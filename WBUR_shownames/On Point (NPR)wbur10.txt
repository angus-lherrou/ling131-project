From WVU are Boston and NPR I'm making the chalk river already as this is on point from the devil's triangle to the Ralph club we've been hearing a lot about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's alleged drinking habits in high school and college
Well what about today's college students they've grown up in a world where sexual assault education is part of the curriculum on many college campuses end where social media can provide any more told trail of deeds and misdeeds
But has any of that changed how college students party now this hour on point today's college drinking culture you can join us on air or on line what was the drinking thing when you were in school and if you're in college now what does partying look like is drinking to blackout unusual
Or the norm and do the cabinet hearings have you worried that what you do now may come back to haunt you later where one eight hundred and forty three to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk you can also join us anytime it on the radio dot org or on Twitter and Facebook and on point radio
We've gotta we've gotta Triplett here a trio I should say of terrific guests are joining us this hour and first of all let me introduce to you Madeline DeAngelis she's Twenty one year old senior at Boston College originally from Chevy Chase Maryland
Full disclosure she's also are on point interns meddling welcome to the program I think that's also with us today is Brianna pick her she is twenty two and graduated in may from Florida State University She's currently a first year law student at the George Washington law school and she's with us from Washington Brenda welcome to you
High there magna and from Tempe, Arizona jak McCarthy is with us he is a Twenty one year old senior at Arizona State university originally from Madison, Wisconsin and jak because he also runs ASU bar stool sports website jak welcome to you hire OK so first of all let me just get a quick
Sort of picture here if I were to ask you you know describe what the drinking scene is like on campus where you are how would you answer that metal and let's start with you sue
... is a school without a Greek life so that does end up shaping a lot of what our drinking she looks like but people were mostly gravitate towards heart alcohol um especially I found during our freshman sophomore years when our call might be a little bit harder to get hold up because you're not legally able to buy it
And there is a very strong blackout culture where people are generally drinking to the blackout ... that's the whole point well it's not entirely the whole point although
I wouldn't say the goal or at a point but it is not stigmatized it's a part of our language you're it's very common to have someone said oh I Can't even remember what happened last night I blacked out and it did some point it is
Almost a goal depending on who your friends are the kind of social senior running in within the school maybe because of the stresses of the week but it is a release you're trying to reach that point of innovation where
You can't even really remember what happens next day and as you said it's it's not stigmatized and that was not in the past
Jak McCarthy what's the scene like at ASU

This is on point I'm making a truck a body we're talking about the drinking culture on American college campuses today I'm joined by meddling DeAngelis she's a Twenty one year old senior at Boston College Brianna Picard also joined us She's twenty two she graduated from Florida State in may and is now a first year law student at the George Washington University School of law
And jak McCarthy is with us he's in Tempe, Arizona he's Twenty one ... year old senior at Arizona State university and we're one eight hundred forty three eight to five five that eight hundred for two three talk we want to know what you think about college drinking culture
Now a and again as we talked about before
Before the break we're we're we're discussing this given in in the light of the hearings regarding judge Brett Kavanaugh and I'm Wondering if your college now is this suddenly making you think
Again about ah what you drink how much you drink or the party and culture on your campus and whether or not
We're living in a world now where five ten Fifteen Twenty years from now can all come back to haunt you were at
Eight hundred forty three eighty five five as I said and we got a lot of comments coming in on social media and on our website uh for example a Don Kathleen is saying on Facebook she says I live in a college town and my residence is surrounded by college housing
Thursday through early hours of Sunday is a display of drunk and debauchery it's typical to see dozens upon dozens of weaving drunk students can racks of course the next party
A until the culture of privilege binge drinking and how that plays out in colleges addressed this shows no evidence of slowing down All right I Want to bring in one more guest into this conversation Wesley Perkins joins us now he's with us from Geneva New York
He's a professor of sociology at Hobart and William Smith colleges and he's been conducting research on high risk alcohol consumption in college students
For three decades and he's also author of the social norms approach to preventing school and college a substance abuse Wesley Perkins welcome to you
Thank you very much good to be here well first of all just reflect with us on what you heard uh in in the previous segment and just the story is I'm from Jack in Brianna and Madeleine about campus drinking culture now a ... or we had a place that's different at all from where we were Thirty years ago
Well I think uh what what I was hearing from them is not something I'm calling you will hear students or or even graduate says they reflect back I have to say
Um we're in many ways though not at a very different place than we were even going back Thirty years ago if I might say a quickly with a couple of points of what the reality is on campuses based on
A scores and scores of studies the overarching in irrefutable
Findings of a massive amount of research now is that first of all high risk or heavy drinking sometimes called binge drinking it is significant and sometimes quite tribes and it's quite tragic consequences are [noise] are prevalent and they're out their highest levels in college students of age Eighteen to twenty four years old
And those are compared to any other age population and compared to non college young adults are the same age
Is this is the heart of of the problem is when we talked about alcohol abuse and high risk
Those levels have declined slightly in the last decade with more innovative interventions but the big picture of high risk in college still remains having said that
Even given the relative high rates of problem drinking in college it is not now nor has ever been in previous decades the norm amongst college students
The best measures of a two ... of of of high risk drinking or about twenty five to thirty percent engaging an occasional occasionally and high risk drinking with some frequency about twenty percent
Might be described as frequent heavy binge drinkers
And it's important to know that to put it in perspective one quarter of students consume two thirds to three quarters of all the alcohol that's consumed on a campus and this is true across all all different kinds of campuses we've researched one quarter of students
Are consuming two thirds to three quarters of the alcohol that's consume so the high risk drinking is relatively concentrated it's not the norm but it's a serious problem looking at some significant ...
Yeah so so it was a person is just one quick point of clarification um maybe you said it but I didn't catch it when you say high risk drinking how are we defining that
Well uh sometimes today with the word of binge drinking issues and typically what is used most commonly measures are measures such as using
Five or more drinks at a setting or more of five for men or for for women to adjust for gender differences [noise] more recent decades that we've had better measures that focus on you use to talking about drinking five or four more in a two hour period because
I mean eight hours or it might mean a very short period of time but the most important thing is uh whether they're consuming enough to get their blood alcohol level up
To a high risk levels such as a point away which was the I'm a legal limit in terms of driving when a one gets above appointed away one gets into the serious risk areas
And that's a so if we were talking about drinking a far more in a two hour period without intention of some of the students were describing to alter their consciousness quickly that's the kind of high risk drinking that we're most concerned about because that's what is most likely to produce the consequences
Okay now Madeline you have both the advantages and disadvantages sitting right across from me here at the on point table and I can see your face you you have kind of questioning look on your face what are you thinking yes what I think
Is interesting about what the difference may potentially be if we're going to talk about the difference between drinking over the past decades is that
There does seem to be at least a PC gravitation towards hard alcohol which when I'm stuck into my parents are people from previous generations seems to be different it seemed people seemed shock that there are just handles of ... or whatever it's easy to get a hold of
Easily available sit like basically right off of that your freshman year and
I don't know if maybe Brianna or jak find that to be similar experience their school but I Do think that's an interesting trend re enter you want to jump in here
[noise] um I think there's probably a fifty fifty shot at whether you're going to be drinking hard alcohol or beer on depending on the situation and what your you know drinking for 'em ... before football games tended to be more beer
Gear heady whereas party hosted a fraternity and eat for ... you know whatever and then tended to be more um hard liquor centric do I think that's definitely a a notable point okay and Jack
On I Would definitely agree with ... like if you're going to a tailgate or something it's definitely going to be beer heavy but
I think definitely for house parties and certain things like that are hard liquor is kind of like where people are kind of having because they don't want to carry your carrying around a thirty case of beer while you're at a house party is a lot more inconvenient and just carrying around a bottle and sharing it with your friends okay wildly Perkins
I mean you've been studying this for several decades do you see that same trend
Right well I think it is true that are depending on what the particular context you might see more beer being consumed or [noise] or more hard liquor [noise]
But the the fact of the matter is that uh we could go back decades and find a a punch in grain alcohol being poured for big parties that were quite common in certain circumstances back in the Nineteen seventies eighties and so forth [noise]
Um and uh still nationwide beers a drink of choice although a in some sectors and some schools
Are some hard liquor may have in the increase popularity but it's when we use the word trends of uh we're just not seeing major trends without regard [noise]
Um and the bottom line still is how many drinks you're consuming how quickly and if you haven't been eating at all or you know they can enter your bloodstream pretty quickly no matter what type of alcohol you're consuming certainly of heart alcohol can can enter your bloodstream very quickly if you're doing
Ten shots in a row and that sort of thing but if you are trying to drink as many beers as you can in a row that can be equally um a devastating too so [noise]
Uh I think we have to temper the the notion that oh this hard liquor is it's a new phenomena and and it explains all the problem is that the U.S it's a mixed picture
So just a we have so many college when I joined us callers I promise I'm going to get to you but I Want to ask was the ... one more question here because you know look I I get it there maybe some people listening to this saying why all the shock
I mean you you just made me you sound like you know a a a shock teetotaler who's saying oh my God there's so much drinking on college campuses maybe it's not I mean

This is on point I'm making a trucker Bertie we're talking about college drinking culture today and we're joined by meddling DeAngelis she's a Twenty one year old senior at Boston College Brianna Picard joined us as well she's twenty two she graduated from Florida State in may and now she's a first year law student
At the George Washington University School of law jak McCarthy is with us either Twenty one year old senior at Arizona State and Wesley Perkins is also with us he's a professor of
Smith College is he's been conducting research on high risk alcohol consumption for several decades where at one eight hundred for two three eight to five hundred eight hundred for two three talk you can also reach out to us over Facebook and Twitter at on point radio
Uh and guess what people are doing exactly that I've got a tweet here from a gentleman named Steven Irving and Stephen I Hope you're listening to them about to return to eat
And the tweet is we're in the midst of a nationwide heroin epidemic and you find a shocking to hear some people blackout when drinking to relieve stress what planet are you living on where that is in any way shocking magna
So that's a Steven if you're hearing this now first of all I appreciate your comment never let it be said that on point does not address the criticisms that come to this show in real time but I'm going to respond to you here first of all I don't think it's necessarily fair to conflate the heroin epidemic with a conversation about college alcohol drinking I think
That's not fair to anyone who was suffering are dealing with heroin epidemic nor to this conversation itself
Now insofar as me being shocked that students who are under Twenty one or under drink to blackout in order to relieve stress perhaps I'm a little distressed not shocked about it because I think if that's the primary way
Of relieving stress or or a manner in which people look to to relieve stress
It does concern me a little 'cause there are a lot of other ways to relieve stress so let me just
Let me just talk to Madeline and ... and Jack here I mean respond to what's what Steven saying and Jack I'm going to just start with you
Is it is it a major way drinking to blackout that people use to relieve stress because I'm not sure it's the best idea when you're thinking the only way to relieve stress is to wake up the next morning and not remember what you did the night before
[noise] no I definitely don't think that it was like the major ways to relieve stress I think a misery to relieve stress to go with your friends and have a couple of drinks like brown Hussein you go out on Thursdays it'd be after you have a class with a couple of friends and just have a couple of drinks [noise]
There's there's not what people are going out and be like oh I had a rough day to day I'm cynical blackout tonight and give us some more of like you just it catches up I'm like you go to a party and there's like
There's all called her and you started drinking and drinking and then you walk out but there's a million different ways relieve stress ... is not a common one I Would say
OK so Brianna again Stephen ... says ah why do you find a shocking to you that some people blackout when drinking to relieve stress what do you have to say about that
I totally agree with jak there are a million other ways to relieve stress I mean especially living in D.C which is such a ... century city you go for a run or you you go to the gym if you're stressed and have things to do for a school or work or other things that are laying down on you know
I'm or ultra light jak that and go out with a couple of friends after class in the grab a couple of drinks and then you go home and you do your homework um you're definitely not going out on a Thursday and then you know I had a really rough cold call in criminal law today I'm going to drink to excess and not remember what I Do tonight
Okay good some clarifications because I thought I heard in the beginning part of this show I thought I heard all of you say that sometimes the point is to get to blackout because things are so stressful did I miss hear any of that
[noise] I Know I mean definitely that is sometimes the point but I think like professor ... saying it's definitely not the point the majority of the time
Um at least not now in law school in undergrad when maybe your responsibility weren't as much as they are earning now um
Go out on a Wednesday because it's your birthday or because you know you had a really rough cat and do that but certainly not the majority of the time anymore
OK Madeline I yeah I also think we have to drive different like a distinction here between the language that people are using and what they're actually doing because at least
In my license blackout is kind of used almost ... really like you you you're like oh I'm going to go get blackout tonight but that doesn't necessarily mean you will it just means it's kind of an normalized thing and it's part of the language almost like a slang term so
We're garlic as to what the comment on lines and [noise] I don't like I don't know that
We are all blacking out every weekend that would I Can't imagine that but I Do think it's part of our language out in a way that it might not have done before
[noise] All right let's go to more callers Veronica is calling from New Orleans you're on the air Veronica
Hi thank you for taking my call um I just uh from here I already graduated from college and hearing all and the drinking scene in ... crazy even outside of college we have Bourbon Street and that kind of like dry your party scene of the nation
But I just feel like sometimes people are a little machine to speak truth only about really what goes on and drinking and it almost sounds like it's that choice
To go out when I've seen people blackout it doesn't seem to me like they do that on purpose they just got to a point where they can't control that drinking anymore so I guess my question would be do you think that it's always up to you whether you're going to blackout or not or if it's more that
You get to a certain point where you just can't control and that's when like things with
Are happening and maybe people will say like oh maybe I can remember or maybe they just saying that it's totally not possible it just seems to me like
I don't know it's just like lying basically because you already know that whoever drink so much as he's portrayed too with the cakes and everything like that had to be a blackout and from what you guys
Are they speaking they ... it's like grow upgrading that it's
Like ... you can't control that you're going to get to that point right Hi
Veronica thank you for your call jak McCarthy my turn to you on that or I mean you heard the question what do you say
Um I definitely say for the blackouts especially I think
We're missing the point to that some people do they have like bigger issues that nobody knows about so sometimes they do go out to drink and like kind of forget about their problems and I think that's also like another reason people are blocking out up there because they have issues that you don't exactly know about like I've seen it firsthand with friends and other people out of the bars
They have other issues and the the um mass and soon alcohol because they are trying to cover up those issues ... ... what what's your response to that question
Well I think that if it if you start from they are going to a party are going to have ... or a point of view first of all of that told me is a segment of the population but you observe the people who are the most extreme and you go home and we're talking with your friends and have stories about
Uh the person who passed out on the dance floor or who started a fight or who uh got sick or if you had to clean them up and that sort of thing [noise]
And uh we have millions of who are stories about them it can be funny to reset it can be scary I ... and so forth but we talked about is what most of the talk is about [noise]
And understandably these these are situations of concern in many instances [noise]
But when we talk about them so much and we have thousands of words for being intoxicated but only two or three for not being intoxicated moderation being sober at an abstinence but you can think of thousands of words for being drunk
That reflects the talked and so consequently it tends to normalize in people's perceptions that this blackout culture as we are talking about are describing it is something that is the norm and it's accepted it's not a big deal but in fact
The blackout behavior which can lead to a very serious consequences particularly in terms of
Of a sexual assault or or or or ... serious problems over there but it's it's largely knows a segment of the population but so many people don't speak out about it or against it because they think well it is enormous what most college students to read it it's the same phenomena of
Of ah students saying well most students do this but not me that is a very common pattern and because we just don't talk about the majority who are normal and it's not just from survey research we can demonstrate this we demonstrate this with anonymous B. C. testing on campuses campuses
Around the country who have done this and shown that
There may be twenty percent coming home late night with a intoxicated and the rest are coming home and not having consumed alcohol or had consumed very little so it's it's the biological evidence in Missouri ovens is overwhelming but it's still a serious problem
Well let's go to Marie who's calling from Hartford, Connecticut you're on the Emery
And there are just wanted to comment on the seemingly close relationship to sexual assault on college campuses and the use of alcohol my daughter is in a recent graduate and she confided in me that her circle of girlfriends uh six or seven of them
W. B. U. R. Boston's NPR News station
This is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep we are roughly thirty minutes away
From a vote in the United States Senate to end debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court if he clears that hurdle the final vote would likely be sometime tomorrow senators giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those in just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios and who covers
Congress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows
Therefore key votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe Manchin isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well
And one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not ... not necessarily yes over the weekend I Will say okay
Fine I'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy and it sounds like if there's four key votes this has got to be close they're going to guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most
Ah let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior members senior democratic member on the Senate Judiciary committee and she used to live in her closing argument let's listen to her
[noise]
Up okay we're going to try to get back to the Senate floor in a moment Dianne Feinstein is delivering her speech there oh she's just concluded her remarks as a matter of fact so we're now going to hear in their entirety over the next few minutes
From two more key players here one is Charles Schumer of New York he is the Senate Democratic leader and he is a senator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination but everything that they had
The other senator we'll hear from is the key player in so many historic debates over the last decade and a half really Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader in the United States Senate and someone who has been absolutely central
To the Supreme Court battles of the last few years it was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominee to the court would not even get a vote
It was Mitch McConnell who then steered President Trump's first nominee Neil Gorsuch confirmation it is Mitch McConnell who has repeatedly said during all the drama of the last few weeks that he intended
To guide Brett Kavanaugh through and so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell in the next few minutes Nina Totenberg has where this year and they know what's on your mind
Well you know Mitch McConnell is that what you would call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they're sort of doing that final
Cleanup hit for their side
But don't be fooled by their boring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist he has done amazing things for a matters that he wanted to advance whether it's his agenda on the courts or getting through a budget when lots of his more
Conservative members wanted to just block everything and this is true he negotiated with a vice president Biden during that
The Obama administration and they got budgets they got you know funding for the federal government through when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer
And you know he's not the majority leader so we can't see if he's a brilliant strategist yet but but but he is there
Sterling the Democratic troops to the extent that he can now let's get a sense of the scene as we await their speeches because Brakkton Booker NPR's Brakkton Booker has been outside the United states Capitol today it's an area where there have been many protests over the last several days and Brakkton what's the scene like this morning
We'll see if there are
Some crowds out here not as big as we've seen in previous days but today is still young [noise] ah there is a group of speakers that are standing off to the side of me maybe a a fifty yards away
Or they have had a number of people come up and share their stories a lot of people who have survived a sexual assaults actual trauma and the sharing the story is basically saying
We cannot foot or a Supreme Court you cannot elevates so much of the Supreme Court has been accused of such crime director has not been founded what what they're saying shifts at
One of the central tensions one of the things which really divided the country in the last several days [noise] as well we'll talk about that a little bit more a mom and apparently Charles Schumer has now gone to the Senate floor let's listen to the Senate minority leader
Sorted chapters in the long history of the federal judiciary
The well was poisoning from the outset
When President Trump selected judge Kavanaugh from the list of names pre approved
By hard right special interest groups for whom the national interest as a trifling concern compared to repealing roe v Wade cutting people's health care and achieving a partisan majority on the Supreme Court
... worse than when the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee shielded the bulk of judge Kavanaugh's records from the public discarding decades of bipartisan precedent and warning norms of transparency and fairness
And finally the dam broke
Under the weight of credible allegations that judge Kavanaugh committed a sexual assault
In high school in twenty Eighteen the Republican majority conduct at a hearing that made the Anita Hill hearings and Nineteen Ninety One look fair by comparison
In this hearing there were no corroborating witnesses on either side
No independent investigation of the facts to inform the questioning they even hired an outside counsel to put a witness Dr Ford on trial
Only at the eleventh hour urging a breakaway members of their caucus Republicans submitted reluctantly do a one week investigation of the allegations an investigation which was then severely ...
By the White House our Republican friends blame us for this process there always finding a straw man but nothing could be further from the truth first they blame us for delay knowing full well
That majority leader McConnell has complete control of when nominees are brought to the floor leader McConnell could have moved this nominee two weeks ago where one week ago Democrats had nothing no say and don't when it comes to who comes to the floor
But in each case leader McConnell couldn't move the nominee forward because he was blocked by fellow Republicans not Democrats for moving forward when it comes to complaining about the leg two words
Never come from our Republican friends lips Merrick Garland
Republicans are also saying we engaged in quote a smear campaign where the politics of personal destruction with this nomination in reality again
Using Democrats as a strongman because what they're really talking about is what Dr Ford said
Democrats did not end do sort of come forward or conscience did and our Republican friends are are are Republican friends accusing Dr Ford
And her deeply held memories of what happened to work of a smear campaign are they using Dr Ford of a smear campaign of engaging in the politics of personal destruction because that is who they're actually blaming their decrying her
Testimony and then trying to blame Democrats I don't blame them they have a flawed nominee they don't want to focus on the nominee
When future Americans look back at these proceedings let them draw no lessons from the Senate's conduct here
As a shameful culmination of the scorched earth politics practice by the hard right in America
People who will stop at nothing to entrench in advantage when our nation's courts let the confirmation process for judge Kavanaugh be recorded as a sorry epilogue
To the brazen theft of Justice Scalia's seat the AIG know many years and
A bipartisan cooperation and consultation on the confirmation of Supreme Court justices and for what for
Whom or Senate Republican leaders willing to discard all semblance of fairness to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh
Certainly a product of an elite education but also someone with hard right conservative jurisprudence far far away from what average Americans
When we vote later this morning we will not only be deciding whether the elevator stunningly well qualified to judge show our highest court
Not anymore not after all this United States Senate will also
Be making a say whether the states that partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence or will reaffirmed that in the United states of America every one is innocent
Until proven
Guilty will either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient
And signal that media bullying and mob intimidation are valid tactics for shaping the center the mob can attack
And the Senate case
What will stand up and say that serious thoughtful fact based deliberation will still define this body

Will either give notice it totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough to destroy on Americans live
Or will declare that our society cannot must not will not set the bar so
Low
So modern president today as a pivotal day and the nomination process of this excellent judge but it's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well the ideals of justice that have served our nation so well for so long
For on full display so let's sit back and sample a few of the choice moments that the Senate and the American people had been treated to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle of the last two weeks the very nice
Judge Kavanaugh was announced as the president's choice where are the junior senator from Oregon declare that just nominate would pave the way they're tearing it
His audience crowds of oral out protesters still filling out in the blanks on they're picking sides that weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah

We've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great
Moral struggle in which they are just two camps you're either complicit and evil or you're fighting against it
More
Recently we've heard the junior senator from Hawaii you argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy admit and I'll listen to this he deserves less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct

You disagree with her you're not entitled to the presumption of innocence when it comes to allegations of misconduct that from a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process

Apparently get due process only if you agree with her and even more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence great confidence offering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen eighties
That was incredibly enlightening
Innocent jokes beer drinking references oh no our colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden or sinister meetings
And play until of course a number of judge Kavanaugh classmate set in straight earlier this week
Just stop and consider the snap shots they absurd it the absurdity the indebtedness say this is our approach
The Supreme Court justice this is the Senate's contribution to public discourse
Before the end of dried on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process
Would be about delay obstruct and resist
And before the ACA dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee were racing to announce it made up their minds are um are totally opposes confirmation
... hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated my friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated it was I was a bunch of like clearer that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination
By any means necessary
It was right there from the beginning madam president Clinton declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats are considered is nominated with an open mind
It would be delaying tactics obstruction and so called resistance until the final vote was called for a few weeks
There are efforts played out along the lines that sadly have become somewhat ordinary around here there were excuses for delay those fell flat
There were gross distortion to judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside doctor first and there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice
... awesome what went on hustled vulnerable people hospital workers same old tricks same old playbook but here's the problem
The old players weren't working the distortions were being liberated drowned out
By the facts
Senators were saved and reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination for every previous Supreme Court nomination
Combined
We read judge Kavanaugh says twelve your record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court three hundred plus opinions were sworn testimony written accounts from hundreds of character witnesses Raul stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career
And the picture painted by these facts was nothing like the character nothing like the character so it was clear mind president they owe taxes weren't working
Money going to get the job done the resistance demanded more try something new they said well we all know what
Happened next uncorroborated allegations of the most sensitive most serious or were quickly sharpen into political weapons
One such allegations shared by Dr Ford and confidence with the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee
Somehow mysteriously found its way into the press
Well chairman Grassley admittedly set out on a sober focus search for the truth the community selected testimony organized a new hearing and most recently asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation
Judge Kavanaugh's seventh seventh
FBI investigation
By any first entered the facts the actual facts proved to be straightforward no corroborating evidence none none
Was produced a support any of the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh
No corroborating evidence from the FBI inquiring or from anywhere else nothing well
That wasn't enough for our democratic colleagues of course the facts were not exactly the point after all waste or to get it right now when the very FBI investigation for which they've been clamoring turned up no new evidence
The Democrats moves that goal post yeah again I Believe the
Latest story is that the whole investigation is invalid not listen to this because individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third hand about nearly forty or all allegations
Weren't treated as a central witnesses let me say that again the latest story is that the whole investigation is invalid because
But lately been told secondhand or third I Am about nearly forty year old allegations weren't treated as a central witnesses
Never mind and they didn't actually witnessed anything they didn't want us anytime
So let's be clear madam president these are not witnesses these are people supposedly in possession of here say they'll say first heard thirty five years after the suppose
Mr Murphy
Okay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or
Unclear if he's not there yet most will do it if their names are called in this more normal setting but are these thoughts can drag out again I go back to that ... care where there's lots of last minute drama if you know the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding
Vote absolutely and we do see a number of senators that there's ... very often this voting period as a time when you see senators looking quite college or they'll be standing in knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people you had to close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't it
Absolutely aren't even before all of the controversy over the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice is one of the most formal you know historical things than I Do
NPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader
He has made himself central a team won historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to confirmation it would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell
Yes and to some degree it would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cast that traumatic thumbs down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare a this would be the culmination
For Mitch McConnell of off a lifetime really of campaigning for a change the federal judiciary unless your social listen to a little bit more as they go through the roles are killers [noise]
Mister Kenny Mr Udall Mr Van Hollen Mr Warner
Okay Mark Warner of Virginia is a no vote their Scott Detrow Racine that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal OK so Lisa Murkowski is no um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe Manchin
A at the moment it appears to be I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live the vote is in is it fluid entail its final senators can change their mind so how do you see that's right or you can't have a firm sense now the final vote goes until they banged the gas
And there could also be a senator whom we have assumed as a yes or have assumed as a no who just at the last moment does something different and we're
On a nice that year where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference well we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for clay
Telegraphed really even when he made the compromise of ...
And ... of the Delaware has that Delaware went and checked it to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for ... cabin up but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week they'll lay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy
So Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report
The Senate has only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves
And they have been a and it really is it are they in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote
NPR's Scott Horsley is that the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street
Just even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination
Or that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench it would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of
A President Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the the bench and a conservative direction
For President Trump I think he also sees a a political advantage here he's been talking
A at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this confirmation process is generated
On the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that uh uh Republicans had been suffering a relative to Democrats that according to our polling as is now more or less close Republicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats already were
And you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he or the people who have been have been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude elevator screeners are paid professionals only looking only ... senators look
And but I Want to mention Joe Manchin of West Virginia home we were just talking about has now voted by a Scott Detrow again with an asterisk that it's not over till it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin that's right
Brett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced is key procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination or you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cabinet along with Joe mansion
And Lisa Murkowski voting no Joe Manchin isn't a really tough spot here he is one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state the cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia
He's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of the state but also if he is the key deciding vote and it's a Democrat and he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you are going to see a lot of liberal blowback on mentioned in the final month
Of he's raising a difficult situation but he is a yes at this time on ending debate that test vote in a sense and just to remind people who may be joining us
This vote is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be
A coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring another voice here as we await the final tally but not quite the final tally at this moment on Brett Kavanaugh although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient
Alex comment has been following all of this debate and it's been involved in many of the political battles of recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate Marco
Rubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program
He's Steve could be with him
So what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way
[noise] [noise] well it's like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell
And you know continue to give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into the terms the midterms are barely a month away that's the big ... big deliverable for our base that frankly you know I think it was looking for something to get him to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm
There'd been do jazz and gap has a lot of the service has shown as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week really narrowed in part because of of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh to have it when I think it's just really going to be encouraging to Republicans
Having been through a political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence in that a parent gain and enthusiasm right now we're in a month out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized
Absolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out your voters as ... and that was a challenge for us going into the midterms oh it's why the out of power party normally does very well in midterms because when you're when you're out of power when you're in the resistance your voters and be more amped up and the people
That are kind of fat and happy but now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and we've seen in the way that the Democrats for Republicans perspective have basically engaged in in character assassination Republicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking conservativism Republicans
As a whole and Republicans are United and fired up in a way that we just have not been in the Trump era and I think to win to exceed is just the nail on the coffin in terms of locking down for ... and it is yet
Them Alex Conan's I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominee through because it was probably almost certainly be after the election [noise]
I'd like to know if you feel that the Republican strategy actually was something different that Republicans were determined to have this vote come to a conclusion before the election because of what you said they wanted a deliverable as you termed it for Republican voters they had to have an accomplishment to run on
Well I think the process is the process and in a while I understand that Democrats would like to draw this out forever because they don't want to fill the seat with the Trump appointee from a Republican perspective we wanted
We want to have a a another twenty on the bench last week so that they could be there for the start of the the new Supreme Court session
So I think part of it is driven by the Supreme Court counter part of it is driven by the fact that we don't want to have a nominee just hanging out there indefinitely while the character assassination continues
And then yes I Do think part of it is the the political factor
Which is there's an opening on the Supreme Court if we can put another Trump appointee another solid

Is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where a dramatic vote has just taken place in the U.S Senate in the nomination to the Supreme Court of President Trump's choice Brett Kavanaugh it was an extremely close vote and the west Virginia
Is there today Republicans ah ah choose choose the presiding officer and was Shelley Moore capital of West Virginia let's give a listen
On this vote the yeas are fifty one the nose are forty nine the motion is agreed
To fifty one to forty nine as the gavel goes down almost as close as it could be if it had been a fifty fifty tie we presume that vice president Mike Pence would have come in
And broken that time fifty one to forty nine almost entirely along partisan lines the one Democrat who voted for Kavanaugh is Joe Manchin of West Virginia the one Republican who voted against Kavanaugh is Lisa Murkowski of Alaska
And we should emphasize before we begin our discussion here this is what's called a cloture vote this is not the final vote this was a vote to end the debate to kind of test
But not an absolute test because senators could choose to vote differently if they feel moved to do so when the final vote comes tomorrow
NPR's Nina Totenberg has covered the United States Supreme court about as long as well
As anyone and she is in our studios here along with NPR's Ron Elving who's covered politics for very long time as well good morning to get both in mourning mourning thanks for joining us throughout the morning here and uh Nina I Want to start with you let's just back away from the drama of the last couple
Of weeks and talk about the historic consequences of this choice presuming that Kavanaugh gets through as he got through the vote today how is the U.S Supreme Court to different court that would've been a with a different nominee or than it was before he came
When I was going to be a much more conservative court regardless whoever Donald Trump picked from his famous list it was going to be someone way more conservative than Anthony Kennedy the man that is being replaced
And that will kill to court that was sort of like a balanced bored sometimes mainly going in the conservative direction but about a quarter of the time and some of those very big cases going the other way
To the liberal side now in almost every case that is a closely contested one where the vote is five to four I think you can expect the conservatives to win and
They may move on an agenda to increase executive power to decrease actually congressional power in some ways to
And to um to take on
Legal questions that have only been sort of on the wish list of hardcore conservatives for fifty to a hundred years
Now it's interesting you use the word agenda I think that if some conservatives ah we're listening to you they might object to the word agenda and argue that conservative judges or just applying the law as they see it but it is an agenda in the sense that it's a very different way of viewing and reading the law correct this would
Be even his term which is so far pretty doggy term frankly we're not very compelling big hot sexy cases even this time so far with a half the docket agreed to and the rest yet to come
There are three cases asking for reversal of very longstanding precedence so you could see a lot of the law changed quite dramatically and some of it would not make headlines you would only
See it when you went to do something and found you could no longer do that whether you're on the right or the left you could be blocked where you could be suddenly find as people are now finding for example that the court in recent years has on the question if arbitration
Said to people you can't bring a class action challenging a clause in ... and when you were hired that says any dispute over salary or anything else has to go to arbitration you can't bring a class action suit in court challenge that Annette ...
Ship that example because it reminds us that while Kavanaugh's nomination has been viewed through the lens of roe versus Wade of abortion rights there is an almost infinite variety of cases
In which presuming he is confirmed on the final vote tomorrow he would have an opportunity to rule and they would include abortion rights and a lot of things short of overturning roe versus Wade and they would include labor rights and
And and many other things let's also remember that there was a relatively true statement made by Charles Schumer the Democrat from New York when he gave a speech shortly before the vote
And he said Democrats have been accused of delaying the nomination Democrats have not he said and what he means is Republicans have had the majority Republicans reset the Supreme Court rules so that a so that a minority cannot block
Action and so if there's been any delay it's been been because of division and the Republican ranks there'd been a number of Republicans who have been uncertain votes one of them Lisa Murkowski who ultimately voted no on this test vote here this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska
Another one being Susan Collins of Maine who issued in a sense a partial decision and let's listen to the words that you spoke to reporters a little bit earlier today we're not going to hear Susan Collins
To a scrum of reporters a group of reporters out on the floor is that I'm voting yes voting yes on cloture however uh I Am not going to announce until a little bit later on today what I'm going to do later what I'm going to do in that second vote which is the way it works right Ron Elving
It is but it let's let's be Frank it's it's pretty rare for people to vote for cloture and then turn around and vote and why ... why would she do that
Well that the justification that people put forward is they say I Believe in fairness to both sides we should have some more floor debate and we should hear all the arguments as though we haven't
And at the end of that we should be fair enough to this candidate to give him a final vote on the floor now I plan to vote no but I think he should have that final vote on the floor
She has not said that let's be you know she did not say that
And and I think there'd be an awful lot of folks who'd be very surprised if tomorrow she votes no but she has that option she may I don't think she's actually well who knows whether or not she's enjoying the amount of pressure that she's on her and she does not seem to be having a good time but there was a
Time when the rules were different when that sort of thing what happened you'd get sixty votes for cloture then maybe only fifty two votes to pass
In there you had a principal and the principal was I don't believe we should block this person from getting a final vote and win the majority clearly favors this person I don't favor the person but I also don't favor cutting off their chance to have a final vote with a filibuster
Okay so we've talked about Republicans who have been doubtful Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was a no vote at least on cloture Susan Collins of Maine who was a yes vote on cloture but it's held out at least for a number of hours today her decision on the final vote
And then there is a Republican who was never expressed any doubt about that nomination and let's listen to a little bit of today's speech on the Senate floor from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell
Every effort was made to ensure that the fact free verdict of the mob and the media would win out over the actual
Evidence made sure the mob prevail
But they are uncorroborated mud and the partisan noise and the physical intimidation of members here in the Senate will not have the final say
Around here the Senate will have the final
The Senate is not quite had the final say but they got to step closer today with this fifty one to forty nine vote
That we have been covering and that we will continue covering here and special coverage from NPR News let's bring another voice into the conversation now ... is executive director of the Georgetown Institute of politics and public service a veteran democratic strategist did I pronounce your name correctly ...
You got an excellent I'm very excited thank you very much so what are you thinking about as you learn this news of the fifty one forty nine vote to advance Kevin
[noise] well you know it's all going to come down I think the person to watch as you guys have been talking about that she was actually two people I'm kinda curious to watch over the next twenty four hours a and they are the
Uh Susan Collins a while we'll see what she has to say at three o'clock ... but uh you know she might be actually trying to
Uh go back to sort of regular order in the Senate and saying you know deserves about I'm going to vote no but he deserves about that could be possible I think that's likely but possible and the other person is Joe mansion who
Uh I think Democrats are probably split and whether or not they're surprised a an his vote today a to his vote for cloture um but he also could come out against so we'll see I think right now
Uh if if I were a betting man I Would probably bad for narrow confirmation tomorrow but what those two senators do over the next twenty four hours is going to tell us everything we need to
I Want to note there are so many layers to this story there is the question of Senate votes there is the broad question of policies that could change laws that could be interpreted or reinterpreted as Nina Totenberg has been discussing and then there's the reality of politics we are deep into an election campaign where it is seen as possible that one
Or plausibly although it's a long shot in both
Houses of Congress could flip and we have mentioned in our live coverage here
[noise]


This is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where we have been listening in the last little while to a historic vote on the floor of the United States Senate
The vote was fifty one forty nine the fifty one goes in favor of Brett Kavanaugh President Trump's nominee to serve on the Supreme Court he's not quite there yet this was a vote to end the debate and then the final vote
Comes tomorrow we would anticipate a final vote that may go exactly the same way fifty one to forty nine but senators are by no means obligated to vote the same way and sometimes they do
Vote differently on final passage than they would on ending to big as a matter of fact one senator
Susan Collins of Maine has specifically said that she voted yes this morning to advance the nomination but that you would give a different statement sometime later today perhaps around three o'clock as to what her actual votes would be on the floor
Free of doubt but it appears that Brett Kavanaugh is on his way a vote that Senator Mitch McConnell the majority leader on the Republican side said was one of the most consequential votes but the Senate has ever had that's the way that he framed this vote Charles Schumer the Democrat of New York said that this was a vote
For a justice who has a record of hard right conservative jurisprudence who was a doubtful nominee even before there were allegations of sexual assault
And then Schumer considered those to be credible allegations of sexual assault which caused the damn to break in Schumer's word
In terms of doubts about this nominee doubts that were reinforced by his
Harsh and partisan testimony of some of those same charges Senator Mitch McConnell said they were largely nonsense and there was no corroborating evidence of the claims by Christine Blasey Ford who described a sexual assault said she was sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh as a friend looked on and perhaps participated
While they were all in high school in the Nineteen eighties so fifty one to forty nine is devoted let's discuss some of the meanings of this NPR's Dominican months' NARAL can start us off here in this segment of the of the special coverage He's NPR's political editor is is anything a surprise to your ear to medical
Well I think Lisa Murkowski coming out and voting no uh certainly shows you know the kinds of independence she shown over the years this is somebody who won
An election state wide as a write in candidate and you know the the odds of doing that anywhere or nearly impossible now allow much Alaska and well I mean Alaska is a little bit easier obviously because it's she's very well known names and yeah and not as many people as a you know some of the other states
So she was able to pull that off my point about that is that she doesn't old Republican leadership anything so when a lot of people were looking around thinking who would be the profiling courage she's somebody who a lot of people thought could be that person more so than Susan Collins or Joe mansion
Ah because of the politics of
Either their caucus a with a Collins or of their state with
Joe ... and when we say profile in courage were just defining that from the Democratic prospect somebody representing the state well last time that I'm not a fix would suggest that not as a Democrat ... pro democratic thing I mean that as somebody who had ... going on in their voting rights go against their base so when
You think about um what we what we have left though given that Murkowski voted no on cloture it's almost certain that she's going to be a no on the floor leader when it comes to the actual final vote that leaves us with the pressure really built on Jeff Flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine
And Joe Manchin of West Virginia these three two of those three would have to vote with the Democrats in order to block mentioned
Thanks for reminding us one could peel away and it wouldn't be an out I'd still be fifty votes it'd be a fifty fifty time Mike Pence the vice president would break the tie there were many people who had something to say around the United states Capitol over the last few days and they include not just senators on the floor
But protesters outside the capital occasionally inside the Capitol there were protesters who confronted Jeff Flake and an elevator famously a little more than a week ago there were protesters who confronted Orrin Hatch of Utah
In an elevator just yesterday I must listen to some more of the sounds of continuing protests around the United states capital as Kavanaugh's nomination went forward
[noise]
Explicit statement there about the election to come and Nina Totenberg as we listen to those protests I'm reminded of one of the excruciating
Conflicts here or you have women especially insisting on the rights of women insisting on the reality of the continuous abuse of women in countless cases and we've heard countless stories so we have the broad issue
And then the specific question of whether a specific individual can be held to a certain standard of proof of having been guilty of that of that kind of act
Right and we're not in a trial although I'm sure that judge Kavanaugh feels that it's a trial for his good name but this isn't that a trial for somebody's liberty this is a confirmation hearing
For somebody deep promoted to the highest court in the land and there there is a difference and and there was a moment today of
The bitter pill I think for the Democrats and what it says about our politics in a way in which when um
Said when it comes to delay two words never pass
Mitch McConnell's lips Merrick
Garland and of course right after Justice Scalia died
Merrick Garland right away said we are not going to hold even hearing any Mitch McConnell says Mitch McConnell said we're not even going to hold a hearing for anybody to President Obama nominates with the just about a year left in his presidency
And he McConnell lean on people whenever they got sort of a ... on that subject in his own caucus and made that happened and never bat an eye led and
And and Obama had thought he was doing a
I'm a a reasonable and generous thing to try to get somebody confirmed that is pick that he picked a moderate he picked a moderate liberal
Or a ... and the person he picked the person that Republicans have been saying for years is the person he should pick Merrick Garland no longer really young in his mid sixties
Who had a real reputation of of moderation on the court is the chief judge of the DC circuit everybody loved him democratic and Republican appointees and that nomination was the O. J.
... whole month and that that you feel the reverberations of that still even though it was only one reference to Merrick Garland today
Are Ron Elving NPR's Ron Elving is listening into this and as I listen to Nina I'm thinking of an analogy of sorts run a because we also are on NPR News frequently cover the middle east and
Every debate about the middle east tends to turn on history and it depends on what you want to pick up your starting point if you say that one side that something terrible day the answer will come back well guess what happened in Nineteen sixty seven guess what happened in Nineteen but when you're
On answers that I've just had which is that there were people in the Democratic party who said listen President Obama you shouldn't take a moderate you should pick somebody we can really go to war over
And he didn't do that and the ... and and and so now the the question is is is the lesson here you have to go to war every time
Which is what Republicans certainly have done but what I'm getting at Ron Elving is it depends on where you start the history to get started and I do sixty Seventy started Nineteen forty eight it seems like Supreme Court nominations are going the same way now depends on what what are beginning point you want to want the set for when the story started to go wrong
Yes there are some similarities here and for Republicans the years Nineteen eighty seven that was when Robert Bork was appointed by Ronald Reagan to the Supreme Court and up as Nina has observed before Robert Bork probably had the votes going into the confirmation hearings to be confirmed
And the Democrats did have a small majority in the Senate at the time they had just one of the year before they had one it's largely by winning back a lot of southern seats they had lost in Nineteen eighty and the first Ronald Reagan landslide and that was significant because they were winning in the south
With black voters they were winning with African American votes and Teddy Kennedy made the case and other senators made the case
That those southern Democrats really owed those black voters a long hard look at whoever was next going on the Supreme Court all along comes Robert Bork who was willing to quite freely admit he had highly conservative views remarkably eye opening eye popping views on some of the oldest Supreme Court precedents
And the Democrats were appalled in the hearings he was somewhat combative himself in the hearings not to not like Brett Kavanaugh was last Thursday but he was certainly pushing back on all of the assertions that were made about him

This is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where the United states senators voted fifty one to forty nine to advance the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court a final vote is expected to tomorrow
There was a handful of votes that we were closely watching about four senators
Whose votes run certain heading into the action this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska
Republican voted no the only Republican devote no against Kavanaugh or at least have to vote no against uh on on uh on on the debate
Jeff Flake of Arizona voted yes Susan Collins of Maine voted yes Joe Manchin of West Virginia the only Democrat to vote yes ah put his vote down things could change in particular we know that there's at least a possibility that Susan Collins could change your vote when the final vote comes tomorrow because she said
She was voting yes but you give a final answer on the final vote a little bit later on today NPR's to medical much narrower still with us and has been covering Susan Collins of what what evidence do we have to go on as to the way she's leading will
Look like you lay out here everyone's watching this court had you know the final four voters and there is a possibility that people vote differently for cloture at than the way they do on the Senate and the final vote now one piece of evidence for why that's a possibility for Susan Collins
Is she's already done it this Congress she did it on the nomination of that the device for education secretary in fact she wasn't out
And help the help committee health education labor and uh
Uh the ... pensions there's your help them and yeah um well done she voted she voted her out of committee but said that she still had concerns about how ... how much you would be strong on public education
At the end of the day she and Murkowski in tandem wound up voting against
A Collins and for or against um the boss and wound up forcing a Mike Pence to come and break the tie which was the first time I had been broken in a decade since March two thousand eight when Dick Cheney has it come down and break the tie on a package of
Tax just a reminder the devoted to it was a vote for continuing the process the vote tomorrow is the vote on the substance and your mood choose to vote differently on the substance than you do on the process let's bring another voice into this conversation as we continue our special coverage from NPR News Christian ... executive vice president for policy of the leadership
Conference and she was once an advisor to Democrat Patrick Leahy was one of the senior Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee which of course considered Kavanaugh's nomination ...
Come on and so what are you thinking about this vote
Well I'm thinking it's interesting that and notable that there's
Bipartisan opposition to even proceeding or ending the debate on Brett Kavanaugh I think that is very revealing about how widespread the concerns are about his conduct
And I know one of your earlier guest said that there was not a hint of misconduct but that's just simply not true the American public saw serious allegations of misconduct brought forth when Dr Christine Blasey Ford testify in front of the committee and that was watched by so many American household
Fifty yards and it's not correct to say there was no evidence because there's the evidence of someone sworn testimony and considerable detail but let me push back on something that you just said there you said there was bipartisan opposition to continuing debate
There was one Republican one Republican out of fifty one who voted no
This has been a very very partisan vote into those equally part is among the Democratic side is not
Well I don't think I think it is bipartisan by by the nature of having Lisa Murkowski vote no on cloture and voting against voting on against cloture voting to end debate is a very a serious thing for a Republican senator to do
A usually people uh want to at least allow the vote receipt or the nomination to proceed so for her to say no today as opposed to just saying no tomorrow when it was the confirmation vote it sends a really strong signal
About how troubled she is by this by this nominees fitness to serve on our highest court
So I Do think it's remarkable I think that is very unusual and I do think later this afternoon we'll hear more from Susan Collins about how she will ultimately vote on the confirmation vote but I think this nomination is in trouble and so today's
Procedural vote is just the preview for uh the the consequential vote which is a confirmation vote currently scheduled for tomorrow
You don't presume that this was settled I don't need a Totenberg
So you know there's been a lot of criticism of the way the Democrats and in particular a ranking member Feinstein handled the Christine Blasey Ford letter in early
July I'm an ... you you were a
Senior staff member for Senator Leahy when he was either the chairman or the ranking member I don't remember which ah Christine shifts
Both so at ... and and Dianne Feinstein said well I was just protecting her confidentiality but is there a third way this could have gone it it was there a better way for the Democrats to have handled it really is typically now
So I think it is it's in retrospect I'm sure people have different views but what how I think Senator Feinstein as ranking member handled this as she handled it as a you know the woman who came forward wanted her confidentiality protected did not want to become public
And I think Senator Feinstein honored her wishes and I think that's admirable but other people think it is less admirable but uh you know I think in retrospect I'm sure people have many different views but I think Senator Feinstein showed that she really understands what the whole me too movement is about
Which is when you are a survivor of sexual assault it should be up to you to decide when to tell your story if ever you decide to tell your story
... ... you think about that was it impossible for her to tip off your yard to mention it to someone so there could be very quietly looked into
Well I think there is an interesting story that hasn't gotten much attention where Senator Whitehouse referred a you know a tip someone had come forward from Rhode Island
Ah to the chairman staff and the chairman staff released the person's name um so I think that's just an example of this fear that there wasn't the kind of trust that you could
And still preserved confidentiality or share it even with the FBI instill preserve confidentiality so I view it as that or if I'm really was respecting the survivor here and I think that's actually something to be praised not criticized
Then I suppose we should mention in the end confidentiality wasn't held the memo was leads to a publication called the intercept Feinstein or staff have been accused of doing that I Believe she denied it there are other people that could have been there was another lawmaker at least one of the lawmaker who uh had possession of the letter we don't know who
Else might have been told and in what way but in the end it leaked do you believe it automatically had to leak
Was there an option where nobody ever found out about this allegation which had been uncorroborated than that I had an individual or didn't want to go on the record
[noise] well I I don't know who leaked it but I think that
What this experience has shown and many centers have been confronted with us over the past week is there are thousands and thousands if not millions of women who have stories of sexual assault who will never tell anyone
Or who will said he confessed to a senator they're interrupting in in an elevator I think what this last couple of weeks has shown America is how many women
Have experienced sexual assault and there are thousands of reasons why they don't report it don't tell anyone and part of the big reason is they don't think people will believe them they don't think that it will do any good and I'm I'm really worried that
Christine Blasey Ford's treatment and President Trump mocking her to laughter and a campaign rally sense exactly the wrong message to those survivors everywhere
That they won't be listened to they won't be taken seriously and there'll be mocked
You know let me ask about one thing along those lines from our colleague David Greene spoke earlier today with Julie ... she's a journalist for the Atlantic who wrote a long article of touching on some of the issues that you just mentioned and she described herself as a victim of past sexual assault when she was in her teens
But said there was a difference between the broad issue of needing to listen to women needing to take seriously and investigate these kinds of allegations a difference between that broad issue and the specific question of whether a specific individual can be proved guilty through some neutral process here
Has there been some confusion of one with the other on this issue people who are concerned about the broader issue have assumed that Kavanaugh must be guilty because they're concerned about the issue or the reverse for that matter
Well first they would say this is not about his guilt or not kill this is a job interview and Republicans prevented any corroborating or supporting witnesses from being hurt by the committee and then Republicans prevented the FBI
From reaching out to people who would support Christine Blasey Ford's account or Debbie Ramirez is account so I find it really troubling that

Okay if you went looking to trace the arc of this me to moment we're living through you'd be hard pressed to come up with better bookends than the following today the U.S Senate voting to cut off debate on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court and move to a final vote despite allegations of sexual assault and has passed
And one year ago today with a New York times broke a bombshell story
The times headline on October fifth twenty Seventeen read Harvey Weinstein paid off sexual harassment accusers for decades or one of the two reporters who broke that Weinstein story was Jodi Kantor and she joins me now hey there
Hi how are you I'm well thank you I started here you just pointed out today a picture of what you were up to a year ago today and it's it's a bunch of you all crowded around to the computer in the New York Times' newsroom about to hit send on the Weinstein story and you write none of us knew what was going to happen one recent that out into the world we
Didn't my partner Megan too and I we certainly felt the power of the story as we were reporting it and because the times was doing bigger investigations sexual harassment we knew that this was part of the system and it wasn't just about Harvey Weinstein we were reporting on Bill O'Reilly and we were reporting on Fort factory workers
But you never know what's going to happen to investigation wet it's when it's published and you know one of our editors I'm Matt party
Like to say as we were working on it he said hurting wine skiing is not that famous and that is true aside from New York and LA and ... really was not a household name 'em
And and what we've seen happen is that not only did the me too movement which was founded years ago by trying to park
Takeoff globally but it just kept going and
And there were so many times in the past year when I saw productions that this was going to burn out or you know the women were all then it ... or the news was finally going to stop and it never did and what's happening with judge happened I think is representative of that there's a feeling that this reckoning only continues and grows bigger let me ask you this
If Kavanaugh is confirmed a with a full Senate vote this weekend [noise] do you see that as a setback to the momentum of me too
I think if he's confirmed there will be massive debate about what this means for the me too movement and I think there are two contradictory answers both of which probably have some validity I'll give you the ... the obvious one is that people will say this is a set back he was confirmed anyway
Uh these really serious allegations of sexual assault didn't matter um
Women were ... you know ignored yet again this is a replay of ... to hell the other argument however is that
What especially what Dr Christine Blasey Ford did was really important uh that she spoke up in front of the entire country
She put high school on the table right she made a case that these things that that happened in our collective you do have a bearing on the presidents and we also some moments like with um the two protesters and the alligator with Jeff Flake where they were able to literally stop a national conversation for a second and say listen to these stories
One footnote to this conversation before I let you go Jody ... we just heard there from our reporter psoriasis or hurting awesome but today also marks the order of the Nobel Peace prize prize that is often Xena sending a political message
Um any word went to people working to stop sexual violence as a weapon of war I Wonder if that's one more book and if you like to the global scope of this me to moment that you hope set in motion
A year ago I woke up to the same news and had the same side I think it's a reminder scale I think it's a reminder of a global reach that
And also media reminder perspective at a moment when we're all so immersed in the cabin on the news media this as a reminder that this topic is it's even bigger than that in a way
[noise] Jodi Kantor she broke the Harvey Weinstein story for the New York times one year ago today ... thank you thank you so much [noise]

From WVU are often and NPR I met her body and this is on point there's an obesity epidemic going on in America
But that word epidemic that word implies that there's a cure a medically based treatment plant a pill shot something that can stop the epidemic truth is there's very little that doctors public health officials are the multibillion dollar dieting industry have done so far that slowed the rising obesity rate
Which is why one reporter suggest it's time to rethink what we know and presumed about obesity it's causes its consequences and its correlation with wellness and if so what would that mean when American culture is as weight obsessed as fat shaming as ever
This hour on point rethinking obesity and you can join the conversation have you struggled
With your weight do you get the help you need in the doctor's office or do you feel ashamed about your body shape your size even there what is stopping us from getting a handle on the obesity epidemic where at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's one eight hundred and forty three talk you
Can also join us anytime it on the radio dot org or Twitter and Facebook
And on point radio well joining me now from Seattle is Michael hubs is reporter at the Huffington Post and author of a new article titled everything you know about obesity is wrong we've got a link to it at on point radio dot org Michael hubs welcome to the program thanks for having me it's great to have you
First of all I Wonder if we can actually start off with your personal story that you tell in in your piece about uh about weight in your own life in amongst your family members and why you really wanted to write about obesity now
I mean I Know journals are really supposed to say that but I've had a chip on my shoulder about this issue for my entire life because
Growing up my mother struggled with her weight her entire life and my entire life and what I saw was in public the way that people treated her was you know people in restaurants or people on public transit her friends would make comments about her family members of ours make comments about her
And the message was always that she needed to be trying harder she was unhealthy and then I Would see in private the way that she actually lived she was swimming five times a week she was biking everywhere she would make us meatloaf the whole family and then she'd sit there and she eat a bowl of carrots next door she was always on a diet she was always trying
And even to a five year old that just seemed unfair to me that everyone is telling the person that she's unhealthy
That she needs to change but she's basically already doing everything that the world is telling her to do and no matter what you doing there always telling her to try harder and once you look into the data on this it's very similar across the country that all of the things that we know about obesity are much more complex
When you actually live them then they see when you read news articles
... well let me just ask one more question about your mom or I mean you just talked about all the things that she was doing to be a healthy person uh but the response the reactions that she was getting from the world around her I mean how did how did those reactions affect her
[noise] I mean it made her you know she talked to me ah for this article the first time we ever talked about her weight in detail was for this article once I had you looked at all the research and things and she said that
That it seemed like a scam and years later his daughter struggles to make sense of what happened

This is on point I'm making a trucker Bertie we're talking this hour about maybe rethinking how we approach issues of being overweight and obesity in America
And we're joined today by Michael hubs he's a staff writer Huffington Post and he's author of an article titled everything you know about obesity is wrong or there's a link to it at our website on point radio dot org
Doctor if a team of ... Stanford joins us as well she's an obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General hospital weight center and she's with us
In our own point studio here in Boston now Michael before the break you were sort of go you gave us the top three bullet points of the
Aspects of obesity that you felt that we kind of collectively misunderstand so let's dig into some of those a little bit more talk to me about the one where you you you said wait and health are not perfect synonym but we oftentimes feel as if they are with people who are struggling with their weight what are you in
A well first of all I Want to say Hi to team up because I actually visited her clinic as part of writing this article about a year ago I was like oh this is high I I was like we hung out together yeah I Know it was really fun ask 'em
And I think I mean as you know there's there's a lot of debate in the medical community about what exactly metabolic Lee healthy obesity means right and then some studies find that there's a small percentage
Of fat people with medical ugly healthy obesity in some studies find a much larger percentage and I actually you know Fifteen or feel free to disagree with me but I feel like it doesn't actually matter that we know how
Difficult weight is to lose and we know how harmful it is the shame people for their weight and so if there are big health effects of obesity
I'm not sure that it really helps for you know a neurologist to tell somebody you have to lose forty pounds before I treat your migraines I mean I think for people that do want to lose weight I think it's really important
You know I mean I think it's fine to talk with a health risk in the same way you know I'm a gay man
Their health risks associated with gay people gay people are more likely to use illegal drugs they're more likely to have unsafe sex it's perfectly fine for my doctor to talk to me about those things but he needs to talk to me about those things in a healthy and accepting and questioning way right of what are your sexual practices what are your drug use practices and not in this way that
Hello and then two seconds into the appointment he says oh well because you're using math I think you should stop using that I mean one thing that came away from me from your clinic Pitino was the way that you guys had an hour long appointment with patients and you were really listening to them and that's something that with primary care providers a lot of patients just never get that luxury if somebody
Asking them about their habits and listening to what they say and believing them
Well a lot of patients period will never get that luxury with their primary care physicians doctors to ever go ahead
Yeah so am I Want to touch on a few points number one I Want to remove some of the language or language that I wouldn't use with my patients which has fat or skinny I can tell you that patients on the extremes I meaning either very lean or ones that have obesity
I'm often um are taken aback by those terms and we do know obesity is a disease process all say that the patient has either mild moderate to severe obesity
I'm so that we know that we're treating the disease and not labeling them by that because I Do think that promotes we buy and stigma so I Want us to to make sure that we don't do that
Now this idea or concept of metabolic healthy obesity
Is such that we look at a patient the patient we know has mild moderate to severe obesity but there's nothing that we're able to define
Clearly by taking like blood samples or things of that sort that really points to them having any disease pathology what we're finding is that this term metabolic fully healthy obesity is is a little bit falling out of favor because we're we're finding is that even in patients where things appear normal on the surface
They do have issues so for example
I have adolescent patients that we send to weight loss surgery these are patients
That obviously have moderate to severe obesity um and when you look at them they may have no obesity ... more but conditions at the time of surgery
What we do at the time of operation for most of these patients as we do a liver biopsy and with that liver biopsy were able to determine if the patient has fatty liver disease now if you look at their liver function tests if you do an ultrasound of their liver we're finding that it appears is that they don't have liver disease
But when they do that biopsy we're finding that about Ninety five percent of these adolescence
That we're sending to surgery actually have fatty liver disease Ninety five percent Ninety five percent of the patients we just finished a study looking at this so that shows you that we're not picking up on something in a way that we might I'm an adult patients you
A question of about this because I think you know there's something that Michael said that really is stuck in my head now where he he was I think he's pointing at like ... ... why should a neurologist though be talking to someone about their weight when that person is there for a migraine and and you know I Want to relate to what you just said Dr stance
Isn't going to find evidence of of fatty liver disease anyway
But let's look at what you guys just said and this is going to put all my medical have because that's why you guys have me here so patients that have obesity have a high likelihood of having migraines and just coincidentally many of the drugs they are ... there used to treat migraine headaches and also a great for weight loss
So when I find that my patience and I would say about fifty percent of my adult patients have a history of migraine headaches and have obesity I might concurrently be treating with the medication both disease process is I'm getting rid of
Their migraines they're losing weight it's a win win situation
So I Would say that they're neurologist approaching them
Maybe from the lens of neurology using that migraines as a as a key um place to come in but we recognize that remember we talked about every disease process that we know affects all organ systems sooner ... is one of the very important one Michael did you want to respond to that [noise]
Well I think I mean the stories that I'm hearing from that people are not that they're neurologist or saying you know we have a couple of morbidity do you mind if we run some tests the stories that I'm hearing are
We won't run any test until you lose weight I mean I've been hearing from people that their doctors refused to give them an MRI until they lose weight their doctors refuse to give them fertility treatment until they lose weight
I think when we talk about obesity care we tend to conflate
Weight loss and the care that fat people get when they go to the doctor and I think that it's it's really worthwhile to separate those two things because
Not every fat person does to the doctor seeking to lose weight a lot of them feel like their life is fine if you like your habits or find they don't feel like they have to lose weight or they're already on a plan by themselves with their husband whatever trying to lose weight in some other way
All they needed a doctor to treat their ear ache right or if they if they get on a train accident they need somebody who's going to be compassionate and he's going to fix that ... D located shoulder
And so I think it's really important that doctors take very seriously this idea that
Fat people are not getting effective medical care and a lot of people just shows up in studies to that fat people avoid going to the doctor because they're afraid that they're going to get shame for their weight if they don't get cancer screenings because they're afraid of what the interaction with the nurse is going to be like they don't want to be weighed and I think if you're thinking about effective care
I think it's fine for a neurologist to bring up hey you know based on the research we have a couple of things that are related
Weight might be related to migrants that kind of thing but that's not the kinds of interactions that people are having
It's really important to think about how pervasive weight stigma is and how weight does this credit patience with their doctors often times in specialties that are really only tangentially related to weight ducks
Never go ahead yeah so I Do agree that we as physicians overall don't do a great job of approaching patients that struggle with their weight secondary to our own biases and an adequate education surrounding how to treat patients that have obesity on what we do know and you do cover this in your article is that um education surrounding obesity nutrition physical activity
And medical schools residency programs throughout the country is minimal at best
I can tell you that there are several organizations working on improving the standards um surrounding this issue because we do know that forty percent of the adult population has obesity and Nineteen percent of the pediatric patients has would be the which means that this is by far the most prevalent chronic disease and so I agree that we do have some work
Um I Would say that patients are concerned about the care they are getting and if they want dedicated care I Would seek out I'm a fellowship trained to be the medicine physician like myself are one that has undergone I'm training and certification by the American board of obesity medicine
And I just I've been here for a second because if you're living in Boston or Seattle or Chicago or Houston maybe you can find that ... what if what if you're living in a rural county that doesn't have the time
That we're doing a really good job so the American board of obesity medicine has certified twelve hundred physicians in obesity and different sub specialties
From neurology to OBGYN to pass all gee in recent years and what you can do is you can go to the American board of obesity medicine site type in your ZIP Code and see what your doctors are certified and I'm In that area there is no pay wall to get through you can see

This is on point I'm making a chocolate bar to we're talking about ... efforts or maybe a call to rethink how we think about the obesity epidemic in America I'm joined today by Michael Hobbs he's a staff writer at Huffington Post and he wrote an article called everything you know about obesity is wrong
And also with us is Dr for team of Cody Stanford she's the obesity she's an obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General hospital
And Dr Stanford and Michael so many colors
Seth who's calling from Johnson City Tennessee you're on the USS
Hi thanks for taking my call 'em so I just got on to talk about something the Michael brought up near the beginning of the food
And we talked about the way that his mom was treated kind of um by her friends and then kind of her behavior home um I think it's really interesting because I've struggled with my weight my entire life
Um but I've never really what my wait hold me back it always seems to be the prejudiced reaction
I'm kind of the stigma and things like that but I get from other people
Um that really hold me back so Johnson City Tennessee the huge area outdoors activities or giant um so I'm always very active however there have been several times in my entire life where I just don't get a good thing because
People think that my weight will hold them back uh-huh I'm so it's kind of interesting
But it doesn't just affect me but it also affects my relationships aren't very broadly
Yeah well ... thank you for your call a and thank you for sharing your story I Want to get Cindy in here who's calling from Charlotte North Carolina Cindy you're on the air
Hi thank you I have to play one is about the definition of obesity I Am a very low you're very active by well and when I got on the scale I Am airports obese
So that the very definition of a case that will tell us the number on the scale and my height
Might not be am I right
Away but that that's that's that's one point the most important one I think it's that I never hear anyone talk about what is underlying the eating that if you're so you know as a society we we treat symptoms not causes
I Know for many very obese are at absolute caretakers they're running school about foster kids they're carrying for everybody no time for them so they were themselves it ... ... if you
Will love for close and personal care tape and I never hear not walk up I very talk about that
Maybe a solution to obesity is treating the bin ...
Cindy Cindy let me just jump in here thank you for your call because doctors Stanford go ahead yeah so I'm sitting able to
Address few appoints thanks so much for calling your number one I'm you talked about the ... which is what the World Health organization uses for obesity and I would say definitely there are some some challenges with that I can tell you that with each patient that I see I pay attention to the weight
I mean how can I pay very close attention to wait distribution so central out of ... wait that security met midsection
Is most concerned because that does predispose patients to um heart disease and other illnesses such as fatty liver so I Would say that if for someone like yourself who seems to be a more muscular where there'd be a mind would not be necessarily the best criteria
I Would pay attention to that we circumference attorney uh we used to converse of thirty five inches or less than we do have significant study's based upon ATP three guidelines that support that
I'm with regards to the psychology I'm actually if you look at um doctor ... members are Michael hops article he specifically did interview psychologist Dr ... song
From them gee we'd center was interviewed and we do have all of our patients um spend time with the psychologist delving two issues um such as um what is the psychology behind 'em they're eating behaviors but not just their eating behavior because of course that's the accusatory part I'm understanding what has been their struggles surrounding weight during the course of their life
So I Do think that that's a very important piece we have several psychologist like Dr song working on this and so um I Would I Would say that we do pay attention to that and I think Michael hops did do a good job by bringing those voices into the army so I Want to switch you
Switch gears here for a second um and and take a step back and Michael I'll bring you back in here for this as well because I'm Dr Stanford I just I've heard you a couple of times in this conversation you
Know call ... especially extreme obesity and disease state implying that it's not a normal state now for some people are sort of a higher than average weighed might be their normal sort of bodies that point for their weight
But fifty years ago sixty years ago we didn't we didn't see the rates of overweight or obese American anywhere
Where near what we have now so I mean I don't I I don't think anyone's gonna say that the the this epidemic that we're seeing is is normal right like ... and so to this is such a layperson question but I just want to get your fuel for ... and ... and Michael you too [noise]
Is it the food supply I mean where did this come from is it a mix of
Of the food that we're eating and genetic predispositions or something because it does feel like it kind of happened overnight absolutely I think this is I'm really we are in an OB so genetic environment so I call it the perfect storm will we have is we have had a change in our food quality we've had a change in our physical activity we've had a
Change in the quality and duration of our sleep we've had a change in circadian rhythm um just
Ward it with being able to talk to our colleagues in Russia and talk to our colleagues in India when we're supposed to be sleep here in the United states would tell you that maternity is terrible for our house [laughter] and I say that not not jokingly right if you're talking about sleep
And and physical activity and food and especially for people who you know a lower income getting that high quality food Michael you pointed this out it's like eight times more expensive than the food that they could get at the at the corner bodega
[noise] yeah I mean you know four percent of our agricultural subsidies go to fruits and vegetables and when we talk to people about this kind of off brand advice about oh eat less and exercise more
But as soon as that people have the time to exercise and that their neighborhood has sidewalks and parks where they can go jogging and they don't have two kids
And two jobs and a lot of people do and a lot of people you know if you're spending food stamps what are you going to spend your food stamps on you're not going to buy broccoli which is wildly expensive and doesn't feed your kids
You're going to get something really cheap and really easy and frozen in process and whatever else
And that's I I don't think it's fair to blame people for that I think we have we we tend to blame our choices without blaming our options and our options have profoundly changed since Nineteen eighty and the choices that we make with in those options
I don't think there's blaming kind of frame for that really helps very much when it's simply impossible or too expensive for most people to do the things we're always barking at them
To do and so the reason why I wanted to bring this up Dr Stanford is because we were talking about rethinking how we approach obesity and um
Even in that context this conversation is it's not bad but I felt this conversation being pulled into sort of um you know a ... individual responsibility or things that can be done in the clinicians office et cetera but in order to really get a handle this epidemic we have to look way outside of
That we have to go outside the box we need to bring together a person's in healthcare persons and that our policymakers
Um physical activity facility schools et cetera I always talk about bringing together all of the people and that would really be everyone to the table to make this discussion really shift in a in a direction where we actually have any data on obesity rates in both a pediatric an adult population and and I think
What we've done um with regards to this epidemic his work entirely in silos medicine works by itself public health worse by itself
Um we come up with food labeling assuming that that's going to lead to change and obesity rate and we've seen none of that happened look at food deserts and
Oh if we get rid of food deserts that's going to change everything no we need to be coming together making these decisions together and really in order to make a shift in a way that's positive for the U.S and for the world
Will get another call in here arenas calling from Providence Rhode Island Reno you're on the air
Thank you for taking my call um I in a primary care doctor Johnston Rhode Island just outside of Providence and I'm
At the wonderful conversation I'm outside of my office just nodding my head very enthusiastically about all the comments that people are making 'em and I had read Michael's article and sent it actually got out the other providers and the office
I think it's such an them or in concept of how we speak to our patients about this and I just wanted to comment on
The um the nuances of how you speak to people about this conversation because it's so individualized it's a lot of times I'm trying to explain how I speak to people about focusing on their health
And you know wanting to care about the quality food that they're putting in their bodies and the benefits of exercise for how they feel about themselves and then from the patient side of things a lot of times people

Some WVU are Boston and NPR I met her body and this is on point there are several streams of information by which senators can evaluate Brett Kavanaugh's fitness deserve on the United States Supreme court we're going to examine two of them today have an actual testimony which will take a look at in a minute
Yeah so his tone was angry and a lot of people criticize that but I think it's true that that could be the tone of an innocent man angry at being falsely accused
Um but there are just ... but when you look closely at it but it's the testimony was just full of deliberate misstatements a he said that everyone who affords us with that denies that it happens that was false he said that he never went to a gathering with the people fall for it said
Uh that was also false false it's on his calendar and when he was asked about his drinking which is directly relevant to the question of whether he was
The kind of person that forward and the other uh accuser said he was um he gave very very misleading and often falls answers
Um and I think those things suggest that even if we're from his demeanor we can't tell 'em from the fact that the things he said conflict directly with facts that we know to be true or we can tell that he's lying and that in itself a should disqualify him from the Supreme Court and from being a judge altogether
And go to your response to that
I think I have a higher standard of proof and then they send us as was demonstrated in his piece and I'm extremely uncomfortable with a painting the situation as being one between we either believe a man
A and tell people that the repercussions are you can just attack somebody or or don't believe a woman and then tell people that that she's a liar and women are believed I think it's much better than that
Right well we're going to explore that much greater detail when we come back we're speaking today with Nathan Robin ... he's editor of the journal current affairs and he's written an extended piece of that he says

If we're going to with all that down Bob if we're going to get to zero that means that we need to raise a thousand dollars a minute
Now at first that might sound like whoa that's that's a lot but you know what we have a community out there we have a community of listeners and the way that this model works is everyone just gives what they can we get to that thousand dollars a minute because everyone who's listening

There's very little time left in the fundraiser it is going to end later today as we promised in you know it only began a few days ago short efficient fundraisers is what we're offering because that's
Because we know that what you like in the other thing that's pretty quickly coming to an end the match money it's drying up because other people have used it by giving to W. B. U.

You feel like is actually fast spinning behind what you are listening to and why they sort of an issue and get people from industry for policy from the research will to speak and whatever the topic is so you get a well rounded look at whatever the issue is

Is there listeners of all ages there are a lot of listeners between thirty five and forty who listen to MORNING EDITION and listen to all things considered
And all of the other programs there are listeners who are a little bit older perhaps more time in the middle of the day because there are retired

This is on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking this hour about what Brett Kavanaugh specifically said in his hearing before the Senate Judiciary committee last week and what those words again we're not looking at the ... head contemporaneously just last week what that says about uh whether or not he should serve on the United States Supreme court and
We're joined today by Nathan Robinson he's editor of the journal current affairs and my ... she's senior director at the White House Writers Group and a columnist at real clear politics and I just want to play one more moment I mean there's many moments we could choose from but let's just play one more moment from last week this is in an exchange with
Uh that that judge Kavanaugh had with senator ... are Democrat from Minnesota when she asked him to clarify his drinking habits in high school
Was there ever a time when you drink so much that you couldn't remember what happened or part of what happened the night before I Know I remember what happened
And I think you probably are ... and and
So you're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happened
If you're asking about you know walk out I don't know a view
That exchange went on and of course people remember just having a after a break came back and apologize to senator ...
And I agree and I wanted to play that clip and then turn to you because
I think that was one of many moments where lots of people including you know what I'm seeing here you're Charlie Sykes a conservative commentator he said in the Weekly Standard pod cast the day after or on the friday of last week he
Said that um ... even if you support Brett Kavanaugh there was a breast ... that was breathtaking as an abandonment of pretended of having judicial temperament and he said it's possible I think to have been angry emotional and passionate without crossing the line that he crossed assuming that there are lines anymore
... ... what's your response to that I think the fact
That he apologized to fire ... he felt that he had come across as too aggressive that I'm In the questioning and and he had said you know I Want to apologize was the first thing that he did when they came back from the break
Because I have appreciated how you handled your interviews and you know this is a really tough process this is you know it it's very hard and I want to apologize and she they had this but I found to be a very loudly reconciliation moment
That I can show that he was human because really got to remember coming into this he's coming in and he's kind of damned if he doesn't damned if he doesn't if he's careful with his speech to make sure that he's clear and and I wasn't you know lie under oath which he was the last person who's going to want to do that he understands the repercussions and their beliefs and our justice system
Then we're going to say well he seems you know on careful or as Nathan Robbins has said cagey
Uh but if he is colloquial unjust and says something like okay I'm telling the truth about these things that happened and the other people who were there they also say it didn't happen which is a critical way of saying I'm telling the truth and none of them have said that I'm lying oh well now he's lying under oath and so

So here we are last day last day say it again can't be a you know more appreciated my ups and how you hours last few with our last day last few hours of the w._b. ... drive but here's the deal while it's been successful while we raised over a million dollars in this one razor
We still have two hundred and twenty two thousand dollars to go today before we can say it was a successful fund raiser so we're asking you just to do your part how much of that can you take away how much of that can you give
And we're only asking you to do what it's affordable for you and what you think the news is worth of you can give a hundred or two that's
Great if you can give ten or twenty dollars a month as a standing listener to the old you are you are then give that but do it now before the fundraiser ends because time is running out one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven is the number to call or give at W. B. U. R. dot org
Two hundred and twenty two thousand dollars as Bob Said that we have left to raise and we have to get that number down to zero to keep bringing you the news we only ask
For what we need here at W. B. you are but the reality is that in order to get that two hundred and twenty two thousand dollars we need to raise about a thousand dollars a minute
So we are appealing to you and saying if you care about WB you are and if you find this model unique as we do where we're not putting up a pay wall for you to to get the news and information from W. B. U. R. we're trusting that you will be there for us the way that you trust
WB you are to be there for you day in and day out one eight hundred nine zero nine
Nine to eight seven is the number to call or go to W. B. U. R. dot org
And you've heard us talk a lot over the past week about being independent and how important it is to be independent
As journalists this means that we have lots of producers and reporters hundreds of them around the country around the world working for NPR the b._b._c. WB you are working on your behalf to find the facts and then write stories about those facts that you can decide for yourself what it means
It only means that we need about a hundred bucks from you or two hundred bucks or a thousand whatever it is that you're able to do to contribute to that pot of money that enables us to bring you the kind of news that you count on
And the beauty of the system here it do you be you are is that you choose the amount you decide how much do will you be you are is worth to you you decide based on your weekly or daily or a monthly budget how much you can afford to give and then you give that and that's exactly what other people have done
They've provided W. B. U. R. as we said a minute ago over a million dollars so far in this fundraiser that thousands of people who've pledged

I mean I wouldn't as you were just saying there is a way to kind of remove yourself I'm being tagged on the post or to ask a friend to take it down if they'd posted it but there's one set posters up
There is nothing you can really if you didn't post it yourself do to remove the post 'em and kind of as to what Jack was saying there really is kind of this culture of
Posting stuff online during the week so that you can see what you're saying especially with specialized school I Know that ... has a bar stool [noise] um I count on Instagram where it's kind of cash I hate to be like seemed doing something crazy on it like drinking or whatever
It is so it does kind of some people want to be seen drinking like that on social media and are not thinking forward to the accomplishments of wow
So we're going to take a quick break here we're talking about college drinking culture today and of course the one of the reasons why we're paying attention to it this is the first time people have talked about this of course but
The fact that I'm drinking culture from Thirty years ago suddenly be once again interrogated

Yeah and we figured out what the pace needs to be in order for us to get that number down to zero by the end of the day
It's about a thousand dollars a minute that we need to raise a thousand dollars so my question to you is what part of that thousand dollars for this next minute or can you provide is it the full thousand dollars if it is great if you can cover the next five minutes and do about five thousand dollars
Fantastic but I Know that there are people out there listening who say you know what that is not in my budget and that's okay we just need you to that to be there for us uh in some amount to show your support because
We rely on the community for Ninety five percent of the funding here at W. B. U.

A minute pace because that's what we need to do in order to get to the end of the day to be at the zero Mart
Being at the zero mark is important because it gives us the money to throw says they head into the news coverage as we go through the fall heading for of course the Kavanaugh nomination vote uh probably on Saturday then through the mid term elections then through whatever politics

Uh and guess what people are doing exactly that I've got a tweet here from a gentleman named Steven Irving and Stephen I Hope you're listening to them about to return to eat
And the tweet is we're in the midst of a nationwide heroin epidemic and you find it shocking to hear some people blackout when drinking to relieve stress what planet are you living on where that is in any way shocking magna
So that's a Steven if you're hearing this now first of all I appreciate your comment never let it be said that on point does not address the criticisms that come to this show in real time but I'm going to respond to you here first of all I don't think it's necessarily fair to conflate the heroin epidemic with a conversation about college alcohol drinking I think
It's not fair to anyone who is suffering are dealing with heroin epidemic nor to this conversation itself now insofar as me being shocked that students who are under Twenty one or under drink to blackout in order to relieve stress perhaps I'm a little distressed not shocked about it because I think if that's the primary way
Of relieving stress or or a manner in which people look to to relieve stress it does concern me a little 'cause there are a lot of other ways to relieve stress so let me just let me just talked to Madeline and Brianna and jak here I mean respond to it
With you is it is it a major way drinking to blackout that people use to relieve stress 'cause I'm not sure it's the best idea when you're thinking the only way to relieve stress is to wake up the next morning and not remember what you did the night before
[noise] no I definitely don't think that is like the major ways to relieve stress I think a major way to relieve stress as you go with your friends and have a couple of drinks like brown was saying you got on Thursdays there'd be after you have a class with a couple of friends and just have a couple of drinks
There's there's not like people aren't going out and be like oh I had a rough day to day I'm cynical blackout tonight against and gets his son is more of like you just it catches up on you you go to a party and there's like
There's all call there and you started drinking drinking and then you walk out but there's a million different ways to relieve stress the button you know is not a common one I Would say
OK so Brianna against even are being says ah why do you find a shocking to hear that some people blackout when drinking to relieve stress what do you have to say about that
I totally agree with jak their million other ways to relieve stress I mean especially living in D.C which is such a ... century city you go for a run or you you go to the gym if you're stressed and have things to do for school or work or other things that are laying down on you
Or overlay jak that go out with a couple of friends after class and he'd grab a couple of drinks and then you go home and you do your homework
Um you're definitely not going out on a Thursday and
Saying you know I had a really rough cold call in criminal law today I'm going to drink to excess and not remember what I Do tonight
Okay good some of these clarifications because I thought I heard in the beginning part of this show I thought I heard all of you say that sometimes the point is to get to a blackout because things are so stressful did I miss hear any of that
[noise] I Know I mean definitely that is sometimes the point but I think like professor ... saying it's definitely not the point the majority of the time um at least not
Now in law school in undergrad one needy your responsibility weren't as much as they are earning now um
You might go out on a ... day because it's your birthday or because you know you had a really rough cat and do that but certainly not the majority of the time anymore
OK Madeline I yeah I also think we have to draw a different like a distinction here between the language that people are using and what they're actually doing because at least
In my license blackout as kind of used almost colloquially like you you were like oh I'm going to go get blackout tonight but that doesn't necessarily mean you will it just means that kind of an normalized thing and it's part of the language almost like a slang term so
We're gonna like as to what the comment on line said
I don't like I don't know that we are all black out every weekend that would I Can't imagine that but I Do think it's part of our language now in a way that it might not have done before
[noise] All right let's go to more callers Veronica is calling from New Orleans you're on the erotic uh
Hi thank you for taking my call um I just from here I already graduated from college and hearing all and the drinking scene in it crazy even outside of college we have Bourbon Street in that kind of like dry your party scene of the nation

From WVU are often and NPR I met her body and this is on point there are several streams of information by which senators can evaluate Brett Kavanaugh fitness to serve on the United States Supreme court we're going to examine two of them today have an actual testimony which will take a look at in a minute
And the FBI is new background reports which as of the early hours of this morning is now in the hands of the Senate Judiciary committee so we will start there today and
Joining me now from Capitol Hill is John Brezhnev hand he senior congressional reporter
For Politico John welcome to employ magna so first of all tell us here I think there's a lot of questions around procedure and process now who exactly has uh the FBI's
Background report on Brett Kavanaugh at the moment
The Senate Judiciary committee has a jurisdiction
It's in a secure facility in the capital and senators and some limited number of staff members can go read the report or be briefed on the report by staffers
Nice nice I'm seeing here that they're going to sort of rotate between a groups of Democrats and Republicans on each gifts and give each group or an hour or so to examine the report
Yes and then they will give separate staff briefings for them so that the staff will go over the report with them
Okay ah how many copies of the report or they're just this one there
Is one that they're keeping though you can they they they will allow some members to see copies of it have it a
Center them back and forth but it's it's the right now they're just allowing the one copy the other one copy of that they're keeping ... inside this it's called the ... sensitive compartment
Compartment in information facility it in the basement of the capital
So obviously the tree treating this as a highly important document that deserves a secure facility but are there agreements amongst the senators and or staffers to maintain the confidentiality of what's in the document I mean we're living in an age where
Would we be surprised if someone gave a press conference after seeing seeing the document
No they'll be they'll be discussions or the Democrats are or have scheduled press conferences throughout the day and you'll see the Republicans were responding all over the floor or statements back and forth on it now
The specific findings inside the report or confidential or are they are classified so well they're ... national security costs are but they're confidential so it would be improper for somebody to leave those or to put those out there
A lot I'm sure they'll be discussion broad discussion I mean we know that the FBI has talked to nine
Interview nine witnesses
Dr Ford was not one of them Dr ... before she was not one of them they did talk to Deborah mirror as they did not talk to afford which is interesting because she of course testified in
But there was the control of those witnesses that was worked up to run the White House about who would be interviewed and and Senate Republicans so we know they talked to nine witnesses we don't know all their identities at that wage

This is on point I'm making a trucker Bertie we're going to spend some time taking a close look at judge Brett Kavanaugh's testimony that he gave before
The Senate Judiciary committee last week and asked the question of what that specific testimony says uh about his character and whether or not he should serve in the United States Supreme court now we're joined by Nathan Robinson he's editor of the journal current affairs he wrote a long recent piece entitled
How we know Kavanaugh is lying on the radio dot org the link to it
And like a green also joined us She's senior director at the White House Writers Group and a columnist at real clear politics she worked with Brett Kavanaugh in the Bush White House for a little over a year and she recently wrote a column titled we can believe Ford and confirm Kavanaugh as well and that link as is also at one point radio dot org
Okay Nathan so uh you know we we read over your piece and we've actually pulled some of the moments that you referred to a in your article and I just want to go through a couple of them and get your analysis and of course and it goes response as well
So here's one moment it's pretty straightforward this is an exchange between judge Kavanaugh
And democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and White House is asking cabinet I hear about specific freezes a that appeared in judge Kavanaugh's your book
Devil's triangle drinking game I was deployed three glasses trying and you're quite quarters gr supporters can
Make and Robbins and why do you highlight this moment
Because nobody's ever heard of this drinking game because there was no evidence that this drinking game a existed up until the moment that it came out of bread Kevin O's mouse during his testimony a devil's triangle is a common slang phrase for a three ...
And uh it's a it's a sexual term and uh in Brett Kavanaugh's testimony she tried to paint himself he tried to the reason this is important is because throughout his testimony he tried to paint himself
As a kind of innocent in high school was that he was a Virginia but to charge you volunteer soup kitchen
He helped intellectually disabled children and this was all a way of suggesting that essentially Ford's picture of him was crazy it was totally out of touch with the person that he was now devil's triangle factory I eat a minor one of the examples compared to a lot of the ...
And like the just deliberate misstatements about about what other people said
Um but there is a pattern
And that is one example of a huge pattern in which Brett Kavanaugh evaded admitting what everyone who knew him in high school and college says to be true which is that he was a hard partying hard drinking kind of guy and ... and aggressive and belligerent and he didn't want the ... know that and so he didn't admit
Or any of the things that suggested that he did actually know how to think about sex in high school and uh things that would make for that gives you more credible
Well uh you know and just to add a level of I'm intrigued to this just after judge Kevin uh um said what he said about the devil's triangle someone with a congressional IP address went to a PDF and actually added judge Kavanaugh's definition of it um that was quickly remove later
But but Nathan they'll let me I mean okay so what you just said let me just push you on this a little bit because we also see um I I Know the devil's triangle things a minor moment but to me it's very revealing because can't we also see this as a man who is so
He has been pushed to such an extreme and it's so cognizant of how hyper partisan this moment is that he can he ... he is legitimately fearful of even admitting to you know what might I don't know I'm just what might be kind of the ... the things that Seventeen year old boy say to each other
Because it wouldn't be taken as that it would be taken as an admission for something
Much much greater that he's alleged to have done I mean I think the hyper partisanship of the moment may understandably make someone ultra cautious even admitting the slightest things
The problem is that there's this thing called a swore an oath and you take it when you testified in front of the Senate and Brett Kavanaugh is a federal judge and he's speaking to be confirmed to the Supreme Court
Ah so it actually doesn't matter if you find details of your life embarrassing or you think that admitting them would make you look guilty of the whole point is that you have to it's a it's sworn testimony you can't lie to the Senate because if you told the truth it would make the allegations against you look more credible in fact that's entirely the point
The reason that he lied about these things
I'm is because if he admitted the truth I'm it wouldn't help it was hard ah him in his attempt to make Christine Ford looked totally out of touch with reality
And it's a green what he said I watch these hearings because I wanted to know the truth and as I wrote in my piece I Believe both of them I found them both to be telling the truth to be credible now as I look at the evidence I think that it's more likely that the trauma
And P TST symptoms that Dr Ford has described are distorting her memory and then it's quite possible that though she may have been assaulted it was not break having all and I don't think that the proof shows
That it could have been him to prove a and the number of people you have one person saying he was this type of person
And then I hear people like a nice in our audience and saying things like nobody's ever heard of the stringing game everybody knew well those are not factual statements we have people on the record under sworn oaths like eighty four women from the Bush White House attest to his character
Sixty five women from high school saying we've known him for thirty five years this is what he was like
But I ... that seems to be discounted which bothers me as a person is really interested in the truth and sneezing statements like nobody's heard of it everybody knew is an example of that faith analysis
And in this particular example when I was looking at this piece by an eighth and his examples of why this drinking a mentally he says it means which I find kind of filthy minded honestly
Is nobody has ever heard of it meaning it's not on the Internet which we didn't have a Nineteen eighty three so it's not on the Internet okay so what DC area kids called uh drinking game devil's triangle which may have just been a circle of friends honestly we I mean who knows I don't have
The I I wasn't in the DC area in Nineteen eighty three uh but that means he's lying and the additional proof as a nation friend Pete Davis who went to high school in the DC area
In two thousand eight
That's not proof ... and I don't think that is even just crediting I mean I can find a friend to say anything I don't know ... Davis um but I don't think that a friend who graduated in the DC area and two thousand eight who says that
In the Internet age devil's triangle now means this thing is evidence that Brett Kavanaugh was lying about this drinking game Nathan I'm going to guess you want to respond to that
... yeah I mean look if anyone can come up with a source for the existence of this thing of the proceeds brick have enough testimony you know having to discuss that I really don't want to dwell too much on this because it is one of the minor things and the most major lives are much much much more significant
Ah like saying I never attended a gathering with the people for ... cents now on his calendar on Thursday July first he attended a gathering with the people that Ford says he attended a gathering with when he says all of the people she says we're there say it didn't happen
In fact one of the ... and he's he cited he says Ford's friendly Lynn ties are
Says that this didn't happen that's not what Leyland Kaiser says Leyland Kaiser says she believed Dr Ford which means it did
It would be awesome if she believes belief does not mean that it did happen
Just to be what she believes that it did happen yeah which is the opposite of saying that strangely but it didn't happen she believes that it happened right her opinion is that forward is telling the truth
Right not that it didn't happen and so when Kavanaugh says all of the people she says we're there say it didn't happen that's false sense of false statement that the full representation of what those people say when he says he didn't go to a gathering with those people that's false he did we know from his calendar
Okay so ... and like I'm going to come back to you for a second on this but I just want to play these two moments that Nathan is referring to first of all here is Brett Kavanaugh again before the Senate Judiciary committee last week uh in fact in his opening statement saying the calendar that he kept in high school a
Show that he he says that he never attended a gathering with people that are professor Ford named
None of those gatherings included a group of people that Dr Ford as far as my calendar show I was very precise about lifting over there very precise
And then in an exchange with democratic Senator Chris Coons a judge Kavanaugh asserted that uh the witnesses who attended the party that professor Ford said the assault happen that they have submitted statements are saying that it didn't happen and here's what judge Kavanaugh said
I just want to emphasize all four witnesses who were allegedly at the event of started to happen
Now on a green I'm actually we know that what the statements the statements that the witnesses submitted say that they have no recollection
Which is categorically different than saying it didn't happen

You and nearly eleven thousand of your fellow listeners put your contributions together to raise nearly one point five million dollars for WB you are in our full fundraiser from all of us the w._b. you are thank you for your dedication and your generous support
This is on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking this hour about what Brett Kavanaugh specifically said in his hearing before the Senate Judiciary committee last week and what those words
Again we're not looking at the past but what he said
Contemporaneously just last week what that says about uh whether or not he should serve on the United States Supreme court we're joined today by Nathan Robinson he's editor of the journal current affairs and my editor green she's senior director at the White House Writers Group and a columnist
At real clear politics and I just want to play one more moment I mean there's many moments we could choose from but let's just play one more moment from last week this is an ... an exchange with
Ah that that judge Kavanaugh had with senator ... are Democrat from Minnesota when she asked him to clarify his drinking habits in high school
Was there ever a time when you drink so much that you couldn't remember what happened or part of what happened the night before I Know I remember what happened
And I think you're probably a beer center and and
So you're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before a part of what happened
If you're asking about young black I don't know a view
That exchange went on and of course has people remember just having a after a break came back and apologize to senator ...
And like a green wanted to play that clip and then turn to you because I think that was one of many moments where lots of people including you know what I'm seeing here you're Charlie Sykes a conservative commentator he said in the weekly standards pod cast the day after or on the friday of last week he
Said that um ... even if you support Brett Kavanaugh there was a breath ... that was breathtaking as an abandonment of pretended of having judicial temperament and he said it's possible I think to have been angry emotional and passionate without crossing the line that he crossed assuming that there are lines anymore
... ... what's your response to that I think the fact
That he apologized to fire Clovis charges that he felt that he had come across as too aggressive
That I'm In the questioning and and he had said you know I Want to apologize was the first thing that he did when they came back from the break because I have appreciated how you handled your interviews and you know this is a really tough process this is you know it it's very hard and I want to apologize and she they had this but I found to be a very lovely reconciliation moment
That I can show that he was human gets really got to remember coming into this he's coming in and he's kinda damned if he doesn't damned if he doesn't if he's careful with his speech
To make sure that he's clear and and I wasn't you know lie under oath which is the last person who's going to want to do that he understands the repercussions in their beliefs and our justice system than we are going to say well he seems you know on careful or as Nathan Robbins has said cagey
Uh but if he is ... and just and says something like okay I'm telling the truth about these things that happened and the other people who were there they also say it didn't happen which is
None of them have said that I'm lying oh well now he's lying under oath and so I think it's important to remember he's a human I think this moment showed that he was human that he felt he got too aggressive he apologized and ah I thought ... and it was really nice Nathan your take
Well what unethical colloquial I call false right just just misrepresenting the facts that but I I say cagey for a reason I mean he us direct questions like I'm so your your book is a got a lot of references to drinking in it and he says
I was number one in my class in high school
Well that that's not an answer to the questions right and and for the drinking thing people dwell on it like we're trying to impugn his his character by accusing him of drinking is directly relevant alcohol comes up in all three of the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh
Is why it's so important for him to be honest and had to answer those questions directly
Nobody's going to hold it against him if he says look I I really yes it might yes I talked about drinking a lot I was voted you know president of the ... club like uh because I I drank a lot and
You know there's nothing wrong with being honest about that people understand that you move on and you grow up but he's a Yale classmates of your time to talk to a dozen of his your costs money to all say that he's misrepresenting his record of drinking in college um and and and and they say that they say that directly we have his freshman year roommate who say they use it belligerent drunks
Um we have the uh University of Washington I'm headed the uh got a call to go on to college in apartment who says I used to drink with Brett
The it's not credible she said it is not credible for him to say that he had no memory lapses I mean he even said that he'd never woken up with his clothes is different from how he remembered the night before that is what he said
And we have people who were there who were participating with him all watched him all say that's just not credible he he he'd listen as high school yearbook he's part of the city club that tried to get through a hundred ... in a year
You know in March judges memoir wasted he's ... he's depicted as bart oh Kavanaugh who feel ... everywhere
Um and he wouldn't even admit that he was bought a cabinet off um he was asked about that and he said oh you'd have to ask mark judge will ... you wouldn't have to ask mark judge because we know that his nickname in high school was bought that's also when you
Look at let's take a call here Nathan is calling from Milwaukee, Wisconsin you're on the our Nathan
I thank you very much for having me I was going to mention I did think that Brett Kavanaugh was lying and I wanted to say so it was already pointed out was claiming that everybody refuted was when he said people refuted
The allegations bottom one that wasn't true
I also talk to the claim that there was a Clinton revenge street going on as over the top accusations but I don't think the fact that he lied to Congress and she can be lied regardless of whether or not a show you lied regardless of if you will your doctor for it or not
I don't think that will stop to Republicans being from Wisconsin I saw Scott Walker lying to Congress back when he was getting a lot of attention from act turns
And none of the Republicans are scared about it or want to do
And then I don't think they are doing now
In measuring good group of people supporting ethanol I found it very ironic that they have the phrase stand with Kavanaugh because it reminds me of the phrase stand with Walker in my experience was that the political slogan used to cover up for on trustworthy versus
Well look people there's a hash tag I stand with Christine I mean stand with so and so it seems to be a very very common way of expressing support for whomever it is that you express support for Nathan
I'm okay I'll I'll I'll open up that far but we I see a lot of yard signs saying a stand with Walker and white that somebody is not trustworthy so when you actually have a science thing that was it was kind of law I'm like oh my gosh okay over again
Nathan thank you for your call and it's a green let me turn back to you I think Nathan is broader point is that he doesn't feel that no matter you know whether that that no matter the number of pieces of evidence of misstatements that the judge Kavanaugh may have or may not have made I Know there's obviously disagreement over that but
In Nathan sees he sees a whole line of misstatements and no matter how long that line is he doesn't think it matters to Congress and all of the congressional Republicans and they're going to
A they're going to confirm him anyway and uh he he objects to that but what's your response to Nathan
Well actually what Nathan is saying is that he sees a line of lives and that is much stronger than misstatements I mean I I as a more trying to see this more objectively I say well maybe he did make misstatements
Um I don't think that that for example he never said he didn't drink in high school he did say yeah I drink in high school sometimes I drink too much sometimes others drank too much that's what that's the way he sat in front of the Judiciary Committee
And in his calendar you know you look at a statement like oh well they said that I look at my calendar there's no gatherings like those described there is no gathering that says that leave when Carter was there to also said I don't know him I didn't go to ...
I've been a different type of gathering et cetera but like we're talking about what is the use of going through things that can't be proven from years ago and I think we even saw this um and then that was less Republicans were trying to sift through this and said we need to hear from people who are coming forward with these allegations
How do we start to do this because this is going to the political circus so they got a prosecutor who has experienced in bringing forth cases of sex crimes she came out with a report which I didn't see mentioned
Uh in in ... piece at all or where she said I found this weaker than a he said she said case based on inconsistencies in her testimony and so I think it's important to be fair saying look
You can find inconsistencies like people are human they're talking about things for the best of their recollection and when you're being questioned in front of every camera and the nation a before panel senators whether you are Christine forward or Iraq having all that is an intimidating
Place to be in and I think really when we come down to is if he's telling the truth

Shows such as men versus wild which aired from two thousand sixty thousand eleven and now host of running wild with their grills he's author of the new book how to stay alive the ultimate survival guide for any situation
Um end up before they make their break a few me before the break a bear people tell me I've talked too fast so maybe I should slowdown here I'm a you were telling us you've got a couple of friends there in the studio that was unexpected to me because we didn't know or that you'd have anyone else with you on your end in London but you know what even sparked me about
A this is talk about the survivors mindset and getting outside your comfort zone so we're going to get outside of our little radio comfort zone here for a minute I get you would if we can you reintroduce us to you too who your friends are and he said they have an incredible survival story
Well what I'm saying is that survival is this is so much about the spirit you know and the rest of it as the arena that we ended up playing and whether you're stuck in a life raft or whether you're in a plane crash or whether you're dealing with bereavement illness or whatever it is all about having not survive the spirit
And you know it's it's a it's great I Love being yeah love to hear about this I'm excited to to get questions from your listeners but I always try and kind of
Bringing inspirational people as well in a band that Simon to
A couple that I've met they reach out to me that you'll hear that story in a minute but I really wanted to meet them and say hey come and join me fussing few because this is a fun one and I will take some questions and all of that but what they know about is is togetherness and an holding on uh-huh I'm OK and Ben is aged
... eleven fellow man Simon is is that so I've been to go
To a little bit about your ... well hey man I'm Sorry for the first of all since I don't know who you are it on our listeners don't know can you just introduce yourself a little more fully what what's your full name and where where are you from I'm
I'm Benjamin almost a uh I'm from ... in England them
And and your eleven okay and your dad as Simon sitting next to you there in London yeah that's correct yes hello Simon what's what's your full name also from Cheshire I presume I yes some insight also from ... okay well the great to have you with surprise guests on this show so so tell us a little bit about what bears talking about what's your your survival story
I'm a doctor will tell you okay he's a bit nervous or the wind or it's all in an unexpected
Bent bend house quite ... um he he can be hospitalized for about four days our time I'm being unable to freeze 'em
So he's on regular ... medication for that but he he wants to get back on the five cent so
He's he's tried ... simple most recently um but as program on this new book especially as inspired him to go out and about so he looks going climbing into my own since he's always pushing himself
A ... every time we go um he he uses an inhaler low but he's really talking back on using the inhaler now so he's really pushing himself getting higher up the mountains like Mr early on
You know using the inhaler last see he's he's really pushing him so she knew spirits no
Well that sounds great and and and Ben let me just turn back to you really quickly so uh what is what is it about about bear and what he's done and his book that inspires you to to push yourself why why do you want to do that
Um it rains rationing because them all the things in that I cannot will still for namely thinking rumors or anything it's just inspirational
Okay well so let's see how far the inspiration goes 'cause I Want to play a clip here from two thousand seven this is from an episode of bear grills man versus wild and he was dropped into the rugged terrain of Western Australia and he ran out of water and here's what happened next
Time they will bring my on pay and Mrs [noise] sorry I've never done before [noise] and on my face and it's been pretty horrible [noise] but I Need to keep going and [noise] it may seem disgusting but you are in your in it's safe to drink [noise]
Fair grills a re hydrate ing in Western Australia in two thousand seven uh then I'm going to like you and I forget that [laughter] I'm gonna let you off
The first time I go and tell you that bend you're lucky what do you drink you know you're lucky if you will suffer the cubs [laughter] how about a novel with an apple juice then would you go so far as to drink you're in if you had to stuck on
A mountain [laughter] depends [laughter]
Well Ben Simon thank you for being a surprise guest this hour or ... let me let me turn back to you or was it disgusting it sounds like it was
A ... a lot of things and survival of disgusting you know but I'm Glad you got to leave your prejudices behind you got to do whatever it takes and survival food is never going to ... nice and survival
You know fluid set need I taste nice but it's about doing whatever it takes you know and and I'm definitely not one of these people who drinks pay for found the center of there if you ... and actually I've met a few of them over the years and that kind of make a swift exit if I get Qunu by somebody tells me they do it for fun or you don't have housing
In your book though how to stay alive ad on page twenty here you actually have this really great a diagram of below ground solar still
That if you're in the desert I eat someplace like Western Australia a dig a hole in the ground but what a foot or so deep and if you have a piece of plastic you put plastic over that whole and some rocks around it
And the stone in the middle so that I'm a water whatever water content in the soil around the the whole will actually condense a underneath the the plastic and drip into a cop and you say they say here if you you earn eight in the whole before setting up the still
Moisture and your your will condense into clean drinking water why didn't you do that
Unless you get the thing is if you're really de hydrated
Drinking you'll pay when it's brown pay is not going to help you you're just into pure waste product
So if you can make a cell is still like this you have the you have the the resources to do that
Paying into the bit around that is gonna evaporate like you say condense and then you you're going to get flus out of that but if you uh well hydrated when you find yourself stranded in survival situation for example you call it breaks down or whatever it is you know I knew what hydrated you don't want to be paying out
Those fluids because actually if you pay is clear
That that can actually help hydrate you so you want to be drinking that you want to be using in other ways may be paying onto your clothes and wrapped around her head to Kuti ahead
Um you know and he he's a little things about the bunch of times I mean it
Was right for you love looking back into it because what if it was a crew to guide you stink then a few days we'll move ... just wrapped around my neck in a on a headscarf a pie and [noise] you know but he said let's see if it's about whatever Italians in it since you mentioned your
Crew I've always wondered I mean how ... your crew was there with you with their equipment having to go through the same terrain and as you are I mean how how how much do you ask of them in terms of a ... of having a survival mindset or doing the things that you're even doing
I'll tell you what they are they're incredible they really are they're being with me from day one small team
You know we're real kind of band of brothers and a foot of respect and admiration and everything you kind of thing can hype about them is true you know they always say hey you have these huge oh we're going to do everything you do the back woods carrying a camera you know and it's a bit you know
Be under no illusion they are incredible and they work the hardest and the the real unsung heroes and the whole story
All right well we're speaking with their grills he is host of running wild that they are grills and of course man versus wild he's got a new book out called
How to stay alive the ultimate survival guide for any situation where at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred forty three talk and call us with your questions for bear and we've actually got a bunch of them already so let's go to art who's calling from ... in Virginia you're on

Is on point to make her body we're talking this hour with Baird grills he's got a new book out at how to stay alive the ultimate survival guide for any situation a and Barrett before the break we heard from college Steve who was former a navy special forces that here in the U.S and he'd he'd gone through the the Navy's really rigorous SERE training a and he was talking about how
Um as one of the toughest things for him was the mental challenge of this
Please isolation and whether or not you've ever experienced a similar challenge or has gone out on one of these survival expeditions without a a a a camera crew and I couldn't let you respond before the break but I wanted to give you a shot at that now
Yeah no festivals the respect for your service and a lot of ... to the
A guy who ran in before yes you're by Sally Ride the bathroom for survival is one and lost in the mind
Um the sea of training is something I went through like rise with part of the British special forces or it is long it is odd shifted its tough
And the time on your own ... I Would second what you said Steve ... it's it's hard but you need to kind of get into that mind five cars are okay we're into this you know however long it's going to be just break it down into the daily tasks
And I she found ... you get so busy surviving you know use his job off the job and people kind of
You know often underestimate how busy this is a loving survive it to look up to yourself and
Again you know when we're now as a crew you know when we were filming staff everything is so much easier when you have an extra set of hands be needed you know putting up shelters are getting a fog and someone else if you needed to put a first on that well you do you know the ...
... everything on the ground is so much harder but it's all so busy you know I just remember that see a training I went through the the days on All right it was just due to a doctor and if you collected firewood repairing the setting snap as doing that
And by the end in sight yeah yeah
It's all on your shoulders and then it's not meant to Saudi you got to keep yourself up beef you gotta keep thinking like you know
I always say to people and it's survival situation is never letting your mind go into neutral is always something they are doing to think about the planning and um and that's why it becomes very draining the times on the right I I think it's three times harder than when you go one other buddy with you
There just one of the thing that Steve had said that caught my attention and I just want to just get a quick response from you because then I actually got a lot of online questions and I kind of want to do a little lightning round with you but but there's something as Steve said that he ... he was man and he managed to snare a rabbit or to during his ear training and I was
Thinking he's really highly trained navy special forces a guy
A and and so he managed to snare rabbit or two but I was wondering do you worry that people watching your shows for example come because you have to show the successes along with the challenges on television or at least survive survival situation do you ever wonder that people come away thinking it's easier than it actually is
Yeah I think that's what I mean listen nobody is going to put on telly may ... spending three hours trying to lie to five and ... and the reality of a sudden in the old days on the Memphis while shows
You know I spent hours and hours doing this or you know hours and hours studying ... obviously that she was going to make a Rudy boring program you know I guess edited down and for you know it's like a bit of music and ... book is going to a guy but
You got to the reality of it it is it is hard work for sure yeah but I think one of the lessons of survival is embracing failure you know not be scared to fail and and it's just this is why I said right at the start of the show survivor of summed up three was never give up is all about that so nasty that spirit
And you might have to go through multiple failures hours and days of
Of getting something wrong before you get success and that's why the rule it's always got to that do get the determine you know next Saturday to the Berlin the brave the strongest
Well so let's do a lightning round a quick quick thing about it right here for
By the way to rabbits for a few people [laughter] that's got to be no one the last ... food team found in the early ... yeah I I I'm not saying that Seventy says we we run another survivor show called the island where we draw these people in the desert island to leave them nothing no camera crews running and they have to
Film everything themselves that you know we come back in months later and it's like ... like stream weight loss it
And that is the reality of survival is yeah you're starving you ... your frighten you wet your cold and ... and
You know and that's why it is is is very on glamorous it's right on romantic Ohio reality of survival is great
Well speaking of the the glamorous part of survival I Do we just got so many questions here a lot of them coming in on social media I just want to do like a little lightning round so I asked a question in just a quick answers that we can get through
A as many of them as we can hear okay so Brian wrestler from or on Facebook says I've often wondered after eating beetles and crustaceans and survival situation it's survival situation how miserable is bears intestinal track I mean does he sit there and say why couldn't it be somewhere with some nice soft grubs to eat
Your mind to subtract needs needs some attention yeah [laughter] I'm like I mean they definitely don't care about the failures number of things have eaten the end of a bad guy rare and stuff and I saw
Um but on the whole is you're not getting the land ... by the failures that and your next time I got ... to ... that one again
Right so I get Matt wanted to know how often as Barrett guessed wrong and ingest poisonous plant or animal I guess that has happened according to what you just said or not
Or do you I Need make big mistakes once and when it comes to
You know poison things I've ... mushrooms and and ... you got to really know you stuff and be careful and if the doubt there's no doubt don't eat it right you know especially when it comes I see now with mushrooms you know I I just we just I just don't even go near them now and the walks into many ones in different areas that ... like so many things okay and then
You know I mean look at that story from Alaska was at one such a great film you know the end of the wind the Alaska decided in the ... and I had a baby coming on our own ran to get it wrong ones out there
And by the way if you have it from folks have already Jon Krakauer original book it's amazing uh Tanya be asked any special advice pertaining to women
[noise]
Well hey listen to what I've learned about ladies in the wild is that they make incredible survivors enough taken so many running wild guess
That you know you think that the man the the the big Bush ... got the big muscles he's going to be great but actually in the middle of an actress severely thinks she can snap in the wild and she's also disliked made of steel so survival is all about that in the spirit and all the alpha muscles
And I'll see an incredible Geraldo ekstrom fantastic ladies we've got some great ladies on a team who ... you know it's such an inspirational survival is so they are living examples to survive is is all about spirit and ... the impulsivity
Um and actually some of them they have the guns the guy with the you know [laughter] or that if it was impressive to see as well
All right one more a lightning round here question Sam Winston on Twitter or say on our website says beer can you do your classic how like when you accomplish a big Clyde thanks that's from Sam

Thank you for taking my call my question for Barry is I I read somewhere if you live in the woods you can't or use any part of a pine tree
It's high income you know drink the water from the Congolese part but I Can't find the information to know what that is true or not
That is true that the the pine tree is one of the unsung heroes of the wilderness so much you can do everything you mentioned but also more you know the old days they used to use the reds and mix it with a charcoal from afar make glue outta that
Uh you know ... ... ... to ... uh there's so much to do I spend a lot of time is moving through forests just chewing on the chewing on the needles good victim and see you know I mean you think of all of the classic old Raul navy and the old days sending around the world
And ... and things ... and everyone was dying lack of intimacy and yet they were harvesting pine trees whether we're going to replace them moss and the ships but will they didn't realize that the the the pine trees could give them a lot more than just good new
Mosque some that ship it could give them a little bit of been saying it was it a hundred years later they figure these things outside
The pine tree is one of the many heroes of the outdoors and also super easy to make five with you get that ... has a lot of resident it will take a just put a little spot come to that and that's why you got to be so capital of sea with forest fires
Are highly flammable but uh uh one of the unsung heroes of the wild

But over the last five years employees share has risen by about a thousand dollars and on top of that more workers have to cover picker deductibles
People who work for small companies usually pay more for their coverage than those who work for bigger firms about a third of those who work for small business cover more than half their insurance premiums premiums also increase faster than inflation and workers earnings
So altogether that means that health insurance costs are taking up an ever larger share of people take home pay

I think that in some ways both are happening the Democrats like to say that the demographics our destiny and I think in large part that's right the problem for them and ... is that it's hard to bridal horse while you're writing it and the goal is for them to be able to try to invest now and
Harnessed these trends which I'm On paper would work for them but which in practice can be very difficult so
Definitely the case that the state is younger it has a changing suburbs that are much more demographically diverse than they were you've got a rising number of Latinos Asians especially in
The suburban counties which are breaking words the Democrats but like you say to there's also a unique moment in American politics where Donald Trump is uniquely unpopular in what is otherwise a really ruby red state so he has exposed this risk within the Republican Party in Texas
He is advocate for things like the border wall which has split many of the parties but also many of the voters
She has advocated for trade policies which potentially hurt rural Texas so there is still a lot of displeasure with Donald Trump even though his approval rating remains fairly high within the Republican Party
Okay so do your point though that if Democrats are looking at at at a demographic change in in pinning their hopes on that I Am seeing here that even though of course there's been a huge growth in the number of Latino residents in Texas that turnout among Latino voters has been consistently very low in the state
Yeah this is a big problem for Democrats and they need to be able to harness this population to things are at play I think number one it's certainly the case that the Latino vote is not uniform so it's clear that you're not going to be able to use the same message for each different Latino and that's something that
Is common but in taxes because of the diversity within the Latino community that certainly the case but it's also of course the case that I'm getting people to come vote for Democrats is not so easy there's about a sixty forty splits so Republicans are pretty popular in Latino community
Yeah and and you know as Ted Cruz a actually just check me on this year but I'm reading that Ted Cruz talks about you know sort of the silent majority of Republicans in Texas and that those are the are going to go to the polls in November actually just got about Fifteen seconds before the break [noise]

This is on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking about the race for Senate in Texas and that's the race between incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz
And congressman Beto O'Rourke it's a close race which is surprising a lot of people and it's why it's one of the reasons why it's maybe one of the most watched Senate races in the country right now ahead of the midterms
And we're joined today by Ashley Lopez she's senior reporter for K. U. T. she's joining us from Austin, Texas
Brandon running house joins us as well he's a political science professor at the University of Houston joining us from Houston as well and we want to know what you think I mean if you're if you're living in Texas what is this Senate race feel I feel like to you on the ground here what do you think about the fact that it's so close between
Crews and or ... and if you're living outside of Texas
Oh what is the Texas race mean to you in terms of what we might see politically when the midterms do roll around in November where at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk
Ashley Lopez I wanted to turn back to you here for a second because we were talking about the the really big growth in the Latino community in Texas here I mean the two thousand ten census showed that
Fifty one percent of the state's overall population is Hispanic or Latino and I'm seeing some numbers here
Two and a half million maybe to point seven million new Texans have come into the state between uh since two thousand ten and more than half of them are Latino so this is a ... a huge potential I don't want to call it a voting bloc ... not monolithic and rented was saying but the huge growth in I'm In the electorate there
Yeah and Latinos are set to become at least by twenty twenty two the biggest population group and the state so even if Democrats where to find a way to mobilize and and get loyalty among a large portion of that group
And they would argue I've I've heard that immigration because it's such a huge issue and the Trump Administration has had such unpopular policies here in Texas among Latinos that this would be like the right time to start doing that
I mean the other issue and and I heard this a lot from people who work in democratic politics who said that you know they see this opening to really um capture a larger part of the Latino group a
Latino voters is that they haven't really spent a lot of money here it takes a lot of money to register voters in Texas and voter registration drives and mobilization therefore it costs a lot of money and Texas
And progressive groups in third party groups that are interested in growing the Democratic party don't see a good investment here because it's been so Republican for so long so I mean it is true that this is this could be the future of the party it probably is the future of the party
I'm here in Texas but it it just you know it takes a lot more work than has yet Ian
I see a brand and running house so we can focus a whole hour multiple hours on the the political force that the growing Hispanic and Latino community in Texas
Or will form but I'm also seeing though that you're taking the conversation back to how Texans feel about president Donald Trump that in fact the president's ah um approval ratings in Texas are probably lower than the one might think some thirty nine percent yeah they're they're low
Recent polling has got more and about fifty percent um but that's really propped up by Republicans who support him to the tune of about eighty six
To Ninety percent so it's really driven by Republicans and this is not terribly surprising if there's a lot of unity within the party that number has grown because there was a time where there are definitely people who objected to Donald Trump and Democrats or Republicans who were favoring

As well unless you're a some of the ads that Texans are are listening and listening to you and and watching on their televisions
This is from a campaign ad from Beto O'Rourke it's one of his highlights one of his favorite talking points that he's visited every county in Texas to meet people across the state and he highlighted that fact in his first ad
Where [noise]

Enjoy she wants to actually burn churches margins
That's an ad from congressman Beto ... campaign and here's some sound from an ad that ripped the Senator Ted Cruz's campaign is running
Wild so
To Jim
Liberal
An ad there from Senator Ted Cruz Brandon running house that that Ted Cruz add ... ... talk to me a little bit about it because I think it speaks to some things that that a lot of Texans hold dear I mean the the right to gun ownership but the idea that
I'm a ... you may be liberalism can't be something that that represents the state of Texas
Yeah I thought you're going to say that this was something that holds the Texans hold dear because it's like country music but I think that's true as well
There's definitely a a synergy there and clearly the cruise campaign understands how to run in taxes they know that there is a certain size guys as you say for
Voting um to keep you know people's guns I'm keeping a fairly conservative philosophy and that's something that was successful for Ted Cruz so there's definitely enough Republican support
You in a midterm election that an organic
Kind of campaign that relies on priming Republicans through these conservative policies can work or work
Has to tangibly make up about a million votes and the just assure as God made little green apples Republicans will come to vote in mid term so the difficulty of trying to make up that with a campaign like Cruz's running which primes Republicans and primes conservatives it just makes it really difficult well
Let's take a call here Christine is calling from San Antonio Texas Christine you're on the air
Good morning I'm just calling and I made millennial voters and for the twenty sixteen election I had ...
And um I grew up in a conservative household my husband is conservative my whole family is but I've been very encourage and I and voting for that to work this election in November just because he looking beyond party line and I think that's so important
To 'em in this day and age right like you're either a Republican or Democrat
I Am a mother and I have two children and I think it's so important that I raised my children with positive values and I really appreciate what that don't work is going out there and I'm making it a point to meet people where they're at ... and um I really appreciate what he's doing
Christine touched a quick question before before you go yeah did you support Senator Cruz before this year yes I did go so what's changed their
Hand in that um I really ... whenever he was in the twenty the female action
And how you get like the talk that whenever he was talking to
'em President Trump and just how
Like how he stood against them and all of a sudden he decided oh I'm gonna be for him and then I don't know like President Trump tweets about Ted Cruz and and now he's supporting him I just think that you're a true um I think it's important that person's true colors and how he just
Was really again President Trump also nice for him like yeah that's that's not to show you something about sunny personality how I really appreciate how does your work is just um he is who he is
Of course the owners that you can ask you one more question I'm again I'm really glad you called in because you were talking about you you liked the fact that you you think that you feel that Beto O'Rourke supports women's rights I mean I just want to touch on one of these controversies that hit the ... campaign recently right to
A controversy over something he wrote in Nineteen Ninety One or a review for a Broadway musical of where he is in the review he wrote some I'm
An unkind things about the female actresses in that Broadway musical you know he wrote that there are only qualification seem to be their phenomenally large
Body parts or need to say it does that concern you
[noise] um I I don't know um [noise]
I Know he's apologized for it ... and um [noise] I I honestly I don't know I Know that I mean I Can't say that okay because that's not that it takes a lot for them making it all I just don't get that for a woman right
Yeah ... ... I I just wanted to I don't know is a perfectly finance or rock hard certainty sometimes is probably what gets us in trouble so so thank you so much for your call
Abby Livingston let me turn back to you on that Christine on the one hand must be a Republican Texas Republicans worst nightmare but on the other hand I mean she talked I Do wish talked about Senator Ted Cruz I keep coming back to this question about whether the challenger
This time around is Ted Cruz himself and that we wouldn't be having this conversation if there were more positive and likeable Republican senatorial candidate
I think it's also I think she I I've heard similar things ah from what she said um I think it's important to remember what a rough landing crews had in his presidential campaign and he was sort of
You know I mean it it's hard to um be against Trump I mean in retrospect endorsing Trump and the fall of twenty sixteen was probably the smart political move 'em but it did there there are women in Texas who have a lot of problems particularly when Trump made fun of cruises wife
I'm In ... in taxes that's just sort of a an ... I Would call these women a husband should stand up for his wife
And so it's it's a tough ... he was and I do think if this was John Cornyn we wouldn't be talking about this race or it would be much more um he would have a much bigger lead a corner and it's just a different presidents and Cruz is very very polarizing and so I think she underscores that
Okay well I Want to play one more piece of tape here uh this is something that went viral on social media and it has to do with an answer that Beto O'Rourke gave 'em when he took a question from an audience member at a campaign event and the question of believe came
From a military veteran and the veteran asked whether or not
NFL players taking a knee during the national anthem was disrespectful to members of the military in Oregon ... ended up giving quite a long answer was several minutes long um he began by saying my short answer is no I don't think it's disrespectful um and so we just want to play a portion of the remainder of what he said
Are frustrated frankly with people like me and the vision of public draws in power who have been unable to resolve this or bring justice for what has been drawing and this is all from January to happen in this country and so long ago I won't leave peacefully

Live from NPR News in Washington I core of a cold and President Trump is being criticized for mocking the woman who was alleged Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were in high school
Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins who is not decided whether to support Kavanaugh's nomination said Trump was quote just plain wrong when he made fun of Christine Blasey Ford and a political rally in Mississippi last night the crowd laughed and clapped
NPR's Kelsey Snell says GOP leaders are seeking Collins support
Republican leaders are still trying to convince undecided Republicans and even some Democrats
To vote for Kavanaugh and this kind of conversation that kind of the exact opposite of what they're trying to kill the president has made clear that he takes this personally that he and he had a personal connection with allegations that he says what he believes to be false allegations of sexual misconduct
And that is playing a role in the way that he's responding to all of that
NPR's Kelsey Snell in Indonesia time is running out for earthquake and tsunami victims still buried under rebel Indonesian disaster officials have increased the death toll to more than fourteen hundred people Michael Sullivan reports on the rescue efforts

And so my goal when working with patience is to help 'em solve and or reduce the level of obesity to mitigate some of those problems I mean
As as Michael pointed out he talk to patients who they would go in for an earring though and the doctor would end up talking to them about their weight and it didn't seem like it made any sense or doctors
Wrong or right to do that it's important for patients to be aware of obesity being ...
The disease that can be treated I think that we do have treatments that aren't utilized because we are not educated on how to utilize these treatments either in medical school and residency on and so that their their treatments available but often we aren't taught how to use those in how to approach patients I'm In a fashion that that's for them
Okay well Dr for team including Stanford joins us today she's professor at Harvard Harvard Medical school and an obesity

This is on point I'm making a trucker Bertie we're talking this hour about maybe rethinking how we approach issues of being overweight and obesity in America
And we are joined today by Michael hubs cheese or staff writer Huffington Post and he's author of an article titled everything you know about obesity is wrong or there's a link to it at our website on point radio dot org
Dr ... Stanford joins us as well she's an obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General hospital weight center and she's with us
In our own point studio here in Boston now Michael before the break you were sort of go you gave us the top three bullet points of the
Aspects of obesity that you felt that we kind of collectively misunderstand let's dig into some of those a little bit more talk to me about the one where you you you said wait and health are not perfect sending them but we oftentimes feel as if they are with people who are struggling with their weight what do you mean
Oh well first of all I Want to say Hi to team up because I actually visited her clinic as part of writing this article about a year ago I was like oh this is how I was like we hung out together and I know it was really fun ask 'em
And I think I mean as you know there's there's a lot of debate in the medical community about what exactly metabolic healthy obesity means right and then some studies find that there's a small percentage
Of fat people would metabolic healthy obesity and some studies find a much larger percentage and I actually you know for team of feel free to disagree with me but I feel like it doesn't actually matter that we know how
Difficult weight is to lose and we know how harmful it is the shame people for their weight and so if there are big health effects of obesity
I'm not sure that it really helps for you know a neurologist to tell somebody you have to lose forty pounds before I treat your migraines I mean I think for people that do want to lose weight I think it's really important
You know I mean I think it's fine to talk with a health risk in the same way you know I'm a gay man
Their health risk associated with gay people gay people are more likely to use illegal drugs they're more likely to have unsafe sex it's perfectly fine for my doctor to talk to me about those things but he needs to talk to me about those things in a
Uh but but we need everyone out there listening to do their part if everyone out there right now became a sustaining member of WB you are done we might need to do you know we might not need these pledge drives at all because we would know that we had ongoing support from the community and that we can provide ongoing news in coverage in return

Is on point I'm making a chocolate bar to we're talking about which efforts or maybe a call to rethink how we think about the obesity epidemic in America I'm joined today by Michael Hobbs
He's a staff writer at Huffington Post and he wrote an article called everything you know about obesity is wrong and also with us is Dr ... Stanford she's the obesity she's an obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General hospital
And Dr Stanford and Michael so many colors I just want to let people have their say let's go to Seth who's calling from Johnson
Hi thanks for taking my call
'em so I just come on to talk about something the Michael brought up near the beginning of the food and we talked about the way that his mom was treated kind of um by her friends and then kind of her behavior home um I think it's really interesting because I've struggled with my weight my entire life
Um but I've never really what my wait hold me back it always seems to be the prejudice reaction
I'm kind of the stigma and things like that but I get from other people
Um that really hold me back so Johnson City Tennessee this huge area outdoors activities or giant um
So I'm always very active however there have been several times in my entire life where I just don't get included and thing because people think that my weight will hold them back uh-huh I'm so it's kind of interesting but it doesn't just affect me but it also affects my relationship on a broad
Yeah well ... thank you for your call a and thank you for sharing your story I Want to get Cindy in here who's calling from Charlotte North Carolina Cindy you're on the air
Hi thank you I got to play one of about the definition of obesity I Am a very low killer very active by well and when I get on the scale I Am airports obese
So it ... the very definition of a case they will tell us enough to fail and like high
Right now the em I write
It that that's that's that's one point the most important one I think it's that I never hear anyone talk about what is underlying the eating behavior so you know as a society we treat symptoms
Not pauses I Know so many very obese are at absolute caretakers their school a foster kids they're carrying for everybody no time for them so they ... themselves ... hit the food that you
Love so close and personal heretic and I never hear not walk with I don't talk about that
Maybe a solution for obesity is treating the beneath the people in the
Senate is Cindy let me just jump in here thank you for your call because doctors Stanford go ahead yeah so am I said you have an address few appoints thanks so much for calling you a number one I'm you talked about the mind which is what the World Health organization uses for obesity and I would say definitely there are some some challenges with that I can tell you
That with each patient that I see I pay attention to the weight
And then how can I pay very close attention to wait distribution so central to possibly mean weight that's carrying that mid section
Is most concerned because that does predisposed patients to um heart disease and other illnesses such as fatty liver so I Would say that if for someone like yourself who seems to be a more muscular where it would be a mind would not be necessarily the best criteria
I Would pay attention to that we circumference targeting a waste of comforts of thirty five inches or less than we do have significant study's based upon ATP three guidelines that support that
I'm with regards to the psychology I'm actually if you look at um doctor ... I'm Sorry Michel hops article he specifically did interview psychologist Dr ...
From them gee each week center was interviewed and we do have all of our patients and spend time with the psychologist delving two issues um such as um what is the psychology behind 'em they're eating behaviors but not just their eating behaviors because of course that's the accusatory part I'm understanding what has been their struggles surrounding weight during the course of their life
So I Do think that's a very important piece we have several psychologist like doctors all working on this and so um I Would I Would say that we do pay attention to that and I think Michael hops to do a good job by bringing those voices into the army so I Want to switch you can
Switch gears here for a second um and and take a step back and Michael I'll bring you in back in here for this as well
Because I'm Dr Stanford I just I heard you a couple of times in this conversation you know call ... especially extreme obesity and disease state implying that it's not a normal state now for some people are sort of a higher than average weighed might be their normal sort of bodies that point for their weight
But fifty years ago sixty years ago we didn't we didn't see the rates of overweight or obese American anywhere where near what we have now so I mean I don't I don't think anyone's gonna say that
No the this epidemic that we're seeing is is normal right like ... and ... and so who [noise] this is such a ... person question but I just want to get your field for an ... and Michael you too [noise]
Is it the food supply I mean where did this come from is it a mix of of the food that we're eating and genetic predispositions or something because it does feel like it's kind of happened overnight absolutely I think
This is I'm really we are in an OB so Jenike environment so I call it the perfect storm
Well we have is we have had a change in our food quality we've had a change in our physical activity we've had a change in the quality in duration of our sleep we've had a change in circadian rhythm um disturbances what I mean by that is that we are rewarded with being a
And talk to our colleagues in India when we're supposed to be sleep here in the United states would tell you that maternity is terrible for our house [laughter] and I say that not not jokingly right if you're talking about sleep and and physical activity and food and especially for people who you know a lower income getting that high quality food Michael you pointed this out it's like eight times more expensive
Than the food that they could get at the at the corner bodega
[noise] yeah I mean you know four percent of our agricultural subsidies go to fruits and vegetables and when we talk to people about this kind of off brand advice about oh eat less and exercise more
But as soon as that people have the time to exercise and that their neighborhood has sidewalks and parks where they can go jogging and they don't have two kids
And two jobs and a lot of people do and a lot of people you know if you're spending food stamps what are you going to spend your food stamps on you're not going to buy broccoli which is wildly expensive and doesn't feed your kids you're going to get something really cheap and really easy and frozen in process and whatever else
And that's I I don't think it's fair to blame people for that I think we have we we tend to blame our choices without blaming our options and our options have profoundly changed since Nineteen eighty and the choices that we make with in those options
I don't think there's blaming kind of frame for that really helps very much when it's simply impossible or too expensive for most people to do the things we're always barking at them
To do and so the reason why I wanted to bring this up to up to Stanford is because we were talking about rethinking how we approach obesity and um
Even in that context this conversation is it's not bad but I felt this conversation being pulled into sort of um you know ... individual responsibility as things that can be done in the clinicians office et cetera but in order to really get a handle this epidemic we have to look way outside
Of that out I mean we have to go outside the box we need to bring together persons and healthcare persons in that our policymakers
Um physical activity facility schools et cetera I always talk about bringing together all of the people and that would really be everyone to the table to make this discussion really shift in a in a direction where we actually
Had any dead on obesity rates in both a pediatric an adult population and and I think what we've done um with regards to this epidemic his work entirely in silos medicine works by itself public health worse by itself um we come up with food labeling assuming that that's going to lead to change and obesity rate and we've seen none of that happened look at food deserts and
Oh if we get rid of food deserts that's going to change everything no we need to be coming together making these decisions together and really in order to make a shift in a way that's positive for the U.S and for the world
Well let's get another call in here arenas calling from Providence Rhode Island Reno you're on the air
Thank you for taking my call um I Am a primary care doctor and Johnston Rhode Island just outside of Providence and um

From WVU or Boston and NPR I'm making the upper body and this is on point the last few years have been anything but politics as usual and the trend continues as it is here in Texas of all places now Texas is deep deep red it hasn't as a democratic senator to Washington since Nineteen Ninety three
But this year there's a competitive Senate race in the Lone Star state
In one corner incumbent Republican Ted Cruz
They want us to be like California [noise]
Why do as well and that
And then the other corner democratic congressman Beto O'Rourke they don't want voting ... corporations and political action committee in Russia wants to go to work to get some money now the polls have work within single digits of cruise making at one of the most watched Senate contest in the nation so
This hour on point we'll take a close look at the Texas Senate race and what it indicates for the midterms and you can join if if you live in Texas what Kennedy are you supporting which one are you supporting and why
And even if you don't what do you think the cruise O'Rourke raise tells us about American politics in two thousand Eighteen we're one eight hundred for two three eight to five fine that's eight hundred for two three talk
You can also join us anytime it on point radio dot org or Twitter and Facebook and on point radio will joining me first today from Austin, Texas is Ashley Lopez she's senior reporter for K. U. T. we've got links to her latest stories on the Texas Senate race at one point radio dot org Ashley Lopez welcome to the program
The magna so first of all like well why do some of the basics here for people who aren't as familiar with the Texas Senate races obsessive politics watchers might be I mean how close is the race right now between a Senator Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke if you ask
Some experts they say it's a toss up pretty much um all the polls have had cruise with a slight edge but you know as the election has gotten closer
Um the polls have got the two candidates closer which is surprising a lot of people because as you mentioned this is not a swing state so a Sweeney election especially for mid term is it's ... it's just really surprising in Texas so a toss up and has it been like that consistently for the past couple of months or is is it narrowing or or widening
Well in the beginning it seemed like this was you know get not going to be a ... a race at all I mean when that over at first and now he's a congressman by the way in El Paso
When he first announced everyone's like you know this is a really interesting candidate a lot of people like him on he's you know really interested in working with you know that Republicans in Congress he's well known for being friends with will hurt who's a Republican in Congress so that was kind of a thing as she was
Really a bipartisan friendly guy um but you know they didn't think that a ton of money would flood flood into Texas where this race so you know it was going to seem like a long shot for better work but um it's only in the past couple of months that it seems like this race is getting closer than anyone expected okay and so

Room at
This point I'm making to shock her body we're talking about the race for Senate in Texas and that's the race between incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz
And congressman Beto O'Rourke it's a close race which is surprising a lot of people and it's why it's one of the reasons why it's maybe one of the most watched Senate races in the country right now ahead of the midterms
And we are joined today by Ashley Lopez she's a senior reporter for K. U. T. she's joining us from Austin, Texas Brandon running house joins us as well he's a political
Joining us from Houston as well and we want to know what you think I mean if you're if you're living in Texas what is this Senate race feel like to feel like to you on the ground here what do you think about the fact that it's so close between crews and or ... and if you're living outside of Texas
Oh what is the Texas race means to you in terms of what we might see politically when the midterms do roll around in November we're at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk
Ashley Lopez learned to turn back to you here for a second because we were talking about the the really big growth in the Latino community in Texas here I mean the two thousand ten census showed that
Fifty one percent of the state's overall population is Hispanic or Latino and I'm seeing some numbers here two and a half million maybe to point seven million new Texans have come into the state between uh since two thousand ten and more than half of them are Latino so this is a ... a huge potential I don't want to call it a voting bloc that are ... not monolithic
As rented was saying but the huge growth in I'm In the electorate there
Yeah and look you know there are set to become at least by twenty twenty two the biggest population group and the state so even if Democrats where to find a way to mobilize and and get loyalty among a large portion of that group
And they would argue I've I've heard that immigration because it's such a huge issue and the Trump Administration has had such unpopular policies here in Texas among Latinos that this would be like the right time to start doing that
I mean the other issue and and I heard this a lot from people who work in democratic politics who say that you know they see this opening to really um capture a larger part of the Latino group
A Latino voters is that
They haven't really spent a lot of money here it takes a lot of money to register voters in Texas and voter registration drives and mobilization therefore costs a lot of money in Texas
And progressive groups in third party groups that are interested in growing the Democratic party don't see a good investment here because it's been so Republican for so long so I mean it is true that this is this could be the future of the party it probably is the future of the party
I'm here in Texas but it it just you know it takes a lot more work done has yet Ian I see
A brand and running house so we can focus and a whole hour multiple hours on the the political force that the growing Hispanic and Latino community in Texas
Or will form but I'm also seeing though that you're taking the conversation back to how Texans feel about president Donald Trump that in fact the president's
Ah um approval ratings in Texas are probably lower than the one might think some thirty nine percent
Yeah they're they're low overall um recent polling has gotten more and about fifty percent um but that's really propped up by Republicans who support him to the tune of about eighty six
To nine to ... percent so it's really driven by Republicans and this is not terribly surprising if there's
A lot of unity within the party that number has grown because there was a time where there are definitely people who objected to Donald Trump and Democrats or Republicans who were favoring Ted Cruz and so now we've kind of morphed into one bigger sort of
More continuous unit for Republicans that support Donald Trump out there's a lot of friction so
I see so so is there another group of voters that we should be talking about here as potentially influential in this race I mean white suburban white women or women in general
Yeah I think that the suburban white women are going to be the biggest swing vote in this election that's really gonna what's probably drive any kinds of success that will walk fines and suburbs which is going to have a reciprocal effect of affecting some of the challenges the congressional level many of whom have
A really harness this vote and could potentially do well but I think if we're talking about changing demographics that we could talk about younger voters who are energized in significant ways in this election so that number breaks ... considerably in favor of better work
They don't treat typically vote in the same numbers that we see for people who are over forty but it is the case that those numbers are rising and just as an aside to I think that the number of Asian voters is increasing in some of the big suburbs in
These big Texas counties you've got the number of Asians far outpacing the actual rows of any other sub racial group and as a result you've got them potentially being of our luck poor partner
Places like forbidden county here outside of Harris County outside of Houston are booming and that really could spell another level of success the Democrats might find so
Ashley Lopez that makes it seem as if turnout is going to be absolutely everything in in this race in November
Well it's always the wild card and elections in Texas I'm a big reason you know Democrats are always say a big reason that Texas has read is not because it's a conservative state it's because it's a non voting state
So if you get all these populations who don't usually vote that could change what Texas looks like if you changed the electorate you can change who gets elected so that's always the big question and especially during the mid term
I mean this is a weird mid term because you know everyone's kind of excited and and and
Democrats aren't likely to vote during the term so if if that is different this year like this could look different than most midterms now so I'm seeing
For example Beto O'Rourke um
Uh a couple of Saturdays ago is quoted as having said our contention is that if no one's ever showing up
And listen to you talking to to to voters
Or or potential voters and incorporated your story into why they're campaigning and the expectations were setting for one another then I wouldn't expect you to vote either so it was he hoping to draw out people who haven't bothered or haven't seen a reason to vote before I mean that's the that's the tactics that we've seen in other places we saw that
In New York with Alexandria Ocasio Cortez for example
Like what he's betting on yeah go ahead written in ...
Oh sorry I was gonna say yeah it's definitely the case like actually said that the turnout in ... in mid term years you're talking about
Probably on the order of about forty percent which is extremely low now I think we'll have a turnout probably spike a little bit in this election because you definitely have the energy that we've seen 'em and so that's something that would definitely I think produced some democratic gains but you
Still have about two and a half million on register Texans who could otherwise register the Latino population is only registered to vote at about forty forty four percent and that number is about eighty percent for Anglo so there's still some fundamental voting demographics and make it really difficult for Democrats to win statewide
Okay well I Want to listen to a little bit more from the candidates themselves and by the way I should note that we definitely reached out to Senator Ted Cruz's campaign and to Congress and better or worse campaign as well invited them or or one of the represent their representatives to join us today
Aerobics campaign declined our request and senator Cruz's campaign never responded to our class but we do our due diligence on that part
But let's hear from the senator anyway this is from the uh the Senate debate that they had on September twenty second and Senator Ted Cruz was asked about his contentious relationship with President Donald Trump especially the relationship they had during the twenty sixteen the election and here's what Senator Ted Cruz said
I have worked hand in hand with the president
On substance and we have delivered remarkable victories the biggest tax cut of a generation we've seen for a million new jobs created since Trump was elected and we and we cut taxes and cut regulations we're seeing record low unemployment Texans lives are better so yes I could have chosen
To make it about myself to be selfish and say you know what my feelings are hurt so I'm going to take my marbles and go home but I think that would have been not doing the job I was elected to
The Senator Ted Cruz on September twenty second let's take a call here Dan is calling from San Antonio you're on the air Dan
Hi thanks for taking my call 'em I wanted to say that
Well there's a lot of work and I know don't have all that much time but I did want to say that about two or gives me and my family's in ... that we haven't felt love generation or my parents would say like John F. Kennedy or the Kennedy family inspiring us to to have some hope
Because living in this so called red state wakes us cringe every time I hear that because we were starch blue family and everyone I Know just about is
A at least inside their county here in San Antonio I'm however we are very diverse state and it's all good and like the message that list for years about
Hope and moving forward whether you're a Republican Democrat independent because we're so sick of the bigotry and hateful comes from Mr Trump will do you see and that's not what we're here in San Antonio in Texas and probably most of American people are just that the message

I'm making a chocolate bar the we're talking about the Senate race in Texas between Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke and I'm joined today by Ashley Lopez Brandon rotting house and Abby Livingston
As well unless you're a some of the ads that Texans are are listening and listening to end and watching on their televisions
This is from a campaign ad from Beto O'Rourke it's one of his highlights one of his favorite talking points that he's visited every county in Texas to meet people across the state and he highlighted that fact in his first ad
We weren't
Dollars off
The Georgetown wants to actually burn churches mortgage
That's an ad from congressman Beto ... campaign and here's some sound from an ad that ripped the Senator Ted Cruz's campaign is running
To jail
Again I'm really glad you called in because you were talking about you you liked the fact that ah you you you think that you feel that Beto O'Rourke supports women's rights I mean I just want to touch on one of these controversies that hit the campaign recently right to
A controversy over something he wrote in Nineteen Ninety One or a review for a Broadway musical of where he is in the review he wrote some I'm
An unkind things about the female actresses in that Broadway musical you know he wrote that there are only qualifications seemed to be their phenomenally large
Body parts or need to say it does that concern you
Um I I don't know um [noise] I Know he's apologized for it ... and um I I honestly I don't know I Know that
I mean I Can't say that okay because that's not that it takes a lot for some Mickey apologize but just don't get that for a woman's right yeah ... ... I I just want to say I
Don't know is a perfectly finance or rock hard certainty sometimes is probably what gets us in trouble so who thank you so much for your call Abby Livingston let me turn back to you on that Christine on the one hand must be a Republican Texas Republicans worst nightmare but on the other hand I mean she talked to the we talked about Senator Ted Cruz I keep coming back to this question about whether the challenger
This time around is Ted Cruz himself and that we wouldn't be having this conversation if there were more
Positive and likeable Republican senatorial candidate
I think it's also I think she I I've heard similar things ah from what she said um I think it's important to remember what a rough landing crews had in his presidential campaign and he was sort of
You know I mean it it's hard to um be against Trump I mean in in retrospect endorsing Trump and the fall of twenty sixteen was probably the smart political move 'em but it did there there are women in Texas who have a lot of problems particularly when Trump made fun of cruises wife
I'm In ... and taxes that's just sort of a an ... I Would call these women has been should stand up for his wife
And so it's it's a tough conundrum humid than I Do think if this is John Cornyn we wouldn't be talking about this race or it would be much more um he would have a much bigger lead a corner and it's just a a different presidents and Cruz is very very polarizing and so I think she underscores that
Okay well I Want to play one more piece of tape here uh this is something that went viral on social media and um it has to do with an answer that Beto O'Rourke gave 'em when he took a question from an audience member at a campaign event and the question of believe came
A from a military veteran and the veteran asked whether or not
NFL players taking a knee during the national anthem was disrespectful to members of the military and are working to ended up giving quite a long answer was several minutes long um he began by saying my short answer is no I don't think it's disrespectful um and so we just want to play a portion of the remainder of what he said
Are frustrated friendly with people like me and those visions of public trust in power who have been unable to resolve is or bring justice for what has been drawing and this is all from drip drip drip of in this country and from Long Island we peacefully
While we argue this country are watching these games they take on the street or changes that are good for this problem to ensure that we regard as why they're doing it and I can think of nothing more American than some people [noise]

Actually Lopez or as I mentioned that went viral on social media which may or may not have significant meaning but how did that go over in Texas well
I mean if you look at the black vote in Texas I Would say it went over really well specifically among black voters yeah something like Ninety seven percent approval according to like one latest poll on that one might be a little high but it it's not unlike most polls that have come out
Um you know conservatives this is red meat for them this is something that Ted Cruz had been talking about um the NFL or in the the protest during the national anthem he's been talking about his rallies
Because it really frustrates conservative and they see this as like disrespectful to the flag into veteran so you know if you look at like democratic base voters this is something that they are so excited to hear you know a Democrat
I'm standing up for racial injustice in their eyes and then on the on the other side you know conservative voters you know this is a polarizing issue so conservative voters see this very differently and are very frustrated by this
Brenda running house I mean I think ... outside of Texas political watchers are saying that perhaps this is the way better or talks about these issues are is one of the reasons why he's getting so much traction there that it's not

President Trump says the FBI should do a comprehensive investigation into the allegations surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh but as NPR's Mara Liasson reports he also says Senate Republican should determine the scope of that investigation

American dairy farmers say they are please a new trade deal that some so more milk and cheese to Canada but as NPR's Dan Charles reports that changes not expected to make a big difference

Some WVU are Boston and NPR I'm making a chocolate party and this is on point ten years after the two thousand the financial crisis it's hard now to remember that as financial institutions failed or were on the brink there were scenes in American cities akin to what you'd expect to see during a bank run in a developing country
There are people who need money to pay their bills I mean there's one guy that's been here for eleven thirty last night I been here since five thirty this morning
We'll that was July two thousand eight and the voices of people waiting in line outside of IndyMac uh thirty two billion dollar California bank taken over by the FDIC the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had taken over just three banks in two thousand seven
But by two thousand ten that number had jumped to more than three hundred twenty banks that held more than six hundred and forty billion dollars in assets that may be FDIC
One of the most influential agencies in the government's recovery effort alongside the Federal Reserve and the U.S treasury the woman running the FDIC at the time she will bear the Kansas Republican was appointed to the post in June two thousand six by President George W. Bush she served as FDIC chief for five years until two thousand eleven
Will a decade after the financial crisis what does she live bears the now the FDIC was created in Nineteen thirty three to restore public confidence in the nation's financial system in two thousand Eighteen is the system deserving of that trust
This hour on point Sheila bear bailouts and the future of the American financial system and she joins us now from Washington Welcome to on point thank you thank you for having me
Well you know I Know a from reading about your career that you first started paying attention to subprime mortgages back in two thousand one and two thousand two
But I but I see here that it was in two thousand was six as soon as you came on board at FDIC did you actually asked uh your colleagues to buy a database of subprime loans from a company called lone performance [laughter] what'd
You say yes I'd been in academia for several years and had not been really working in the mortgage area and a bit retained an interest in it and when I got back
The staff or as the FDIC were were already on top of this they're worried about it but we couldn't really see what was going on because the these mortgages are being secured ties all of our reporting systems were geared towards
Assets aid in this case loans are actually on the banks books and in these for mostly we're not even being originated by banks are the big banks were providing some support to the non bank originator is here we're doing this and helping them package them insecurities
And sell them off so this was data that showed those original mortgages then ...
It it shows the underlying mortgages ... trust and
And so when you took a look and when your colleagues at FDA if he took a look I mean what did you see where are you
Concerned yes we were [laughter] stoppage [laughter] I couldn't believe what I saw oh my gosh so
As you noted in your introductory remarks are my history of this goes back to the early ... thousands where we're seeing this kind of abuses of lending but it was really ... it was a marginal you know players in the mortgage industry that we're doing it and they were targeting

This is on point I'm making a talk of already we're talking today with Sheila ... she was the head of the FDIC from two thousand six to two thousand eleven
And we're talking about the role that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation played in a the financial crisis and getting the nation out of it and what she ... now when she looks across the financial system or whether she sees a healthy system or not and she lived there joins us from Washington today
A Sheila there's a story that you tell in your two thousand twelve book I think bull by the horns if that's the story that the very beginning of the book and it's just
It's so telling us how hoping you could read if you could share it once again with us and it's it's a story about um how you in two thousand eight in October two thousand eight you attend is very key meeting at the treasury with Hank Paulson
And I believe what a seven of the top CEOs of the biggest financial institutions in America
Right yeah well that was um [noise] that was quite
A quite a meeting it was false and they called it I was their members heirs have gotten there was there the head of the other banking regulators or were there and um the purpose
Of the beating was basically for us to tell the banks that uh we were going to take some interventions and that we wanted them all to participate there is this the there was a you know the ... the court center piece of it was the tarp capital investment yet are going to
Put under the veins of dollars into a new capital into these banks or the FBI she was gonna start within limits and for the we're going to start a year and she uh the debt that they needed to issue to roll expiring debt we had because the markets were seized up and they were having hard time refinancing their own debt
And then the fed had trillions of dollars of learning disabilities that they they put into place and so it was ... it was basically to explain those new programs and is
That they had to take the ... well yeah you know and as I say that I think a lot of that
Was a was designed to cover up the problems the weaker banks like city I think most of them at all but most of them probably could've bumble through but show we didn't want to test that and ah and also there was a lot of fear that if you just singled out certain banks for
Assistance you are going to make them look bad and you know exacerbate their problems right so the that was the reasoning
Why I kind of just read a paragraph from from from the book because it's so telling about
I think that the the state of the financial system that maybe ... many Americans just weren't aware of before two thousand eight you say again this is a meeting of Monday October thirteenth he doesn't eat you say nine men student milling around in the room men I should know right nine men
Parental really ... really some and thereby treasury secretary Henry Paulson collectively they headed financial institutions representing about nine trillion dollars in assets or Seventy percent of the U.S financial system and then you're right I Would be damned if I Would let them see me shaking
[laughter] yeah that's right [laughter] well I Do think you know there was this um [noise] there was even balance of power and and I still think we suffer from it
That uh you know who works for ... does does it ever worked for the banks are you know or did just that the banks the banks and the safety net the get FDIC Deposit Insurance and fed access and all that
Do they have public obligations and do you know or are they a a whole a beholden to government to fulfill those obligations and and abide by the regulatory process we have in place for them because we know that all of these so government supports like Deposit Insurance can can incentivize a risk taking and too big to fail
Just really doubles down on that so yeah I I did not I didn't want there to many question about the balance of power
And it was a turning it wasn't you know and I certainly didn't want look up look like I was the weak link so uh you know I think that some of them told me they're afraid of me I don't know if there that's a joke
[laughter] I Can't I Can't
Be little directed times I Will be the first to admit that but I I Do think that it was important for the government to be the person in charge and well I mean I just
I I'm I Am so the numbers of looking at the ... the sentence written on the piece of paper in front of me it's still shocks me
Nine trillion dollars and edit Seventy percent of the U.S financial system represented by the decisions made by these nine men I mean isn't that that is the perfect summation of the problem of too big to fail and two interconnected to feel that we had well
It it it is and whether we fix said I don't know and uh I certainly the system is more resilient now but you know I I'm very concerned about all this recent rhetoric
And Tim Geithner obviously you know I've had our disagreements in and their policy disagreements but here's another one 'cause his emphasis right now is all about expanding the government's bailout tools you know based on the assumption that we're going to have another cycle we're going to have another financial system that's going to need government help and so we need
More bailout tools and I think that's ...
System we still have that we don't want to save that system that you would like banks go down now oh well we we have something called title to and which we did not have a ... in two thousand eight and yes
That allows regulators the FDIC working with the treasury and the fed
To you know put a bag into a resolution process to break it up you know keep his bad assets out impose the losses on the shareholders and the and secured creditors which is where the losses should be and where the losses are also if you go through a traditional bankruptcy
To fire managers to fire board members to recapitalize the bank you know and and you're bringing new investors new management to and and in return they healthy parts of the bag back to the private sector so yes that is all that is basically what you do it a bankruptcy this is a government run bankruptcy process or ... unique
Things about large financial institutions that make traditional bankruptcy a difficult to you that's a tool we didn't have been to them we have now the regulators need to be willing to use it and importantly signal now remind them markets that this this is going to be the new paradigm this is the due process not bailouts but accountability
Wills are going to ask you can you know of so many questions to live there because I I I'm just wondering outlook I I I don't want to come across as some like crazy anti capitalist has not ... not I'm not that at all but some people might be wondering why wait why even wait for the next financial crisis
I mean as long as the banks are too big already won a breeder huh well
Uh there are people who have that view and I can understand that view and ah I don't think there's a political will ah in Washington to do that I mean and this is bipartisan unfortunately you see
Legislation going through now the reduced uh three the largest banks we have reduced their capital by twenty percent this uh this bill that just passed
And in that kind of signal the fed to weaken some of the capital rules and the stress testing
Requirements and now you've got Republicans I'm ashamed to say 'cause I'm a Republican and I thought ... you know Republicans are market oriented a lot of Republicans trying to pressure the fed to reduce capital even more so that's a political environment you know big banks are back in charge [laughter]
That's a political environment in DC right now I don't see that there's any political will to break them up or do anything else and and my fear is is that we're going to have to have another disaster before
They finally happens but yeah I mean if they needed a bailout again I think ... our democracy cannot survive that and if they think
Sedated and again she lived her I said I don't our democracy could not survive another round of bailouts it just you can't look what look what happened you know people who discount the role of the two thousand eight crisis
And and even you know the eight million a homes lost nine million jobs lost
You know that that the terrible hit to the public purse
Still people struggling in lower middle income families um that started with the crisis and that some of that is still remnants of the crisis in ... and ... and I think that's a lot of what if he's in the discontent we have right now so to suggest that we're going to bail out together that's going to be the new paradigm that
We don't really need to bother regulation trying to prevent crises we just need to be repaired with more taxpayer bailout tools I don't think democracy is going to tolerate that
Well you know uh so okay that's quite a bracing thing that you said and yet I I've been speaking with you and other people who were very key to the uh in the two thousand two thousand nine period any financial observer most people say we probably will have another crisis knows how to square with our democracy yeah well
It's a if it well like I said you're hearing different he's in different people and I'm not I don't know that we're going to have another crisis I I I think we ... what I think we should be doing now that we are towards the end of the cycle
We should be preparing for the next downturn and economic cycle if banks have enough capital unstable funding to continue functioning
When the economy turns you know and their credit losses go out that's what happens in a downturn if they have or if they are resilient to continue functioning and continue lending we will have a downturn we will not have a crisis we will not have a deep recession it's all about how we see the financial system is which is why now

Does his own point I'm making Tucker birdie okay here's a pop quiz for you how many American Soldiers are in Syria today
The answer around two thousand and why are they they're well to fight ISIS of course but that mission could be changing last week's national security adviser John Bolton said us troops will not leave Syria quote as long as Iranian troops are outside
And he and proxies and militias end quote
Well that's a sharp departure from the military's current mission and for the first time it ties us goals in Syria directly to countering Iran
So listeners what do you think if you applauded when President Trump vowed to bring American troops home do you think we need to stay in Syria to take on Iran now we're one eight hundred for two three to five five is eight hundred for two three talk
Well joining me now from Beirut, Lebanon is Liz Sly Beirut bureau chief for the Washington Post lose it's good to have you
Thank you for having me also with us from Tyson's corner Virginia is ... rent for he is a reporter for the military times Kyle welcome to you hey thanks for having me
All right so let me start with you I mean you wrote about uh about what John Bolton said in this article for military times by the we've got a link to it at one point radio dot org how big of a shift in rhetoric is is regarding the U.S mission in Syria
[noise] it seems to be kind of a more over um way to say that the
Prior to U.S policy goals which were to uh mainly just put us troops in the eastern theory in order to fight ISIS is being being expanded
So the Pentagon has a readily acknowledged a Pentagon officials up to and including secretary of defense Mattis that us troops are only fighting ISIS
However they do play a secondary benefit of balancing against Iranian influence in the country a boat and kind of came out and was way more overt in saying that that is the primary goal countering Iran a hence the condition for us to withdraw is ah the withdrawal of Iranian forces
So that's a changing mission or an expanding of like the mission parameters that we used
... so I'm seeing here that James Jeffrey ... uh the state department special representative for Syria a following John ... comments said that the United states would maintain a presence in Syria possibly including an extended military mission
Again until Iran withdraws us soldiers in military forces it commands and Jeffrey told reporters on Thursday that the president wants us in Syria until that and the other conditions are met
A but but Kyle I mean the authorization for use of military force that the U.S is operating on in Syria right now those date back to Afghanistan and Iraq right there there are counterterrorism authorizations
Yeah well there's one from two thousand and one which covers al Qaida and its affiliates and those who hire harbored al ... in response to the nine eleven terror attacks and then there's one from two thousand two against Iraq and so neither of those really cover the Iranian mission um and so I think that
The way that if they were to continue having a U.S presence in eastern Syria they would try to quote it by saying that us troops are conducting counter ISIS missions primarily and um they would just continue to say well you know it also balances against Iran such as the secondary benefit
Well Liz Sly you're joining us here from Beirut I mean let me ask you how is uh this new language or or I may be to use ... raise ... description of it more overt language from the Trump Administration how's that going over in the region
[noise] well
I think people in the thing that the price by the second coming out you can't you learned that we've seen that yet because as you remember a few months ago um ... we're going to be going home very very soon and was actually an expectation that they would be caught on by the end of the year
And most of the regional palate I'm invoking Sherry I checked she Russia Jackie I'm no everyone else in the neighborhood has been expecting he likes to go and they can practically to punish the ... the idea that that actually going to be getting out and gets ... definitely puts them back like
In the picture when it comes to negotiate an end to the Syrian more and I think it should be on our Web that she'll go and eat at the moment
Okay well let's hear a little bit more ah from what a national security adviser John Bolton said in his ramping up of the anti Iran rhetoric
On ... on Monday again he said we're not going to leave Syria as long as Iranian troops are outside of Iranian borders and then on Tuesday he went even further
If you cross us our allies are our partners you harm our citizens if you continue to lie cheat and deceive yes there will indeed be held up to
Well the very next day on Wednesday of less meat week some lawmakers did question of the U.S is military role in Syria and this expansion of the military objective they question Robert ... assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs
And here you are going to hear Massachusetts democratic congressman Seth Moulton pressing came to get more specific about uh Iran and Syria and how that correlates with the mission and fighting ISIS the problem is that national security advisor
You've indefinite military presence in Syria until Iran withdraws for its forces that to me sounds like we're sending our military to Syria to counter Iran
Especially because their withdrawal is apparently dependent on actions of wrong not actions of ISIS or the defeat of ISIS
... let me ask you about this because it seems as if what Congress and molten is saying is that if indeed this is why the U.S will be sending troops to Syria and the future that it may be illegal because he they do not have congressional authorization for that
[laughter] yeah so he's basically making the argument that even if I'm us troops are conducting active operations against Iranian forces or Iranian proxy forces the fact that they're
In the region with the mission to balance against those forces or restrict those forces freedom maneuver through eastern Syria means that they are I'm conducting a military operation and therefore the Pentagon the White House needs to come to Congress and ask for a new authorization
Has the has the White House or the Pentagon shown a willingness to do that
I mean I don't think that they don't think any real administration has
A show in a willingness to get a new authorization to use military force ah I mean that's a question of the Aspen brought up ah during the past airstrikes that have occurred against the Assad regime in response to the chemical weapons attacks some people think that those aren't covered by a either a you enough from two thousand and one or two of them to
... know Liz Sly I mean the secretary of defense James Mattis has repeatedly said
We'll talk we'll talk specifically about what he he has said about this new language from the White House but over the many years he has repeatedly said that he sees Iran is the single most quote enduring threat to ... to stability and peace in the middle east in the region
And to that effect you today you just
Went on a tour of an of an alleged a missile site in Lebanon that the Lebanese wanted to show or the Israelis and it wasn't a missiles like can you tell us a little bit more about that
Well yes I'm
At the United nations um last week the Israeli prime minister Netanyahu held up a picture
Of punk off that he's Hitler just shocked like Jim age and with three think like ours on it we seem to cut ... sites that
When his while I was a huge story well manufacturing Mikhail to be which could be used to like when it's Lyle such gate the Lebanese fine ministry invited ambassadors took all the countries that them but you can walk up and then
Um did you go and visit she's arts people to try to see that they don't contain any child
So what we did was we went to actually went to the Gulf Coast but that would keep aren't on state we shouldn't laugh so then they put you back on the buses and we went to a sports club ... and ... and other stuff
And then we went to a warehouse that was kind of and she ended with designed to show us the chance for them it's not in fact storing it in his house in the site to do it was very much child
From the very simple picture which Netanyahu flash chocolate United Nations exactly why the site where anyway and um so it it was very hard to tell you if you were in the ... and ... and he didn't he I mean the trials
Huh OK so a button [laughter] so but regarding for example um
Israel's response to the United states starting to talk about a more permanent or at least in definite presence in Syria certainly they must be supporting this

And I want to just go through a kind of a little walk through a through history here in in terms of moments for different nominees where
Politics definitely came into play a first of all let's go back to Nineteen eighty seven here's then Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork in a press conference in October
Two days after the Senate Judiciary committee voted to have his nomination put before the full Senate with a recommendation not to consent to the appointment
And obviously a rubber ... ended up not being a elevated to the high court and here he talks about the lasting effect
The politics involved in his nomination
Most serious and was being injury and all of this is not to me ... to all of those who have stood vastly supported my nomination Andrew Marr I'm deeply grateful
Rather the damage to the ... the integrity of law and public service in this country
Robert Bork in October Nineteen eighty seven fast forward into October Nineteen Ninety One and here is then Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas addressing the Senate Judiciary committee about his confirmation hearings this is a certain some national disgrace [noise]
From my standpoint as a black
It was a high tech lynching for up all the blacks who in any way Jane to think for themselves to do for themselves have different ideas and it is a message that unless you count town to an old order this is what will happen
Clarence Thomas in Nineteen Ninety One now move forward still to Merrick Garland who President Obama nominated and um we can't plenty tape there because he never even got a hearing

This
Is on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking about the legitimacy the integrity
And the public trust in the United States Supreme court and I'm joined today by Dahlia Lithwick Stuart Taylor and Christopher Schmidt and I want to play just a couple of clips here uh this is against this is for the last week
A and first of all you're going to hear Republican Senator Lindsey Graham I'm being asked by a reporter is uh the hearings that were held on Thursday could have an impact on the Republican vote on Brett Kavanaugh
If you can ignore everything in this record
Looking at allegation is thirty five years old this uncertain time place
Date and no cooperation and fast enough for you God help us all as Republicans Gulf this happens to us it never happens to them but let me tell you my democratic friends if this is the new norm
You better watch out for you or nominates
Senator Lindsey Graham last week and last week's confirmation hearing Senator Ben Sasse Republican from Nebraska said that all of the reason ... hysteria is because the Supreme Court nominations have become so politicized
We have a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the Supreme Court an American lifestyle
Are political commentary talks about the Supreme Court like there are people wearing red and blue jerseys that's a really dangerous things and by the way if they have red and blue jerseys I Would welcome my colleagues to introduce the legislation that ... lifetime tenure for the judiciary
Because if they're just fall additions than the people should have power and they shouldn't have lifetime appointments
That's Republican Ben Sasse last week the week before the break I had to interrupt you there so that we could take that break but you were talking about the fact that uh people are seeing politics in the nomination process but they don't actually get a chance to see in great detail the court and doing its actual work and the consequences of that
And that's right and in some sense I think senator Sasse put it better than I did um you know if you all you see is people in red and blue jerseys and the Senate turning it into a lead sport about getting a red or blue justice on it's a little bit hard to say the public isn't going to take that away with
I Would add as we've been talking about the public perception of the justices but I think it's probably worth just threading into the conversation the justices view of these things we know for instance that Clarence Thomas
Never fully recovered from what he thinks we've done to him and his hearings we know that Sam Alito has said that he never quite forgiving forgotten how his hearings went down it's really hard to imagine that is Brett Kavanaugh as elevated to the court
He will look at some of the groups that are attacked him in anything resembling a an objective open minded way so
There are real consequences not just for public perception of the justices but the justice is
A perception of the public and that's something that I think we really do you have to factor
In the conversation ... I'm going to get to some colors 'cause we've got folks have been waiting patiently on the line but Christopher Schmidt I just want to ask you a quick question here because uh I mean it isn't there an evidence enough or perhaps ample evidence in um the justices own voting are just records in the decisions that they make
That perhaps I don't know if it's fair to say politics already plays a role in how the court operates but that one can wonder if that's true when we have justices that are much more often than not um you know voting in line with the with what would be perceived
A preferred vote of the president that ... that nominated then I put them on the court to begin with
Yeah this is absolutely true there is also nothing new we knew this before Brett Kavanaugh came on the scene
As a nominee for the Supreme Court politics play a role it's always played a role in some sense and also say if you look at the American people's attitude toward the court most people are if you don't think that the court does not involve itself in politics and politics and play some role in the court
And people oftentimes do have an ability to say yes there are politics at play here um but the court still has legitimacy even independent of that so it's not the idea that once people see it as in some ways a political institutions automatically is legitimacy is lost and no longer people are going to followers dictates
Well let's go to college here finally and thank you everyone for were for waiting so patiently on the line let's go to Aaron who's calling from Detroit Michigan you're on the air Erin
Hi thank you for taking my call very interesting topic don't want to get this is from almost be through it first of all of the the point of course is the legitimacy of integrity or public
Trust for the last two perception and if you
Think about what happened with a Obama not being able to appoint a adjusted to repeal replace ... because of Republican saying we will not let him do it
That politicized it in the public's eye now we know that the American public is probably the most uh propaganda as a easily manipulated a populist in modern history
And so through the media and through a lot of other things they are uh giving a perception of what is and what is not but to the last several months Donald Trump in his
A blatant disregard for for for the constitution and Republicans with this don't down we're going to do this regardless because we're Republicans or we're gonna go against whatever Democrats saying that a lot of law
I think the public trust has been shaken and I believe the integrity of the word is gone and I believe like one of the other uh uh statements were made that we need to put some kind of
Limits on terms now because it is simply a political position
Well Aaron thank you for your call call Stuart Taylor um at least one you know one ... there about from them from a member of the public about maybe it's time for term limits with justices
Well I think term limits as a wonderful idea that's not that for twenty or Thirty years
Or maybe eleven years maybe Fifteen Years in and out the problem is it'll never happen
Because it would require is maybe a constitutional amendment to even getting it through Congress
Or the calculations by the political people who could decide whether to have term limits are are going to be who's going to be helped who's going to be hurt who's ... who whose people are older
You know who's terms or later ... is it going to help the red team of the blue team and they're always be a calculation where of one side's thinks it's going to be a good thing for their team the other side will think it's going to be a bad thing
And neither side is gonna care much about the herring merits of term limits which are good you know people shouldn't be sitting on the Supreme Court for forty years um but that's what's going I think that's what we're going to be seen from ... for a long time well
Let's go to Troy who's calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the air Troy

This is on point to make her body we're talking this hour with Baird grills he's got a new book out at how to stay alive the ultimate survival guide for any situation a bear before the break we had heard from college Steve who was former navy special forces are here in the U.S and he'd he'd gone through the ... the Navy's really rigorous SERE training
And he was talking about how
Um as one of the toughest things for him was the mental challenge of the forty eight hour period that he had to spend in complete isolation and whether or not you've
Ever experienced a similar challenge or has gone out on one of these survival expeditions without a a a a camera crew and I I couldn't let you respond before the break but I wanted to give you a shot at that now
Yeah no festivals the respect for your service and a lot watched the ... the
A guy you rang in before you're ... you're so right there the bathroom for survival is won or lost in the mind I'm just see a training is something I went through likewise with part of the British special forces a it is long ... tough
And the time on the ride I Would second what you said Steve ... it's it's hard but you need to kind of get into that mind five cars are okay we're in today is you know however long it's going to be just break it down into the daily tasks
And I she found ... you get so busy surviving you know use his job off the job and people kind of
You know often underestimate how busy this as a lone survivor to look out for yourself and
Again you know when we're now is the crew you know when were filming stuff everything is so much easier when you have an extra set of hands be needed you know putting up shelters are getting a fog and someone else if you needed just to put a first on that will you do you know the ...
The everything on the right to do so much harder but it's all so busy you know I just remember that the training I went through to the days on All right it was just doing ... and as you collect firewood repairing the setting snags doing that
And by the end it's like yeah yeah
It's all on your shoulders and then it's not meant to say you got to keep yourself up beef you got to keep thinking like you know I always say to people in the Bible situation is never letting your mind go into neutral there's always something they are doing to think about the planning
And um and that's why it becomes very draining what the times on the road I I think it's three times higher than when you go one other buddy with you
There is one of the thing that Steven said that caught my attention and I just want to just get a quick response from your cars and actually got a lot of online questions and I kind of want to do a little lightning round with you but but there's something as Steve said that he was he was ... he managed to snare a rabbit or to during his ear training in as
Thinking he's really highly trained navy special forces a guy
A and and so he managed to snare rabbit or two but I was wondering do you worry that people watching your shows for example come because you have to show the successes along with the challenges on television ever survive survival situation do you ever wonder that people come away thinking it's easier than it actually is
Yeah I think that's what I mean listen nobody is going to put on telly may ... spending three hours trying to lie to five but I often the reality of a sudden in the old days on the bus while shows
You know I spent hours and hours doing this so you know hours and hours studying ... obviously that she was going to make a really boring program you know I guess edited ... bit of music and ... book is going to a guy but
You got to the reality of it is it is how it worked for sure yeah but I think one of the lessons of survival is embracing failure you know not be scared to fail and and it's just this is why is that right at the start of the show
Survivor of summed up three was never give up is all about that to nasty that spirit and you might have to go through multiple failures hours and days of
Of getting something wrong before you get success and that's why the rules to we've got to the do get that determine you know next Saturday that the Berlin the brave the strongest
Well so let's do a lightning round a quick quick way here
For by the way to rabbits for a few people that's got to be no one do you love food team found like wow yeah I I end up seeing is Seventy says we we should run another survivor show called the island where we draw these people in the desert island to leave with nothing no camera crews running and they have to film everything themselves that
You know we come back in months later and it's like ... showing that they like street weight loss it and
That is the reality of survival is yet you're starving you dehydration your frighten you wet your cold and ... and you know and that's why it is is is very on glamorous as very on romantic Ohio reality of survival is great
Speaking of the the glamorous part of survival I Do
Coming in on social media I just want to do like a little lightning round so I asked a question in just a quick answer so we can get through
A as many of them as we can hear okay so Brian wrestler from or on Facebook says I've often wondered after eating beetles and crustaceans and survival situation it's vital situations how miserable is bears intestinal track I mean does he sit there and say why could not be somewhere with some nice soft grubs to eat
Your mind tests attract needs needs some attention yeah [laughter] you're like I mean there's definitely took you about the failures number of things have eaten the end of a bad guy rare and stuff you know so
Um but on the whole is you're not getting the land villa by the failures that and your next time I got ... to ... that one again
Right so I get Matt wanted to know how often is buried guessed wrong and ingested poisonous plant or animal I guess that has happened according to what you just said
But not but also you got to be super caffeine and what do you I Need make big mistakes once and when it comes to
You know poison things I've ... mushrooms and ... you got to really know you stuff and be careful and if there's doubt there's no doubt darn each it right you know especially when it comes I see now with mushrooms you know I I just we just I just don't even go near them now and the walks into many ones in different areas that look like so many things okay and then
You know I mean look at that story from Alaska was that one side great film you know the end of the wind in the Alaska decided in the ... and I had a baby coming on your I go wrong ran to get it wrong ones out there
You know by the way if you have from folks haven't rented Jon Krakauer original but it's amazing uh Tanya be asked any special advice pertaining to women
[noise]
Well hey listen to what I've learned about ladies in the wild is that they make incredible survivors enough taken so many running wild guess
That you know you think that the man the the big Bush ... got the big muscles he's going to be great but actually in the little tweak of an actress severely things you can snap in the wild and she's also disliked made of steel so survival is all about that in the spirit the alpha muscles
And I'll see an incredible her ekstrom fantastic ladies we've got some great ladies on our team who ... you know such an inspirational survival is so they are living examples to survive is is all about spirit and ... the impulsivity um and actually some of them have the guns the guy with a

Supreme Court justices likes to call the other branches of government at the political branches and playing of course that the court is where the law not politics plays out but politics have long been part of the nomination and confirmation process these

Thank you for having me
Also with us today from Washington is Stuart Taylor author and contributing editor for the national journal Stuart Taylor good to have you as well nice to be here and where do you [noise]
Um so I Want to start out actually with the voice of a Supreme Court justice or because last friday on September twenty seven just the day after a Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testify before the Senate Judiciary committee
It just so happened that justice Elena Kagan was speaking at a University of California Los Angeles law school for them
Now or I should know I watched the whole forum it was an about an hour and a half long and Brett Kavanaugh his name was not mentioned once uh neither by Justice Kagan or by uh the UCLA moderator of the law school dean Jennifer Munn nuke in
I Want to play for you both here anyway because I think it's as close as we're going to get to knowing what's inside the minds of justice is right now and there was this really interesting moment where ... who can ask Justice Kagan about the lessons that the justices had learned when they only had eight members on the bench after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia
And Alina Kagan said the court has a real interest in preserving its institutional legitimacy and then she said this
The courts strength as an institution of American governance depends on it having a certain kind of legitimacy on people believing that
It is I'm not simply an extension of politics that it it's it's decision making has a kind of integrity to it that is something different from what you find in the political branches

Kind of a little walk through ah through history here in in terms of moments for different nominees where politics definitely came into play ah first of all let's go back to Nineteen eighty seven years then Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork in a press conference in October
Two days after the Senate Judiciary committee voted to have his nomination put before the full Senate with a recommendation not to consent to the appointment
And obviously a rubber ... ended up not being a elevated to the high court and here he talks about the lasting effect of the politics involved in his nomination
Most serious and one's been injury and all of this is not to me
... to all of those were the best we supported my nomination tomorrow I'm deeply grateful rather the damage to the the integrity of law and a public service in this country
Robert Bork in October Nineteen eighty seven fast forward than to October Nineteen Ninety One and here is then Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas addressing the Senate Judiciary committee about his confirmation hearings
There's certainly some national disgrace from my standpoint as a black American as far as I'm concerned it was a high tech lynching for up all the black who in any way Jane to think for themselves
To do for themselves or have different ideas and it is a message that unless you count town to an old order this is what will happen
Clarence Thomas in Nineteen Ninety One no move forward still to Merrick Garland who President Obama nominated and um we can't plenty tape there because he never even got a hearing so that takes us than to where we are now two thousand Eighteen and just last week
President uh Brett Kavanaugh defended himself before the Senate Judiciary committee
Are claiming that Democrats had politicize this process and developed quote a long series of false last minute smears to block his nomination
This whole week effort has been a calculated an orchestrated political hair
Fuel with our parents pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand six Gina watch and see or that it's been unfairly stoked about more judicial record
Revenge on behalf of the coins and millions of dollars and money from outside left wing opposition groups
Do it this week hoping ... you with us now yeah I'm here great ... thank you so much so so let me just ask you hearing sort of those voices through history is what we heard last week with Brett Kavanaugh categorically different than the politics that came before in previous nominations
I you know I think it was a I think that it it's a funny it's there's some perfect symmetry or we started with Robert Bork what Robert Bork did at his hearing that was
Probably tactically a mistake was he talked really in Folsom clear and very very certain ways about his own views there's a reason that people stopped doing that after Bork
A and learn to say I'm just a robot in a neutral umpire so in a sense what Robert Bork was being a Bork over was in fact how he thought about judging how he thought about the constitution then when you fast
Forward to last week and judge Kavanaugh you have a very very strange almost the mirror image where since then there's this long tradition of judges including judges by the way with very very very extensive legal records um records of writings records of speeches and communications and records of
Their actual ... views standing up and saying but I'm also just a robot a I have no use models and strikes and in a weird way I think that Robert Bork was the last time we had anything close to a truthful
Scrutiny of someone's record now what we have is this funny pantomime where the nominee pretends that they actually have no use it all and nothing they wrote in the past has any bearing and I think that sets up
A what we saw this week which is you have a nominee who has a very very clear very coherent doctrinal record and he spent most of the hearing trying to get away from it now
That doesn't answer the question of whether Brett Kavanaugh did something really dramatically different when he started talking about dark money and the Clintons because I think that's a given I've never seen anything like that
But I think at least Bork was honest and he was when the Senate exercised it's advice and consent it did so knowing yeah
That's gone we'll Stuart Taylor I mean I guess the the question that the naturally raises itself here is is the court being undermined by what is fundamentally seen by many as a broken nomination in ...
This is elevation to the high court
Emphatically yes and I've been watching it happen and get worse and worse and worse since before
A judge Bork ... a year before judge Bork Justice Scalia who was then a very controversial figure was confirmed like Ninety eight zero I think or maybe it was an idea to to
Uh I think was euro uh ... I don't understand why the Democrats didn't want him to get confirmed because his record shows that he was going to be bad for them on almost every issue and even then what I said earlier was true
Ah everything you know they're they're deciding many of the most important political issues in the country you can heart you know it's almost impossible to be a neutral arbiter when that's what you're doing
The where the Democrats did was a Bork and and what made worker bird
Was the smeared him in every conceivable way accept a sex life
They smeared him as a liar as a monster they portrayed him as a horrible person they took out advertising it was a disgusting display you know that this was how they thought they could win now with Thomas it was more complicated
With a cabin on who you know for all of all of the comments lately and understandable comments about his odd performance in front of the committee
Or he's been on the bench for twelve years at the second highest court in the land arguably sitting along with Fifteen admirable judges including my law school friend Merrick Garland and we know what happened to him
I have it on good authority and it's pretty public that every one of those judges
Or or at least almost every one of them including George Carlin I Believe
Uh that marred him in terms of judicial temperament as a level headed smart wonderful colleague
Who uh you know who is much more conservative than most some of them in some ways but he was an excellent totally yeah you know now that's not what he looks like the person we saw on TV the other day was totally out of character
For a cabinet or in this process I think a drove them after a
While and and and uh do you all this week I mean we're we're creeping towards looking at Congress's role in all of this I mean there's the politics that play out between Democrats and Republicans in those hearings themselves
But also I mean after Harry Reid first you know wants the nuclear option or push the nuclear option button in two thousand Thirteen and then Mitch McConnell did it after that for Supreme Court nominees in two thousand Seventeen
That removed you know what was the most effective
Break in terms of bringing more controversial justices to uh you know to the nomination process right so I mean we have to be looking at the Senate and and its role here in creating this highly politicized environment for the court
I I don't think there's any question I think that the fact that we're talking about what one two votes were talking about Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and the totality of this feat rests on one or two people's votes it it really I mean I couldn't agree more with Stewart that you know justices Ginsburg and Justice Scalia
Often uh say are set in ... case look this used to be at Ninety eight nothing seems to be a Ninety four
Nothing enterprise because of the rule that everybody adhere to in the Senate was
Elections matter and if the president chooses someone who's fit we don't go after them because of perceived outcomes and that's clearly
Just gone I Would probably say that
The the holding of Merrick Garland seat open and in fact I Would say the running on the proposition right because Ted Cruz and John McCain ran in the twenty sixteen election for their Senate seats
You're planning begins to convince voters dot com slash create [noise]

[noise] today China I knew the power in the walls and China would win with ... China
Has plans to build a brand new city from scratch on my walk of life would be just sticks and politics stand in a way it's not a done deal and actually be from coal fired fast flowing before on the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News [noise] tomorrow morning at five
Or ... students NPR News station
This is on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking about the legitimacy the integrity
And the public trust in the United States Supreme court and I'm joined today by ... Stuart Taylor and Christopher Schmidt and I want to play just a couple of clips here uh this is against this is for the last week
A and first of all you're going to hear Republican Senator Lindsey Graham I'm being asked by a reporter is uh the hearings that were held on Thursday could have an impact on the Republicans vote on Brett Kavanaugh
If you can ignore everything and this record
Looking at allegation is thirty five years old this uncertain time place date and no cooperation if that's enough for you God help us all as Republicans golf this happens to us it never happens to them but let me tell you my democratic friends if this is the new norm [noise]
You'd better watch out for your nominee
Senator Lindsey Graham last week at last week's confirmation hearing Sen bent
Ask a said that all the recent quote hysteria is because Supreme Court nominations have become so politicized
We have a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the Supreme Court in American Life now
Our political commentary talks about the Supreme Court like there are people wearing red and blue jerseys and that's a really dangerous thing and by the way if they have red and blue jerseys I Would welcome my colleagues introduced legislation that hands lifetime tenure for the judiciary
Because if they're just fall additions than the people should have power and they shouldn't have lifetime appointments
That's Republican Ben Sasse last week this week before the break I had to interrupt you there so that we could take a break but you were talking about the fact that people are seeing politics in the nomination process but they don't actually get a chance to see in great detail the court doing its actual work and the consequences of that
And that's right and in some sense I think senator Sasse put it better than I did um you know if you all you see is people in red and blue jerseys and the Senate turning it into a blood sport about getting a red or blue justice on it's a little bit hard to say the public isn't going to take that away with them
Um and I think the only other thing I Would add is we've been talking about the public perception of the justices but I think it's probably worth just threading into the conversation the justices view of these things we know for instance that Clarence Thomas
Never fully recovered from what he thinks was done to him and his hearings we know that Sam Alito has said that he never quite forgiving forgotten
How his hearings went down it's really hard to imagine that
If Brett Kavanaugh as elevated to the court he will look at some of the groups that are attacked him in anything resembling a an objective open minded way so there are real consequences not just for public perception of the justices but the justices
A perception of the public and that's something that I think we really do you have to factor
In conversation
I'm going to get to some colors 'cause we've got folks have been waiting patiently on the line but Christopher Schmidt I just wanted to ask you a quick question here because uh I mean it isn't there an evidence enough or perhaps ample evidence in um the justices own voting or just records in the decisions that they make
That perhaps I don't know if it's fair to say politics already plays a role in how the court operates but that one can wonder if that's true when we
Have justices that are much more often than not um you know voting in line with the with what would be perceived a preferred vote of the president that ... that nominated them and put them on the court to begin with
Yeah this is absolutely true but it's also nothing new we knew this before Brett Kavanaugh came on the scene
As nominees and the Supreme Court the politics play a role it's always played a role in some sense and also say if you look at the American people's attitude toward the court most people are if you don't think that the court does not involve itself in politics politics doesn't play some sort of role in the court
And people oftentimes do have an ability to say yes there are politics at play here um but the court still has legitimacy even independent of that so it's not the idea that once people see it as in some ways a political institutions automatically his legitimacy is lost and no longer people are going to follow dictates
Well let's go to college here finally and thank you everyone for were for waiting patiently on the line let's go to Aaron who's calling from Detroit Michigan you're on the air Erin
Hi thank you for taking my call very interesting topic don't want to get to hear from almost be through it first of all the the point of course is has the legitimacy of integrity or public
Trust for the last two perception and if you think about
What happened with a Obama not being able to appoint a adjusted to repeal replace could live because of Republican saying we will not let him do it
That politicized it in the
Public's eye now we know that the American public is probably the most uh propaganda as a uh easily manipulated a populist in modern history
And so through the media and through a lot of other things they are a given a perception of what is what is not but to the last several months Donald Trump in his
A blatant disregard for for for the constitution and Republicans with the snow down we're going to do this regardless because we're Republicans were going to go against whatever Democrats and got a lot of law
I think the public trust has been shaken and I believe the integrity of the word is gone and I believe like one of the other uh uh statements were made that we need to put
Some kind of limits on terms now because it is simply a political position well
Aaron thank you for your call call Stuart Taylor um at least one you know one thought there about from them from a member of the public about maybe it's time for term limits
With justice is well I think term limits it's a wonderful idea that's not that for twenty or Thirty years or maybe eleven years maybe
The problem is it'll never happen
Because it would require if maybe a constitutional right to even getting it through Congress
Or the calculations by the political people who could decide whether to have term limits are are going to be who's going to be helped who's going to be hurt who's ... who's people or older you know who's terms or later ... is it going to help the red team of the blue team
And they're always be a calculation were of one side's thinks it's going to be a good thing for their team the other side will think it's going to be a bad thing
And neither side is gonna care much about the herring merits of term limits which are good you know people shouldn't be sitting on the Supreme Court for forty years um but that's what's going I think that's what we're going to be seen for ... for a long time well
Let's go to Troy who's calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the air Troy
... thank you very much uh I Will remind people Lindsey Graham supported taken
For Obama and the uh keep in mind that the ... the Supreme Court goal is to make the wrongs of the government against its people
Fixed so I think uh this is an injustice for uh the the nominee that what he's going through [noise] thank you very much
Troy thank you for your call let's go to Joe who's calling from Tampa, Florida you're on the air Joe
I'm I guess what I figured that I called the ... the if the Supreme Court and the question was going to go out when I realized that it was only up to a couple of justices weathering I got the right to marry my on
'em and now I'm kind of thing that play out of gang where a lot of decisions I could come up and it's not even that it's a light left ideology it seems like it's more of the plane down to
Um that was the right is actually just a code word for religious so it's a bunch of religious people on the right if you want to overturn roe even though that may be impossible by some standard they still want to do it and they're willing to sacrifice anything
To be able to give me get that chance when in reality there is no scientific reason to do it there was no scientific reason you or prohibits gay people are married it's just about ... what religious doctrine is actually going to sway that massive
... yeah well Jill thank you for your call a deli it looks like you have a response to that [noise]
Yeah I mean I think Joe just gave us the answer to Stuart subject Gina Stewart
Correctly makes the point that the Supreme Court has inserted itself into all the big ticket issue that the day
Excuse me and I think you know what you just heard was the Supreme Court was by design supposed to be a counter majorities Harry and check it was supposed to fight for their rights of minorities or when the other branches of government

Some WB or Boston and NPR I'm making to talk her body and this is on points
For vote for judge Kavanaugh is also a vote to reject the ruthless and outrages tactics of the Democratic party mean obstruction is the main reason is is that
Of the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh that as of yet in the Senate Judiciary committee's a outsides council but they brought in
A ritual Michel ... released a memo to the Senate Judiciary committee released a over the weekend that essentially said there are um uh there there is not even a preponderance of evidence to pursue a criminal investigation uh in ... Dr ... Ford's a
Accusations and that doesn't mean that are just getting the nomination still can't go down to who we found out more information but I think it would actually be who've the White House um for the FBI to pursue
Um that that that question sort of unfettered um because as of now as the information is now in his ritual Mitchell's metal outlines there are holes there are inconsistencies
In Dr ... testimony um and uh and and if you're living in this in terms of credibility and believe ability
Um it seems to me that at this point I'm the truth might very well might set the Republicans and Brett Kavanaugh free if there are we willing to uh to let that happen right now I think the risk or looking like the guy from on the scales for something they may not even need to put their phones are on there for
Right and Caitlin we've just got about thirty seconds here to go before the break but I think Democrats would say they saw and heard holes and inconsistencies and Brett Kavanaugh's testimony on Thursday as well that's what needs investigation
Absolutely ... and in addition to that questions have been raised about his temperament and whether he is in fact two participants to serve on the court so I think there are going to be questions that extends beyond just this event and question
Well Caitlin Huey burns is with us today she CBS News digital political reporter peer Thomas is with us he's chief justice correspondent for ABC News and Michael Moore enjoys it says well he's senior writer at the Weekly Standard

I think definitely that's the beauty of cycling by bike you feel like you've entered day to day life because you're going through town that you know don't generally see tourists go through them because they're off the main rotor off the main train station they don't have the big museum they don't have a really important because he drove or anything like that but
You stopped in the grocery store for your picnic lunch or you stop at the cafe to have your morning coffee after your for five or ten miles of your bike ride and
It's really a nice way to the day to day life everyday life that is true on any bike to work but I think especially when you're in such a well known region it's refreshing when you end up realizing that there's more than just Florence and there's more than just kind of some of the other highlighted pieces

And Michael Moore joins us to today he's senior writer at the Weekly Standard and of course so much attention focused on the FBI's current background investigation into the allegations are surrounding judge Brett Kavanaugh a and we've got lots of comments here on our website on point radio dot org
John in Amherst says lying and allegations aside as someone with Kavanaugh has demonstrated belligerence unbiased capable of serving as a judge on any bench let alone
The Supreme Court well in fact this weekend Republican Senator Jeff flake of Arizona was asked about that on sixty minutes this was just yesterday a and here's what he described he saw in Brett Kavanaugh's temperament during Kavanaugh's testimony last week
When I heard him hurt someone who are who are with some like if I had been unjustly accused and to see his family behind ... and ah
It was it was under a ... term but if I were unjustly accused that's how I Would feel as well
And the Chris there that Senator Flake referred to as Senator Chris Coons of Delaware who was also interviewed by sixty minutes and correspondence Scott Kelly ask tunes are about the the claim or the assertion or the belief that parts of Kavanaugh's testimony and his demeanor in front of the Senate Judiciary committee may have crossed the line
I'm not at all surprised to hear that from other colleagues in the committee or on television but I was really struck that I thought his anger got the best of him and he made a partisan argument that would've been best left to be made up for his advocates
Building in my case yes it made me wonder about a ... to survive and
That is democratic Senator Chris Coons speaking on sixty minutes there and I keep making the same mistake I keep seeing Mike Judge but I mean to say mark judge and I apologize for it to everyone for that mistake here ... burns let me just pick up with you 'cause you're speaking to this point before

This is on point I'm making a trucker Bertie we're talking this hour with Caitlin Huey burns she's CBS News digital political reporter also with peer Thomas chief justice correspondent for ABC News and make a war and senior writer at the Weekly Standard and we're at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for it to three talk
Uh and I want to talk with all of you about the midterms here and just a just a second here but peer you said something before the break that wanted to follow up on 'em and particularly because you're justice correspondent for ABC News about
How the the purpose and intent of the FBI's background ongoing a background investigation right now are into the allegations around judge Kavanaugh that that's supposed to provide some of the detail and clarity
A around these allegations that until now we possibly don't have right but I mean I just want your thoughts on this like so many people over the weekend and even today are saying how can we possibly get trustworthy clarity
Is the FBI isn't even investigating things like the allegations of a judge Kavanaugh's excessive drinking in college we have multiple people coming forward saying they want they want to talk to the to the the the federal agents about this um but perhaps no one's reaching out to them to hear them
Well I guess we have to be very careful about describing what the investigation will unfold for example a mystery mirrors talks about the fact of this incident happening at Yale University
So the FBI interviews her and they get information from her regarding other people who may have known about
This incident contemporaneously so therefore if the FBI goes in talks with those people they may end up getting information that speaks to whether judge Kavanaugh
A drink to excess weather here is a demeanor change so that may end up in what's called the FBI three oh two which is the the report that they fall regarding what the witnesses say again the FBI will draw no conclusions about
Who's telling the truth or not but what you may end up as a body of work which includes witness after witnessing the same kinds of things and again we're going to support judge Kavanaugh's version of the story or will it ... you know attack
There was a little and I mean ... I'm asking you about this and we talked about earlier show because I Want to be sure we get it right a ... we can't be sure if the FBI would talk to those people right because it again there's confusion about whether or not the White House counsel's office and say here's the list of people you can talk to full stop
Right we don't know if they have to go back to the White House and say we've been given these additional names of people who may know specifics about this incident can we go talk to them um typically the FBI has the ability and the authority to go do that
Uh because most times the client wants to know this level of detail most again
We're we're tiptoeing around it is is there a conflict of interest in this case the White House's client do directing the FBI to pursue the questions that they want answered the same time this White House has made it very clear that they want Mr Kavanaugh approved confirmed
And there's no guarantee that we will ever know who the FBI actually spoke to with certainty or if the report is not made public and if I'm remembering correctly for example the FBI's investigation back in Ninety One with Clarence Thomas that hasn't been made public at All right
Well in theory we'll go to the White House and then the senators are one hundred or who will vote on his a nomination will be able to get access to it the question then becomes will leak when it gets to Capitol Hill has a little bit different era now
[laughter] so so much has
So much and yet so little at the same time as change in Nineteen Ninety One so let's talk a little bit about the more and more detail about the mid term here and in order to set that up I just want to play a actually a clip from a conversation on sixty minutes yesterday with one man who is not running for reelection Republican Senator Jeff flake because he
Told Scott Kelly or that if you had been running for reelection his decisions regarding um a delaying the vote on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination would have been very very different
Could you have done this if you were running no ... no not yet not a chance now because politics has become too sharp to Portland ... there is no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive
Michael Ward I'm seeing here also is just a recent study from cue that says that ah Seventy six percent of the potential midterm voters are saying that the Supreme Court nominee with a process around it is a very important issue to them in these midterm elections I mean how big is this
A it is big but I don't think we know exactly how it plays out um you know George Will often says that the political parties organizer animosity is not you know politics is as much about uh
Uh who do you hate or maybe a little nicer who you're not like who do not want to see in power I'm clearly Donald Trump himself has been a and organizing force for Democrats who who
Sort of woken up uh in our on our are expecting a a good election in the midterms um my question is how many more potential democratic voters are left to be woken up in an energized to vote in the midterms
I think there is a question about whether or not enough Republicans a have a
Have been energized a I don't think the Trump Administration as it's going on I had given him Republican much to be excited about perhaps a and we'll have to wait to see a polling is a week or so after the uh the the hearings last week
Um perhaps the feeling that judge Kavanaugh is under siege may uh give Republicans a reason to get to the polls that they haven't had a for the last uh Eighteen months um I don't know if that's going to be the case we've been talking about the way that ah that women voters might respond
I'm a you know anecdotally I hear from Republican women voters who are sort of take the opposite
A view that you might expect him say that I'm actually judge Kavanaugh's treatment I'm a as make them more willing to go out and vote for Republicans we just don't know how that's going to play out but I think an issue like this is something that does animate voters
A in a way that uh that that that does energize them to get out the whole right ah in November
... in fact we heard the president himself over the weekend at those rallies galvanizing his supporters and saying you know if you want to preserve the
Uh the futures of the judges judge Brett Kavanaugh go to the polls in November I mean he's absolutely using it as a rallying cry on the other hand you look on the we've got so many comments on our website I'm seeing your saying
That's a quote I think we're seeing a new political party emerge a party of women to different possibilities for the cabinet nomination the women at the Senate block it or he is confirmed
And the women of the nation rally their power to throw the bums out that is a comment on our website on point radio dot org let's go to Steve who's calling from Bangor Maine you're on the air Steve
I Would agree with that oh that is absolutely I find that in my own ... you know all of this will go um it's a generational thing where at least social media is lit up and I think
There are females are are motivated you know they listen to their mothers or the grandmother say you know uh uh the slogans like we really haven't come a long way baby and we have this is like

You think the FDIC a and you do

Risk that it created a I immediately that the FDA she had been had undergone some brutal downsizing before I got there we had our resolutions chained to the team that handles failed banks have been cut to the bone

As a percentage of the the deposits that we ensured a we started hiring staff

Put under the veins of dollars into a new capital into these banks or the FBI she was going to start within limits and for the we're going to start a year and she uh the debt that they needed to issue to roll expiring debt we had because the markets were seized up and they were having hard time refinancing their own debt
And then the fed had trillions of dollars of lending facilities that they they put into place and so it was ... it was basically to explain those news programs
And is that they had to take the ... well yeah you know and as I say that I think a lot of that was a was designed to cover up the problems the weaker banks like city
I think most of them not all but most of them probably could've bumble through but uh we didn't want to test that and ah and also there was a lot of fear that if you just singled out certain banks for

This is on point I'm making Tucker birdie okay here's a pop quiz for you how many American Soldiers are in Syria today
The answer around two thousand and why are they will to fight ISIS of course but that mission could be changing last week national security adviser John Bolton said us troops will not leave Syria quote
As long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders and that includes Iranian proxies and militias end quote
Well that's a sharp departure from the military's current mission and for the first time it ties us goals in Syria directly to countering Iran
So listeners what do you think if you applauded when President Trump vowed to bring American troops home do you think we need to stay in Syria to take on Iran now we're one eight hundred for two three to five find that's eight hundred for two three talk
Well joining me now from Beirut, Lebanon is Liz Sly Beirut bureau chief for the Washington Post lose it's good to have
You
Also with us from Tyson's corner Virginia is Kyle rent for he is a reporter for the military times Kyle welcome to you hey thanks for having me
All right so let me start with you I mean you wrote about uh about what John Bolton said in this article for military times by the we've got a link to it at one point radio dot org how big of a shift in rhetoric is this regarding the U.S mission in Syria
[noise] it seems to be kind of a more over um way to say that the
Prior U.S policy goals which were to uh mainly just put us troops in Syria eastern theory in order to fight ISIS is being being expanded
So the Pentagon has a readily acknowledge a Pentagon officials
Up to and including secretary of defense Mattis that us troops are only fighting ISIS however they do play a secondary benefit of balancing against Iranian
Influence in the country a boat and we kind of came out and was way more overt in saying that that is the primary goal countering Iran a hence the condition for us to withdraw is ah the withdrawal
Of Iranian forces so that's a changing mission or an expanding of like the mission parameters that waste
Right so I'm seeing here the James Jeffrey just uh the state department special representative for Syria a following John Bolton comment said that the United states would maintain a presence in Syria possibly including an extended military mission
Again until Iran withdraws us soldiers in military forces it commands and Jeffrey told reporters on Thursday that the president wants us in Syria until that and the other conditions are met
A but but Kyle I mean the authorization for use of military force that the U.S is operating on in Syria right now those date back to Afghanistan and Iraq right there there are counterterrorism authorizations
Yeah well there's one from two thousand and one which covers all ...
And um it's affiliates and those who hire harbored al ... in response to the nine eleven terror attacks and then there's one from two thousand two against Iraq
And so neither of those really cover the Iranian mission um and so I think that the way that if they were to continue having a U.S presence in eastern Syria they would try to quote it by saying that
Us troops are conducting counter ISIS missions primarily and um they would just continue to say well you know it also balances against Iran such as the secondary benefit
Well Liz Sly you're joining us here from Beirut I mean let me ask you how is uh this new language or or I may be to use ... raise cows description of it more overt language from the Trump Administration how's that going over in the region
[noise] well
I think people in the thing that the price by the second one coming out you can't you learned that we've seen that yet because as you remember a few months ago um ... we're going to be going home very very soon and was actually an expectation that they would be caught on by the end of the yeah
And most of the regional palate ... involved in Syria that she's Russia Jackie I'm no everyone else in the neighborhoods have been expecting he likes to go and they can take a kitchen that's on the ... the idea that that actually going to be getting any definitely definitely puts them back like
In ... when it comes to negotiate cheating and then you can share and more and I think it should be on our Web that she'll leave at the moment
Okay well let's hear a little bit more ah from what a national security adviser John Bolton said in his ramping up of the anti Iran rhetoric
On ... on Monday again he said we're not going to leave Syria as long as Iranian troops are outside of Iranian borders and then on Tuesday he went even further
If you cross us our allies are our partners you harm our citizens if you continue to lie cheat and deceive yes there will indeed be held up to
Well the very next day on Wednesday of last week week some lawmakers did question the ah the u._s. is military role in Syria and this expansion of the military objective they question Robert ... assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs
And here you are going to hear Massachusetts democratic congressman Seth Moulton pressing came to get more specific about uh Iran and Syria and how that correlates with the mission and fighting ISIS
The problem is that national security adviser John Bolton stated that the United states intends to keep an indefinite military presence in Syria until Iran withdraws it for its forces that to me sounds like we're sending our military to Syria to counter Iran
Especially because their withdrawal is apparently dependent on actions of wrong not actions of ISIS or the defeat of ISIS
Let me ask you about this because it seems as if what Congress and molten is saying is that if indeed this is why the U.S will be sending troops to Syria and the future that it may be illegal because he they do not have congressional
It's basically making the argument that even if I'm us troops are conducting active operations against Iranian forces or Iranian proxy forces the fact that they're
In the region with the mission to balance against those forces or restrict those forces freedom maneuver through eastern Syria means that they are I'm conducting a military operation and therefore the Pentagon the White House needs to come to Congress and ask for a new authorization
Has the has the White House or the Pentagon shown a willingness to do that
I mean I don't think that they don't think any real administration has shown a willingness to
Get a new authorization for use military force a I mean that's a question of the Aspen brought up ah during the past airstrikes that have occurred against ah the Assad regime in response the chemical weapons attacks some people think that those aren't covered by a either a you enough from to I've been wanting to I've been to
... know Liz Sly I mean the secretary of defense James Mattis has repeatedly said
We'll talk we'll talk specifically about what he he has said about this new language from the White House but over the many years he has repeatedly said that he sees Iran is the single most quote enduring threat to ... to stability and peace in the middle east in the region
And to that effect you today you just
Went on a tour of an of an alleged a missile site in Lebanon that the Lebanese wanted to show or the Israelis it wasn't a missiles like he he tells a little bit more about that
[laughter] well yes I'm
At the United nations um last week the Israeli prime minister Netanyahu held up a picture
Of ... that he was shocked like Jim age and which we think like allergies on it seemed to ... sites that
When his while I was at the store and will manufacturing Mikhail to be which could be used to like ... and file such gay he's fine ministry invited ambassadors with all the countries that them but you can walk up and then
Um did you go and visit she's our people to fight to see that they don't contain any child
So what we did was we went to such where we went to the Gulf Coast but that was Japan on state Michigan law so then they put you back on the buses and we went to a sports club where we were ... ... and ... other ... type stuff
And then we went to the White House that was kind of energy and it was designed to show us a check for the rich no in fact storing it in his house in the site to do it was very hot child

Point radio dot org John in Amherst says lying and allegations aside as someone with Kavanaugh has demonstrated belligerence unbiased capable of serving as a judge on any bench let alone the Supreme Court well in fact this weekend Republican Senator Jeff flake of Arizona was asked
About that on sixty minutes this was just yesterday a and here's what he describes he saw in Brett Kavanaugh temperament during Kavanaugh's testimony last week
When I heard him heard someone who are who
Are with some like if I had been unjustly accused and to see his family behind the ... and ah
It was it was under a ... term for the fire were unjustly accused that's how I Would feel as well
And the Chris there that Senator Flake referred to as Senator Chris Coons of Delaware who was also interviewed by sixty minutes and a correspondent Scott Kelly ask tunes are about the the claim or the ... or the belief that parts of Kavanaugh's testimony and his demeanor in front of the Senate Judiciary committee may have crossed the line
A lot at all surprised to hear that from other colleagues in the committee or on television but I was really struck that I thought his anger got the best of him and he made a partisan argument that would have been best left to be made for his advocates and defenders on the committee made you wonder about a ...
In my case yes it made me wonder about his ability to survive and
That is democratic Senator Chris Coons speaking on sixty minutes there and I keep making the same mistake I keep seeing Mike Judge but I mean to say mark judge and I apologize for it to everyone for that mistake here ... burns let me just pick up with you because you were speaking to this point before
The break here I Wonder um you know all day on Thursday Democrats focused on their call for investigation
They got one they got an investigation you know its current terms they may not like but I'm Wondering if you think they missed an opportunity here because you know many folks did look at for example that paragraph in judge Kavanaugh was opening statement where he
Talks about a left wing conspiracy talks about the Clintons 'em and you know that and perhaps some folks might say they should just simply point at that uh as evidence for of what you know might be judge Kavanaugh suit ability or lack of for the Supreme Court
Right I think not paragraph was particularly revealing for a lot of people watching because
Um remember we're talking about this seat as the potential swing seat on the court from um a a conservative and a ideological perspective but when Kavanaugh was talking about the Clintons and the left wing conspiracy I think it did raise questions about whether he would in fact be a partisan
I'm a political type of person
And so I wouldn't be surprised if the conversation starts to evolve this week away from the events in question in the Nineteen eighties and more towards Kavanaugh's suit ability for the court or
The question though and that the point that I Would make is that you know a lot of lawmakers made their decisions about ... even before these allegations surfaced you had many Democrats come out as soon as having all was nominated or shortly thereafter saying that they could not support him and you had lots of Republicans
Are really cheering him on so there is a question of you know how much the events of uh that we learned last week how much we learned this week
How much it will actually change minds I think Republicans also are considering that the idea that they have wanted to shape the makeup of the courts that's been an organizing principle for them in election after election
And so they have to kind of weigh that against the allegations that they've already heard and against any new information that comes out this week that pertains to the events in question and also that pertain to Kavanaugh's a personality and his fitness for the corps
Well Michael warn me chime in here because if as Kaitlin says we do start hearing more Democrats talking about issues of temperament will that argument hold any weight now because there has been so much emphasis placed on allowing the FBI to investigate
... I think if that's where the argument shifts this is Caitlin suggested might um it suggests that Brett Kavanaugh is going to be confirmed as a Supreme Court or or to the Supreme Court I mean this is I'm a respect for you I think a ... his ah his testimony his anger
In that are in that testimony on Thursday or somehow revealed something about the kind of justice he would be what we're not hearing is any sort of analysis of his actual time on the bench he's a he's a on the DC circuit court what are the most powerful or courts in the country or in this claim about
Perhaps it robs somebody will now Rob somebody will go back through some of his decisions and find it but so far they haven't
I'm a ... and I think Jeff Flake is giving it something here rubber flick is one of the three Republican senators I'm we're on the fence about cabinet none of the Democrats
Are who are who are including Chris Coons were mentioning they're concerned about his temperament oh we're really ever going to vote for him in the first place um will Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake or change their mind because of the uh the angry way in which
Cabinet responded to what he claims are smears
Um I don't think so if if this the investigation finds out the capital has wide about this or has lied about anything anything else that he's been accused of that will change things up but but the anger on display or I think a won't make a difference with the people who who matter in this decision which are those three Republican senators
Hollers take a quick call here on this point let's go to Rick who's calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the Iraq
[noise] Ricky their maintenance high yeah go ahead Richard
Uh I really don't have too much
Faith that you will not be pushed shortages records or I'm going to be asking [noise] perhaps British civic lesson
He is a
Appointed and confirmed um when will he
Will have to decide how many cases you have to recuse himself because of his are blasted NATO to carry it or the Clinton years or ... or conspiracy or to the other members of the court will decide when recusal shouldn't and should not be used her
Rick and Rick thank you for your call peer Thomas you want to pick up on that because
Uh I think if you know a ... judge Kavanaugh on Thursday he talked about well funded left wing groups et cetera and if you're one of those quote unquote left wing groups and you bring a case before the Supreme Court
Would you be right to be concerned about a ... a justice cabinet is so iffy so becomes his ability to fairly Jew Decatur case like that
[noise] you know it is interesting um a lot of the things that were said again we're out of anger I think what the caller is picking up on is the invoking of the Clinton for example that some people thought that that was
A bit too much in terms of the judge and whether he recused himself the justices have a lot of latitude to determine what they feel like they may have a conflict of interest on a but most of the judges and in many of these cases feed themselves as the arbitrators are the facts and
If it's not often if they recused himself from cases
All right well let's go to another call here Reggie is calling from ... Iowa you're on the air Reggie
Yeah so I was wondering if he comes back and so they can find no evidence to support doctor board or any of the other users
There was a single Democrat Jim or vote because I think they made up their mind up for Justice Kennedy said he was going to require there were voted no on whoever was nominated I don't even think the Democrats in the sun it ... it just it gets tougher because they want to vote no
... Reggie thank you for your call Caitlin Huey burns I mean I feel like Joe Manchin is the one one Democrat I Am that keeps coming up right I think
That we have to kind of separate separate out some of these red state Democrats these are

Protect independent journalism give now at W. B. U. R. dot org
This is on point I'm making a trucker Bertie we're talking this hour with Caitlin Huey burns she's CBS News digital political reporter also with peer Thomas chief justice correspondent for ABC News and like a war and senior writer at the Weekly Standard and we're at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five it's eight hundred for it to three talk
Uh and I want to talk with all the about the midterms here and just a just a second here but peer you said something before the break that wanted to follow up on 'em in particularly because you're justice correspondent for ABC News about
How the the purpose and intent of the FBI's background ongoing or background investigation right now are into the allegations around judge Kavanaugh that that's supposed to provide some of the detail and clarity
A around these allegations that until now we possibly don't ... right but I mean I just want your thoughts on this like so many people over the weekend and even today are saying how can we possibly get trustworthy clarity
Is the FBI isn't even investigating things like the allegations of a judge Kavanaugh's excessive drinking in college we have multiple people coming forward saying they want they want to talk to the to the
But perhaps no one's reaching out to them to hear them
Well I guess we have to be very careful about describing what the investigation will unfold for example a mystery mirrors talks about the fact of this incident happening at Yale University
So the FBI interviews her and they get information from her regarding other people who may have known about
This incident contemporaneously so therefore if the FBI goes and talk to those people they may end up getting information that speaks to whether judge Kavanaugh
A drink to excess weather here is a demeanor change so that may end up in what's called the FBI three oh two which is the the report that they fire regarding what the witnesses safe again the FBI will draw no conclusions about
Who's telling the truth or not but what you may end up as a body of work which includes witness after witness saying the same kinds of things and again we'll that support judge Kavanaugh's version of the story or will it you know attack
There wasn't and I mean ... I'm asking you about this and we talked about earlier show because I Want to be sure we get it right a ... we can't be sure if the FBI would talk to those people right because it again there's confusion about whether or not the White House counsel's office and say here's the list of people you can talk to full stop
Right we don't know if they have to go back to the White House and say we've been given these additional names of people who may know specifics about this incident can we go talk to them um typically the FBI has the ability and the authority to go do that
Uh because most times the client wants to know this level of detail most again the question here and we're we're tiptoeing around it is
Is there a conflict of interest in this case the White House's client their directing the FBI to pursue the questions that they want answered but at the same time this White House has made it very clear that they want Mr Kavanaugh approved confirmed
And there's no guarantee that we will ever know who the FBI actually spoke to with certainty or if the report is not made public and if I'm remembering correctly for example the FBI's investigation back in Ninety One with Clarence Thomas that hasn't been made public at All right
Well it in theory we'll go to the White House and then the senators are one hundred uh who will vote on his a nomination will be able to get access to it the question then becomes will leak when it gets to Capitol Hill has a little bit different era now [laughter]
So so much has
So much and yet so little at the same time that change in Nineteen Ninety One so let's talk a little bit about the more and more detail about the mid term here and in order to set that up I just wanted to play a actually a clip from the conversation on sixty minutes yesterday with one man who was not running for reelection Republican Senator Jeff flake because he
Told Scott Kelly or that if you had been running for reelection
His decisions regarding um a delaying the vote on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination would have been very very different
Cooking who have done this if you were running no [laughter] no not yet not a chance now because politics has become too sharp to Puerto ... there's no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive
Michael Ward I'm seeing here also is they're just a recent study from Hugh that says that ah Seventy six percent of the potential midterm voters are saying that a Supreme Court nominee with a process around it is a very important issue to them in these midterm elections I mean how big is this
A it is big but I don't think we know exactly how it plays out um you know George Will often says that the political parties organizer animosity is not you know politics is as much about ah
Who do you hate or maybe a little nicer who you're not like who do not want to see in power I'm clearly Donald Trump himself has been in organizing force for Democrats who who are sort of woken up uh in our own are are expecting
A a good election in the midterms um my question is how many more potential democratic voters are left to be woken up an an energized to vote in the midterms
I think there is a question about whether or not enough Republicans a have a
Have been energized a I don't think the Trump Administration as it's going on I had given him Republicans much to be excited about perhaps a and we'll have to wait to see a how polling is a week or so after the uh the hearings last week
Um perhaps the feeling that judge Kavanaugh is under siege may uh give Republicans a reason to get to the polls that they haven't had a for the last uh Eighteen months um I don't know if that's going to be the case we've been talking about the way that ah that women voters might respond
I'm a you know anecdotally I hear from Republican women voters who are sort of take the opposite a view that you might expect and say that I'm actually judge ...
We just don't know how that's going to play out but I think an issue like this is something that does animated voters or in a way that ah that that that does energize them to do out ... ah in November
... in fact we heard the president himself over the weekend at those rallies galvanizing his supporters are saying you know if you want to preserve the
Uh the futures of of judges judge Brett Kavanaugh go to the polls in November I mean he's absolutely using it as a rallying cry on the other hand you look we've got so many comments on our website I'm seeing your saying
That the quote I think we're seeing a new political party emerge a party of women to different possibilities for the Kavanaugh nomination the women of the Senate block it or he is confirmed
And the women of the nation rally their power to throw the bums out that as a comment on our website on point radio dot org let's go to Steve who's calling from Bangor Maine you're on the air Steve
I Would agree with that oh that is absolutely I find that in my own you know all all will go um [noise] it's a generational thing where we social media and lit up but I think
There are a few meals are are motivated you know they listen to their mothers or the grandmother you know uh the slogans like we really come a long way we are this is like
Where we haven't we still have men mostly now in their fifties who are making decisions you know on a ... year ... you know talk about sexual assault in the ... and then go on and done nothing to control the military and the
And and so obviously you're loaded the bottom line your nails are motivated organizing a Alexander ... el ... court as New York court gee that's another one yeah like all that are normally you know got really have a woman can't really you know get out of the kitchen
Will seem you know since you brought up the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez a victory there I I Want to actually take that and thank you so much for your call and turn it to Caitlyn Huey burns because you know we heard Michael say earlier or just a minute to Michael worn saying
That um you know he asks and I think it's a good question uh you know how many democratic voters are they're left to be woken up for these midterms um uh but as the caller pointed out there's the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez are raised in New York I had a ... victory in Massachusetts as well I mean to those
Those those campaign so they want because they brought voters to the poll who's ... who had never voted before so you could the Kavanaugh stuff further galvanize those young people
Well I think that Michael brings up a really key point and something that question that I've been hearing from Republicans as what is the ceiling of enthusiasm for Democrats we know that at a snare we've seen it and the turnout numbers from the primaries we've also seen in terms of women
