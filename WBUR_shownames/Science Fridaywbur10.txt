It's here now hundreds of Muslims survivors of the earthquake and tsunami that devastated Indonesia gathered outside crumble mosques and on the beach with is an army hit for friday prayers today the disaster a week ago today killed more than Fifteen hundred people that number's going to rise
You've probably been listening to NPR international correspondent Julie McCarthy who's made it to the city of ... on the island of sue the less at one of the hardest hit areas Julie what are you seeing
It's extremely dark here but there are a few street lamps on most of the houses appear to be deserted
Very few lights are on um gas stations are indeed open there are lines but earlier that kind of harried
A jam crushed that's just not there I also saw earth movers for the first time at the Roma yawn a shopping mall you remember that was this huge shopping mall that was destroyed in the disaster but I have to say Robin there is no mass government mobilization
One week later that is ... this is a do it yourself affair of full of good Samaritans
Yeah and and in the areas that have been devastated I mean the pictures just ... you know we almost get numb to these pictures of toppled homes and buckle roads and smashed cars in body bags um but you know what how do you take that and
You know you you take it in with personal stories of people you take it in with the man who sits and described to you and he's had with a far off looking as I
Um this complete conflict that he has inside his his self that he ... that that he survived but
At what cost he kept saying things like
It you you may think we were selfish when we just ran um because their loved ones were left behind in in in his case he left the father behind he said he was he was praying and his house he said we had seconds to
To get out um and they were luckily on the street he looked up germs or saw wall of water coming at them
And just ran it you know in some ways it's it's so serendipitous and miraculous that people survive these these sorts of events because this is this a zoo nominee is coming at them like a locomotive and it's just building steam and it's building height and so I think it's the personal
Stories um of of people who whose lives are completely shattered you know there are a thousands tens of thousands of people whose livelihood has been destroyed
The economics of this city robbing are simply not an up and going concern right now and the vice president said it's going to take two years for that to happen
I think by the look of it it will take much longer
But you know this question but what does it look like there are you you you would be forgiven if you drove through and thought or some areas the Joe Joe through some areas and said well there are there what could possibly have gone wrong here
And other areas that are completely
On on recognizable
For example a church moved and untie or over a mile it was moved by the churning earth below it
In one area to bowl a vast expanse set on swamp land it must be said was part of this churning of the earth someone called that said the ground was like a blender the earthquake was like a blender just gobbling up houses and its weight they don't know
How many people are are are are lying belief that that mountain mountain of mud is what I saw and so that will take a long time to do on earth and they don't have the equipment here to do it yet and that is part of the mystery of this point
How many people perished we know a French rescues were very frustrated they thought that with their equipment they heard signs of life under a four star hotel the collapse now they're thinking that that might have been a gas leak or something that they the there is no life there that you mentioned the lack of coordinated government response
So yeah long term recovery but what about you know tomorrow to people have food do they have water
They don't have food they don't have water they're scrounging for it and they're begging borrowing it
On there are people coming in from the outside driving for hours to deliver aid
Um that said what you had
A sort of amassing a at a ... among the big aid effort the ramped up aid effort the Japanese the um the um the New Zealand or is um and the Indians have
Have on the ground here evidently um hundreds of tons of supplies they're just not getting here you don't see evidence of it there is no running water electricity is extremely spotty um gasoline again extremely spotty and people who get it are leaving
NPR international correspondent Julie McCarthy in Palo Indonesia and the area devastated by earthquake tsunami and there was also about Keno a Julie thank you so much
Thank you Robin well the United states is not the only country dealing with political polarization Sunday's election in Brazil is expected to be the country's most polarized vote in decades
There's widespread distrust among the electric because a record number of lawmakers have been caught up in a massive corruption scandal polls show that's driving voters too far left and far right candidate joining us now from Rio de Janeiro is Tim francs or the BBC Tim
Or what's at stake in this election in Brazil
For a lot of people will say that democracy is at stake and the reason they will say that particularly opponents of the man who is leading the presidential campaign including the opinion polls
That they said because he ... he's a fall right congressman who
Was sort of sprung from ... ah he's a threat to the Democratic norms are in Brazil and this is just says he is remember from when there was a minute free dictatorship here so will vote democracy is vibrancy in this country
That people don't take it for granted equally supportive of Mr ... and already said that they are the ones who are going to rescue Brazil ... she's all the people who have been responsible for a surge in crime a surgeon corruption and the worst recession
That the country has ever experience so they say that
You know Brazil is on the mortal threat if the left gas and hence Europe's the right to do about ... but also the language people use about what is at stake in this election could not be morph rules
And we should also remember that two of the last few presidents or one of them is in jail right now the other was forced out of office
And that is ... ... depends a lot of the opposition to the main challenges to this fall right presidential candidates because the work is policy the P. T. to give it it's a
... ... they would impact she has been she's two thousand and six team
And all that watch the largest corruption scandal that Brazil is ever seen and in fact his ... much of Latin America a two groups and ... presidents messier Lula da Silva
Who was a two term president in Brazil the P. C. had been hoping to feel to him as a candidate in this election but he was sentenced to twelve years in jail for corruption of you to us and so they put up a bit of a man for them to a dodgy
Who comes had some ... more ... less charismatic ah I'm he's funny difficulties he's the second in the opinion polls at the moment but he's funny difficult
To punch through against the the brush populism of ...
Or people excited about this election or some people not even gonna bother to vote because of all this
Other thing is either to be honest I think people are on tens of about this election and I think a lot of people
Are feeling [noise] ... ... she's a state so polarized so the choices facing them but they really have to choose it's apathy isn't isn't an option and I think one of the key things that you have to remember here is this
The ... caves misogynistic racist homophobic amen even the police officers to warmly about dictatorship even about those who was tortured and killed for the states I'm most of people
Feel very strongly that the workers policy has having shops in Brazil and all their Walsh corruption crime on recession has been result

Protesters clamoring in Washington is Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court cleared a major procedural hurdle to date in the Senate a final vote on his confirmation is expected tomorrow let's bring in NPR's Brakkton Booker has
Been talking with people outside the Capitol today Brakkton we can hear some protesters in the background what are you seeing there
Yeah Germany well this crowd has a bit since the cloture vote to face a little while ago but they're still about two hundred or so people some holding signs that read stop Kavanaugh and others that are safe leads the survivors
Are and they come back tomorrow but I can tell you the crowds were not as big as the word yesterday it was just trying to figure out what it's like these are some of the most fervent supporters of the senators who were trying to convince to be against the nomination
Are there people they're supporting Kevin [noise] there are some I Would say a handful of
On one hand there's a lot if you saw that were in support of Kavanaugh one
Person who actually described himself as an independent I talked to him in front of the Supreme Court
He said he was there to to push back on this circus like atmosphere those are his words a that surrounded the nomination of of ... he's saying that the Democrats have brought it on themselves and that they they made a spectacle out of the nomination process
There was another gentleman I met a says he was a member of the n._r._a. and it was really there
To show support for in our area but he said that he's using to West Virginia and a couple of weeks wanting mentioned to do the right thing which in this case was to go to a vote I guess the first half and
Then we still don't know what mentioned is going to do tomorrow in that final vote how far have people traveled to get to Washington
So we've met people from uh from Illinois is that people from Denver ah we've met people from all in Michigan we've does the furthest I think we've heard prefers that someone has traveled or group of people that have trouble is from Alaska from Anchorage event uh some folks that
Were part of a hundred women that that traveled from Anchorage to try to get in front of a Senator Lisa Murkowski
Or to try to influence her vote they said uh there was a group of a number of them with her yesterday and ah they were trying to make sure that she was a no vote which ended up doing in this cloture vote again it may be seeing what she's going to do tomorrow
Well just briefly practice a lot of ah protesters have made their way into the capital to try to have their voices heard by senators are getting into elevators et cetera what kind of access or protest is getting inside the Capitol just briefly
Yes they're they're still getting in I had not been inside the Capitol today but they're not being impeded by by Capitol police to get in on this process is going to continue throughout the day and and you can probably see that happen tomorrow as well
Right That's NPR's Brakkton Booker outside the capital back and thank you thank you well
As we continue to follow everything with Brett Kavanaugh at the U.S Capitol today a number of Senate races
Are in the balance with four weeks or so to go until election day let's get to our Senate tracker series this week we're looking at the race in Nevada where Republican senator Dean Heller he's facing a challenge from democratic congresswoman Jacky Rosen joining us now from Las Vegas is Joe Shannon hosting senior producer at Nevada public radio Joe
Hey how ya doing doing well and let's start with the Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen a relative newcomer to politics compared to tell her she was president of her synagogue before Democrats are back in twenty sixteen tapped her to run for Congress where she is serving her first term what else should we know better
Oh just a quick uh bio she's sixty one she's the mother of a college aged daughter her husband's a radiologist
She lives in Henderson which is a city adjacent to Vegas and she moved here from the Midwest after her parents moved here this was back in college she was a waitress at Caesar's Palace she had a degree from a community college
And then she got under the national scene really by surprise when former Senate majority leader Harry Reid asked her to run for the house which she won and twenty sixteen meeting Danny Tarkanian in a really close race
And we remember that Harry Reid represented the state of Nevada let's listen to one of the ads from Jacky Rosen that's airing on TV just kind of going on the offensive here it opens up with a shot of one of those inflatable Gombe type things you see outside a car dealership blowing in the wind and then she equate that to Dean Heller
Calling senators mindless because Dean Heller beds with the political when first promising to vote against the land where people Obamacare because it would hurt in Nevada Dean Heller from Nevada is a no
You're right now I Can't go supported the piece of legislation to ensure that we should ... Americans but but
Then Dean Heller got pressure from his party leaders
From President Trump loud and clear this was the one we were worried about you were there but they're going to be our focus
Promise and voted for repeal a deciding vote just or how
How big of an issue is that flip by Dean Heller
It's a pretty big issue in those ads have
Seemed to be making I'm quite a mark here you know this was the vote about about a year ago maybe a little bit more Heller initially at the start of the summer said no he was for keeping Obamacare or the Affordable CARE Act
And then he changed his tune and it was such a huge change the Nevada house representative mark ... who is also a Republican was quoted as saying hey it's pretty clear you change your mind you probably ought to tell people why
It just for the record neither ... nor his campaign has ever agreed to come on our program to talk about that or any other issue
Or what about Dean Heller um here's one of his ads
I don't have time for politicians talk but don't deliver I'm not telling me what
You're going to use just doing
The hell are getting things done forty pieces of legislation to how by veteran part is the capital
From on top of delivered to the actual Dean Heller is our ... our
Our boys
Seem less interesting
To note that all the people speaking of that ad are women
Yeah that really really stand out look I I don't trust falls but by the late a CNN poll of less than a week ago he's losing big with women women preferred Jacky Rosen by fourteen points over Heller fifty two to thirty eight percent that's a huge drop from the summer when Heller was at about fifty percent with women
[noise] what else do we know about ... other than the fact that he sort of straddling between supporting his party and you know voting against his party occasionally
Yeah no that's really the kind of become a central issue although he ... until this race he was a modest not quite a centrist but just sort of you know he would always vote unreliable issues against Yucca Mountain for instance um
This is the nuclear waste site in Nevada
Yeah about Ninety miles north of here there's a mountain where they want to store the nuclear waste or for the country
Or the health care issue he seemed you know reliably sort of in the middle it's sort of when I'm Sheldon Adelson the billionaire a got involved he's been called a peacemaker by the New York times he he called Heller and in and said you know uh don't opposed Trump on this
Um that's what the hell are seem to change his vote and um the Adelson in turn have uh given to his campaign war chest
Is Adelson a huge player still in Nevada politics
Huge huge player he's worth tens of billions of dollars maybe the most maybe the richest men in the world um yeah he's front and center you need
Him on your side in order to hold office there
[noise] ... just this will be the ... election to see if that is the is the case
[noise] ah any sense of how the cabinet or a nomination fight is playing with voters in Nevada
... said that sexual assault allegation against Brett Kavanaugh was a checkup it did explode across the social media landscape here um
And and of course that CNN poll I just talked about showed a huge drop with women supporters for Heller but I haven't seen a poll asking a direct question of how women feel about Heller in the aftermath of the Kavanaugh hearings
What would you say is the biggest issue for voters in Nevada this November
This election is I think it's not the heart and soul of Nevada I Do think President Trump will be on the minds of voters Democrats or Republicans everything when they go to the polls because through his words his tweets his actions he has made politics about values
