From NPR News this is all things considered I'm Ari Shapiro
And I'm Mary Louise Kelly and judge Brett Kavanaugh is now one step away from a seat on the Supreme Court looks like he has the votes he needs to be confirmed in a final vote
Tomorrow this afternoon last undecided Republican Susan Collins of Maine delivered a lengthy for speech she talked about Kavanaugh's qualifications for the Supreme Court before she turned to the allegations of sexual assault against him and said this is
The presumption of innocence and fair that you know they're on my thinking and I cannot abandon them
Than for the next twenty minutes she walked through why she ultimately believed the charges against Kavanaugh should knocked prevent him from serving on the Supreme Court her conclusion
Mr President I Will vote chicken for judge Kavanaugh
Minutes after that West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin said he would also support the nominee or we're going to bring in NPR's Kelsey Snell she is on Capitol Hill she has been tracking all of this back and forth today he kills either high so I Want to ask and just a second a little bit more about what senator Collins said but first just the headline
Is there any suspense at this point how this confirmation fight is likely to shake out
Well now that mansion has said that he remains I guess this is essentially they had the fifty one votes the fifty on people who voted yes before our very likely now to vote yes tomorrow when the final confirmation vote comes up
Now that's not to say that some crazy thing could happen but now I'm not going to happen we have to keep those catty outgoing but this means that the support that that we saw earlier today it seems to stand and it means that vice president Mike Pence did not appear to be needed to break any ties writes
A role but he might have had to play how to how to not checking out quite this way today okay senator Collins as she laid out her position and the links for speeches or you just said a did appear to have been undecided anytime that recently I'm and she was from start to finish it was pretty clear how she was wanting to vote
Yet she basically used her speech as a kind of closing argument did was as much that a closing argument for Kavanaugh as anything else
Um she basically was saying that he is not the extreme partisan that Democrats have been saying he is
And she walks through all of the ways that he's more moderate than he's been portrayed that she did that for more than forty minutes and she made it pretty tough case there she said that she didn't like that this had become what she called the gutter level political campaign instead of a fallen confirmation process
Earlier today she had lunch with Senator Mitch McConnell and I was in the room there while she was making that speech and he sat in just a few seats away from her and turned his seat so he could watch her well she spoke and it was it was a it was ... it was clear that he was prepared and ready and kind of knew
What was coming to me a little bit more about how she said she wrestled with the allegations of sexual assault
Yet she said that she believes that something may have happened to forward and ah Christine Blasey Ford the woman who originally accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault but she says she doesn't think that the process that they went through it and going through his record on earth any evidence that it was Kavanaugh's who did it
And she's sticking to her belief and the presumption of innocence and she spoke about that quite a bit um and about the idea that this isn't a trial but that due process is still something she believes in

Are you a little difficult to make out there but that's
Some tape from the court room with the jurors reading out the verdict there I Know that during the trial many were surprised at the defense put Jason Van Dyke on the stand how did his testimony compared to what was shown repeatedly on on a video of the shooting
Well she has to fight that he saw the corn that Donald raised a nice up to his shoulder and the video ... see that happening
He also testified that at some point look phonic Donald after he was on the ground tried to push himself up you also cannot feet back on the video when push on that point chicken pancakes said that he had a different perspective and with a video camera was so that can represent what he
Saw him on a pretty heart basically saying your testimony isn't matching reality
As we said there were significant protests after the dashcam video was initially released how is the city been preparing for this verdict and how do you expect the community to react to it

That he demonstrated a lack of judicial testament it temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice
Who we didn't last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens
Is the thing that the rule judge and they should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind
To Malcolm so these are not he said she quit she said questions there that are being raised these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think
Sure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's a temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the ISI circuit court of appeals in our audience who
Know him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week was testifying
That is certainly true I think that there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught against him
That he would have acted like and what time is on I had
By the way he acted like in ...
I think the response which had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if you did at the American bar association of course interviewed well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers
And said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as a Supreme Court justices well
People coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim as a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy
That this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice while I forward
Sure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not base he leaves based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about to sacrifice that wealth has a reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court
I wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously ... had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the ... ... you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either
But to that specific remark and he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics
Absolutely I I think there is no question that she found the tactics
Of some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when it comes truly on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respecting the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker had his Spartacus moment
In his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal and he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he and he said there are some things they shouldn't have said what things get what you do not have said
Well he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to centered ... uh for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the collar but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's strengths and the ... gang rape
If that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will
End very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that
You know he I think there is no question that the Democrats and you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I like not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota

Listening to all things considered from NPR News
The U.S unemployment rate reached an important milestone in September it dropped to its lowest level in nearly fifty years it's now three point seven percent according to the government's monthly employment report today's news is a big positive for many workers by the challenge for businesses NPR's John Ydstie has the story
Sarah houses senior economist at Wells Fargo says it's hard to overstate the significance of this super low unemployment rate
I think it's a huge deal
And houses the lowest unemployment rate in half a century has businesses scrambling
That top concern or hearing from and players they can't find more hurry that
Could limit their ability to grow their companies and put a drag on the overall economy but how says those historically low jobless rate is a positive for many workers
And also of course has sent Connecticut implications for wages there
Are signs that wage growth is finally picking up as employers are being forced to boost paid to attract and keep workers
Economist Dean Baker says low wage workers are among those benefiting partly because many cities and states have raised minimum wages to September jobs data showed average wages growing at just to point eight percent over the past year but lower income workers experienced much bigger gains
For twenty three percent over last year so some of the minimum wage was but I think some of that is the tightening labor market
And Baker says the super low unemployment rate is helping those at the bottom of the economic ladder finally get a toehold in the first wrong
When you start to get the unemployment rate down load people benefit of disproportionately goes bottom so you're seeing people that historically not been able to get jobs at least recently not able to get jobs the markets opening up to them
Black teenagers are a good example the black teen unemployment
That's the good news bad news is that it's still above Nineteen percent
And that's why Baker believes the Federal Reserve should not panic and start raising interest rates more rapidly to keep the economy from overheating so who should get the credit for engineering this low unemployment rate
The White House took some credit today touting President Trump's policies on deregulation tax cuts and trade
Former President Obama also get some credit for reducing the unemployment rate by more than half during his administration Baker who is senior economist at the center for economic research and policy says both administrations have a case but
The fed is really a hero
Baker says remember that just four years ago the consensus among fed policymakers was that once the unemployment rate fell below five and a half percent inflation pressures were built
A lot of them wanted to raise interest rates should you know look I'm getting too low you have a problem with the PlayStation
But former fed chair Janet Yellen said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally began raising rates gradually and has continued that pays under the Fed's current leader Jerome Powell
If you followed the view of many people in the bed and many other economists they would start to slam on the brakes she'd be on a one way to get around five percent and they never would have allowed it to get this low
And Baker says that would have meant millions of people might not have gotten the jobs they now have John Ydstie NPR News Washington

Okay if you went looking to trace the arc of this me to a moment we're living through you'd be hard pressed to come up with better bookends than the following today the U.S Senate voting to cut off debate on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court and move to a final vote despite allegations of sexual assault in his past
And one year ago today with a New York times broke a bombshell story
The times headline on October fifth twenty Seventeen read Harvey Weinstein paid off sexual harassment accusers for decades or one of the two reporters who broke that Weinstein story was Jodi Kantor and she joins me now hey there
Hi how are you I'm well thank you I started here you just pointed out today a picture of what you were up to a year ago today and it's it's a bunch of you all crowded around to the computer and the New York Times' newsroom about to hit send on the Weinstein story and you write none of us knew what was going to happen when we got out into the world
We didn't my partner Megan too and I we certainly felt the power of the story as we were reporting it and because the times was doing bigger investigations of sexual harassment we knew that this was part of the system and it wasn't just about Harvey Weinstein we were reporting on Bill O'Reilly and we were reporting on Fort factory workers
But you never know what's gonna happen to an investigation wet it's when it's published and you know one of our editors I'm Matt party
Like to say as we were working on it he said hurting winds dean is not that famous and that is true aside from New York and LA andme E. D. D. C. he really was not a household name 'em
And and what we've seen happen is that not only did the me too movement which was founded years ago by Toronto park
Takeoff globally but it just kept going and going
And going there were so many times in the past year when I saw productions that this was going to burn out or you know the women were all then a simmered down or the news was finally going to stop and it never did and what's happening with judge happened I I think is representative of that there's a feeling that this reckoning only continues and grows bigger
Let me ask you this if Kavanaugh is confirmed a with a full Senate vote this weekend [noise] do you see that as a step back to the momentum of me too
Think if he's confirmed there will be massive debate about what this means for the me too movement and I think there are two contradictory answers both of which probably have some validity I'll give you the ... the obvious one is that people will say this as a setback he was confirmed anyway
Uh these really serious allegations of sexual assault didn't matter um
Women were ... you know ignored yet again this is a replay of any of the hell the other argument however is that
Especially what Dr Christine Blasey Ford did was really important uh that she spoke up inside of the entire country she put high school on the table right she made a case that these things that that happened in our collective youth
We also found moments like with um the two protesters and the alligator with Jeff Flake where they were literally stop a national conversation for a second and say listen to these stories
One footnote to this conversation before I let you go Jody ... we just heard there from our reporter psoriasis or hurting that today also marks the order of the Nobel Peace prize that prize that is often seen sending a political message
Um and the word went to people working to stop sexual violence as a weapon of war I Wonder if that's one more book and if you like to the the global scope of this me to
Moment that you helped set in motion a year ago
I look up to the same news and have the same time I think it's a reminder and all I think it's a reminder of global reach that point and also media reminder prospect at at the moment when we are all so immersed in the cabin on the news media this as a reminder that this topic is it's even bigger than that in a way
[noise] Jodi Kantor she broke the Harvey Weinstein story for the New York times one year ago today ... thank you thank you so much

From NPR News this is all things considered I'm Ari Shapiro
And I'm Mary Louise Kelly and judge Brett Kavanaugh is now one step away from a seat on the Supreme Court looks like he has the votes he needs to be confirmed in a final vote
Tomorrow this afternoon the last undecided Republican Susan Collins of Maine delivered a lengthy for speech she talked about Kavanaugh's qualifications for the Supreme Court before she turned to the allegations of sexual assault against him and said this is
The presumption of innocence and fair that do beer on my thinking and I cannot abandon them
Then for the next twenty minutes she walked through why she ultimately believe the charges against Kavanaugh should knocked prevent him from serving on the Supreme Court her conclusion Mr President
I Will vote chicken for judge Kavanaugh
Minutes after that West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin said he would also support the nominee or we're gonna bring in NPR's Kelsey Snell she is on Capitol Hill she has been tracking all of this back and forth today who tells you either high so I Want to ask and just a second a little bit more about what senator coincide but first just the headline
Is there any suspense at this point how this confirmation fight is likely to shake out
Well now that mansion has said that he remains I guess this is essentially they had the fifty one does the fifty on people who voted yes before our very likely now to vote yes tomorrow when the final confirmation vote comes up
Now that's not to say that some crazy thing couldn't happen but now I'm not going to happen you know we have to keep those catty outgoing but this means that the support it that that we saw earlier today it seems to stand and it means that vice president Mike Pence did not appear to be needed to break any ties writes
A role but he might have had to play had it had it not checking out quite this way today okay senator Collins as she laid out her position and no links leave for speeches or you just said a did appear to have been undecided anytime
It was pretty clear how she was wanting to vote yet she basically used her speech as a kind of closing argument it was as much of that a closing argument for Kavanaugh as anything else
Um she basically we're saying that he is not the extreme partisan that Democrats have been saying he is
And she walks through all of the ways that he's more moderate than he's been portrayed and that she did that for more than forty minutes and she made it pretty tough case there she said that she didn't like that this had become what she called gutter level political campaign instead of a solemn confirmation process
Earlier today she had lunch with I'm Senator Mitch McConnell and I was in the room there while she was making that speech and he sat in just a few seats away from her and turned his seat so he could watch her well she spoke and it was it was it was ... it was clear that he was prepared and ready and kind of knew what was coming
To me a little bit more about how she said she wrestled with the allegations of sexual assault
Yet she said that she believes that something may have happened to forward and ah Christine Blasey Ford the woman who originally accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault but she says she doesn't think that the process that they went through it and going through his record on earth any evidence that it was cabinet ... who did it

This is all things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise
Kelly and I'm Ari Shapiro in Chicago today a stunning verdict for the police officer who shot and killed a black teenager Jason Van Dyke was found guilty of second degree murder he shot the Koran McDonald sixteen times
It was caught on camera and sparked an uproar in Chicago it also triggered the Justice Department to conduct an investigation into the police department
Finding a pattern of excessive force WB easy Shannon Heffernan has been reporting on the trial for months and joins us now Hi Shannon ... this guilty verdict is a huge deal for the city of Chicago what is the reaction
Well because I've been able to speak to so far has said that while they were hoping for a first degree murder charge they're satisfied with eight second degree murder charge this is something we haven't seen happen in Chicago for decades so I think for those activists feeling like a moment of celebration
We've also heard from representatives for police like the police union there of course I'm happy with this verdict and concern for what it will mean for policing going forward
The convicted police officer Jason Van Dyke actually
Took the stand this week in his defense during this trial what did he say
Well he described ... McDonald as somebody to be a feta he described his face as a frightening describes his eyes blank um he said that the that that law clinic Donald raised and light up to his shoulder
Um which is not something you can shape looking at the ... video of districts that act so the prosecutors really push too hard on why his version of that didn't match with video
What kind of an impact you expect this verdict to have on the relationship between the Chicago police department and the African American community well
I think that's hard to say that because I think that the tension here had been more about more than just look on McDonald's you'll have to remember that in addition to this trial there is another trial would lead it to the shooting
There are three officers charged with conspiracy for exaggerating the threat of a chronic Donald a preventive at night and there were reports and I think that there's this feeling that the shooting was a a problem that the community field but also that feeling that officers covered it up so I think
We'll be watching closely what happens in that trial and how she reacts to that
As we've reported on so many police involved shootings and in so many cases the officers are acquitted this conviction is a rare exception what do you think made a different well
I think the number of shot six soon made a big difference in this case I also think the fact that there were multiple other officers unseen that night who encountered the comic Donald and chose not to shoot I think that that was important to a lot of folks that fact of asked
The w._b. easy reporter Shannon Heffernan reporting on the trial and conviction of Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke so guilty today of second degree murder Shannon thanks so much thank you so much

Dollars a minute is really what we have to do and the next couple of hours of Jaycee said and it sounds ambitious and it is but we don't ask for any more money than we need this is the amount of money that it takes to bring you comprehensive news and great conversations and original reporting

So if you want to keep W. B. you are a place of independent and strong and full of integrity and the kind of journalism that you rely on and that you trust call now this is the time to show us how much this means to you one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or W. B. U. R. dot org
And we're now down to a hundred and thirty three thousand dollars to raise by seven o'clock tonight we can do it you really are coming through for us on this one drive and we so appreciated we need to make one hundred thirty three thousand more that means as magnets at a thousand dollars a minute we know we can do it
Because you have done it for us prior to this and we have way more than a thousand people who are listening right now by the way those who've already pledge
Thank you so much if you haven't do your part it could be a fifty dollar pledge a ten dollar pledge a you could do a ten dollar pledge a month and become a sustain or just make the call right now in support the station that you know it was a nonprofit noncommercial radio station but it's one you've chosen so supportive
Eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or W. B. U. R. dot org is how you get your contribution to us maybe you yourself can give a thousand dollars but you know no matter what you give your going to be protecting independent journalism without support and you're going to get yourself
A chance to win a choice of a couple of nice new Tony Nineteen Subaru sim city side Subaru in Belmont somebody wins the choice of those cars at seven o'clock and it could be you if you give right now one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or W. B. U. R. dot O. R. G.
Down to a hundred and thirty thousand now so that's terrific just we've got three thousand dollars a last minute and a half of that kind of pace exactly that we need to keep up one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or W. B. U. R. dot org and just an echo at least suggest said
Thank you to everyone who's done their part throughout this entire fundraiser even even earlier this year and thank you all of you who are about to call one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven to keep W. B. you are strong and independent
See that we just started a a a new quarter and you know that there are a media corporations focused on reporting a quarterly profit W. B. U. R. instead it's focused on reporting the stories that matter to you and to the community so protect
Independent journalism you protected and you keep it strong and powerful in fact with your donations he'll make the call now
Decide what to leave the army needs to be a one eight hundred nine zero nine nine eight seven or W. B. U. R. I. dot org added incentive a Subaru is riding on your phone call you will automatically be entered in to
Say that when they respond they basically said nothing like this ever happened when you give me a sense of how many officials you talked to who were informing your reporting
Give you some sense of the cluster of ah sources 'cause that's really important so we had several sources inside of the U.S intelligence community we had several sources inside law enforced and we had sources inside of the other parts of the U.S government but we also more importantly had sources inside the companies who were these chips were found the interesting thing about apple and out
It very valuable companies but they also have pretty good security the fact that they found these chips was amazing in itself
Now companies room you're spots for saying what they what they want to say but based on our sourcing and the way it was layer for so many different places including inside of the companies were really confident that we had a story down so what are the implications of this well they're more they're just they're they're really large
Economic and national security that's right in part because
The global economy is built on sort of global outsourcing trade model
And again especially where it comes to technology China is a huge player and not
And the implications of this or companies now have to think well do I have to worry about what's being put in the technology that's being manufactured how do I try and counter that is it should I go someplace else and make things
I mean it's a it's a really big hard issue to solve a for a lot of companies a lot of companies the reason they operate and as cheaply and can sell products that she plays the cat is because many of those ... products are made in China they have to rethink the entire model you get a sort of a tidal wave of decisions that could impact the the global economy [noise]
Your reporting continues on flick is

We're down to a hundred and six thousand dollars now one hundred six thousand dollars that we need to raise in the next hour and fifty three minute so that just puts us a little bit under needing to keep up that pace of a thousand dollars a minute and here I was going to say one quick thing I Know
You're listening I Know you're listening right now and I know how deeply WB you our listeners do pay attention to what they hear on this radio station because
At least you can vouch for this we hear from folks all the time give us feedback on things that they've heard on all things considered on on point on radio Boston on MORNING edition and the level of detail with with which we get the feedback it shows me that people care
They listen deeply they engage with the material they here here and they want us sometimes push back I mean there's an intelligence intelligent report that we have with you as the listening community here at W. B. you are because you trust us
You want us to remain independent and so I wanted just reach out to all of you folks who who are out there who listening right now and say

We've been saying we need to raise about a thousand dollars a minute it's actually nine hundred and thirty eight dollars five three cents per minute but we have to do that every single minute between now and seven o'clock that's why it's important that we all step up

And we can do this and I think we will do this you just have to pick up the phone and do your part now five dollars ten dollars twenty dollars

Just think about what part of that you can give maybe ten Fifteen dollars a month maybe you can give five thousand dollar contribution we've had a handful of those in this fund drive
So consider what you can give consider what is at stake in this country and how important this journalism is do you do your family your community and give what you can one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or W. B. U. R. dot O. R. G. N. J.
We're down to one hundred thousand dollars now so it's really important psychological landmark here we've got to get it under three digits well actually technically it's ... just right but we got to get it under a hundred thousand supposed to be fair fight and keep going keep pushing
Keep picking up that phone for those of you who haven't yet already and call one eight hundred nine zero nine
Nine to eight seven as J just said and I think this is the point that cannot be underscored enough
Now is the time that we need journalism that you can trust
You know almost more than ever
We said that for many years now but it doesn't stop being true journalism that you can trust journalism that is independent
Journalism that brings us we just heard from all things considered over the past twenty minutes or so voices from all across the aisle in Congress as senators are really grappling with a difficult but yet vital decision they have to make
About who might next sit on the United States Supreme court one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven is the number to call it that's the kind of far reaching balanced independent journalism that you want to bring into your life every day
Ninety nine thousand dollars now thanks to all of us have called and just the past couple of minutes thanks you all have you've called through this one drive in fact if you haven't do so now we have less than an hour and a half in which raised Ninety nine thousand dollars magnet just mentioned there the Brett Kavanaugh hearings and the controversy around his nomination to the high court
You also heard on all things considered just a few minutes ago that remembrance a really lovely one of one Romero the man who when he was a teenage busboy held Robert Kennedy's head as Kennedy was dying after he was shot on the campaign trail

The Labor Department comes out with the latest jobs report tomorrow and economists expect to see more new jobs being created at a healthy pace
But there aren't just more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this hike artist hey are what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more well
My favorite indicator dynamism is probably the quits rate that's just the share of people who quit to voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so it shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work a and looking for something else
So you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a high rate that's actually a good sign economically
I mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it
Up but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit
And when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there
Actually a lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand
And that doesn't mean that everyone who once worked will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it
And is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings and others
No no it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at the health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels
And then there's this category called professional and business services those are like high end services things like design accounting law advertising in all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities
If employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are
You know this has been puzzling economist for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that there are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now
Said that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that actually there were more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but they're also more workers available to be found
What does all this mean for the economy as a whole
You know when the economy's more dynamic it tends to give people more bargaining power so wage growth that's been kind of sluggish in the last few years very disappointing it could be about to get better it also makes the economy a bit more efficient more productive
Because if people are finding jobs that are a good match for their skill set a it makes them better at their jobs and it also means that companies will be more likely to invest in the kinds of tools and equipment that will make them more efficient so it's good all the way around both for the workers and for the economy
That's ... Garcia co host of our economic podcast the indicator from Planet Money they fought pleasure Ari thanks

Protect independent journalism become a sustaining number right now here's how [noise]
Us before we go back to all things considered in just a couple of minutes ... with Jay Clayton in Deborah Becker and we are encouraged
That uh you appreciate a free press but freedom of the press or not only as you just heard Andrea Shea say doesn't require a certain people to pay for it but it also doesn't mandate the truth or accuracy or balance and we know
That those are the reasons that you listen to W. B. U. R. because there are many places you could get information on the dial this is a place you've chosen so help us pay for it because you will never hear

And going back to what Andrea was saying yeah the founding fathers didn't say anything about how this would all be paid for but President Johnson did he signed the public broadcasting are back in Nineteen sixty seven and that act said there ought to be and will be and now is some space in the media landscape
For radio and television stations that are on encumbered by commercial pressures that is WB you are that is independent journalism it is all about how it is funded and listeners play the most important role in funding this and that is why it is important
To think about what you can do to help W. B. U. R. bring you the news what part of that eight thousand dollars you can contribute maybe it's ten dollars a month and for that will send you the New Yorker for a year as our thanks for your contribution
Normally it it'd be Fifteen dollar among the contribution but through seven o'clock tonight only ten dollars a month to get to the New Yorker and its support WB you are

I'm at and and the whole pan of all you can see them on line at the artery
At W. B. U. R. dot org and ah and also climate we've made a real priority of climate science the environment

The federal government was so unprepared to carry out the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant families earlier this year that it wasn't even ready to house the children nor did even have a plan to reunite them with their parents that is from a scathing report from the homeland security department
The administration has abandoned its policy of separating families to deter illegal immigration but only after widespread outrage and after more than twenty six hundred children were already separated from their parents
To talk more about the d._a. chess inspector general's findings were joined by NPR's Joel Rose hail hail so so you know we've been hearing all year about the problems with this policy of separating families but why isn't new in this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration
Well it contradicts some early assurances that we got from federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's da chest secretary cures to Nielsen
It is important to note that these miners are very well taken care of don't believe the press they are very well taken care of
But this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that the H. S. held hundreds of migrant children in border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days
And many of these children were held in metal cages in border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to has children
And as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other in the system after they were separated
Well again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress
There's no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds could find any child in our care for any parent
Ha just by the way cared for children after they were separated while da chess had custody of their parents and at the time da just said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children
As central database did the inspector general find that central database
The inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children
The government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all and then what happened to those families
The government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower
And the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children it anyway no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that the authorities were able to find these children and reunite them
So have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way
Well as the administration often does is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote
VHS does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the H. S. also acknowledge that the government's computer system still do not communicate across these agencies ...
Are there any children who still haven't been reunited with their parents
[noise] oh yeah more than a hundred and thirty remain in us custody apart from their parents mostly because those parents have already been deported without them back to Central America
All right That's NPR's Joel Rose thanks very much Jill you're walking [noise]

But a lot of them were really more I think he would believe me but I'm afraid it would just destroy him he thinks it's his job to protect me and he would feel like he failed
It is it only fathers or are people concerned about telling their mothers as well
[noise] I did get responses from people concerned about telling their mothers but
I think often survivors are putting their parents in different categories a lot of wind and said I told my mother and learns that she had been a victim to or I told my mother because I thought she would understand what it's like to walk through the world
As a young woman and so they they were really afraid that their fathers in particular wouldn't understand on the same level or might feel squeamish or embarrassed to be talking about these kinds of things
You write that a lot of taboos Missouri exist because women don't want to make men uncomfortable with lead paint explain what you mean by that
[noise] you know just just thinking about tropes in sitcoms where
The dad is sent to buy a pack of ... for his daughters or his wife and it's presented as the most humiliating embarrassing journey to the grocery store that he can ever make
We do that with ... we do that with breast feeding all of these things that happen on a woman's body are seen as being really embarrassing and inappropriate to talk about and I think that that exist on the spectrum where we're afraid to talk about sexual assault because it falls on this spectrum
Of gross or uncomfortable things that happen to women
Can you tell us about some of the responses that you've had to this call them since it was published this week
[laughter] yeah I've received more than five hundred emails in the past twenty four hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll read you my my favorite response yup we've
Deer Monica thank you for sharing these stories I was very moved by them because I'd never even thought of asking those questions I shared your call in with my wife for forty years and asked her head this ever happened to her and she told me a story of herself at ten I just listened and inside I broiled
I asked her should I ask my daughters and she said do you think you're ready
I didn't answer but I'll do it soon not today but the next time I see them right now though I'll have a couple of drinks and I'll think I Hope I can be of some comfort semper fi well so I've gotten a lot of emails like that a lot of emails from dads
Who are good dads
They're just really trying to think about what it means to be a good dad
I've gotten a lot of emails from men who say I always told my daughter if anyone tries to hurt you own murder them and now I'm rethinking was that the right message to send because what if that kept her silence because she didn't want me to go to jail for for murdering someone
Um so I think that these are conversations that have just been happening in secret for really long time
And good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be a comfort in them
Is part of your argument also but it's important for daughters to tell her father's about this sort of have a better understanding of what women go through
I think so I really do and a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dads for the first time because of what we're hearing into the cabin up for hearings because their fathers have said something like
I'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened
And it's causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago
And I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you so you were a father and you have a Simpsons of how a victim should behave or whether someone would or would not have told someone I think it's really meaningful to hear from women in your life that you're close to who have said
I grew up in your house you love me more than anyone and I never told you and this is why

Objects this far out with really elongated orbits are just weird the current models of solar system formation don't predict these objects Juliet Becker is an astronomer at the University of Michigan now it's possible that these models are wrong but Becker says a better ...
Planet some astronomers think is out there
In easier solution is the existence of planet nine because it naturally creates these objects in the solar system
The gravity of big planet like Jupiter Neptune Ken sling smaller objects into weird orbits if they happened to wander by but the goblet doesn't get anywhere near Jupiter Neptune so some astronomers think planet nine might be out there doing the swinging
Becker says right now only a handful of objects points to the existence of planet nine so there's plenty of skepticism that it really exists
I guess I have kind of a picture in my mind is how many new objects do we need right now we obviously don't have enough but this particular object is such a unique orbit and it's so useful that like I the kicker in my mind just jumped up like where a lot closer to having enough objects
Certainly the goblet gives new confidence to several teams already searching for planet nine but so far no luck Joe Palca NPR News [noise]

People are learning that their drinking water is polluted with a potentially harmful group of chemicals they're called pee fast P. F. A. S. and they're linked to a number of illnesses including cancer the Trump Administration is working on a plane to regulate them some in Congress are pressing for it to move faster NPR's Jeff Brady has been looking into this and joins us now Jeff
Hi Ari first of all what are these chemicals
Of several thousand manmade chemicals in some of them had been around for decades these chemicals are good at Republican oil and water and that makes them really useful for all sorts of products like nonstop cookware holdings on fast food rappers pizza boxes
And the places where pie fast says are used in manufacturing those are generally the places that are the most polluted or there's some sites in New York North Carolina Michigan just to name a few places ...
Also are in firefighting phone used at airports and military bases in some cases around the country the chemicals have migrated into local drinking water and the estimates on exactly how many people are affected very but it's safe to say that the numbers and the million
How harmful to people can these chemicals be what kinds of problems that cause the
Research is limited so it's hard to pin down exactly how harmful these chemicals are a scientist will say the pastors are linked to certain illnesses here's Laurel said her she's a research scientist with an advocacy group called the Silent Spring Institute piece
Chemicals have been linked to a wide range of health effects including cancer
Low birth weight thyroid disease elevated cholesterol and effects on the immune system
Manufacturers have agreed to stop using two forms of pee fast in the U. S. but these chemicals take a long time to break down on the environment and that's why they are still a problem now and
How regulators responding to this especially given the uncertainty
The EPA requires most water utilities to test for a list of ... passes in in twenty sixteen agency lowered a non binding health advisory limit for some ... chemicals it's now Seventy parts per trillion I'm told that it's about Seventy grains of sand and an Olympic size swimming pool
And some environmental advocates argue level should be even lower than that
But all this uncertainty it creates confusion especially for water companies like ... America it's based in suburban Philadelphia Christopher Crockett is the chief environmental officer there and he says companies like his need clearer direction from the EPA and from policymakers
To be able to explain to the public and my above or below sea level here and do we need to put treatment on in this community and how soon and that still needs to be determined and that needs to be determined as soon as possible
Now the EPA is working on a plan to manage the fast chemicals the agency just wrapped up a series of public meetings around the country the plan is expected by the end of the year
The Trump Administration has been so staunchly anti regulation especially rolling back protections meant to keep people safe from environmental contaminants why are they responding differently today is
An issue like this it really fits in with the way the Trump Administration has tried to narrow the focus of the EPA away from things like climate change and toward issues such as clean air and clean water also we should keep in mind that the EPA still working on his plan to manage be fast chemicals
And we don't know what that plan is going to look like and tell us out sometime in the next few months
So what could people do to protect themselves today
With the water utility aqua that we heard from just a minute ago they've installed these big carbon filters to bring the levels down and that works the utility says the water is safe to drink
If you're still worried about it those filters that you get in a refrigerator or water pitchers those will bring the levels down too but I've talked to people here who still just don't trust their water that it's safe and they're continuing to drink bottled water
That's NPR's Jeff Brady thanks thank you are and tomorrow we'll visit a New Hampshire town where there's concern that these chemicals are leaking from landfill into drinking water [noise]

Brett Kavanaugh he has made it clear that he has already been through six separate background checks for government jobs over the years do we know of any of his background checks revealed allegations for anything that's been mentioned so far what were they caught in any of
Those reports those background check reports are secrets on the White House and the Senate Judiciary committee led by Republicans have said they did not capture a whiff of sexual impropriety when it came to
Brett Kavanaugh and we do know that there are some clues that Kavanaugh was asked about his finances maybe some other allegations in a private hearing with the Senate Judiciary committee this year but that hearing
Has remained mostly private I reached out to Ron Klain who helped President Bill Clinton that judges claimed says there could be another issue the White House counsel's office under Donald Trump is under staffed and they've been pushing through judges at a record pace
I Wonder if the bakery is just too many cakes and maybe they're not getting the attention they deserve
By contrast round cleans as President Clinton stopped all the other judges while he pushed through Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court but judges are central to Donald Trump's legacy and his mainly pleasing his political base so I don't expect to see a lead up there in this case All right That's NPR's Carrie Johnson thanks carry my pleasure [noise]

Now to the Supreme Court where today the justices grappled with a difficult death penalty question
Does it violates the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment to execute a convicted murderer who has such severe dementia that he doesn't remember the crime he committed NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports
Burned in Madison committed a terrible crime in Nineteen eighty five after leaving his girlfriend's house he returned and shot and killed a police officer who had remained outside in his car to provide protection twice Madison was sentenced to death but the convictions were overturned because a prosecutorial misconduct
The third time he was convicted the jury recommended life in prison but Alabama has a unique law that allows a trial judge to override a jury's recommendation and the judge did just that
Madison has been on death row in solitary confinement in Alabama now for more than Thirty years in that time he suffered multiple severe strokes an MRI shows part of his brain is dead and there is no dispute that he suffers from severe vascular dementia and
His lawyer Bryan Stevenson says that Madison is so disoriented that he doesn't know what day a month or a year it is he's legally blind has difficulty walking and slurs his speech
But most critically has no memory of the circumstances of this crime the things that the state six to execute inform
Inside the Supreme Court today lawyer Stevenson told the justices that executing them and so incompetent we'd be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment in the past two decades in cases
And then all of a sudden the mentally challenged the justice who provided the fifth and deciding vote was Anthony Kennedy and he has just retired
Inside the courtroom today the justices appeared closely divided chief justice John Roberts asked whether for the purposes of the death penalty dementia is the same as someone who becomes psychotic while in prison
Lawyer Stevenson there would have to be a memory loss plus something else Justice Ginsburg what would the plus B answer brain damage that is the results of an injury so that the brain is incapable of producing memories are creating the kind of rational understanding that this court has required in the past Justice Sotomayor
So you're not talking about just amnesia answer no Mr Madison's dementia is so comprehensive that he can explain to you that he has a toilet in itself or his use
But he can't hold that memory and he routinely urinate on himself and asked the guards to take him to the toilet
The problem in this case Stephenson said is that the lower courts have said that since Madison is not delusional or a psychotic it's All right to execute him the eighth amendment he said is not like the constitutions other amendments it's a mirror of our norms and our values
And what we have argued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia renders him so frail but we'll dirt and vulnerable
That executing cannot be reconciled with the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment
Arguing for executing Madison was Alabama deputy attorney general Thomas ... junior justice prior a frequent critic of the death penalty asked this question I think if a person in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's what's the purpose of executing that person if you wouldn't executed person who's gets a friend or a delusional

President Trump said he wants the investigation to end quickly and that the FBI should look into whatever the Republican Senate wants it to he said he believes Kavanaugh was truthful in his testimony and that his family has been treated horribly but he also said he has no backup plan if Kavanaugh should withdraw or be rejected by the Senate
I Hope that he gets approved I Hope that the report comes out like a ... like I really think it should I think it will I Hope I Hope what look I'm

With the bureau itself has not provided any ah any clarity on this but NPR has learned that the FBI has interviewed Ramirez ah she's given the FBI list of people that she says either witnessed the elected incident uh or heard about it uh contemporaneously you on that though it's it's pretty much crickets a the bureau has not reached out to forward at this point
It also had an reach out to a third woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh that's Julie sweat Nick
And then there are number of possible witnesses who could have information about the various a legit events in question when of course has Kavanaugh's friend mark judge we talked a lot about him judge has said he'll cooperate with the FBI of his his lawyer today declined to say anything beyond that
And at the same time more if Kavanaugh's high school and college acquaintances are speaking out tell us about what they've said most recently
Well in the last twenty four hours a former friend of Kavanaugh's at Yale came out and publicly ... disputed Kevin O's representation of his of his drinking as a young man this is Chad letting too and he's a history professor at North Carolina state now
And his comments don't relate to allegations of sexual misconduct but really about how much Kevin I drank and what led you didn't says is that he frequently drank with Kavanaugh when they were at Yale us as Kevin was a belligerent and aggressive drunk
Or but at the same point in time the White House has put out statements from two college friends who say Kevin did not behave that way they don't match those allegations don't match the cabinet that they knew a it's important for Democrats um to talk about Kevin O's truthfulness about his drinking truthfulness in his testimony
That it's a something that should be looked into when the president says you know what I Believe what Kevin has had the same NPR's Ryan Lucas thanks Ryan thank you [noise] you're listening to all things considered

This is W. B. U. R. as all things considered I'm Lisa Mullen's a pivotal character in the saga surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh faced protests at an appearance in Boston today US Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona spoke at the Forbes under thirty event was on city hall plaza
Earlier in the day hundreds of protesters crowded the plaza to speak out against Kavanaugh's nomination to the high court
On friday flick called for the FBI to investigate claims against Kavanaugh that investigation is now taking place but flake said that he will vote for Kavanaugh if the FBI probe does not turn up more evidence that Kavanaugh committed sexual assault or misconduct
WB or senior political reporter Anthony Brooks is at city hall plaza was more on leaks experience in Boston
Anthony lots of protesters earlier a smaller group of them remain during flakes appearance can you tell us how those protesters were addressed if they were addressed at all of his concerns were address today
Well keep in mind that the main protest took place for for Jeff Flake arrived from city hall plaza but there were some protesters still present when he's folks some yelling vote no or also about a dozen or so women standing silently in the seat of section
A while he's folks they were holding a printed signs with them
Arizona which is just like state but he didn't address them directly but he was asked about that extraordinary event last friday when he was confronted in the Senate elevator by two women who said they were survivors of sexual assault you'll recall that video went viral and flake said that event and events like that
Had a powerful effect on him he suggested that have played a role in the decision that he made last friday to push for an extension of the FBI investigation which as you suggested Lisa is on going now
Yeah we should say one of those women apparently it was a recent northeastern graduate one of the women who approached him at the elevator there were reports over the weekend Anthony that the White House had limited the scope of the FBI investigation and today
That seemed to have changed when President Trump said he was in favor of a comprehensive investigation and that the FBI can interview anyone thinks this person that did flake respond to that today [noise]
Well like a responded in this way he said that he and his staff I've been having conversations with the White House counsel's office to make sure the FBI does a real investigation said that any current a credible allegations against Kavanaugh should be fully investigated here's a bit of what he said
That does no good to have an investigation that just gives us more cover for example we actually need to find out where we can find out or we have to realize that we may not be able to find out everything that happened
This is something that was awhile ago some witnesses or potential witnesses may not want to cooperate um but for those that can and those who we can compel to cooperate or we've got to do a false from investigation
