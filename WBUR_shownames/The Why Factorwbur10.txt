If we are faced ways really emotionally painful experiences is understandable that we would want to turn away from that and that we might kind of cut off and isolate or somehow [noise] minimize things that he didn't feel that that kind of ... and all that bad

So in terms of the relationship emotionally we disconnected from each other I just didn't have a clue what any did you wanted went into an ad [noise]
It was very hard to bond with my youngest you know it didn't have a relationship with him really it was a little to say
Tools one child I'm kind of weird blank feelings towards another child it was horrible
After almost a year and a half it became too much
Alan was diagnosed with compassion to take she'd been so busy trying to do with her Chinese trauma that you'd almost run artist emotions of her own she felt numb and to the point that even the smallest of tasks the kind that moms do everyday felt impossible
Things I'm just gonna say bad and say side and upsetting to go up to the point where I just felt like her couldn't give them any love or pet it was just basic needs

And this image has been used to generate that emotional response and individuals to get them to look at that child and sympathize empathize pity the child
Charity campaigns can be upsetting but that's the point they worked because they're upsetting we feed guilty into action but Dr Hudson wanted to find out if there was some kind of collateral damage if using these images actually made compassion fatigue worse
So they decided to put it to the test they showed two groups to separate poverty come pains the first was the one we're used to the poor single African child looking helpless or malnourished what's known to some as flies in the eyes campaigning
The second image was different still young African chai but this time he was at school holding a sign saying future doctor

Now that's a pretty terrifying thought that we could become so desensitized are cut off but we just engaged entirely from the world around us what happens if we also carrying
A psychologist Dr Lucy ... thinks that sometimes it's okay to switch off to almost cure rate the word around you so you can focus on what's in front of you
