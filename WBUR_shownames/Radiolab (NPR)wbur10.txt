And streaming or W. B. U. R. dot org W. B. U. R. Boston's NPR News station where you [laughter]
[noise] okay [noise]
You are listening to radio lab
Radio around WWE and why he [noise]
Some people like roses and others to lips um I've always liked snakes says
Radiolab I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich and our show today is about deception and we thought we're better to start than with snakes [noise]
This is where you keep all your snakes
... for some of them here we have a right it is and was working with
This is Gordon work hard he works at the University of Tennessee I paid a visit recently and I have several rooms here where we keep a variety of different reptiles and it's all just one little snake that he likes to show off small guy man as a pencil goal to hug new snake these are the hog do snakes they can see this guy is already
Starting to go into the the split [noise]
Gorgeous pops top off the cage and then that's something interesting well do is think
He puts a chicken puppet of a puppet of a chicken on his left hand right and then with this up and he begins to kind of attacks the snake are mock attack simulate
Like ... bird that might be attacking it happens next is kinda shocking and see now how tiny little ... is calling its tail first the snake flips of its back very goes upside down then vomit blood blood all even come out of the mouse to then
I've noticed is definitely a little bit it's rising
It gets real easy
Finally stopped deal
[noise]
Effect will stop breathing and it's all ... all the show I was like wait that as an outlet and touch him but as soon as we took a few steps back from the cage the snake pops it set up goes on flat and that's the only adult clothes and there was alive again
And then you'll start to breeze
And gays around it was lying basically that's pretty good thank you very much although you know as the world and it was kind of an ordinary life really what it was shut when was the last time you proved yourself for a lot well
I could like review so beautifully you wouldn't be on your back tongue out no way 'cause I Would get you know you wouldn't get you what do you know I Would totally get closer to tell you if that's not with cats you know if it were me no you wouldn't so that's our our ... people who live and the people who catch them not to
[noise]
To get things started in earnest let us go to every New Yorkers the rich spot [noise]
I Love John F. Kennedy Airport of course will place went to go get away from it all
Ended up there with her producer Alan Horn we hadn't actually meant to calm the guy that we had been interviewing
Daughter for a large it'd be portrayed by demeanor embarrassed to be a higher emotional right in the middle of the interview he'd gotten a call hello said he had to run or that's where you are really crap we have more questions over and do so we decided to jump in the car within [noise]
Laughing friends men
With big guns ... thirty combat uniform for Iraq have automatic weapons in any case this is Paul act now at when he carries a a security expert and that's what he will be called nowadays and speaking of security the reason he's here today at JFK Airport is to talk with Jet Blue security
Teaching the few things about how they might do their jobs better okay we have a lot
Of ... in a building that's how I thought I'd ever in a restaurant [noise]
Not a General Robert security kicks is how we are really in the terminal
And the only place it seems we're allowed to stand right here on the concrete nearing two lanes of traffic accidents finally pulls out the thing he'd been hoping to show the folks that Jet Blue
Has your little you're very stylish little laptop the that's starting off the simple computer program that he promises about forty minutes teach year here into a ... start start alright let's start
Stepping forward to the computer hears loading image is they have a best way to catch the ... [noise]
Uh
I see that one again that was so fast
All oh
What his dad and I promise I'll tell you but let me just keep going
To explain Paul ... studies faces the human states he's probably studied the face more than anyone
Up at some of my work that was person certainly hey we didn't really know how many expressions of face could make and there was nothing like a musical notation for the face
So about Thirty years ago he began by examining his own face very closely to see how many muscles are in there and there are roughly fifty then he spent the next couple of decades trying to figure out how many ways those muscles can combine to form a facial expression
Hide developed tropical official action crediting system
Basically a muscular scoring system where you could apply to photograph film realized PA right you just did a a one to for your your numbering my facial especially the one to is the most common finger up to his raising your eyebrows ... as far as just raising the upper are serving his concerns are are
In all in all the human face is capable of three thousand different expressions that's what he thinks it's we sat in his publishers office in midtown Manhattan is about an hour before the airport incident where the example yeah he demonstrated if you
Are very few fabricate anger very unlikely you'll put in what we call the anger reliable muscle which most people
Can't voluntarily move the anger reliable ... I Want to see his
Beard and senior Pepsi nerve red margin of error that's related to flip you looked fierce when you do that instantly so have you on someone's mad look at their lips conversely if you want another happy genuinely happy and they're not just faking it he says look at their islet skin
In between your eyebrows and Europe or are they in the genuine spontaneous enjoyments while that's getting loose lightly down
Hard to detect a bug visible you know what you did it when you said that
The reason that we're talking about him here in our on line is
Being paid these days to finding life by using fancy brain scanners X. men is kind of on a crusade to remind us that you don't have to do that you don't have to look in the rain because the brain is actually directly connected to the face in ways that we can't control
Of these muscles are activated involuntarily when an emotion and curves without your choice
Or the things happening on my face on her face on any safer for Germany or do you know and I also filled out of my ... they could face [laughter]
Which brings me to my new favorite word
Leakage leak inch leakage yes it is a word you will hear again and again when you talk to anyone in the field to fly catching
Take for example burying McManus area el McMahon seem CNN us he's a longtime CIA interrogator physiological leakage could be anywhere from sweat gland activity when someone knows that they're misleading you and they break out of a sweat
That because of ... nervous system that you have no control over basically telling the truth is easy that is the crux of it quoting Steve Silverman a reporter for wired magazine the truth is kind of sitting there in your brain your brain knows it you say it
No problem but your brain has to work harder to generate the line there is an effort and with that there was always leakage even in an instantaneous moments sometimes you even hear it
Were a person's breathing pattern will change or the size that people do and what particular time did they do a you're not trained to look at it most people ignore it but if you've been trained and you know what to look for ... man is it it will strike you right in the face speaking faces really
Dark near grab a particular brand ... specializes in and to do with something that he calls on micro facial expression or very fast facial expression about twenty six of his second
Okay just to just as an example let's just let us imagine that you're smiling
Games but on the inside of us who know you can test maybe you got some rage a little little being all that but on the outside you're smiling now a microexpression is went for the tiniest tiniest moment a little bit of the interagency slips out onto your face

And these are just little like just a fleeting directions very loosely pretty extreme but they're very fast and how consciously has been so fast that most of us don't eat at all
Most of us don't rush they most everyone around Ninety five percent of Muslims but what's your learning it over and
Once you don't know there's going to ask me you wake up to the startling possibility that Pfizer everywhere
Deep
Enough to make now that's where my daughter was born and raised here and there is a girl I decided to go on and say oh life to have to leave my life without a line
He basically set up into the right thing
There really wasn't part of me that was thinking well here's the test of a person he was going to stand by her and support her through the pregnancy and he said okay let's go to the doctor together
I Would say where when I Want to be there and she would say three o'clock at the doctor's office than I Would say okay
And I would go either early you know to forty five and uh she would not be there three Fifteen would roll around and three thirty would roll around there I Am sitting sort of alone in the perception is ... ... can I help you she would say oh well that that one was at one o'clock or I Would notice
On the sign in sheet that she is actually signed it and I could see the handwriting was indeed it was hopes and um she signed it two hours earlier
So then did you think
Yeah oh yeah yeah and as this continued I Would say repeat that for me three okay so three o'clock I mean these are moments in principle clarity of life you're not losing track of stuff
Man he got the call from a woman named Leslie I met hope off Craig's list actually put out an ad for a roommate and she moved in with no furniture she showed up with just all of her stuff in trash bags and then she disappeared
Leaving the back behind so it was right around that point where a check bounced and I was like oh now and so through mutual friends she tracked down shoot I was kind of like OK well she has this boyfriend she called them call them and sort of wanted like is he in on this she had no idea what she's talking about no he didn't even actually had a roommate mean lastly
I mean who the hell was who are you know who are you you will mean money and no I don't and she'll you know it was all very confusing
Not knowing what else to do Leslie decides to go into hopes for him and start looking through her spine I just like you know I'm just going to go through this see what's in here and that's when I found those notebooks
Spiral bound up on an inside literally pages upon pages of different names with different social next to them
Credit card numbers mother's maiden name birth date page after page of that kind of information on what exactly was is these are like crib notes for calm on them that's when I called Jude and I said
Get over here [noise]
What did you do at this point well dude knew he had to do something
I finally got up the courage to confront hope and say this is over my own responsibilities are not withstanding to be um
And what about Leslie at this point where she will last one
Hoping that through Craig's list which is very lively by her so she went back to ... started posting warnings many times
A day things single white female make specific hates me the Gray Thursday twenty something political science relied Ron driveway ran away in fact when your hairdresser she's hosting morning after morning did you have any information about the person is simply wants them to the police email at times I Hope at Yahoo dot com and
Credit check them all down as in Craig's on Craig's list ... remark soldier frog so he thought that they were inappropriate yeah they were unfair to do the right thing but everyone has right she would pass no drama and not even take down
She would pose a fact of the matter is that hope is out there somewhere he would take it down but within a few days in those moments where I was in the bathroom or away from his desk
People respond to stories and you get multiple reports and she wrote people
Off every different kind of person from all over the place yoga instructors landlords car mechanics fact flower shop owners ... car rental agency cashing place fifty dollars a remote
Not functionally ten thousand dollars and everybody with the same story she won
Or Emma seems to be living with the stop signs trying to pass a check out of the clergy countenance boat when it comes out over the
Course of several years there were testing and there were people who were
She got kind of a celebrity
Following finally we used to get emails like every day for people who were just like is there any student loves the nose for if you tell us anything I'm like no she's in hiding sorry
Who was this woman and you can
Get you to introduce yourself to be around what you do my name is Terri Larry on the special agent with the Louisiana department of justice
Louisiana how's it gets Louisiana well after a few years hope pre surfaced in New Orleans
We had a call in complete from a lady down in the New Orleans area or her credit card had been use someone had tried to purchase Dell computers
And it just started from there every time we talked to one victim lead to one or two other bit of hope has a almost like a cult following
You know her emo was that she knew she got to know him really well I talked a lot of victims and they just don't trust people anymore a lot of these people did some good human open heart things with her and said
This to poor girl I've got to help her out and there were there really let down there just don't trust people anymore and it's sad you know not only do you have to worry about cleared up your credit and get your money back from the your bags you know you've got to deal with with people in the surf now that you don't know you know who you're standing next to Mm
Jaded had that feeling
One of the houses that help it blown tree in San Francisco and he had found something that was really upsetting I had come across
A letter but she had written to my parents but never male and just sing some very very terrible things
Which Jude says we're totally untrue
In this letter to his parents
Hope for that [noise]
At at one point during
Pregnancy she was having complications and the the main symptom was like severe
... bleeding and bad news is that she was on somebody's living room floor at a minor hers in a terrible condition and that um that I had that I just left
Totally abandoning the situation and my responsibility in just a graphic and ugly depiction of an awful scene [noise]
Cheapest traumatized
The whole experience he compared to an earthquake [noise] have you ... know never well one of the things that happens is that there's these aftershocks after the earthquake and there for a little while after the earthquake you're not sure
That when you put your foot down to ground is still going to be in the same places it was a minute ago
There were days I can tell you there were days when it was significant to hear anybody say anything of any consequence there was just
You know to say
I have a carton of milk in my refrigerator that expires on September ... and that was true was it didn't say the Denver nineteenth or September fifteenth potential temper Seventeen to other
People crying on the phone talking to me about the situation and they were victims six seven years ago people are embarrassed they're embarrassed and then they become mad
You know and that's when they become detective [laughter] make lousy practice
Where are you know front of her mother's house in that neighborhood in New Orleans sort of around midnight what's your name and her mom Marcia Valentine and why are you there exactly I could kind of gotten a little obsessed with how he got himself
Wife I have no idea I definitely having taken aside
Imagining how she was doing all this so
Was like really fun to imagine but maybe also happens Leslie too but like once I started looking I was able to find a lot of victims a lot of information and I wanted to meet her [noise]
Marcia Valentine
They're not around here ... everybody ...
Hoping back where okay next right with ... what did you know about hope at this point well I knew that she had had a daughter
Really know anybody who
You know not choose the timing was all
Wrong and I had located the father well I'm standing outside of hopes mothers how shares through ...
Piled up against ...
I don't see any land inside the house
Next morning I went out
To find a woman named ruby ruby moon I live in New Orleans Louisiana Rubio's a coffee shop I live down the street from hopes mother the one who came to New Orleans um her mother you know introduced a ruby has a kid who's about the same age hopes daughter and they go to Montessori together
Than when Rudy opened her shop a year ago hope to car pool today
She would pick them up and when we got home about five thirty six o'clock we'd all eat dinner together and she would spend the night sometimes and
Quite frankly I enjoyed having help around the weeks later a cop show up to arrest hope she printed a check on her home computer with a made up account number divide twelve thousand dollar used her
Here you are you really like this woman your kids love her and you can't believe it you don't believe it
And I wanted to stand by her I wanted to help her you know and she hadn't screwed me over she hadn't done anything to me so maybe she's turning around that well then
My husband find that she's taken a credit card off the show that
He put away because the credit card with maxed out and she'd been buying gasoline and paying her phone Bill Maher that much it was like two hundred and fifty dollars it really wasn't much and my husband was like hope why ...
You know inconsistencies big ones and then the hundred and eight books that she ... she found a pathological liar twelve actually twelve twelve out of a hundred and they say ... or they pathological Arizona depends on how you defined I Would hope that she found twelve people that you wanted to look at further she said to them
Would you be willing to come in and Julie Bones Are basis into the lab
And let me scan your brain [laughter]
Just another day but to ...
Put people in the in my scanner and then we scan their
Brain and everyone's brains all one hundred and eight of participants the liars in the non liars no one knew which group there and ... and she was looking at a particular part of their brains just beyond therefore it called the prefrontal cortex
And this is the part that the brain that part of the nation is where the real thinking at making decisions and more judgment for example
If you do me into that place just behind your forehead [noise]
You'll see two kinds of brain tissue you've got gray
Matter and then you've got white men I've heard of gray matter yes well we think of the brands being gray but actually to to think it's great white the great stuff kind of thing but it's like the computer processor part they're these little clumps of neurons that process information
[noise] computer [noise]
That's the great where's the white a white matter it's like the the connections between all these cars on the computer away met her in other words is what moves the thoughts around gray is where the
Happens and then why is when you move the thought from here
To there exactly yes they transfer inflation from one end to the ... because
They've got your grave that you're white ... thought she would see when she looked into the brains of people who ... I found
Out we would see a reduction
Some piece of it not they're missing something physically she thought she would find less gray stuff must have been thinking why would why would
Why because that's what she's seen in other um mental disorders that are kind of like this and if you think about it in a really simplistic level
The graves where do you think your thoughts and it's also among other things where you crunch your moral calculations and liars she figured have trouble in this department some maybe they have less great that was okay but
When she got the pictures that what you saw was such a great increase in
More and not the great more white matter
White stuff lot more ... than a quarter to twenty five twenty five percent more connections in their head the non liars yes before we get to what that means what were you thinking when you saw this
I was really bubbling
I thought this was this was something something something something shoe
Cheers her ideas so far ready if she thinks that these extra connections play a crucial role in a kind of in the ...
I Know is coming up with a story on the fly let me give you an example mhm you're leaving work
You're ... you're younger and knowing the nice co worker corners you oh hey Sallie corners you in the elevator
Hey asks you out on you know I've been meaning to ask you made me want to go out with me on friday
So there you are questions dangling in the air tomorrow so for most of us
Right at that moment inside her head and our brains were thinking
The same thing in the public why why why would I
Think I think you can just reaching out into the void trying to form a connection with some ideas that can help you come up with some excuse I can say I'm you know I could say well don't show on [noise]
And really what you need to do at this moment is you take a bunch of disparate thoughts on different sides of your brain like 'em me tonight cheese dentist and connecting altogether
Late night over flick that book okay we can all do it given enough time but for the pathological liar she thinks that because they have so many more of these connections to begin with they get
Their faster at night and you have ... have you back yoga I ... I think the more connection very beekeeping ... during the speed of the ... thing you can jump from one idea to another and you can come up with more um random stories
She thinks in the brains of most of us we have trouble making those connections we have when you're in trouble as I said like you want to come out you know friday night would you not be able to come up with a ... I Would say um yeah I Am
I have to strive to count straws to see a third third United struck county we always we have about three hundred and sixteenth stress so far and ah I'm only I'm only doing ones with with um with the little red circles on them so that's there's you know sorry
[laughter] I don't know I did this happen there you go see you've got you've got extra white men or perhaps
So she's saying this is a cause of lying or ineffective lie
Like well she's not sure and this is a big debate in which you can say is that children as they grow from eight to eight ten here is a big jump in the white
Matter oh and that's it and see the same age that they give up the skill to lie or
Among
Close to given everything we've just talked
About how do you square this information with being a new mom I mean is this your first get yes it's my first one a boy or girl and yeah what's her name ads alley doesn't it make you wonder a little bit about Zoe and what's what's going on inside her head
Oh yes I Wonder about that all of the times it's still too early to scan her brain but eventually I Will do and are you serious yeah
This is a moral to this never if you were a little baby have a social psychologist as a mother to the very very dangerous thing anyway if she does this then maybe we'll do a little bit more about the nature nurture of liars but until then
This is radio lab and we'll be back in a moment in your brain

... I'm Robert and this is radio lab today on our program the topic is liar
All kinds of liars and now it's time for the liar we haven't yet mentioned a ally which might actually be wonderfully huge and this is the uh the self deceive or have somebody
Somebody who lies or not to others but actually likes to oneself get my drift thanks ... anyhow what does that even mean well lie to oneself how would you tricky it give you a classic example let's say that you are madly in love with
Somebody who just conjure up whoever you really you know I don't know who okay so now you're in love with her and strange things start to happen
Here at home the food rings
You pick it up a
Person on the other one is breathing and then
Things up next she suddenly staying late at the ...
I mean I'm I gotta work late tonight again don't wait out
Then your friends tell you that they see this woman who who's this
Guy that company of ... brother maybe repeatedly come are
In short all the signs are there and yet despite the evidence you jet continue to believe and I mean you truly truly believe that the woman is being faithful well maybe in
This little scenario that you've created for me I'm just a stupid are clueless [laughter] no I'm not going to take that away from you or not but in this case though for the sake of argument let's say you're not okay let's
Say you believe both these things in some different compartments in your head you believe that she is faithful and it's a very same time you know you know what's going on here
What self deception really is is that you have two contradictory beliefs and you hold them at the same time and you allow one of them into consciousness and that you have the motivation for allowing one of them into consciousness
That's Joanna start she's a psychologist and we're going to hear more from her late ... how does that work than what what you just sat next to have two contradictory thoughts and your brain at the same time and your own that and then one well lose an experiment on this subject kind of an interesting one and
My other experiment introduce you to the two guys who did it for okay
I'm a a Harold set time limit professor in the departments of psychiatry and radiology or some university
Okay my name is Reuben who were on a new or psychologist by training
... Ruben gr our friends they met back in Nineteen Seventy four Seventy three have make that Seventy three one was a grad student that would be Harold ... a professor that's yeah Gore
