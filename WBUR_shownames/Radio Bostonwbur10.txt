Stevens who has praised Kevin in the past said he had changed his view on confirmation not because of any question about Kavanaugh's intellectual ability but because of his performance last week accusing Democrats and liberal groups as a partisan slot on behalf of the Clintons to destroy his nomination

Is radio Boston I'm Anthony Brooks and we'll begin today with the question Ken words kill someone to be found guilty of involuntary manslaughter because of what they said on the phone or text it
Those questions were at the heart of the controversial conviction of Michelle Carter she was found guilty last year and sentenced to Fifteen months in jail for text some phone calls encouraging or Eighteen year old boy friend Conrad Roy to commit suicide and he did
The case to the case is back before the Supreme judicial court where Michelle Carter is appealing her conviction
WVU our senior correspondent Deborah Becker was at the Supreme judicial court this morning and she joins us now thanks for coming in ... thanks for having me I think so remind us of the details in this case what exactly was Michelle Carter convicted of last summer
Well see this convicted as involuntary manslaughter and the judge found that she encouraged her boyfriend friend Conrad Roy who struggled with depression to get into his truck loved the truck was filling up with carbon monoxide
This happened in twenty four team Roy died in this track as you said and and Carter was not there she lives about fifty miles away at her home at the time that the prosecution presented tax during her trial where she encouraged already to kill himself and threatened that she that's going to make him get help if he did not
At the SAC hearing today Anthony it was that as the packed courtroom as you can imagine because this is a controversial decision about a dozen friends and family members have Royce were there for the hearing but they they didn't comments afterward
Right and I understand that Carter herself was not in court today but her lawyers were right
The merely argued before the justices today a he said that this case raises a lot of questions including about the definition of involuntary manslaughter especially for juvenile defendants Carter was Seventeen
At the time that this happened you know says that it raises questions about freedom of speech and whether someone can be held responsible for their words and another person suicide especially in a state like Massachusetts that does not have a law against assisted suicide or against someone helping someone else take their own life
Here's what attorney mark said after the hearing today
I think that for literally just wrestling with a number of problems ... trial constitutional from stretched were
They get this is a very complicated issue which is why almost every other state in the country other than Massachusetts has a lot to deal with us from as a lot to deal with the suicide sent
Me the attorneys argue of essentially that this is a very complicated case and they say essentially the lower court judge was wrong to rule that Michelle Carter created a situation where Carter Roy would Conrad Roy would try to kill themselves and then neglect her duty to try to save him
Didn't start with that why not start with that I've got no right to call you these things but even with everything that happened you are my daughter our daughter
Your mother was a very good mother I Hope you remember that about her she did not deserve
He stops that hot Smokey kitchen the overhead light missing one bald so it was never a bright
Enough in there and then to she had had it she was screaming and she was leaving and it was like being told your heart in Oregon's are about to go for a little ride and you have no say in it
None whatsoever
... so that sound right to abuse the third reading from um [noise]
His new novel gone so long you know I have to say I'm In the middle of this book right now and I'm I'm loving it but I find myself struggling with Daniel because you're portraying with so much humanity and making this what feels like kind of his valiant effort at ... personal redemption but then I kind of
Like you I don't go you know I have a a horrendous aversion as well to people who do horrible things to women not to mention killing them and little kids the F so you know helped me out I mean talk about this sort of moral complexity that sort of surround factor
Yeah well you know he's he's a ... when when the novel begins we we started slowly learned that he's dying of prostate cancer duty as purposely not a sought treatment and he's sort of embrace in his own death
Or he he makes a living as a chair Cain or he lives in ... Massachusetts in a small yard or he volunteers are at the um the council on aging and drives you know elderly women usually two doctors appointments in the grocery store et cetera
And he listens to books on tape mainly history [noise] um what I discovered in you know you and I have talked about the creative writing process before but for for me it's it's it's really all about
Finding what's there and and it it's it's a weird kind of thing because this is a work of the imagination yet there is a feeling that when when it's going well that you're not making this stuff up that you really just kind of uncovering it and so when I began to find was
A he had sort of casting he'd been out of prison for twenty five years and that he'd he'd sort of put himself in his own solitary that he uh he doesn't date women he he sticks to himself is a very solitary existence and what I kept feeling from him was was this complex combination of contrition
Um but he still has a hot temper yeah he still has a short fuse and he knows this about himself and um I got
This reactor yeah yeah that's right I forgot [laughter] that's right out of
White hot reactor that sometimes turns on and get some and in the case of killing his wife gets them into all kinds of trouble
Yeah as a kid he was a comic book reader in and um he began in in the letters you know that he begins to right Susan is a way to sort of describe the crazy kid he's views himself as having been he
Talks about himself in the third person he describes himself that he could have been a a character in one of his own comic books and you could call him the reactor [noise]
And um that that rang true to me so I kept going with it and I'm discovered more things about him but I Do I Do want to tell you though that I I share share your ambivalence I [noise]
But it's so hard you know I I think it's impossible to write character driven fiction um dishonest if if if you're judging your own characters I think you've got to allow anyone in any way that they are um
Even if you don't like it you know police Pascal I Love this line anything written to please the author is worthless and
So it didn't please me but it didn't displeased me because I felt that I was uncovering something honest about the men even though I detest what he did but
Like kept discovering was ... I could not to test it more than he did
Interesting you know you seem you are haunted by [noise] certain lives I mean how wrongly certain lives can go I'm thinking of your last novel the garden of last days you featured a nine eleven attack or and yet you know sort of flush them out
Uh nine eleven attack or he wasn't a whole person so and gone so long you tell the story of Daniel why do you suppose you're drawn to these scary
You know I I don't know I I but you're absolutely right to put it that way I Do seem to be [noise]
Haunted by how wrongly certain lives can go in and um I don't know I mean I you know a lot of us grow up around dysfunction and bad news and I certainly had my share as well I don't know if that has shaped how am as an adult I Do know that
Um I Do know that and this is bumper sticker Christianity but I Do believe it's important to hate the sin and not the center [laughter] and and um even those of us who do the most heinous things
Ah they were somebody's baby and I'm not saying excuse them and I'm not saying you embrace them and I'm not saying you let them out of jail even
Um but you know I Love this line from Tom Waits you know the great singer songwriter from one of his songs heart attack and vine
There is no devil there's just God when he's drunk [laughter] that's a great it's a great line as blasphemy to many people as there is I mean that line to get Tom Waits you know imprisoned or worse than ground just across the world right now but it's it's it's a line that I find myself a subscribing to [laughter] I
Don't know why I'm reminded I was reminded of this I Love your memoir townie and I remember I think you're talking to you about
Your dad at the end of county and you said something that stuck with me for years because I sort of read that in and and then when I got to the end of the novel I was sort of saying man
Injuries to have you know she was like he was tough on the family and and I asked you you know how you sort of found capacity to be so loving to him at the end of his life and you said
I truly believe that people do the best they know how to do and I sort of went back and extracted that quote right and it just made quite an impression on me and is that the way you also look at Daniel I think
So I think so because I now I remember in that conversation we had
... which I I Do believe that all of us get out of bed across the planet or get off the ground wherever we sleep trying to have the best day we know how to have ... which is not necessarily the best day we can have yeah and that's where growth comes in right you know a
Yes reading from Daniel's point of view or certainly has led into that question you know one of my favorite lines from Flint Oreo con or one of her essay she says a writer's beliefs are not what she sees but the late by which she sees [laughter]
So I look back at you know all that I've written over the years um I've learned I've learned a lot about when I Believe in that one ... keeps coming up yeah
I'm a good one I mean it's a good one to keep in mind I think like I think it leaves room for all of us to grow and we all screw up that hopefully we don't screw up is horribly is being around people like him
Right but they screw up given their demons given their upbringing given their background they're sort of I mean not that you're again as you say you're not excusing someone who murders their wife but it's it's like worth getting into their shoes and trying to understand
What and let me tell you why I think it's worth it because I I don't believe the I'll just speak for myself you know I've been writing all my life and and if I've learned nothing you know what I've been learning or I'd be what keeps coming to me lately
Is a deeper I dig down into my own psyche and I write these these stories I don't think there is another I don't I don't believe in the other ... I think we are one with everybody and even those who do things that we did test
Even those elected to an office who do things we did test him you know there's we're we're all we're all in this somehow and and I and I think it's it's it's good for our humanity individually to imagine walking in the shoes of any other kind of human being even those we did test
I Want to come back and ask you to talk about something that you mentioned a moment ago when when when you are right this is about the writing process when you're writing when do you know that the creative force is with you I mean in other words I'm asking
On the one hand I imagine a writer pushing a vision of a story along deciding where it wants to go but there's a point when you suddenly feel sort of um that the story is guiding you you know that's what you just you're either my my guess is that must be an amazingly I'm an amazing relief
In it and it's and it's as deeply pleasurable a creatively and and for me it comes about when when two forces are in play and
In one is it has to be curiosity yeah you know you have to be authentically curious about the situation in the same way by the way you can't force yourself to fall in love with a particular person I'm up you've ever tried that I tried it once did and you either fall in love or you don't yeah uh the same way I don't think you can you can choose what you're curious about either so
That's number one you need to have that as creative fuel that seems to me and then the other thing is you've got to bring in at least three to ... for me three of the five senses and every
Orient yourself into the truth of that human being like right now we're in a in a radio station we'd be having a totally different conversation if we were sitting outside on a deck with a sea breeze right even if we're talking about the same thing we would change just on that level
So I found over the years if I can get those two ingredients together um and then proceed with you know fear in face that something will come something always comes something always comes one of my favorite lines is from an ancient Chinese anonymous port we poets knock upon the silence for answering music
A what I just heard is absolutely preposterous ... this is this is more of a cover up then invests
Than an investigation market place yeah
Let me ask you about last friday's extraordinary hearing with with Dr ... judge Kavanaugh did
Democrats in your view perhaps make a mistake I mean they spend a lot of that time demanding an FBI investigation
And are people who might feel the other way could say well they got it people will debate whether or not the hearing was complete the investigation was complete enough but Republicans in particular wavering Republicans now have the cover that the FBI went back and took another look
And I'm Wondering if you feel with hindsight the Democrats play this hand badly
[noise] well the goal which we had was to get an FBI investigation
In reality what has happened is
That we've had a a a a shadow of the uh the uh pretend an investigation by the FBI under constraints that had been opposed by the Trump White house in terms of how far they can go so
To the extent to which they can put the name F. B. I. on this investigation
That's the totality of the credibility that that that you we can give to of this process because uh beyond that it's empty pages ... nothing behind it except to cover sheet saying FBI so its cynicism
Or on stilts that's what the Republicans are engaging in
A day are definitely trying to rush to judgment there in gate of engaging the systematic cover up the entire way we still haven't seen Ninety three percent of all of the documents that that Brett Kavanaugh how she handled inside of the White House Ninety three percent of all of his documents or and or
In the American people know
That what's at stake ultimately
Is that Donald Trump said that he was going to appoint someone to the Supreme Court who would repeal wrote the weight would repeal the Affordable CARE Act
And protections for a pre existing conditions all that gets lost in this a charade which the Republicans have constructed a and called an FBI investigation
Center market we literally have ten seconds or Fifteen seconds left or so but it doesn't look like we somewhere I'm sitting in Boston that the Democrats are going to be able to stop this though is that a is that the way it looks to you at this point well
The the experts didn't have John McCain coming out to put his thumb down at one o'clock in the morning
To save the Affordable CARE Act so you haven't given we're going to continue to work everyday
Heidi Heitkamp I'm from North Dakota just announced that she was going to vote no and
Most experts to say in for the past two or three weeks that she would vote yes the cabinet so I don't think we know the answer yet far and that's why we're going to keep our energy level high and I and I hope that the American people do as well as our airport and for us to assume that we're going to lose so I think we can we still have a chance to win Massachusetts
Senator Ed Markey thanks so much for joining us today we're very grateful no thank you much
Regime [noise]


Finally tonight we want to bring you another installment from WVU are in the Boston Globe's new investigative pod cast last seen it dives deep into the unsolved mysteries of the world's largest art heist at the Isabella Gardner Museum in Boston almost Thirty years ago
Last night we brought you the first half of episodes three we heard from host Kelly horn and jak wrote illegal beginning there look at this idea was the high plane in Dorchester auto body shop in the belly of Boston's criminal underworld tonight we have the second half of episode three
Picking up with retired FBI agent David Makovsky talking about a tip from FBI informant Anthony Romano
Only told me that a car Milam or Leno wanted to Rob blooms Fargo vote facility in the eastern
Side of the Boston FBI county remind out with essentially accuser line informant his notes on the ... and goings in conversation he observed inside T I C helped ... work on his angle on them and they helped Cronin where kids on the Gardner [noise]
Obtained Anthony my mind as a confidential informant or parts of the ...
Between October Nineteen Ninety vendor Nineteen Ninety eight
In any other alongside ...
Fat which that's not the name is mother gave fat
Which he was born Richard Tchaikovsky picture a sharply dressed Bostonians missing all of his hair and some of his front teeth within inexplicable Brooklyn accent and a career as a scam artist as vast as the man himself as large which is not to say talk
One day fat which he called the Boston supervisor of the FBI squad that oversaw the gardener case that which he didn't introduce himself but he didn't have to
You actually said to the caller on the phone goes or you fat Ritchie 'cause we hadn't identified him so he goes there was a big budget goes well some people do call me that
... says fat which he told him an agent Cronin that he could get the paintings from Carmelo Renee now and ah uses but [noise]
You know if I can get the five mil like getting the paintings from him
That's what I Want to lose your goes out there not here so we just looked at each other just as beautiful
And that's how Richie ... achy a fat Ritchie became the second
Confidential informant inside T. R. C. auto electric
We obtained fat which used to be a to Z and they are full of instances of ... promising to deliver the paintings
In one day to January six Nineteen Ninety eight that rich you reported that Marino planned to return half of the stolen paintings and hold the rest for security really no had also reportedly said to Ritchie quote I've got the news you've been waiting for I have the Vermeer and the Rembrandt
For the FBI it must have been a shining moment
They had to informants reading on two heist won the Loomis hit in the planning stages
And the other the gardener robbery still casting it's long shadow over the city just maybe the one that had yet to happen would yield clues or better still an arrest and the one that had to get to be solved

It was at this point that the feds offered Carmelo Marino a quid pro quo of their own a letter of immunity from prosecution in exchange for the stolen art
But he assured nearly 'cause I don't have them because if I had him take that five million a given to you because I'm just as interested in finding them as you are I Want to get the money
The feds didn't buy it they knew or Leno kept that immunity letter from the U.S attorney's office taped under his desk AT T R C why would he needed if he was only in it for the reward if only they had leverage some other crime they can squeeze him on to make him talk
About what he knew about the Gardner heist something like an armored ... robbery
You've told told me that he was not just thinking of it he was planning it he was going on surveillances who was seizing it up you wanted to do this and the way he wants to do was to put somebody on the inside who to trust in other words
Get somebody in there as an employee that's willing to give it up when it when the time came that was his big plan he wasn't going to go in their guns blazing he wanted to go in there and have it set up already that place was going to
Vote and there's nothing like being jammed up on one wiping federal crime to make a bad guy sang about what he knows about another one that was the hope anyway just [noise]
The entire time that ... was making claims about the Gardner paintings he was also planning a strike on the Loomis Fargo armored car vote facility about twenty three miles south of she RC in eastern Massachusetts
The Lewis has presented just a chance the feds needed [noise] they didn't have any proof that really no really did have access to the Gardner paintings so they saw the next best thing
Pressuring him on a different crime one serious enough to make him give up would ever he knew about the Gardner
... had to come to Jesus moment with his informant Anthony Romano
He'd have to do two things introduce an undercover FBI agent to pose as the inside guy it'll mess and wear a wire to catch Marino and his accomplices planning that take down Anthony ... says the stakes for Amano could not have been higher
He wore a wire inside that place right there were looking at a place that
W. B. U. R. Boston NPR News station
[noise]
Ninety nine WB you are with special coverage from radio Boston Good afternoon I'm Anthony Brooks and we're following breaking news as the U.S Senate gets set to vote on the Supreme Court
Nomination of Brett Kavanaugh tomorrow this morning following the FBI's weeklong investigation into allegations of sex
Major hurdle in the Senate procedural vote of fifty one forty nine that moves the nomination to a final vote tomorrow and here's where we stand right now Arizona Senator Jeff flake says he will vote yes to confirm Kavanaugh he was one of the key
Republican swing votes in this nomination battle Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski the one of the other
Key Republican swing vote says she will vote no so this could come down to Republican Susan Collins of Maine who's expected to announce her decision from the Senate floor any minute now and we will bring you that live a when that happens
Until then I'm joined by our friday week in review panelists tc oughta gearing professor and co director
Of the center for social innovation at Boston College she's also a member of WB ... executive advisory board and a regular member of our weaken review panel to sound a Happy Friday thanks for coming in thanks for having me also
With us is Tom nickels he's a professor of national security affairs at the U.S Naval War college in Newport Rhode Island
And the Harvard extension call a school he's here in his personal capacity not representing the U.S Naval War college Tom thanks so much for coming in nice to be back thanks so uh what a week and as we wait for Susan Collins to begin her comments on the Senate floor to ceiling I'll start with you
There is a huge amount of pressure on this Republican senators shoulders right now what are you thinking about
You know I'm having had some Public Leadership roles in my career previously
When you ask to be put in these leadership positions you have said I Want the burden of responsibility of representing the American people and sometimes that
Burden sit very very heavily on your shoulders and I and I my heart goes out to her for the difficulty of this decision and I also think this is a moment when we need so many people to remember that they asked to be the leaders in this position making these decisions that
Little bit of information about us Susan Collins of Maine she was among the senators who voted yes to move this toward a procedural vote which uh Tom might lead one to indicate to to suspect that she will
Vote yes tomorrow but it doesn't necessarily mean that so we're waiting to hear from her but what are you thinking about what what is Susan Collins a you know juggling in her mind ... before she makes us very difficult decision
Well it's a I think the procedural vote as an important point to make I used to work in the U.S Senate I'm a long time ago and culture is a vote that says we can debate and go to a vote or an have and and uh actually talk about the vote itself so
People who vote yes on on um as a constant can say look I let the process play out I didn't vote to Stein me a final vote
And so that's a pretty common thing now it's pretty unusual for somebody to flip
In between the cloture vote and a final confirmation vote now she does that
That'll be interesting and really the thing about from college you couldn't scripted this I mean this kind of nominee with this sort of scandal in this kind of uproar with a female senator from a small divided kind of purplish what really kind of read versus blue New England state I mean if you submitted this was a TV script
A they tell you to rework it 'cause it's a little to
Pat [laughter] yeah Everytime I picture here I see Iraq on one side and a hard place on the editor right in her started standing in between them
Well a all morning a we have ah been listening to some of the testimony by members of the Senate I Want to play a clip from Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal who was speaking on the Senate for just a moment ago he's among the Democrats all the Democrats obviously voting are not actually we're waiting to hear from Joe Manchin as well but
Most Democrats or will be voting no
And a senator Blumenthal focused on the demeanor of judge Kavanaugh during that a difficulty hearing a week ago today where he came across as very sharp very angry very partisan so here's a little bit of what Richard Blumenthal said just a few moments ago
Cannot be denied is that
Picture of judge panel
Committee which indicated profound a lack of temperament and prospering
Tom Nichols um what's your view on this how badly did judge Kavanaugh undermined his credibility among a number of people would that performance a week and
Um I think it was disastrous and uh you know speaking personally I I'm a kind of moderate New England conservative of the old school when Kavanaugh was named first pipe popped up I said well
That's about what you'd expect I mean this could have been a ... a bushel Rubio point here are Scott Walker appointee um to me that outburst in front of the Senate was disqualifying in and of itself it he he went down the rat hole of conspiracies he pointed at the Democrat in a way to ... even Clarence Thomas Suzanne and I were talking about this earlier
He went angry but he didn't single out of the party I'm so that was the distinction
You're not just that he was angry but that he was red hot part of
It but he was part is in that he was a I think doing damage to the institutions of government by going for these conspiracy theories and I think you know some of my former cameras on the writer saying well you can't disqualify the guy because he lost his temper over being smeared in one herring and my answer is
Is why we have hearings it's not a longevity promotion hearings don't matter and how the nominee conducts him or herself in hearing doesn't matter than just do away with hearings and just promote people based on a link up service we don't do it that way we have hearings for a reason and I think Kevin are completely flamed out in his ...
What did you see last week to charter without a performance by Kevin
I appreciate what times that and I'll add to it becomes qualifying was actually the term that came up for me as well and I'll go back to my original point we're talking about him saying I'd better than anyone else I deserve to hold the role that one of only nine people on the planet we'll hope to be a steward of other people's needs
And who's John I'm going to interrupt because our understanding as we are going to senators and our ... our man until just live on the center for sergeant arms were store order and the gallery [noise]
So Susan Collins is on the Senate floor right now and she's about to announce her decision on the Kavanaugh nomination uh disarmament arms we understand is trying to restore order and you're hearing from protesters in the background there we're going to go ... lived at the center here we go expressions
Of approval or disapproval are not permitted in southern galleries sooner forming
Mr President Mr President the five previous times that I've come to the floor to explain my vote on the nomination adjusted to the United States Supreme court
I have the gun my floor remarks explaining my decision with a recognition of the solemn nature and the importance of
The occasion but today we have come to the conclusion
Of the confirmation process that has become so dysfunctional it looks more like a caricature of a guide her level political campaigns than a solemn occasion
The president nominated Brett Kavanaugh on July none
Within moments of that announcement special interest groups raised to be the first to oppose and including one organization that didn't even bother to fail and the judges name
On its ... press release they simply road
That they opposed Donald Trump's nomination out acts
To the Supreme Court of the United states a number of senators joined the race to announce their opposition but they were being to the punch by one of our colleagues who actually announced opposition before
Thing nominees identity was even know
Since that time we had seen special interest groups with their follow words into a frenzy by spreading misrepresentation and outright falsehoods about judge Kavanaugh's judicial record
Over the top rhetoric and distortions up his record and testimony at its first hearing produced short lived headlines which all those ... hours later and continue to live on and be spread
Other sides met with have expressed concern said Justice Kennedy's retirement
Threatens the rights of same sex couples to marry yet judge Kavanaugh described the overcook pals decision which legalize same gender marriages as an important landmark
He also cited Justice Kennedy's recent masterpiece cage cakes shop opinion
For the court's majority stating that
Quote the days of treating gay and lesbian Americans are gay and lesbian couples as second class citizens who are in theory or in dignity and words are over in the Supreme Court and quote
Others have suggested that the judge holds extreme views some birth control in one case judge Kavanaugh encouraged that does favor or both sides of the political spectrum for seeking to ensure
The availability of contraceptive services for women while minimizing the involvement of employers
[noise] although his critics frequently over and look at this point judge Kavanaugh's dissent
Rejected arguments that the government did not have a compelling
Interest and facilitating access to contraception in fact he wrote that the Supreme Court precedent strongly suggested that there was a compelling interest in facilitating access to birth control
There is also been considerable of focus on the future of abortion rights based on the concern that judge Kavanaugh would seek to overturn roe v Wade protecting this race is important to me
To my knowledge judge Kavanaugh
Is the first Supreme Court nominee
To express the view that precedent is not merely a practice and tradition but rooted in article three
Of our constitution itself he believes set precedent it's not just the judicial policy is constitutionally dictated to pay attention
And pay these two roles of
In other words president
And his goal or an aspiration it is a constitutional tenet
That has to be followed except in the most extraordinary circumstances and the judge further explain that President provide stability predictability reliance and fairness
There are of course rare and extraordinary times where the Supreme Court foot rifling you overturn a precedent
The most famous example was when the Supreme Court in brown versus the board of education over rules plastic versus port purchase and correcting a gravy asleep wrong decision to use the judges term
Allowing racial inequality
But someone who believe that the imports some precedents has been rooted in the constitution
Would follow longest tablets president except in those rare circumstances where
A decision is gravy asleep wrong or deeply any consistent with the law does
Our judge Kavanaugh was raised as a judge should started to me a long established precedent it's not something to be trimmed narrowed just garden or Oprah's law
Its roots in the constitution gives the concept of starry just sites is greater way such that the president can't be trimmed or narrowed simply because the judge might want to on a whim
Ensured his views on honoring president would priests clued a chance to do by Dallas that which one has committed not to do over for
Noting that roe v Wade was decided forty years forty five years to go every year for nine Fifteen Years later
And Planned Parenthood versus case and I asked judge cabin or whether the passage of time is relevant to following
President he said decisions become part of our legal framework with the passage of time and fed honoring precedent is essential to maintaining public confidence
Our discussion then turn to the right to privacy on which the Supreme Court relied in Griswold versus Connecticut a case that struck down the law banning the use since sale of contraception
Griswold tablets the legal foundation that led to row eight years later
In just griping Britain's falls as settles law judge Kavanaugh observed that it was the correct application
Of two famous cases from the Nineteen twenty Meyer and here that are not seriously challenged by anyone today
Finally in his testimony he noted repeatedly that roe had been up to help
By Planned Parenthood versus Casey describing it as president unprecedented when I asked him would it be some fish than to overturn them long established precedent it
It is believed that it was wrongly decided he and ... said no
Opponents frequently sites then candidate Donald Trump campaign pledge to nominate only judges who would overturn roe
The Republican platform for all presidential campaign has included this pledge since at least Nineteen eighty
During this time president Republican presidents have appointed justices O'Connor suitor and Kennedy to the Supreme Court the start that very three justices Republican president
Appointed justices who authors like Casey decision which reaffirmed row
Further more pro choice groups vigorously opposed each of these justices nomination incredibly
They even circulated by and
With the slogan and stop Souter or women will die
Just two years later Justice Souter coauthored the Casey opinion reaffirming a woman's right to choose suffice it to say prominent advocacy organizations have been wrong
These same interest groups have speculated that judge Kavanaugh was selected to do the bidding up conservative idiot lives despite his record of judicial independence
I asked the judge point blank whether he had made any ... Mad Men or pledges to anyone at the White House to the federalist society to any outside group
On how he would decide cases he
Unequivocal like assured me that he had not
Judge Kavanaugh has receive rave reviews for his twelve year track record as a judge including for his judicial temperament the American bar association gave him its highest possible rating
Is standing committee on the federal judiciary conducted an extraordinarily thorough assessment some listening input from almost five hundred people including his judicial call like
The APA concluded that his integrity judicial temperament of professional confidence met the highest standards
Lisa Black who was argued more cases before the Supreme Court than any other woman
In history testified quote by any objective measure judge Kavanaugh is clearly qualified to serve on the Supreme Court his opinions are in very bleak thoughtful I'm fair ms black
Who clerked for an as an ardent uh Meyer of Justice Ginsberg and who is in her own words and unapologetic defender of a woman's right to choose sets that judge Kavanaugh fits with in the mainstream of legal side
By some who have suggested that in last judge Kavanaugh's nomination has rejected the Senate and some how
Can Joan and sexual assault nothing could be further from the true every person man or woman who makes a charge of sexual assault
Just serves to be heard and treated with respect the me too movement is real
It matter it is needed and did it's long
Overdue we know that rape and sexual assault or less likely to be reported to the police than other forms of assault
On average an estimated two hundred eleven thousand rape
And sexual assaults go unreported every year we must listen to survivors and every day we must seek to stop the criminal behavior that has hurt so many
We all this to our cells
Our children and the generations to come
Since the hearing I have listened to many survivors of sexual assault many were total strangers who told me their heart wrenching stories for the first time in their lives [noise]
Some of our friends that I had known for decades yeah with the exception of one woman who had confided in me years to go
Yeah that they had been the victim of sexual attack
I Am grateful for their courage and their willingness to come forward and I hope that in tightening public awareness they have also lighten the burden
That they have been quietly bearing for so many years
To them I pledge to do all that I can to ensure that their daughters and grand daughter's
Never share
Their experiences
Over the past few weeks I've been emphatic that the Senate has an obligation to investigate and the value ways
The serious allegations of sexual assault I called for and support is the additional hearing to hear from both professor force and judge Kavanaugh
I also push for and supported the FBI supplemental background investigation this what's the right thing to do Christine for never saw the spotlight
She indicated that she was terrified to appear before the Senate Judiciary committee and she is shines attention since then
She seemed completely unaware of chairman grass lease offer to allow her to testify confidentially
In California watching her Mr President I could not help but feel that
Some people who want it to engineers that to speed up this nomination cared little if at all for her
Wellbeing professor Ford testify that a very limited number of people had access to her in the latter
Yet that letter found its way into the public domain she testified that she never gave permission for that very private letter to be related
And yet here we are we are in the middle of a fight that she never buy saw arguing about claims said she wanted to raise confidentially
Now one theory I heard his spouse repeatedly is that our colleagues senator Feinstein's lead professor forests letter at the eleventh hour to derail this process and I wanted states that very clearly I Know Senator Dianne
Feinstein extremely well and I believe that she
Would never do that
I knew that should be the case before she even stated it at the here and she is a person of integrity and I stand by
I've also heard some argue that the chairman of the committee somehow treated professor Ford unfairly
Nothing could be further from the truth
Chairman Grassley along with his excellence stab treated professor forward with compassion and respect throughout the entire process and that is the way the senator from Iowa has conducted himself throughout on lifetime
Dedicated to public service but the fact
Remains Mr President someone leak this ladder again professor sports express wishes I suspect
Regrettably that we will never know for certain who did it
Today that leak or who I Hope is listening now let me say that what you did was unconscionable you have taken a survivor
Who was not only entitled to your respect
But who also trusted you to protect her and you have sacrificed her well being in a misguided to town when what ever poll little crusade you think you are fighting
My only hope is that your cat has said has turned this process into such a dysfunctional circuit that it will cause the Senate and indeed all Americans to reconsider
Court nominees if that happens then the polling lack of compassion you forwarded professor Ford will at least
Have some unintended positive consequences Mr President the politically charged atmosphere surrounding the nomination has reached a fever catch
Even before these allegations were known
And it has been challenging even stand to separate fact
From fiction we live in a time of such great great just unity as the bitter fight over this nomination both in the Senate and among the public clearly demonstrate it is not merely a case
Of differing groups having different opinions
It is a case of people very extreme ill will towards those to disagree with them
In our intense focus on our differences we have
Free God and the common values that's fine jazz to gather
As Americans when some of our best minds are seeking to develop the even more sophisticated algorithm design to link has to websites that only reinforce
And cater to our views
We can only expect our differences too intense some fine
This wonderful arm the draft or some of our constitution who were acutely aware that different values and interests could prevent Americans from becoming and remaining a single people
And the up to six object and they vote in the preamble
To the constitution
The one that they put first was the formation of a more perfect
Union their vision of a more perfect union does not exist today
And if anything we appear to be moving farther away from that
It is particularly worries that the Supreme Court the institution that most Americans see as the principal guardian up our shared constitutional heritage is viewed as part

The three Republican senators who have been wavering on the choice of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh today were expressing varying degrees of on happiness over remarks made by President Trump last night

This is radio Boston I'm Anthony Brooks and we'll begin today with a potential cost of a ballot question that has Massachusetts voters closely divided question one would set limits on the numbers of patients assigned to nurses at hospitals
And other health care facilities across the state advocates including some nurses community groups in a long list of elected officials
Say the measure would improve patient care now comes a study from the independent Massachusetts health policy commission
It concludes that if question one were to pass hospitals would have to hire as many as three thousand additional nurses and the cost it could run as high as nine hundred fifty million dollars a year
That's almost a billion dollars if you're keeping score at home do your view are common health editor carry Goldberg has been looking at the study and was at the health policy commission today and she's with us now I care hey Anthony so let's dig into that nine hundred and fifty million dollar figure a bit more how did the commission come up with that number
So first of all the Nineteen fifty million at the high end of a range they're saying it could cost between six hundred and Seventy six and Ninety nine hundred and forty nine million
That's a big contrast to what the proponents of the ballot measure estimating
Which was more like between thirty five and forty seven million dollars right now that's a big contract yes and and it's quite hefty sum when you put it in the context of Massachusetts having some of the most expensive health care on earth already
Which by the way is why we had this health policy commission as a watchdog on health costs in the first place
Now David our back he's the director for research and cost transit the commission
Estimates that costs could amount to just over one percent
All right now one percent of them found like a lot
It doesn't but it's one or maybe a little closer to two percent of a lot of sixty one billion dollars or as our backs at an understated Lee I Would say that a substantial amount and it's up to three point five percent of total hospitals spending
All right so what does that consist of all that's been
Written so it's several elements so as you said hospitals would have to hire a couple of three thousand more registered nurses the pay for nurses would likely go up because that's basic economics right there would be more demand for them and if a similar law in California is any indication
Nurses income might go up by an average of maybe like four percent or so and it would cost money to have this news staffing ratio system in place in hospitals
And then there would be some one time costs like it could cost millions to put in like a tool to help assess how sick patients are and therefore what the nurse ratio should be forgiven unit
Right right it interesting that flake is bringing that up the use of course one of the the the key swing votes last friday he was the one who sort of shocked the world when he pushed for a delay to allow the FBI investigation
So what do we know about ah the FBI investigation so far first of all when do we know when it's expected to conclude one we might see something about it from it will we see something from it
I've heard some charter among senators today that it could wrap up as early as today and
Uh the the report was first go to the White House and pretty soon it would be here on Capitol Hill with the according to
Senate majority leader McConnell available for every senator to look at try to lead it won't be released to the public however we don't know exactly when that's going to end the FBI has not been a you know speaking publicly about this investigation as it usually doesn't but
Everyone is is kind of anxious to see when it comes out and people are on guard for it to potentially land today if not later
Right and so he'll water lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez who who is also made allegations against judge Kavanaugh what are they saying about the FBI investigation so far
They are arguing that the FBI is not conducting a thorough investigation that it's not following up on her requests from them
Or for follow up and ... interviews to speak with the FBI is that it hasn't you know pursued other leaders that they consider relevant to the investigation or tried to contact other witnesses that they believe you know could corroborate um or at least shed some light on
The uh the allegations here so they have said publicly that um they they worry the FBI hands or being tied and that it's not conducting a thorough investigation and those concerns of the ... and may have had announced critics here on Capitol Hill
Right meanwhile a Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell talking about a ... a vote as early as this week or how soon could that come in and do we know if it'll be a straight a floor vote or good Republican leadership take some kind of different rooms here [noise]
Well it would have to eventually be a floor vote on the confirmation but what McConnell has said is the full Senate will vote on the nomination this week now if if we want to parse that that means
It could go up until Saturday it's not clear whether McConnell is talking about a final a Senate confirmation vote or if he's talking about the beginning the process but you're involved with a procedural vote followed by thirty hours of debate this week so a lot of questions now
I Will say McConnell has been very confident that Kavanaugh will be confirmed that he has maintained that confidence he does not have fifty votes yet
Assuming flake is still a yes he said he's going to support the the nomination but he was an FBI investigation first assuming he's still a yes McConnell can only counter forty nine votes right now because Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski has not yet decided it's very likely to come down to those two if
A one if both of them vote no then the nomination that's probably dead at one of them vote snow on the nomination could still survive if the other books yet so I'm a you know to anyone washing the site and wants to know how it's going to come down and keep your eyes on those two
Interesting so I I Want to come back to President Trump sort of clearly doubling down on on the strategy of whipping up his base I guess at that rally in Mississippi um where he criticized Waze forty also said
Um that it's a scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of
Um what what effect do you think all of this might have on the coming election what's what's your view on that so he'll [noise]
The president is trying to counter the argument that uh you know his his critics and critics of Brett Kavanaugh are making which is
That if you know there there is a serious a possibility that Brett Kavanaugh may be
Assault or and he does not deserve to be on the Supreme Court not what Trump is pointing out is that someone who you know someone like having a deserve the presumption of innocence and his view and it could set a bad precedent for men down the line if Kavanaugh is denied
You know a Supreme Court seat in this case or ... kind of virtue of presuming that have been guilty um so it's kind of it
Problem and that women deserve to be heard or they deserve to be believed he kind of trying to flip that around and say well what about the young man what about the young boys who worry that they could be all the accused of something I'm like all that is of course the argument here not about
Having a street under is not a criminal trial where you go to jail is not whether you get the promotions so the standard or ... you know in in the view that as a as a critic should be higher
Yeah meanwhile are very quickly I Want to ask you very quickly about the New York times story which did this major investigation alleging among other things that Donald Trump's of wealth was not self made but it was the result of a huge fortunate he inherited from his dad and and probably because
According to the times he engaged in a series of suspect tax schemes
Now another time in history and obligation like this against a sitting president would be seen as a huge deal how was the White House responded to this
Yeah there's a lot to unpack the times called it outright fraud I talked to a bunch of tax lawyers and found that
Um you know the the activities that you are a organization engaged and chew 'em you know limit the amount of estate taxes that Trump would have paid for instance or a very much outside the bounds of the law into according to the times reporting and it also it goes against President Trump's
Argument that he is a self made man that has well was only the only a tiny bit of it in his words wasn't inherited when that does not appear to be the case according to this investigation the White House has responded by a
By lashing out by attacking the times by talking to press kind of a a familiar ... used in the [noise] right
Well so he'll cup or national political reporter for Bloomberg Politics thank you so much for joining us today we're very grateful
Thank you
All right now the testimonies of ah the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh are at odds on to say the least Ford says she has a hundred percent confident she was assaulted by Kavanaugh when they were in high school
But Kavanaugh vehemently denies that it ever happened one way to reconcile the opposing narratives is the so called blackouts theory that Kavanaugh did it but doesn't remember because he blacked out from drinking too much in last friday Senate hearing prosecutor Rachel Mitchell
Brought up the possibility when she asked Kavanaugh this question have you ever pass out from drinking
[noise] I Love salad would be no but I've gone to sleep but I've never blacked out that's the that's the the allegation a and a sense that's wrong
But what exactly is a black what do we know about it the answer these questions we're joined by Dr Richard said he's chair of Boston University school of public health department of community health sciences
And an addiction medicine specialist knee joined us from the school of public a health a doctor say it's good to have you thanks for being with us sure it's a pleasure to be here
So can we just start with the basic definition if one exists ... what does it mean to blackout first
You know I mean the the question that you heard asked there was really the wrong question it's not the same and this is a key point it's not the same as passing out ... blackout is when there's something that you don't remember
And it happened when you were drinking and it happens when you drink a lot very quickly something that might happen in a drinking game when you drink ten or Fifteen shots one and a half ounces of eighty proof liquor something in that range
A and to all around you you appear normal or intoxicated that is that yours you're walking and talking and responding to cues and your environment and and people who are with you
Are but later the next day or someone asks if you remember what happened some specific event and you don't recall it matters blackout so what
Does that mean in terms of what's happening chemically in the brain that we're walking and functioning I mean maybe were stumbling around a little bit maybe are words are were slurring are words a little bit but your point is we appear to be conscious conscious essentially but we don't remember a big chunk of what happened so what's going on with the brain
You know I mean I I think that we used to believe that alcohol is simply base the brain and had sort of a general effect
On the entire brain and and that is true at very high levels
But it seems to have some specific effects on receptors and narrow the transmission and a while I Can't really tell you the exact nerve transmission that's that's involved here
What we do know is that there are parts of the brain and involved in learning and making either short term or longer term memory that are affected and what happens here is the person knows what's going on but the experience doesn't get put into long term memory
So they might remember that if you're there in front of somebody and you ask them what happened just now just one minute ago they can tell you but if you ask them the next day it's not there because
Uh the hippocampus as a part of the brain where we're learning happens and it doesn't stay there for the long term
... so do we know ah something about who experience of these these blackout sooner words are some people who drink more susceptible to them than others
Yankees but if they play the athletic she's not quite willing to make that commitment so it really could kind of depend on who the hitters are which team they're facing and all that he also talked about the home field advantage how much the team loves playing at Fenway they hit better there
Uh the crowd obviously helps give them energy as they go forward right yeah I mean that's got to be a huge in this in the red Sox did incredibly well it's in ... park the season yesterday seven and twenty four on the air
So what about Chris say all the teams ac had a couple of students on the disabled list he didn't seem to be throwing as well when he came off the disabled list toward the end of the season ... what do you
Say about him so Alex course that he is not at all worried and he's a hundred percent sure that sale is going to be ready to go come playoff time but I think yeah exactly [laughter] I think it's important to look at the contacts there you're talking about he went on a ...
A he came back for one started against Baltimore through Ninety eight Ninety nine miles an hour and then went almost immediately back on the DL with shoulder information and since coming back that second time his velocity has really been down
A court said that specifically in this final started against Baltimore last Wednesday that or what he saw out a sale actually despite the performance in the down velocity was pretty encouraging
The fact that when the game was on the line and the last one and he hit Ninety for a few times it wasn't Ninety nine but he went from eighty eight eighty nine to Ninety four I Know is there I Know is there and the fact that he came to me right away you know after the game is over and he he
He felt that in the ... and he saw it on the video I'm like okay you know this was this was mechanics
So or whether it's mechanics or an injury there is no doubt about the fact that silk velocity has been noticeably down
In that Baltimore start last week his fastball average just over Ninety miles an hour that's the lowest average basketball of his entire career ... you're scaring me we've got to move on to the New England patriots a for a moment or two of the patriots quieted critics on Sunday by blowing up the Miami Dolphins thirty eight to seven
The pets are now two and two on the air how big was that when for them on Sunday
There was actually a huge win what you're saying something for September football uh I've been a patriots fan for a long time as well the steam always kind of struggles out the gate and by November or December their clicking on all cylinders but had they lost to Miami they would have been down three games to a division opponent that is a tough hill to climb in a ... game season
Are so I got to ask you a quickly before uh we go about
Uh Celtics dark Kyrie Irving he made headlines last year when he sat on a pod cast that he believed the earth was flat he's given different answers since then about whether we actually believe that or not but he addressed it at the Forbes under thirty some ad on Monday what do you say well
Interesting I bet you didn't think we'd be talking flatter than a sports uh he's gone back and forth about whether or not he was initially joking he seemed to finally uh admit that he did genuinely believe this when he started at the time at
The time I was like ... and the conspiracies everybody's been there [noise]

You know what's going on with our world
You know like how these the ...
Even went on to apologize to science teachers everywhere [laughter] right so he's climbed out of that flat earth a rabbit on the radio Boston's Chris that are expressed thanks so much for like ...
Finally tonight we want to bring you another sample of WB you are in the Boston Globe's new investigative podcast called last seen it goes deep into the unsolved mystery of the world's largest unsolved art heist at Boston's Isabel a steward gardening museum almost Thirty years ago
Last night on the show we brought you the end of episode to we heard host Kelly horn and jak wrote illegal explore the theory that the ... was an inside job
Tonight we had the first half of the episode three which asks the question was the highest plant in Dorchester auto body shop in the belly of Boston's criminal underworld you suspect the guards ...
No I'm just not enough
I mean his big league decision AAA boiled down to ... this is Fenway Park
This is not a big league criminal defense attorney with some strong opinions about the greatest art heist in history
Let me say this way the guy that museum robbery was so easy [noise] someone does it wasn't a salami of bird colors come you're going to do it because they have
Musicians guiding millions and millions and millions of dollars worth of paintings musicians that's like putting Dracula in charge of a blood bag

There's a lot there's a lot of there's a lot of murders a lot of organized crime is water disorganized shrimp
Armed robberies drug deals armored cars pickup jobs you name it
But it's a crime that gave Boston Isabella Stewart Gardner museum the dubious distinction of
Being the scene of the single largest art theft in history that seems to hold special meaning for that though framed reproductions of some of the stolen paintings hanging his law offices including one he's especially partial to the concert by Vermeer
To print you just talk to your so wonderful magnificent harsh winter if your kid appreciate you know from what is a great masters um [noise] what else
Is Aleppo takes a particular interest in the Gardner heist it isn't only because he feels the loss of what was stolen it's also because he just might know who did it no other defense attorney has represented more criminals who have been tied if only unofficially
To the gardener case seven and all they are men Aleppo has long defended for other crimes
And while he won't comment on what they might have known about the plan to steal some of the most valuable and bill loved treasures from Isabella Stewart gardeners collection he will say this about whoever pulled off the robbery
This was done by a bunch of ... 'cause this was very well organized well organized ... every single thing
By day let that means the FBI
And he's right in the twenty eight and a half years since the highest they haven't found any of the stolen masterpieces but one of the places the FBI has been looking at the longest reveals a lot about who they think might be behind this still unsolved crime
It's a car repair shop called T. R. C. auto electric a place hard to beat for criminals per capita and many of them in the back of planning or pulling off the Gardner heist have needed
Martin let both services it's because of other crimes they hatched at T. R. C. [noise] the question is was the plan to Isabella Stewart gardening museum one of them
[noise]
If one road to some of the suspects in the Isabella Stewart Gardner museum heist leads to the law officers of Martin Aleppo another leads to Thirteen twenty five Dorchester avenue in Dorchester neighborhood of Boston one day last summer Kelly drove there with the garden museums head of security Anthony ...
[noise] wait here that's a that's pure cereals really
[laughter] I in my mind it was a much much greater thing okay [noise]
Picture a low slung brick and cinderblock building much longer than it is wide with corrugated metal doors there's a spindly tree on the sidewalk out front it's Kennedy juice bar to offer shade under withering July sun
Does everything you'd expect to find it a mechanics and it's sort of vehicles hooked up three open repair bays and spare tires in parts leaning against an exterior wall painted and industrial base
What there isn't any suggestion whatsoever that the former TR see auto electric was in its heyday a front for thriving hub of criminal activity it's only about four miles from the Isabella Stewart gardening museum but this place could not feel farther away
It's true that is a world away you know you go from the Italian Renaissance a lot so that is developed you were a gardener built a to resemble the ones she left a saying in Venice
And here we are as a single story brick building that's just a a real difference
Look what it is a great place for a crime headquarters right people coming and going all dirty it's perfect completely
Fishes too I mean I Would have driven right

... her killed his wife Linda in a jealous rage in front of their three year old daughter Susan Daniel was out of prison living in Massachusetts and wants to see his daughter one more time she's in Florida struggling in her marriage and trying to write a memoir
Her grandmother lowest is consumed by rage over her daughter's murder the story follows the three characters as they move towards a possible meeting
And reckoning hundred abuse the third is the author of seven books including his novel house of sand and fog and his wonderful memoir county he lives in Newport he'll be at the bridal theater tonight talking with me actually about this new book
Gone so long and he's with us right now in the studio welcome back to write a Washington Oh thank you I think it's great to be back it's great to have you back I was just saying you it feels like a holiday when you come out with his own thank you for that so what inspired the story was there a germ of an idea that sort of haunted you and give them to go on so long
Yeah well that's exactly the word haunted I um
It came from a a project I was working on a it was a a screen play I was researching and it was about a real intimate doing real time in ...
And it's an interesting story and in in that process I found myself in Chicago interviewing people who'd known him for years and one was a man who was a whole who I enjoyed having lunch with he was in his sixties he was kind of quiet and unassuming and
A warm and really gave me a lot of good stuff to work with and I took a bunch of notes and a bottom lunch and as I was paying the bill I said I forgive me I guess I just have to ask what what'd you do time
Said oh I killed my wife and I just you know you have you read my memoir Tony I have a particular hatred for for male violence against women and and kids and
And so I just took a breath and just want to get the hell out of that restaurant and but I I said well do you have kids and he said oh yeah but they don't want to see me and that's what lodged in my psyche I couldn't get out of my head for three or four years it just circled in my head this
This notion of well you've done the worst thing possible to know a human being one who you vowed to love and care for by the way yeah you have a child or children with that person you still love the kids
And I I just couldn't get that out and and so I had to write my way into it in five years later there you
Go [laughter] so your character Daniel is dealing with this quandary he committed this terrible crime and is now trying to come to terms with it there's an effort to sort of a personal redemption he's doing some good works he's helping older people
And he wants to connect with his daughter I'm so can you read um we have an excerpt right there in front of you I'd be happy to where she's beginning to think about a writing to Susan's his daughter
Sure thank you and the joy beneath the toaster under loose pins and pencils stubs and the broken calculator is the small pat I'm which you multiplies his prize times the number of chair holes and he pulls out the pad and one of the newer ... sits at the table
He stares at the St Louis lines and all that empty space between them he gets up slowly and fills himself a glass of water he sits back down the were the fan the streak of a crew in the trees
He leans forward and writes
Dear Susan he crosses this out
My dear Susan know this sounds too much like she's his that he deserves or Susan no too cold my daughter's Susan yes that's better it's the truth but it's still too cold
My dear daughters Susan that's right isn't it all for words in that order though there are still the feeling he's claiming something that is no longer rightfully his didn't start with that why not start with that I've got no right to call you these things
But even with everything that happened you are my daughter our daughter your mother was a very good mother I Hope you remember that about her she did not deserve
He stops not hot Smokey kitchen the overhead light missing one bald so it was never a bright
Enough in there and then to she had had it she was screaming and she was leaving and it was like being told your heart
In Oregon's are about to go for a little ride and you have no say in it none whatsoever
[noise] so that's Andre to abuse the third reading from um
His new novel gone so long you know I have to say I'm In the middle of this book right now and I'm I'm loving it but I find myself struggling with Daniel because you're portraying with so much humanity and making this
What feels like kind of his valiant effort at ... personal redemption but then I kind of
Like you I Want her to go you know I have a a horrendous aversion as well to people who do horrible things to women not to mention killing them and little kids yeah [noise] so you know helped me out I mean talk about this sort of moral complexity that sort of surround factor
Yeah well you know he's he's a ... when when the novel begins we we started slowly learned that he's dying of prostate cancer that he has purposely not a sought treatment and he's sort of embrace in his own death
Or he he makes a living as a chair Cain or he lives in ... Massachusetts in a small yard or he volunteers are at the council on aging and drives you know elderly women usually two doctors appointments in the grocery store et cetera [noise]

Really fascinating discussions like the ones you've heard already with debt Becker in under the booze or the or the third there and we are coming up to all things considered also at four o'clock or Sam plumbing since you're here I have a question for you we have and maybe I'm putting on the spot because maybe you know the answer to this but we have heard in this fund drive
From a nine thousand eight hundred fifty people and just fifty people say in the last forty minutes or so how many people are listening right now do you think
You know if it does at this moment in uh in any given Fifteen minute period of time probably Fifteen thousand
Fifteen thousand we've heard route fifty we know that many of you have already pledged for which we are very grateful and take you to the fifty who just pledged I'm Jay Clayton do we know what percentage usually people who listen pledge yeah it's about
A third
A third so that's not bad but we can do a lot
To do better we you know we've done great in this fundraiser but there is room for you and the need for you because we have about a hundred and forty five thousand dollars you have to raise and we're going to wrap this fundraiser up in about three short ours
Because one forty three right now one forty three yeah one eight hundred nine zero nine nine cue eight seven
In fact this morning I was talking earlier um so the average a list or perhaps just like yourself
A listens about ten hours a week and if you're a die hard be you are listening or you might listen for Fifteen hours a week and you might tune in an average of two point three times a day or something like that and over the course of the week it might be twelve or Fifteen times a week
And the point is you're coming and going coming and going
It's I mean one of the great things about radio is you and I both know Lisa and Jay having all worked in this industry for so long is that we don't have to think oh that television shows on we think oh they're going to have an interesting thing on the radio right and oh it's all things considered times over the course of three hours or whatever it is
I Know that I'm going to hear some interesting story it's
Never like fifty seven channels and nothing's on
Yeah exactly and I think and and that's one of the great I was thinking something you said earlier Jay that we're all about cure ration here we are cure rating what stories to put it on the air word cure rating of how much time to give stories for curiosity what programs to put on the air when to put them on the air
All in honor of the kind of journalism that you as a listener expect to get and uh we apparently are doing a great job because we have a lot of
Listeners just like yourself listening who give us support and you know thankfully we don't have to go back and ask for that support that often we're at the very end of the line right now where it's very important to hear from you
That is right just about three hours left to go in the sun dried here's the number again one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven W. B. U. R. dot org
And uh and it is and give you plenty of reasons to call and also you know because it's what you see when you go see the deli BYU dot org it's what's he let you listen to every time you tuned in on the air but then an added incentive I'm Jay Clayton can tell us about it and comes in the form of a huge super
Yeah comes in the form of a choice of a huge Subaru actually the outback one of the cross trek from city side Subaru in Belmont they're providing this
Some lucky winner is going to get this car at the end of this fund drive which is seven o'clock this evening it could be you but if you haven't given a contribution yet that is the way that you get entered into this contest so and of course that's the way you support WB you are and protect independent journalism here

The radio Boston I'm Anthony Brooks the White House and Senate Republicans are hopeful that judge Brett Kavanaugh as one big step closer to being confirmed to the U.S Supreme Court
After the FBI completed its investigation into sexual allegations against the nominee members of the Senate were able to review it in a secure room and the Capitol today groups of Republicans and Democrats were allowed to view the report for one hour each
As far as we can understand the report will not be released to the public Republican Chuck Grassley said there's nothing new in the report that we didn't already know Democrats say the FBI probe didn't go far enough
And they're calling it a sham among the Massachusetts senator Ed Markey who joins us now from Washington Senator good to have you back on the program that you ... did you see the report if so what did you see [noise]
Um yeah we we were put into a room Seventeen senators
Given one hour or two read approximately I'm thirty pages thirty five pages of
Of of interviews are summaries of interviews that were conducted a with a ten people are in only ten people
Um [noise] the um the most disturbing part of this is that uh uh in the most absurd part of this is the United states senators who have to vote
On the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh only given one hour
And one copy of the document amongst all of the senators to share within one hour to read a into a making assessment as to whether or not
The um the information is something of that is disqualifying or
A should lead to even more inquiry being made because of the unanswered questions in the document right
So Sen in that one hour did you get a sense one way or the other that that that are in corroborated anything that for example Dr blindly forward alleged or that it didn't what did you come away with that when
I came away with a very clear conclusion that Donald Trump and the Republican leadership in the Senate
Had decided that they were going to engage in a cover up that they were going to limit very narrowly the number of people who could be interviewed that the FBI would not follow up on any leads a that were produced by those interviews or other people who had
Come forward separate from the people who they interviewed and so as a result
I left the room with the very clear
Feeling that a day that is the Republicans led by Donald Trump we're trying to engage in a complete fraud in terms of an FBI investigation limiting the FBI not allowing them to follow leads and by the way inside of the room
Was also at least a thousand pages or all of a
Hotline tips that came in that have not been reviewed by the FBI not followed by the FBI not
A not a attempted to uh to uh to see if there was useful information right while many of the tips are probably not
Helpful within that large body of tips they came in there are in the opinion of our democratic judiciary staff there are

Mrs rainy of all and I'm Deborah Becker if you think the criminal justice system is biased should you be barred from sitting on a jury that was the threat of a question before the Massachusetts Supreme judicial court today in
The case of a juror who was dismissed after saying that she believes the criminal justice system is arrayed against African American males
Joining us on the line to talk about this is judge Nancy Gardner retired federal judge in senior lecturer at Harvard law school she's also WB or legal analyst and she wrote an abacus brief in this case Hi Nancy Hi so so let's get a little bit of background here after searching an apartment in Brockton police found cocaine
And they charged Clinton Williams and African American man with possession with intent to distribute now during jury selection for millions trial a prospective juror was asked if she might have bias
And she said yes because she worked with low income used including teenagers convicted of drug crimes and she also said she does think that the criminal justice system is unfair to young black males
The prosecutor asked that should be excused the judge dismissed or for cars so what's wrong with that
One thing about it this way
If she had said for example that I Believe that the criminal justice system is always fair and that the outcome is always correct we would not have recused start even though that's not true we would not have disqualified her even though that's not true and so to some degree this is a statement
That is a general statement which actually is is also true that is to say that the criminal justice system is unfair too
The problem was there was another question that the judge should've asked which is having that in mind having that in in in your view would you be able to be um would you be able to be fair in this case in other words one can have a general view of the of the criminal justice system but nevertheless said this is what I Would do
In a particular case we do that in the death penalty sending all the time what's your opinion about the death penalty well I Am generally oppose well do you think that you could impose it if the facts require it yes
That second question is the bias question because that is saying this set of ideas would be an impediment to by being fair in this case but general
Views about the criminal justice system on either side should be in a different category
... says so basically would you say are the guidelines for determining potential bias and a potential juror the fitness of a juror I mean it it can people can have all kinds of opinions and I would assume that you would want a variety of opinions among the jury pool so

Well I mean I guess we should start with what the heck to call it I mean is it after two point oh is it the U.S MCI after the next rests on like the village people the U.S MCA a smoker um it really seems like we should keep calling it NAFTA because it's mostly NAFTA
The changes are slight non trivial but slight and the basic framework remains in place low tariffs among the three nations of North America
So so let's talk about some of the some of the changes even if they are slight the babies are dairy auto what are the big ...
Yeah so well it depends what you mean by big ... of the goals of the Trump Administration was able to accomplish include some increased access to the Canadian dairy market candidate has traditionally made it very difficult for other countries to export dairy and agriculture
And now some dairy farmers will be able to export more cheese a little more milk more sort of dry milk powder that's easier to transport um so that's a slight gain we're talking about fractions of a percentage point in trade for a teen number of jobs but it's something that you mentioned really cared about and the got it
And the next thing is some new incentives to make sure auto manufacturers build their cars in the U.S instead of a in low wage factories in Mexico and
So is this good for Canada is it good for Canada I mean again the big picture is it doesn't change all that much Canadian dairy farmers are not happy but it's not going to affect them and it's a different way and the Canadians got something in exchange for that which is
The ability to continue either exporting were dumping depending on your perspective suffered lumber this has been an ongoing American complaint about Canada they subsidize their lumber industry and then the excess ends up back in the United states under price and it hurts loggers and a lumber industry in the U. S.
Uh and the Trump Administration loan with previous administrations tried to end pieces of NAFTA that made this possible they didn't so the Canadians get keep subsidizing exporting lumber they have to give up a little bit of a except a little bit more in the way up there and
What about this independent tariff dispute settlements system that was involved so
That's okay so they're there to to think about here one is the kind of look lumber problem
Or can the nation's contest each other when
They dump and the answer is it's very hard to do and it's still very hard to do the other is the investor or state settlement process that's like companies who are really unhappy about some new law in Mexico or Canada
There was a system where they had their own special courts where they could go and contests these laws that are passed by parliaments
And they could win rulings from court special courts outside of a normal court system
Of this has gotten increasingly
Um controversial in light of ... in other places for instance you've had cigarette companies that will soon nations for anti smoking campaigns any special courts and so they've gotten really unpopular and that mostly went away there's still one exception which is different oil and gas company in Mexico decides to nationalize the gas industry you'll still be alive to complain
But apart from that no that's gone and not actually could be a big deal it's something that the business lobby in the United states cared about they may continue to lobby against the new NAFTA
Will see so this is a victory for the way
I think if nothing else it shows that I think it counts as the first real evidence that Trump's a scorched earth or some ... um foreign policy negotiating strategy can pay off
A he has taken well he's levy tariffs against Canada and Mexico he threatened to throw out the agreement he threatened further terrorist he then split the negotiation refused to negotiate with both at the same time to go kind of divide and conquer strategy or this generated a lot of resentment but then it ended in an agreement
And I think until now it's been hard to point
And it goes shading posture aggressive as it is can work but now he can you can say yes we got this agreement I think that's a big deal I think that's a big deal for the agreement and in some ways just reinforces his tendency to acted belligerent ways with other countries
And this led through Sunday this deal than it was sort of ... this was a deadline right while the
... ... it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't a deadline you know it's like
Um it was a self imposed deadline and the reason it was ... just because well there are elections coming up in Mexico and we really want to get the new deal signed before the new government comes into Mexico because they may not like it
So this is a very strange part of this whole thing is you've got a new president who's already been elected in Mexico but hasn't taken office takeoffs in December and they're trying to rush this through before she take office
In fear that he may oppose it so there's a kind of anti democratic ... an outright and Jim a credit but there are sort of playing with against democratic systems in other countries to make the move is fast that's the only reason we have this deadline
It thought these this deal still needs to be approved
It needs to be approved by all three countries I got easier and Canada and Mexico when you're parliamentary systems it's harder on the west though I'm there won't be a vote until January that's because these kinds of deals
Have long vetting requirements congressman tickets times going to look I have to by law so they may not vote until after the midterms and after the new Congress comes to DC in January which means you could see Democrats who control the house getting a vote on this deal
Um I still think they'll vote for it but it'll be an interesting test
A and magic ...
She not it I mean I I enjoy matter and on our listeners who can't see a [laughter] basically the challenge will be people if the Democrats take control of the house it will be on a wave of anti Trump sentiment right so they will come in and it will be very hard for them to vote for a Trump trade deal like a smoker
Um US MCA or NAFTA or whatever calling it
A on the other hand this trade deal is not a big deal there aren't big reasons to oppose it
And the few changes that do exist aligned with some democratic priorities like are there are tighter of their better protections for workers in Mexico that's something that Democrats support why would they vote against ...
Okay well it'll be interesting Evan Horwitz quick study columnist for the Boston Globe thanks so much for coming in thank you to stay with us there's more ahead

Welcome back to radio Boston I'm Deborah Becker with deep divisions over the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh we spent some time today talking about how young people are processing this controversy and this cultural moment
A Quinnipiac University poll released yesterday said forty eight percent of American voters most believe Kavanaugh's accuser Christine Blasey Ford forty one percent
Most believe Brett Kavanaugh and today President Trump said this
Is a very scary time for young men in America would you be a you'll see of something that you may not be guilty of
That how does this divide effect teenagers particularly when it comes to talking with them about sexual assault and consent joining us in Studio ... mega rebel she's founder and director of partners in sex education in Oregon
Into schools cross Massachusetts Hi thanks for coming in hello thanks so much for having me unless there is we want to hear from you have you talked with your children about these hearings and what do you tell them what do you tell teenagers about their Brett Kavanaugh
Hearings and the Senate Judiciary committee hearings and they're related controversy that's been going on since the hearing the end it looked as education around sex and consent looked like in your school
They would feel regretful embarrassed humiliated or ashamed of the next day including him
And I think there's a way to help people understand that not only somebody saying yes because again
It's not like going to a movie but if you tell you what's going to this will they won't let alone then I'll like it oh come on let's give it a try it's not the same kind of thing so getting enthusiastic and said like yes this is something they're both ready for that both interested in the both willing to try
It I think they can get a little more clear to not cross those lines that people well she said okay and
My also so ... is there are those good guidelines ... thank
You Helene that was an amazingly um articulate explanation of enthusiastic consent I particularly like your description of how somebody feels about it later that somebody should not be doing things that they are and shamed of
Um [noise] uh and and all of those other things so I Love that description I Do want to address
Um the the idea that we have comprehensive way of ... in Massachusetts I um would love to know what community or an on an because it sounds like it is does a great job
Um with comprehensive sexuality education however Massachusetts as a whole is very inconsistent because Massachusetts does not have any required
Um curriculum and is one of the about
Half of the states in the nation that requires no kind of sexual health
Um curriculum doesn't require a anything at all only eight states in the nation require consent curriculum and Massachusetts certainly not one of them and I just wanted to say that we had tried to pass last year the healthy youth act
And the healthy youth act would have
Required not that schools had sex ed but that if they had sex ed it'd be medically accurate
Age appropriate and inclusive
And so that means maps to the national sex ed standards it has to be true and it has to be gender and orientation inclusive
It does sound as if uh you may have that in your community so I think that's excellent but I Hope that we can get all the communities to catch up in Massachusetts and so right now than in the schools that you work in I mean are there wide differences
Are among schools in terms of what students are taught so uh partners
In sex education um goes to a wide variety of schools including some public schools and charter schools although the bulk of the schools that we go to our independence schools
Um public schools are very inconsistent
And whether they have sex education and this is largely based on whether they have a health teacher who is committed to sex education and who I can do content education and all of these things I strongly recommend having health teacher um because that is the person who is the most well
Versed in social emotional
Learning okay well maybe that's the topic of our our next show mega rebel founder and director of partners in sex education and organization that delivers sex education in schools across the state thanks for being with us and thank you so much

Finally tonight we want to bring you another sample of WB you are in the Boston Globe's new investigative podcast titled last seen it looks at the unsolved mystery of the world's largest art heist
At Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner museum last night we brought you the first part of episode to warehouse Kelly horn and jak wrote all ego began exploring the idea what if the Gardner heist was an inside job tonight in the second half
We learn about some strange behavior of security guard Rick ...
Twenty minutes before ap as opposed to the into the museum the alarms we'd have tells us he opened and closed the same door why would have done that was he's signaling the bad guys investigators have wondered whether you're saying hey the coast is clear or was it as Rick Avon has always said it was
Just something he did every night to make sure the doors alarm was working
With what I was a good writer [noise] loves the alarm off the door of a real or let him go [laughter]
I don't care what he says there's no way
John Paul Kroger trained the guards including ... for the overnight shift at the Gardner Museum
That right there is a huge risk it makes no sense that you would allow yourself to why in the world would you open that up there's a camera outside that shows palace road there's no reason in the world why you would ever open the door
So if you could somehow be proved that added opened and closed the outside door every time he worked the overnight than is opening the night of the highest looks a lot less
In two thousand ten Rob Fisher the assistant us attorney in charge of the guard your investigation had an idea ... to security changed from the night before the robbery when Rick Abbott was also an dating show me that Abbott opened and closed the door that night and I believe that he did it as a matter of course
What did you see when you when you watch the video from the night before
It was not a guard checking to make sure the doors were secure and long it was somebody being let in after hours and being let in you know where the robbers when ...
Most exactly twenty four hours later oh
So the surveillance footage from the night before the Gardner heist does show I gather opening the door
When the U.S attorney's office released the surveillance video twenty five years after the ice and they did so with a public appeal who is this man it was the closest thing to a bombshell that we've had and the gardener mystery was it a bad guy was it a dry run for the robbery how we finally going to solve this thing
Well no and now and now we know who came in the night before
Yes who is it
A it's a personal we've identified and we are actually certainly ... entry was not connected to the highest in any way shape or form
Anthony I'm Laurie won't id the night before a visitor but three former security guards we interviewed confirmed the identity as well as a source close to the investigation demanding question was the Gardner Museum deputy director of security it turns out recap it was just letting in his boss
But John Paul Kroger who trained the guards for their third shift duties says no one was to be let into the museum after hours after not your boss not even cops
The protocol was very straightforward name and badge number calling verify their identity and then if there's a legitimate reason for them to be there then only you let them in a wreck has made some statements that they were never trained on that that's completely false
The other guard on duty tonight if the heist the one we're only calling by his first name Randy says security at the gardening museum was lax
Oh dear member or somebody order pizza or some kind of food delivery and they're just posed a write in when they came to the side door it looked like the kind of thing was done there all the time
By not guards give Randy as he says he did witness a pizza delivery guy being ... into the museum in the middle of the night how tight put that security protocol have been
Certain people really did take their job seriously and then others really did not
Cynthia de just worked at the Gardner Museum as a security guard at the time the heist to hear her tail it if there was a rule against late night visitors wasn't followed not even by the gardeners than director and Holly
She had had dinner with people and brought the men after dinner like at ten o'clock at night or later she would bring people into the museum and go into the galleries that breaks that
That mindset that breaks that chain of command do not let anyone in after five well
What is a guard on underlying supposed to then do
So why is this a big deal
Why can't the museum director comment at night to walk through the galleries with a trusted friend
Why can't the deputy security director come in and chat with the guard well it's a very big deal according to security experts what if the director at the door is under duress with a gun to her head
What if there is a bad guy just beyond view of the security camera waiting for his chance to slip into the museum
That's why you would never let anyone in after hours the simpler the rule the easier it is to follow no one means no one
Joke gift Abbott's own bosses broke the rule is it fair to blame him for breaking it too
And does all this door opening business say more about the state of security at the Gardner Museum than it does about ...

Welcome back to radio Boston I'm Anthony Brooks and we're going to touch down in Washington to catch up with a fast moving story about
Embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh an FBI investigation into allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were in high school is expected to wrap up this week Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell expect there to be a vote to confirm
Meanwhile President Trump who'd been somewhat restrained in his comments about all this
Shifted tone yesterday at a political rally in Mississippi where he mocked lousy Ford
I have one right I Want to be
Well you know there was one of ... how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago when I don't [noise]

Hubble can Senator Susan Collins of Maine Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska all key swing votes in this nomination fight
Criticize the president Collins calling his comments just plain wrong Murkowski calling them appalling joining us now from Washington is so he'll ... poor national political reporter for ... for Bloomberg Politics so he'll uh good to have you thanks for being on the show
Hey Anthony thanks for having me you don't want to ask you about the president who's been as we mentioned somewhat restrained about all of
This but then yesterday he sort of return to form what kind of reaction has there been to this attack on Christine Blasey Ford [noise]
Right well they were reaction on Capitol Hill is as you can imagine an overall pretty negative Democrats are very critical of his remarks several Republicans as you pointed out those three key votes like Murkowski Holland's also critical of president
But it remains unclear that that changes the calculus in any meaningful way each senator these Republican senators you just mentioned are not going to
You know cast their votes on the ... or something the president says there are a ... a ... you know thinking of a lot more complicated
Right well I Want to talk a little bit about Senator Jeff flake who was in Boston on Monday and talked about the importance of uh
Yesterday at the Atlantic festival in Washington he raised concerns about the partisan nature of Kavanaugh's testimony last friday here here's a bit of what he said
It was very troubled by the tone of the remarks the initial defense the judge Kavanaugh gave
I Hope that I Would sound that ... if I felt that I was unjustly maligned but then it went on and the interaction with some members were sharp and partisan and that concerns me we can't have this on the court so
Interesting about that so he was when I heard Senator Flake in Boston a on Monday he was a little more restrained than that comment or which is pretty forceful a saying that we can't have this on the court what what are you hearing that comment
Well this has become a big part of the whole debate surrounding Kavanaugh one of the um main democratic arguments is that his credibility came in the question that hearing about his temperament ... not very judicial and otherwise he lashed out you know he was angry with low the village rent at times
Um he in other words the flakes sounded like what an innocent man would sound like if he's accused but still the argument is is that how it should sound ... artist and then um you know attitude so I that's been a big part of the ...
Part of the discussion that's been I'm a huge part of the criticism coming forward that even if he is innocent
Can someone like Brett Kavanaugh will be trusted to rule and to judge him partially if he's expressing the overtly art invent them and then of course the question and others are asking is is he going to hold a grudge as a result
Right right ... interesting that flake is bringing that up he's of course one of the the the key swing votes last friday he was the one who sort of shocked the world when he pushed for a delay to allow the FBI investigation
So what do we know about ah the FBI investigation so far first of all when do we know when it's expected to conclude one we might see something about it from it will we see something from it
I've heard some chatter amongst senators today that it could wrap up as early as today and uh the the report with first go to the White House and pretty soon it would be here on Capitol Hill with the according to
Senate majority leader McConnell available for every senator to look at try to lead won't be released to the public however we don't know exactly when that's going to end the FBI has not been a you know speaking publicly about this investigation as it usually doesn't but
Everyone is is kind of anxious to see when it comes out and people are on guard perhaps to potentially land today if not later
Right and so he'll water lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez who who is also made allegations against judge Kavanaugh what are they saying about the FBI investigation so far
They are arguing that the FBI is not conducting a thorough investigation that it's not following up on a request from them or for follow up and
For interviews to speak with the FBI is that it hasn't you know pursued other leaders that they consider relevant to the investigation or tried to contact other witnesses that they believe you know could corroborate um or at least shed some light on the other allegations here so they have said publicly
That um that they you know they worry the FBI hands or being tied and that it's not conducting a thorough investigation and that was concerned that the ... and may have had announced critics here on Capitol Hill
That's a mistake but there's also this sort of disbelief that someone could entirely forget something a traumatic or something serious that might have happened and and that isn't the case you ... you really can forget in a blackout the other thing that strikes me that really struck me about the interaction
Is a I think everybody would agree that when he was asked about his alcohol use that he was quite annoyed at the question he seemed angry about it and annoyed that somebody might be accusing him of drinking too much
And it turns out that one of the medical questionnaires that we used to detect alcohol use disorder
Or one of the questions is about if you've ever been annoyed when people ask you about or criticize your drinking I'm not suggesting that he has an alcohol use disorder he may or he may not I can't diagnose that up but it is a feature and it raises that question I I also wouldn't suggest that heavy drinking disqualifies anyone from
Having an important job as many people with alcohol use disorder or fully employed and quite successful
Or but it does it raise that question for me
Well it's interesting too because if you look at this for example from a judge Kavanaugh's point of view if he's absolutely convinced that he didn't do this
I'm Andy had a blackout I mean he sort of being asked to prove a negative I mean he's certainly didn't do it if he had a blackout he wouldn't remembered if he did so it sort of puts him in this peculiar situation as well if he is innocent
Life right I think in that case if if if he understood what a blackout was and he understood that it could happen if you drank heavily and rapidly then he would have to at least be open to the possibility that he did something terrible and didn't remember it you know and and that's why I mentioned before
Current blackouts uh and and have a more serious condition alcohol use disorder often feel guilty that they may have done something and they and they feel regret about it and say gee you know I I I really don't remember it but if I did that I'm really sorry about it right
Well well this has been really fascinating I'm a doctor Richard states he's chair of Boston University school of public health department of community health sciences and he's an addiction medicine specialist Dr ... thanks so much for joining us that I really appreciate it

Our senior political reporter Anthony Brooks joins us from Boston city hall plaza now Anthony hello welcome back to the self
Pay good to be here don't
Sell Jeff Flake Republican senator just spoke about an hour ago I'm told that this Forbes under thirty summit what did he say
Will his main message was that he pushed for this extra FBI investigation because he'd been trouble for some time that they weren't getting the answers that they needed about allegations of sexual misconduct by I'm Brett Kavanaugh
Back when he was in high school flake said he wants to make sure that the FBI investigations up to standard as he put it
And he talked about his decision making at the end of that extraordinary hearing a last friday here's a bit here's a bit of what he's
Had been trouble for a while but I I felt that we weren't doing due diligence with a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court
If there are questions that haven't been answered and the the FBI could've investigated I felt that it needed to know since the Judiciary Committee only has one person majority for Republicans eleven to him I'm and I'm not the eleventh republic
They're so does he use that leverage to ah convinced um some of his fellow Republicans and the White House and you have some Democrats going along with him that
He would advance I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination the full Senate if the FBI or took up this limited uh investigation what you're doing now he was also asked if he found Dr bloody for credible she's a professor who who brought the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh
If he found her credible then why uh advance her nomination to the floor and flake said basically that he also found a Kavanaugh's denials believable so that's why he wanted
A move the FBI to do more and he was also asked if he was uncomfortable with Kavanaugh's anger and is in a sense of partisanship
And he said he was uncomfortable with that but he also said if I had been accused of something that I didn't do I'd be angry too so that was a what he said pretty much in summer
More for those were books auto [laughter]
Welcome back to radio Boston I'm Deborah Becker or their secret courts are operating in Massachusetts the Boston Globe says there are in the form of closed door hearings before a single court official where thousands of criminal charges can and do disappear
The paper analyzed data from what are known as show cause hearings which are held before court clerk than the paper says its analysis shows an arbitrary part of our state's criminal justice system
Globe spotlight reporter Nicole Duncan joins us to talk about this Nicole welcome to radio Boston Hi thanks for having me also on the line is Joe Simon's a criminal defense attorney in Boston Thanks for being here Joe
Hi thanks for having me during our conversation also we're going to hear from a member of the governor's council parents Kennedy and we'll talk with him as well but first Nicole I Want to start with you why are you calling me secret courts
So in Massachusetts and around the country generally criminal proceedings for adults are always public suffer the minute a person is arranged arraigned on a charge in the courtroom you or I can go into the courtroom and we can look up the case
But in Massachusetts if you're accused of a crime and having been arrested you generally have a right to this hearing that data that's completely hidden from the public
Um I Can't go into the hearing and it's a very different from every aspect of the open court that you know we see in court houses across the country but this on three arrest pre arraignment three arrest sorry not pre arrest it's usually for people who haven't been arrested such pre arraignment
Okay uh so so give us an example of of what you found here in terms of the criminal charges that are heard in these show cause hearings
Such a huge range I mean in general misdemeanors are the ones that are going to go to this but in our story we actually found that
No one out of twelve of them were felonies so there are some serious charges that were going into these uh to these hearings for example I'm the beginning of our story it's an average aggravated assault claim and domestic violence
Case there is a motor vehicle homicide case and so these are the kinds of cases I end up
Um being
Within ... closed hearings without any accountability
So how would it be that these cases when you're talking about charges like motor vehicle homicide
That there wouldn't have been an arraignment already that they already wouldn't have been slated to go through traditional court as opposed to a show cause hearing lick will who makes that determination that these cases might be fit to go to a show cause hearing as opposed to a traditional judge [noise]
And so in some cases the police department might set it up for hearing instead on instead of going straight to arraignment because they find that the person isn't a flight risk or a danger to other people for example I'm so that it so they're saying oh there might be
Um some questions about it so they might send it to these kind of hearings and in general if you are accused of misdemeanor
And you haven't been arrested you know some people will know that you have a right to this hearing so a lot of defense attorneys um they might see that their client is going to go straight to arraignment that they can say oh hold on one second we're actually going to have to stop for hearing
Well let's ask our our defense attorney who we have on the line Joe Simon's so does that typically happen if you see that you have a client in the system here do you try to divert a case to a clerk magistrate
Absolutely or if it's a misdemeanor though was committed outside of the police officers presents then you have a right with from a short exceptions for example domestic violence but uh yeah sometimes that happens we're
Making arrest even bring somebody to court and then you realize that the person who actually has a structure tore right not to be arraigned for cork marriage streets hearing a lot of cases of
Judges agreed to dismiss
That some of them never come back some of them do come back and get screened out and then some of them come back and and the court issues a complex
Still cause hearings are problematic Joe
I don't think so I think they serve a a good purpose so for one thing in Massachusetts [noise]
Anybody can go into a courthouse and do a clerk's office and apply for criminal complaint against anybody else there's really no bar um in almost no oversight to that except that they have these ... registries hearings
To the court magistrates are of a function where they screen out cases that really have no business being in criminal court or many times there isn't probable cause the crime was committed and somebody simply seeking redress that you should be better served in civil court
Um sometimes to police despite doing their best efforts in responding to calls you have to make split second decisions and don't always have the ability to analyze whether in order to really
Should be a go into court whether there's enough probable cause
Right but I think I Am you know I think the article and and you know the coal certainly correct me if I'm wrong but it brings up that there's an arbitrary system here what if you don't know about such a thing as show cause hearing what if what if you have not hired a private attorney who knows about such things and
You may not have the same opportunity to have your case or by clerk magistrate and you are going to go before a traditional judge where they're likely will be something uh in public or at least or possibly a criminal record
And that's very different from what happens in these hearings does this result in a different system for people depending on who's in the know or who can afford a lawyer to fight it
Unfortunately yes those definitely true and I can't tell you how many people don't call me until after they've tried to go to the court's hearings by themselves
People call me and say oh I've got invitation to court I don't know if I Need to go or not I don't think a lot of people realize what they really are even people who were summonsed to go to these hearings because the the way some of them are awarded or well you can appear and if you want to have an attorney you can bring one
Um [noise] I think people would be a
Should be better advised of the the consequences
Are the chances that they have [noise]
You know to protect the rights when you say invited to court I don't think anybody gets invited and willingly right still would have been invited to [laughter]
Conversation with the clerk at me off and then you see things on the record too I mean for them to their detriment everything's under oath so they might see something that you know for it and we could be um you know deemed some sort of a mission or cause I had mission against for their their life right
But but you're saying that these are on the record but Nicole what you found is there's no recording of these proceedings or the these are not public
Definitely not a requirement to be recorded um there within the guidelines of the district courts they say it's recommended but we call it a lot of courts and really it's kind of a toss up whether you get into a district court where it's actually recorded
Um there certainly aren't public transcripts for anyone um I mean some people compared this to a grand jury proceedings but those are really different um there are those are
Those are with the jury is of citizens who are making these decisions um and their transcripts or some time but they're usually recorded those times um and so it's a really different case and I think you
Really hit the nail on the head and you're saying that there were these big disparities I mean we were looking at places
That just had completely different standards of justice you know you go to a court like Chelsea and only Eighteen percent of those cases
Have charges issue but then you go to stir and eighty percent of those charges ... would would issue and when you look at racial disparities in some individual courts I mean you see some really troubling things we have a ... a statistic from Brookline courts
So about eighty percent of the white defendants who went to show cause hearing could leave without a charge but only forty five percent of minorities do
And so you know I can see why people may say this this is a wave screening but without any kind of open hearing you know you don't have people who are able to study um why these disparities exist and how to change them they
But but is this a system though that as Joe says is a way to sort of weed out frivolous cases and perhaps it improve the efficiency to a certain degree of the criminal justice system
I think there'll there'll be people who argue about that I don't think that
There's necessarily within our story we're saying this entire system should be abolished there is a really big difference between not having these hearings at all and having these hearings but having them open so that
There can be people coming into these hearings to give some oversight I think a lot of people would agree that oversight is good for everyone defendants uh people that people who are involved in this even for you know the magistrates like we can
... um and we can have records about things that might have gone wrong before cases and well
Let's bring in parents Kennedy who's a member of the governor's council and on this because the governor's council approved the appointment of of click magistrate so welcome to radio Boston is er Kennedy
Thank you Devon thank you for having me on
The what about him oh hugely
Outside they had searching directors before him and he's the first guy to come outside of the company he joined the company in April as a member of the new board of directors they cut back from each team members to twelve
And a ... and he's got a sterling career as a running them a model conglomerate very tightly focused company ... increased shareholder value many times over market value many times over
But you know he faces a huge task is an outside or Deb I spoke with Bill all that he's the managing director of the Martin dressed hundreds MIT entrepreneurship and
He's a professor of practice at MIT Sloan school business
How do you keep about ...
And ... which is for internal person because it's hard to put your homework but if you get an extra little person they can look at it differently and change it but they're not part of the DNA so it's really hard for them to keep the good people there because if you don't have the people ... you're just not going to be able to get this thought
You know it's all about people as far as a lead is concerned in most people actually because they've got three hundred thousand employees scattered over a hundred and thirty countries around the globe this is a big ship to turn
... so what is this all mean for the company or would you say how how would you explain it
[noise] well it means you've got to be a different company this is a company that invented the industrial age and that has to reinvent itself and cannot do that well you know you can't cut your way to success it's just can't be done
I mean if they have a massive right I'm right down that they announced today of twenty three billion dollars in its power unit
It's got a over thirty billion dollars in unfunded pension liabilities this is a company really at the edge so really struggling what'd you say
Yeah I mean it's worth a hundred billion dollars let's put that in perspective for a third of the world's energy is generated by
A GED and forty percent of the world's energy software that manages that is ... is a big company but
You know its stock was removed from the down it was the dog and the down the listed first time in a hundred and twenty five years
And so remind us that in terms of this moved to Boston two years ago uh [noise] what did you get for the city and state and how about the promises to this area
Of the hundred and fifty bucks and promises a hundred and twenty five from the state saying I'm One of the hundred and fifty bucks a hundred and fifty million did I say that's ... ... [laughter] hundred and twenty five
Million dollars and twenty five million dollars from the state you know in tax incentives and all kinds of things and twenty five million from the city is contingent upon bringing jobs to city and eight hundred jobs they promised by twenty twenty five
I'm GE he promised to chicken fifty million dollars to local institutions has been making payments and it's been funding a lot of different things organizations health care and into schools in Boston [noise] um but it's a
It's new corporate headquarters oh good question well so that was on hold they they decided they would never built two ... two buildings are warehouses they doing that there was a building of the new can of building toward a million dollars is on hold
Goes to the twenty Twenty one day I think it can be completed on WB or Boston on a supporter of risk element thanks for being you bet that

The Isabella Stewart Gardner museum is known as one of Boston finest institutions but it's also the side of the world's largest art heist
On march Eighteenth Nineteen Ninety to the stress is Boston police officers locked into the museum in the early morning hours after St Patrick's Day they walked out with their teen pieces of art somebody Rembrandt for me here and thank God
And display of five million dollar reward from the museum not one piece has been returned
Twenty eight years later it's still a mystery and now the subject of a podcast last scene is the production of WB you are in the Boston Globe and tonight on radio Boston We're bringing you the first half of episode to which you can find on apple pod cast or wherever you download the podcast
At the end of last week we brought you episode one in two parts and we heard about how the thieves got in and what exactly they still an episode to host Kelly or an ad jak wrote a leak Alex Florida this idea what is the Gardner heist was an inside job
[noise] the gates abuser della gardener museum will stay locked wall authorities search for clues in the daring weekend heights

All the mistakes you've ever made now imagine that just one of them one lapse in judgment in London millisecond in time hung over you for all of your days to come imagine being known above all else
Can never undo [noise] and now imagine that the going estimate for the cost of your mistake is upwards of five hundred million dollars recap
Who was manning to watch desk in the Gardner Museum at one twenty four in the morning on march Eighteenth Nineteen Ninety doesn't have to imagine any if that he's lived
Here for a minute closely I hadn't heard that [noise] no I've told the story though you are about ... years time I'm not just advertising it normally hear sound like when I go to get a job [noise] I'm like oh I open the door on the
Twenty five years ago and they got ... five hundred million dollars to hire me right
Abbott has always maintained his innocence and he says he's always been forthcoming about his decision to open the door the night the robbery even in his earliest exchanges with the first to Boston FBI agent on the case
And I said well what do you want to know I Will tell you and he said I immediately felt like I suppose is why didn't have anything to lose
...
Has never been arrested for anything related to the Gardner heist but he's also never escaped the suspicion of investigators who said that the men who robbed the museum had help from the inside
That they knew their way around it and knew the police weren't coming there implication is that al ... is the reason why
Those investigators have never publicly named Abbott as a suspect they won't even name him as one of the security guards on duty that night but Rick Abbott must be a suspect why else would you have to keep answering investigators' questions and testified before a grand jury
What forgot that didn't make a mistake when he let that feeds into gardening medium
What buzzing them in with all part of a larger plan to Rob it
What if ... was the inside guy on the largest art heist in history
[noise]
Whenever something is stolen from a museum the most likely culprit is an employee according to data reviewed by the FBI about eighty percent of museum robberies are inside jobs so given that stat and the fact that this security guards opened the door and let the thieves walk right into the gardener
It makes sense then investigators would look hard at Rick abba our colleague from the Boston Globe Steve Kirk ... has been looking hard it ever too he's been reporting on the highest for more than Twenty years for the globe
He's written a book about it master thieves it took Steve a while to find out that
I was about the whole day up and brought a bow Vermont are trying to find work I couldn't find them couldn't find them but it had been told you may be staying at a shack up in the hills I went there
And there are nine o'clock at night I find there is a topic project and there's a car or new driveway show I Walk up and knock on the door and a show master who was ... from the Boston Globe trying to reach ... will to guard the museum at
The door flies open and outcomes Rick
In two thousand Thirteen Steve and Rick habits sat down and an Indian restaurant over chickens in Duluth and beer
For some reason I seem to be the only person involved today
For only one who's not trying to figure it out and that mainly comes down to I'm Glad to be alive [noise]
The river feeling of shame as to what happened to this did you feel personally responsible for
I mean I feel bad about

[laughter] so who was ... on march Eighteenth Nineteen Ninety
You had a long flowing curly here you know didn't dress when he came to the museum and as a as a night watchman regard [noise] uh I think the night of the ... he was wearing short of type ... you know in a cowboy hat
Abbott's get up the night of the robbery does bear mentioned if only because Abbott himself knew how an security guard like he appeared to the cops who are really robbers
'cause I knew of look at them long hair and write the guests steps in my head my Berklee College of music tired I Would write and I had my gardener museums security shirt over that eroded button right

Live from NPR News in Washington I'm Laurie London President Trump is in Philadelphia today but before departing reporters caught up with him on the White House lawn with more questions about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh among other things they asked
How he would feel if the report shows Kavanaugh lied to Congress
I don't think there's a lot of the guy there's a lot of people over
Last year that have larger Congress to me that would that be acceptable
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has promised a floor vote this week even as a probe continues he says each lawmaker will get a copy of the FBI report on sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh
Democratic leader Chuck Schumer says he wants a briefing at least twenty four hours before an initial procedural votes White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow is defending the administration's new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada
As NPR's Scott Horsley reports that agreement drew criticism from the conservative editorial page of the wall Street Journal
... who was a former CNBC commentator calls the Journal's editorial writers dear friends but he takes issue with their criticism of a trade deal nothing is perfect Kudlow says ... an uptick to NAFTA which would affect a quarter century ago
We've improved the supply chains of terrorists we notice a tear free zones and it was in effect sly James would be their business will not be disrupted all those threats are not from the past so I had ... presidents there's
Never mind that it was the president himself who threaten cross border supply chains with promises to tear up NAFTA if you didn't get his way Kudlow stumbled over the name of the new NAFTA which Trump insisted on rebranding as the U.S and so you're going to NPR News the White House the Trump
Administration has started denying visas this week for same sex partners of un diplomats who are not married NPR's Layla financial reports the state department says the change in policy is about equal treatment
The department says the shift makes the policy consistent for same sex and opposite sex couples so same sex domestic partners can no longer get derivative diplomatic visas unless they are legally married
This will also impact other foreign officials like ambassadors and fulltime embassy employees but many worry that the shift unfairly targets couples who come from countries where same sex marriage is not legal
Former UN ambassador Samantha Power who served under President Obama tweeted that the change in policy is cruel and they get it going on to say only twelve percent of member states allow same sex marriage
In some cases these relationships are punished people stationed in the U.S now have until the end of the year to get married somewhere where it's legal ... NPR News

Friday he's confirmed Monday he takes the oath of office um and on Tuesday it you know and on Monday he starts hearing a gimmick a democratic challenge to Republican gerrymandering

Welcome back to radio Boston I'm Deborah Becker President Trump is declaring victory on the trade front
My great honor to announce that we have successfully completed negotiations on a brand new deal to terminate and replace NAFTA Andy NAFTA trade agreements with an incredible new U.S Mexico Canada agreement
Gold us MCA sort of just work and [noise]
So what's in this new deal and what will it mean for American workers and companies loved joining us to talk about this is the Boston Globe's quick steady columnist Evan Horowitz and unwelcome addicts are happy fundraising so you know thank you well know versus eleven let's not talk about ... let's talk about NAFTA so
Will you call this NAFTA to point out what do you mean
Well I mean I guess we should start with what the heck to call it I mean is it after two point oh is it the U.S and C I F for the next rests on like the village people the U.S NCA a smoker um it really seems like
We should be calling it NAFTA because it's mostly NAFTA the changes are slight non trivial but slight and the basic framework remains in place low tariffs among the three nations of North America
So so let's talk about some of the some of the changes even if they are the biggies are dairy auto what are the big ... and you're right
Yeah so well it depends what you mean by big ... of the goals that the Trump Administration was able to accomplish include some increased access to the Canadian dairy market Canada has traditionally made it very difficult for other countries to export a dairy and agriculture
And now some dairy farmers will be able to export more cheese
A little more milk more sort of dry milk powder that's easier to transport um so that's a slight gain we're talking about fractions of a percentage point in trade for a teen number of jobs but it's something you'd mentioned really cared about and the got it
And then next thing is some new incentives to make sure auto manufacturers build their cars in the U.S instead of a in low wage factories in Mexico and
So is this good for you is it good for Canada I mean again the big picture is it doesn't change all that much Canadian dairy farmers are not happy but it's not going to affect them and significant way and the Canadians got something in exchange for that which is
Yes we'll be like Meg she's given back to W. B. U. R. put put your money where your mind and and your heart and I guess quite literally your ears are if you listen to W. B. you are
Or you know you're listening right now to radio boss and maybe listen for hours a day give back make it make WB were possible not just for yourself in the future but but for your whole community one eight hundred
Nine zero nine nine to eight seven
Make a phone call right now we as we go back to radio Boston or will be discussing how young people are processing the controversy over allegations of ... Kelvin us behavior in high school just heard about what the new trade deal to replace NAFTA is going to mean for American workers and the companies that they work for that's what we like to do we like to bring issues local issues national issues home
And find out what they're going to mean to all of us
So that's what we try to do on a daily basis with radio Boston with all things considered MORNING EDITION all here and now all the programs that you listen to make the call now to support that kind of independent journalism one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to age seven or W. B. U. R. dot org thanks a lot
A
Welcome back to the radio Boston I'm Deborah Becker with deep divisions over the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh we spent some time today talking about how young people are processing this controversy and this cultural moment
A Quinnipiac University poll released yesterday said forty eight percent of American voters most believe Kavanaugh's accuser Christine Blasey Ford forty one percent most believe Brett Kavanaugh and today President Trump said this
A very scary time for young men in America would you be ... you may not be guilty
Divide effect teenagers particularly when it comes to talking with them about sexual assault and consent
Joining us in Studio is mega rebel she's founder and director of partners in sex education an organization that delivers comprehensive sex education to schools cross Massachusetts Hi thanks for coming in hello thanks so much for having me and listeners we want to hear from you have you talked with your children about these hearings
And what do you tell them what do you tell teenagers about their Brett Kavanaugh
Hearings and the Senate Judiciary committee hearings and they're related controversy that's been going on since the hearing ended what does education around sex and consent looked like in your school
You can call us at eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk you can also send us a tweet at radio lost him so ... what have you been hearing a from educators and young people amid all of this debate about the Brett Kavanaugh hearings
So our organization partners in sex education has always taught about consensus I that's an integral part of teaching about healthy relationships in communication and sort of getting the basis of how young people should learn to
Relate to each other and certainly a consent questions have been coming up in classes um our educators are not trying to get into political um debate to the students but I have been hearing a even as recently as today from an educator that
Ah that they were talking about it um and a lot of the conversation tend to be polarized by gender which is unfortunate because I feel like we should be getting the same message is
So so give me an example of of what was happening in terms of their polarization
And well I just that I think that young men are are not
Are not always understanding I think the young men are often told and for instance by the president and I quote their tolls and they're the ones that are somehow victimized by us
Um and I think even polarized it along gender lines as a mistake I think that we all need to think about how to do better in terms of how to communicate and how to respect other people's person HUD and how to
Um respect uh have have sexual morality and carrying relationship and not just make it down to the the letter of the law in terms of consent
So is there something specific that you say is there sort of a
General rule of thumb that you tell young people about about understanding what consent looks like well that that's a great question because the
Way young people often want to approach it is like I said off into the letter of the law and so there are things about the law that they need to know they need to know that the legal age of consent in Massachusetts sixteen they need to know that if ah somebody is under the influence of drugs or alcohol they cannot legally consent
Um and so these are you know there's many other aspects so these are important
But I think that ah when you're talking about sometimes you're just talking about just what is criminally prosecute rubble and what is not and that should not be the standard that we hold and that should not be what we're teaching we should be teaching people how to be
Respectful and so consent education needs to be broader than that and it needs to be not just about sex consent education is about everything and it can be taught from a very
Very young age ... and how how do you do that at a young age well for
Instance um when anyone we we talk about this with in elementary schools all the time in terms of somebody's physical space and somebody's boundaries and to somebody else want
'em to be touched or not is that okay keeping your hands to yourself um whether ah children are um
You know allowed to say yes and notes of things that happened to them and I think ... at a very very young age that should happen in the home right so a a child says no to to to being tackled and what do we do often adults because it's fun to make children laugh will continue to tickle a child
Or what have we taught them about their capacity to say no to that which happens to their bodies and so I think that if we respect that no and then we're teaching them that if that they're now will be respected and we're teaching them from the youngest age that they can also have that same kind of respect for other people now [noise]
When I talk a little bit of out of the women as well as we mentioned boys a little bit but ah and and just in case somebody hasn't heard uh some of the testimony we're in a place of of the uh emotional a piece of what Christine Blasey Ford said last week during the Senate Judiciary committee here's a bit of that
I Believe he was going to rape me I Try to yell for help when I did read put his hand over my nails stopped me from yelling [noise]
This is terrified me the most and it had the most lasting impact on my life it was hard for me to breathe and I thought that was accidentally going to kill me [noise]
So ah the mega rebel and when that
Is televised and replayed over and over again how should parents and teachers
Deal with that [noise] wow yeah that that is really emotional and [noise]
I think that the problem there at first I Want to say that the problem there in that situation is not as as we often assume a miscommunication misunderstanding about whether or not she gave consent clearly
She did not right that is a basic um of ignoring of her
Person HUD and ... and her that
Was like you know to make a point to other men was a man I'm kind of showing off in a way for another man and so that that is a whole different situation but those are also [noise]
The kinds of things that with a a social emotional learning curriculum that we can address in the classroom so what should um [noise] what should parents tell their young people
I guess I'm telling ya livid and tell young women um and I guess the idea that you should be respected that you
Have a right to say it's a yes or no with what happens to your body and in that I feel like if
Young women believe that they should be respected than they should be heard
Than they would be more able to communicate but also more able to report when something goes wrong because they're actually very very low numbers of of young women and young men
Because let's not forget the young men are also assaulted are they really um
Unfortunately high rate so they'd be less young women and young men who feel that it is their fault and who feel that they will not be believed and unfortunately these messages that are happening on the national stage are reinforcing the idea that it is their fault and it they should not be believed and we need to fight very hard to prevent
That ... uh take some of the callers now James is calling from Manchester by the sea James you're on the air

As speaking of uh twenty twenty or Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren or made comments over the weekend at a town hall in Holyoke saying she would take a hard look at running for president after the midterms in November So what do you make of that [noise]
Well for well over a year she's been swatting away questions about a White House runs saying that she's focused only on her Senate reelection campaign but as you said at the town hall meeting in Holyoke she says
She's going to have a hard look at running for president and she's done a lot to fuel that speculation I'm that she's preparing to run for president she's been raising a lot of money she campaigns frequently across the country for fellow Democrats raising her national profile and she's been pushing out big national policy proposals
For example this past August she introduced an anti corruption of legislation and has been running ads casting herself as the would be sheriff who wants to clean up
Washington so she does run for president she's positioning herself very much as I've been to the populist I'm
Sort of occupying the same way in that Bernie Sanders occupied a couple of years

Welcome back to radio Boston I'm Deborah Becker or their secret courts are operating in Massachusetts the Boston Globe says there are in the form of closed door hearings before a single court official where thousands of criminal charges can and do disappear
The paper analyzed data from what are known as show cause hearings which are held before court clerks and the paper says its analysis shows
An arbitrary part of our state's criminal justice system globe spotlight reporter Nicole Duncan joins us to talk about this Nicole welcome to radio Boston Hi thanks for having me on the line is Joe Simon's a criminal defense attorney in Boston Thanks for being here Joe
Hi thanks for having me during our conversation also we're going to hear from a member of the governor's council parents Kennedy and we'll talk with him as well but first call I Want to start with you why are you calling me secret courts
So in Massachusetts and around the country generally criminal proceedings for adults are always public suffered in the minute a person is arranged arraigned on a charge in the courtroom you or I can go into the courtroom and we can look up the case
But in Massachusetts if you're accused of a crime and having been arrested you generally have a right to this hearing that data that's completely hidden from the public
Um I Can't go into the hearing and it's a very different from every aspect of the open court that you know we see in court houses across the country but this on three arrest yeah Priya Reagan Korea rest sorry not pre arrest it's usually for people who haven't been arrested so it's pre arraignment
Okay [noise] uh so so give us an example of of what you found here in terms of the criminal charges that are heard in these show cause hearings
I understand your dies level of training for all clerk magistrates
Well that's what it is it's it's a standardized level training the old ah various um training throughout the year for
A they're either not educational environment yeah yeah and and the coolest thing it better than I Am fewer educational review educational requirements for clerk magistrate is deciding matters of law ... aside from that though I'm just wondering what
About ... ... if you're talking about lawyer versus non lawyer I'll be glad to address that um I think that I've been like Joe I've been a criminal defense lawyer for many years have been a criminal defense lawyer for thirty five years um and I have dealt with
Many many court magistrates that were attorneys and many that will not Mm and some of the best work magistrates though I've dealt with ...
What do we do to make sure that the system is more uniform I guess is the is the thrust of this question here
What respect I mean I used it in with respect to with Corning hearings
Um that's something that could be discussed and certainly wouldn't be a a a bad idea I've attended many cord magistrates hearings where they are recorded I don't I don't see that as a security issue and by the way the statute allows for any party to either bringing a recording device or a ...
A which I'm done I brought in St demographers into court match the hearings before when they were somewhat serious
... not as a as a result of this report do you think the governor's council would consider making any changes or anything
Well the governor's council doesn't have any jurisdiction over making changes with the way to him a system works within the court we approve a the court magistrates themselves when the governor nominates one we have to make sure that they're qualified in it when you look at who's going to be a court magistrate it's not just
A legal background because I think that can be made off with a great deal of experience to for example there's just a quick note to straighten Wharton court system for many years they might be qualified but
A big part of their job goes beyond that they have to be good managers managing the quirks offers some of whom have a you know fifty sixty Seventy employees from a smaller but uh it [noise] you have to be one manager as well and I think that's an important part of the jaw
Nicole wondering what's what's the reaction been to the story
I think we've heard from a lot of people who were surprised that this even existed um I mean I actually [noise] hold all fifty states see if there was anything even remotely similar
Um and many of the prosecutors and the court officials that I talked to said no I never heard of anything like that it's really surprising um on our and we've heard from other people who've gone through some of these hearings and we're glad that we were shedding light on it and
[noise] and so in terms of any action that might be taken or any changes still too early to tell
Yeah I mean that is something that I think legislators can look into
I mean this is in fact something that the trial court itself could actually um mix them action or make some changes on 'em because this isn't actually codified directly into law the idea of these um these hearings being secret
Um came from an ass Jaycee a Supreme um Supreme Court decision a so it's not actually something that is codified into law
We did we should say we did get a statement from a trial court chief justice ... saying that the role of these hearings on clerk magistrates is consistent
With criminal justice reform efforts recently in Massachusetts load doesn't look like there would be a changes anytime soon I'm Sorry that we are out of time because I Know we could continue this conversation but I Want to say
Thank you to Nicole dumped on the Boston Globe spotlight reporter Joe Simon's a criminal defense attorney
