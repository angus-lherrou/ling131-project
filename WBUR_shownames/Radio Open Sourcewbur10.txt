Org [noise] I'm Christopher like this is open sores Chris Hedges is our guest this hour
The war reporter and doomsday are with the song sermon of warning about the trouble we're all in his new book is titled American
We're in the first Paris church and Harvard Square
Christian I are in the same seats in the same stage that I shared a few months ago with the upbeat psychologist Steven Pinker around his book enlightenment
Secret thinkers better angels of our nature Chris Hedges is drawn to bad news [noise] the way Steve Pinker has drawn to the good
Chris Hedges got hooked on more assignments with the New York times hardened on battlefields in Latin America Africa the Balkans and and the middle east if you've got some of his soul back studying theology and classical literature for his best seller war is a force that gives us meaning the Russia battle he has written
Going back to ancient times at Homer
And the Bible is an often lethal
Drug himself ingested for years it was just one or the addictions that fits agencies in our country and our culture today
His new book begins with a path is from Dietrich ... over
The Lutheran breeze then theologian
Executed by the Nazis in Nineteen forty five for his part of the anti Hitler
Resistance none nothingness you wish the rest is sliding the Jews who burned hovers last management
Is not a natural and not the death or sinking of a community it is nothing that is that is rebellious violent anti God
Most manifestation of all the forces opposed
To God I ask Chris Hedges at the outset to locate his idea of that nothing is in our world today
That's a culture which we've created a commercial culture which orchestrate alienation
Loneliness unhappiness a sense of inadequacy
And promises us that if we invest in that culture both financially him personally which is a culture that at its core is about the cult of the self we can find the happiness that they have destroyed ...
But of course as proof understood every time
We buy their experience whether just commercially or emotionally or their product is only the starting point for new desires ...
And what in biblical terms it is is a culture of our dollar tree and the writers of the Bible understood and idols demand in the beginning the sacrifice of others but in the end like more luck [noise]
They always demand your sacrifice you you are sacrificed on that alter and I think that spiritual malaise that cult of the self has created tremendous depression

I'm Christopher lightened this was open source Chris Hedges our guest is a preacher's kid who grew up in Maine which Colgate made a name for himself covering wars all over the world to the New York times
Then he took up the allergy in big books as a sort of sidelined and reached a personal professional breaking point resisting the Iraq War from inside his famous newspaper
At the cost of his job he's our guest of the Cambridge forum and the first parents church and Harvard Square his new book is America the farewell tour
You're leaving one huge zone my favorite zone out which is George Bush and the Iraq War
To my mind the light in line is it that is pretty much the bone in our it's worse than the bona throat
It set the stage for where we're at an illegal immoral irrational five trillion dollar or maybe a lot more war that goes on today which the United states chose war shows torture ignited terrorism
In ... and ... literally kill the country in front of our eyes corrupted the Democratic opposition including our print John Kerry
And destroyed the media I mean the war began and went to his hand with the cheerleading of those institutions including your friend Tom Friedman we didn't have fired ... David every rocks and they're still working I mean the point is only that to see Trump
He is symptomatic of all that the trail of the working class
At the same time he's the most I must say viable person who ever tip the tables on Jeb Bush and then on the Clintons I don't want to give them any credit for it exactly but here's a question for my friend Chris Hedges [noise]
Do you find your heart really rooting for the record as the Trump or his so to speak or you certainly to root for the establishment where where's your heart procedures
Heart is with at this point the sixty or Seventy percent
Who are being pushed towards a modern form of serfdom in the ... system and you bring up the war so and it was you know I had a very contentious relationship with the New York times I'd been in the middle east bureau chief for the New York times was denouncing the war
Was booed off of a commencement stage and of course I actually knew the middle east and knew the instrument of war unlike banker and
And I was given a former written reprimand and told I was no longer be allowed to speak publicly about criticizing the war and I left the paper over that issue so when you talk about all those people who were wrong
Being still in power but that's misleading because
They may have been wrong but they played their role
And the role of this was ... the role of the liberal elites
Is to discredit
And you can read the review of this book in the New York times the Washington Post because that's exactly what they do to discredit
The critics on the left because they set the moral parameters and they are essentially given their place in a capitalist democracy
Because they make sure nobody crosses those parameters nobody actually questions the system of capitalism nobody questions the intentions of going into Iraq they make concede afterwards
That it didn't go quite as it should so they played their role perfectly which is why they're still they're not they're all
Know we can't talk about leaders I mean this has come a complete misreading of what's happened in this country it's far more serious than that and I think one of the things that inform this book was the two years I spent reading a book on the Christian right
Mm because the Christian right is really the advocacy but before that let me just respond one more thing in the war so in in and you know from the book in in this is from a court but late empire
Andme according to historian McCoy who wrote a very good book called shadows in the American century which I recommend he writes that empires that they're beginning actually use military force very carefully and very judiciously empires at the end in decline
Engage in catastrophic military adventure ism that
Fuels the decline in an attempt to restore last greatness so you look at for instance the end of the scene an empire they invade Sicily the entire Athenians ... most of the soldiers to kill the umpires over you look at
The Suez Crisis the British Empire in decline from the end of World War one until Nineteen fifty six Nasser nationalize the Suez Canal the British invade with a French
And have to retreat and humiliation the pound sterling is dropped ... as
The world's reserve currency and the British economy goes into a tailspin that's the death of a coin actually gives it a date which I Would never do twenty thirty but the so we have Seventeen years of warfare there's a front page story about the debt did you read the ... I read the times tonight I just read that
What may soon exceed the cost of the U.S military interest on us debt
Within a decade more than nine hundred billion and interest payments will be do annually this is what happens at the end of empire you extend yourself militarily
Beyond your ability to sustain it financially and
Cost in order to carry out this military adventure ... this is ... ... is to just hollow out the country from the inside so ths acidity is writes that the charity that Athens imposed on others and it finally imposed on itself why because the military adventure ism
Is so costly your roads are not maintained your public libraries are school you're you know the crown jewel of American democracy or is our public school system and we are watching it be destroyed ... and so as
You follow the country out from the inside you use the harsher forms of control which I spent Twenty years reporting on on the outer reaches of empire militarized police suspension of civil liberties wholesale surveillance
Revoking basic rights like due process militarized drones it's all coming to a town near you
And and that's how empires go down so yes the military adventure ism is important but it's just a piece
And we've got to stop personalizing this issue around Trump we've got to stop thinking that the Democratic party is going to cough up some magic candidate
Study of the Christian right was called American Fascists the Christian right in the war in America
I was trying to reach out to them and I'm
Bill Moyers did not want me to use the word fascist and I actually when I finished the two years of reporting I sat down with Robert ... wrote anatomy and fascism and Fritz Stern who wrote the politics of cultural despairing left Germany as an Eighteen year old two of our greatest scholars on fascism and I was with them for several hours and I just threw everything I had found
And I wanted them to
Be able to argue me out of using that word and I at least to my mind they could not
Tell me what's wrong with this sort of idiot definition of fascism fascism the ... and the binding of she's it stands for the unification of
War making power police power opinion making power the the electoral machinery churches media the whole thing in one to my mind God Knows what's ahead but in the this is why I go back to the Iraq War
That was all of those institutions bound together unanimously that was pretty bad and still
Yeah but Chris ... it was different so as bad as it was
And we can't divorce the war
From the re configuration of the society into a corporate oligarchy we have the largest social inequality in American history worse than the gilded age ... and so the war is part of a peace I mean why are we still at war in Afghanistan the Taliban controls more territory
In Afghanistan then when we went in Seventeen years ago why because Northrop Grumman Raytheon Halliburton they're making a fortune
It's propelled forward by the primacy of profit
At the expense of everything else why are we expanding NATO which doesn't make any sense why are we expanding NATO to the Ukraine well because and and let's not forget that Reagan had promised Gorbachev that NATO would not be expanded beyond the German borders after the unification of Germany why
Because it's a billion dollar industry I was just in Poland I got up the airport there's a giant billboard from ... ... because if you have to re configure the old Soviet Bloc military machine to make a compatible with NATO

I'm Christopher like this is open source where in an old fashioned citizen forum in what happens to be a church hall in Harvard Square Chris Hedges is our guest this hour and his audience is about to get into the act
So my question is regarding the global kind of presence of the American empire so his empire retreats what does it mean for the rest of the right words plus I think what can the specially developing nations can do about it
Right what happens is the moment the dollar is no longer the reserve currency because it has an artificial value in essence because of that the moment that it has dropped
Than the empire has to contract because we can't pay for nobody wants to buy treasury bonds the value of the dollar drops imports become extremely expensive
And what I worry and you know I Would add the fact that our financial system is once again being grossly mismanaged by Citibank and Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo and everyone else what they've done since the two thousand a crash
Is Ben handed by the fed out of electronic ether according to the University of Missouri their estimate twenty six trillion dollars trillion and what have they done with it they haven't as trying to did rebuild the infrastructure and create jobs invest in the real economy
They have taken that money and
Use it to buy back their own stock that's why the whole idea of the overheated stock market as a sign of economic health is nuts
They hoard it or they've gambled with it so the times had a story I guess a couple of weeks ago about the next
Dot com bubble being the fracking industry because like the dot com industry the fracking industry is based on projected profits not actual fracking in fact is a huge money loser the two hundred and eighty billion have been invested in fracking
So the money was given to them at virtually zero percent interest but it has to be repaid so what have they done they've gone to the beleaguered population and impose harsher harsher forms of debt peonage it's why even if you have medical insurance
You're getting all these new costs and co pays and that's why we have one point five trillion in student debt is why we have Thirteen trillion in personal household that
Um and it's why cities and I open the book in Scranton are facing insolvency and so I open the book there where they're selling off municipal assets their pension funds have dropped forty percent because of the crash of two thousand and eight
And so they're selling off their sewer system their parking authority of their utilities in a desperate effort to stay solvent but then they don't have anything left to sell so my fear is that the system the Malay the enemy is so widespread the ...
Shouldn't including suicide aren't epidemic but we live in a period of relative stability
But with a financial crash
Which is coming it's going to come I don't know when but it's coming and with the dropping of the dollar as the world's reserve currency
That financial crisis and all of totalitarian movements rise to full fluid ... out of a crisis because our movements have been destroyed our press has been quoted or democratic institutions don't work then I worry that the monsters are really come out
Unless you went
Little deeper into authority relies when you were making
And I'm from Detroit and you know you're on the ticket from where I'm from an area where nine out of ... young black man and up and prevents and I was the one thing to write them so we went to college and University of Michigan or start a company and so as I've been to dress or in some of my endeavors of notice I'm often the only young black guy in the room and especially from a neighborhood like minds
I feel like in some ways Austin andme of social justice faces reframe the system as if it's more powerful than the people on one of those people have always some kid you know you can come you know through your circumstances so I'm trying to put the power into the people in their potential and not necessarily in the system
But I Would just say for sort of marginalized communities not necessarily for the so the problem in
Marginalized communities is
A structural problem and as they carried out the kind of corporate coup d'etat which really began in earnest under factor and Reagan they changed the whole paradigm started hall writes about this you didn't look to government anymore government into that famous Reagan line you know government is not the solution is part of the problem
And it started hall writes quite stupidly they told the beleaguered white working class that there was an assault on their national identity
And the Clintons rose to power on those people forget
But Jesse Jackson's rainbow coalition was dismantled by the Clintons who are using coded racist language and wanted to out law and order the Republicans Biden was a big factor in this
So it was actually the Democrats that accelerated mass incarceration from about seven hundred thousand under Clinton to all the time he was out two million
Now half of the people in our prison system were never charged with physically harming another person the other thing Clinton did they destroyed the courts Ninety four percent of the people in prison never had a jury trial and the students I teach with the longest sentences
Are the ones who went to trial unfortunately they trusted the system but the system makes an example of them because as Michelle Alexander points out if everyone went to trial the system would crash it's built on the deals so one of the things that always breaks my heart in the prison
Is and and it's one of the reasons I teach in the prison is that the structural racism which is so
Pronounced as to make it as you know from Detroit almost impossible to make a living in the legal economy has effectively sold a lot of these people this idea that it's your fault you made mistakes
You know August Wilson at a great line he said all the great black warriors in this country are in jail because when the society denied them the ability to get what they needed for their family they just found another way to get it and I think that
There was a conscious effort on the part of the corporate state to deny they always talk about stem you know it's all vocational to deny what I Would call an education to the oppressed
To hide the fact that these structures of power are designed to destroy their lives you know from Detroit
You lock up the men and you of the women and children and that's what happens on why because if if you have are a victim it on the average is every six months in a poor community you finally the third or fourth time you're a victim you don't talk to your neighbors 'cause you know you're going to be a victim
It's why they make it so unpleasant when you visit a prison
And the children are terrorized I mean there is no other word for it and people stand out in the rain for hours without bathroom facilities 'cause they don't want their terrified of any unity the most stew political class in America are African Americans they are the one class that tends
To actually understand what their interests are which is why they're all being raised from the voter rolls including by the Democratic party so my feeling is and this comes out of Rosa ... my like very much
Lemons only intellectual equal and which Lenin would admit she was right we're Lenin was wrong Luxembourg would say yes you have to do what you do we have to
Dress despair but at the same time we have to educate and so I Would say yes what you're doing is fantastic unimportant but at the same time
Consciousness consciousness consciousness and you know there was nobody better to start with the mouth them [noise]
Hi [noise] when I was in grammar school we went through drills for what we would do if there was a nuclear Holocaust and
Some of us in the room probably remember we used to joke about it and say you sit down
And you put your head between your knees and you kept your asked by and there is a certain aspect of all of this that made me remember that what would you suggest is already happening
Now that we could start that you personally find promising in addition to overthrowing corporate well I write
About it at the end the last chapter is called freedom and I was at Standing Rock I
Actually gave a talk in Boston a couple of years ago and all of the activists because there was a pipeline running through Boston and they said you know we've gone to our elected officials we've done petitions I said no what you have to do is go out and buy junk cars
And when the construction equipment comes in to build a pipeline you've got to drive all the junk cars to block everything and take the batteries out and walk away
That's the kind of stuff we got to do it's the activists who got on the railroad tracks in the northwest to stop the bit of an tar sands fuel that's what we got to do and they will be vicious
