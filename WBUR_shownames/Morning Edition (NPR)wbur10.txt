Right fifty is the number of votes he would need for Senate confirmation fifty plus the vote and fight for vice president Pence now Republican leader Mitch McConnell is expressing no doubt

Inspectors for the department of homeland security examined an immigration facility in Southern California and they say they found serious violations of detention standards free to ... Romero of ... D begins this report with a sign of just how troubling the conditions were
There have been at least seven suicide attempts and less than a year at the privately run at Atlanta immigrant processing facility and deaths as thirty two year old man killed himself by hanging in twenty Seventeen and three detained people died in part because of medical neglect since twenty Fifteen
That's all according to the inspectors report doing an unannounced bet that inspectors found health and safety violations including a disabled man who was confined to his wheelchair for nine days and nights
Newsday it's made out of bed sheets and detainee cells that could eight suicide and people waiting weeks or months to see a doctor
The medical attention as very low standard
My ah thirty one he spent six months at Adelanto and was just released this summer we're not using his last name because he fears it could hurt his asylum case
It just came to the point where we just were not even putting in medical requests because we said what for
In California attorney general says they'll consider the federal inspectors findings as they pursue their own first as our investigation if immigration facilities California and gained authority to inspect federal detention centers in the state holding nearly five thousand detainees
From a twenty Seventeen law authored by state senator Ricardo Lara
The federal government owned report is validating are concerned
The Trump Administration has sued to overturn that line court Lara says the new report gives legal ammunition to California
Makes it much more important for California have a bigger role in investigating what is really happening in the center
But the California attorney general's review is not expected on march of next year
The slightest with the inland coalition for immigrant justice
Is concerned about detainees in that lentil now the lives of these people were pretty much a list slightest helps detainees filed grievances with immigration and Customs Enforcement degree to which is pretty much one over that's what a report from homeland security itself found earlier this year

For NPR News I'm fatty that jak by that medal in San Francisco [noise]
Are based on a a pre determined assumption I at the end of the
Day I mean that that the central question really seems to be is there a way to protect the accused while still encouraging women to be able to speak up about what could be painful and humiliating experiences I mean how do you
Protect the accused without sending a message to survivors but it's basically you've got to prove it
That's the question isn't it [laughter]
I don't have the final answer in some ways we can look at this Kavanaugh wrenching Kavanaugh experience as what we don't want to do and in a little partial way
Maybe what we do want to do because once I'm Dr Christine Blasey Ford reluctantly came forward
I think the country was helped by having a public process a process where in which she could tell her story now it is an adversarial process and there was attempt to
Knock her story that's what happens but I felt at the end of the day
Um they didn't chip away at her and her credibility remained intact and uh I I thought it was really helpful to hear the account of of someone who said she has been through this
I'm equally a lot of people were a
Distressed by the uh extreme anger and aggressiveness a and partisan attacks uh Brett Kavanaugh now he was entitled to be very angry I have spoken to many young men who've been through this process on campus
Their lives have all been profoundly changed even people who were cleared
A say they'll never be the same so it's one thing to express your anguish about what happened it's another to go on an absolute endless attack and lawyers I've spoken to said if their clients had acted like this on campus they would have been ... found responsible for what they were used up

... another win for the New England patriots they lead from early on last night and beat the Indianapolis Colts in ... thirty eight to twenty four the patronize three and two on the season
With us this morning without much sleep is ESPN dot coms Mike ... talked about the game good morning Mike and thanks for coming in
Good morning thanks for having me so I have to say I watched a good chunk of the first half of the game last night Thursday games are pretty challenging since both the colds are and the patriots play just a few days earlier last Sunday but the patriots seem very well prepared
Yeah as a patriots fan you saw the part of the game that you wanted to see ah they were excellent and the first half opening up at twenty four to three lead at half time and then they slipped a little bit in the third quarter but if they can play like they did in the first half they're going to be just fine the rest of the season
Let me ask about Julian Edelman first came back for the season the patriots top wide receiver you served a four game suspension for use of a performance enhancing substance of fans in teammates said pretty much eagerly awaited his return and he was happy to see all of them here's what he said last night
And play football and ... I think it was like four or five days or something like that so it was good to be out there in front of the crowd there rock and they're often seen all of them was was amazing so it was just great to be back
So from your point of view was he good he was very good and he created a lot of energy for both the patriots and the fans
Ah one of the great visuals have last night was when the patriots were announced to come onto the field before the game Julian Edelman let them out of the tunnel and he just sprinted Bob from one end zone
To the other and sort of leaped up in the air and pumped his fifth and the crowd really roared and then he ... the first half of the game they really wanted to get them involved fairly
Alright how about TV twelve a quarterback Tom Brady he threw his five hundred career touchdown pass last night he looked pretty good too
Did a historic night just to third player in NFL history to throw for five hundred touchdown passes
Um and and so that was impressive and also set another record by doing it to ... throwing a touchdown to Seventy one different players no one has ever thrown it to that many players at least one touchdown pass Seventy one different players touchdown passes to them wow that's pretty
You're gonna wish me and he also talks about how that means he's played a long time [laughter] let me
Uh ask this question or as we pointed out the ... look really good in the first half they only gave up three points to the field goal by a Adam ... on the cold side but in the second half it was a little bit of a different story what happened then should concern us
Well what happened was that the patriots didn't have the ball security Tom Brady through a couple of nights passes one too wide receiver Chris Hogan and ... and Chris Hogan couldn't catch it sort of popped up in the air and the colds intercepted it and then later in the third quarter a similar situation a path to Rob Gronkowski
Or that the big tighten normally would would bring in but instead it's sort of bad it up in the air and the Colts intercepted that one as well
And it was a good reminder to the patriots that when they don't secure the ball they get a little bit sloppy or the other team gets turned over those can be a great equalizer and keep the other team in the game on it is a concern because the patriots can't play like that against better teams if they expect to win All right next a next time they
Play which would be about a week and a half they play the chiefs are in their next game ... out of the chief slogan and what's the long lay off a lot of the patriots to do
Well Bill Belichick gave the players three straight days off players were very happy about that so they get to rest up he'll up some of their injured players and the Kansas City chiefs Bob and one of the best teams in the NFL they're one of two undefeated teams heading into this weekend
Great offensive team they the scored more points than anyone in the NFL so that really has a chance to be a marquee matchup a week from Sunday so it's their biggest challenge yet this season no question about it my

... it'll be Chris fall night tonight for the start of playoff baseball at Fenway Park with a Red Sox but using the Yankees in game one of the American league division series it'll be a brand new test for the first year ... manager Alex Cora led the Sox were franchise
This season WVU ours boards and society reporter she re Springer got an inside look in the core is mine said it was the playoffs began
When you walk into Alix coroner's office at Fenway Park the first thing you notice is a wall full of photos core points out different images reliving a season full of highlights
The the cool thing is that you know if you go through it you you do remember the game
Like when David Price pitch the red Sox to their one hundreds when and when ... launched a grand slam over the green monster where when Andrew Stanton tendency to walk off the single again
There's one photo for every Red Sox win this season
We got this fool wall all the way down to Ninety nine so we're a space and now we got hundreds all the way up there one on one or two of them though we got what one oh five
And later came one of six one of seven and went to eight it's an impressive display the court doesn't dwell too long and the many highlights of the red Sox season throughout the summer of course says he made one message clear
... there's a bigger picture than just one day during the season
Translation you don't live and die with each regular season game and you build toward the play offs how did he get that message across he
Gave players days off to rest that happened as early as game six when he didn't start ... coral also communicates regularly with his players he's as comfortable as they are texting and talking while playing cards at forty two court isn't much older than some of his players
And he'd rather be in the club asked with his players than alone in his office
I'd rather spend time with them talk to them or there's some good conversations when you're in a
In a relaxed environment they don't know it but they know that sometimes you know it's better to talk baseball why we're playing cards you know or or talking about their families and where they are a lot of individuals when you're over there and their environment
But it takes more than great communication skills to get the best record in baseball there is also corps ability to balance is baseball and stinks and analytics when asked if it's been hard to strike that balance with the red Sox players course says no
Your baseball i._q. drinks over a and one thing I learned right away or during the off season just talking to them they're bright yellow they
Were in the same page as far as like [noise] I'm taking advantage of certain things or the game will give you and uh they pay attention to details and that's what I tried to do to
You can see the impact in defensive alliance and pitching strategy in lineup construction
... also says that the organization is on the same page to and that contributes to the kind of chemistry necessary to be as consistent as the red Sox have been they didn't have a losing streak longer than three games during the regular season and that happened only four times
The players they like to be GM's delight to be managers they liked the owners of the team that they they know what's going on and if they feel that there's no we're not in the same page um they'll talk about it and is not
Good for for the environment so [noise] uh one thing I Want to make sure like they were in this together and when we talk about analytics or or base running or ... or medical staff you know that I Want to make sure they know that those stations do we make their made it as a group
Looking ahead to the playoffs court and the red Sox could easily find themselves facing the east an address last year at the ... won the world series with Cora as their bench coach so what does he think of possibly facing is former team in the postseason well since the Astros are the defending champions course sees them as the ones to beat
We're having a great season I Know everybody's talking about us but they're the ones you know so oh pressure on them [laughter]
Still some baseball pundits wonder how the red Sox will handle the weight of expectations especially since they haven't had any lengthy losing streak any late season worries about making the playoffs or any catastrophic injuries but don't tell the red Sox manager that his team hasn't been tested this season
Have been tested daily or that's the way we see a um a hundred and sixty two games are just very challenging regardless if you have success or not but I Know we haven't lost when the games in roe whatever blah blah blah but I think [noise] to stay focused and show up every day that's been a challenge for us
After seeing what's happening on the field this season and talking with court and his office it's easy to understand why he sometimes called the next great baseball manager his response
No [laughter] I don't
I don't consider myself a genius or a magician or whatever just baseball guys that surround them but [noise] my great people and then we have a lot of talented that talent will be


Let me just contradiction and let me just untangle that and the minute that we have left here or there have been some allegations some suggestions that there may have been contact between Brett Kavanaugh and people close to him and Deborah Ramirez and people close to her before that story was revealed a
It's our understanding that Republicans have looked at that evidence and not found anything there there is some text messages that are subject to interpretation or you alleging there's solid evidence that Kavanaugh himself was involved in some kind of cover up
There's certainly evidence of that out each but here too important point first of all this report should be made it so you and I

And he's running from the far right impress Philip Reeves has been monitoring this moment in Brazil and he joins us on the line from Rio de Janeiro this morning I fill time so what can you tell us about this man
Well he positioned himself as an outsider but he's actually a veteran congressman he spent twenty five years old and twenty five is actually in Congress

Forward while so despite those warnings about where he might take the country though it sounds like you I mean he's been surging in the polls and has a pretty good shot of of becoming president right
Yes I mean until now people have been saying that you know he would he was ahead in the this this race but it would go to a second round runoff between the top two candidates and then he would probably you lose that they use the polls evidence to to get back to that argument
The latest poll showed this big should in fact yesterday was a poll showing him Fifteen points ahead

Another win for the New England patriots they lead from early on last night and beat the Indianapolis Colts in barge boroughs thirty eight to twenty four the patronize three into on the season
With us this morning without much sleep is ESPN dot coms Mike ... talked about the game good morning Mike and thanks for coming in good morning thanks for having me so I have to say I watched a good chunk of the first half of the game last night
Thursday games are pretty challenging since both of colds a and the patriots play just a few days earlier last Sunday but the patriots seemed very well
Prepared yeah at the patriots fan you sell the part of the game that you wanted to see ah they were excellent and the first half opening up at twenty four to three lead at half time and then they slipped a little bit in the third quarter but if they can play like they did in the first half they're going to be just fine the rest of the season
Let me ask you about Julian Edelman first came back with the season the patriots top wide receiver you served a four game suspension for use of a performance enhancing substance of fans in teammates had pretty much eagerly awaited his return and he was happy to see all of them here's what he said last night
And play football and ... I think it was like four or five days or something like that so it was good to be out there in front of the crowd there in Iraq and they're awesome you know seeing all then was was amazing so great to be back
So from your point of view was he good he was very ...
Gee for both the patriots and the fans
Ah one of the great visuals of last night was when the patriots were announced that come onto the field before the game Julian Edelman lead them out of the tunnel and he just sprinted Bob from one end zone
To the other and sort of leaped up in the air and pumped his fifth and the crowd really roared and then he ... the first half of the game they really wanted to get them involved nearly
All right how about TV twelve a quarterback Tom Brady he threw his five hundred career touchdown pass last night he looked pretty good too
He did a historic night just to third player in NFL history to throw for five hundred touchdown passes um and and so that was impressive and also set another record by doing it to ... throwing a touchdown to Seventy one different players no one has ever thrown it to that many players at least one touchdown
Pass Seventy one different players touchdown passes to them well that's pretty ah that that's pretty significant complement he also talks about how that means he's played a long time [laughter]
Let me uh asked this question or as we pointed out the ... really good in the first half they only gave up three points to the field goal by a ... on the cold side but in the second half it was a little bit of a different story what happened then should concern us
Well what happened was that the patriots didn't have the ball security Tom Brady through a couple of nights passes one too wide receiver Chris Hogan and ... and Chris Hogan couldn't catch it it sort of popped up in the air and the colds intercepted it and then later in the third quarter a similar situation a pass to Rob Gronkowski
Or that the big tighten normally would would bring in but instead it's sort of bad it up in the air and the Colts intercepted that one as well
And it was a good reminder to the patriots that when they don't secure the ball they get a little bit sloppy or the other team gets turnovers those can be a great equalizer and keep the other team in the game and it is a concern because the patriots can't play like that against better teams if they expect to win
All right next a next time they play which would be about a week and a half they play the chiefs are in their next game I ... out of the chief slogan and what's the long lay off a lot of the patriots to do well Bill Belichick
Gave the players three straight days off players were very happy about that so they get to rest up he'll up some of their injured players and the Kansas City chiefs Bob or one of the best teams in the NFL they're one of two undefeated teams heading into this weekend
Great offensive team they've they've scored more points than anyone in the NFL so that really has a chance to be a marquee matchup a week from Sunday so it's their biggest challenge yet in season no question about it

That's a great question I mean I ... from my where I'm sitting I've always thought that she was trying to get to yes on Kavanaugh you know there's a lot of pressure from the left but there's also a lot of pressure from the right and she feels that so I've kind of felt like she's always been trying to get to yes now that was before

If she does vote yes on Kavanaugh is she going to face backlash and the other direction
Absolutely I mean I think that especially with the sexual assault allegations which is sort of ... a lot of really horrible experiences for a lot of women and they're angry they were already at great just by virtue of the twenty sixteen election and you know now I think that's just intensified and she's going to have to face that

Until recently was pretty much will figure he's ... and the over a longer though he's age sixty three he's close to the military and he's a divisive figure uh
He uh has a record of making offensive remarks about the algae Beatty community about black Brazilians and about women who took to the streets David in huge numbers last weekend some of that by women's group a campaigning on line
Or and or using the hash tag not him and I'm One of the messages that came from those demonstrations of the people are worried that both NATO will take Brazil back to the era when it was a military dictatorship that dictatorship ended in Nineteen Ninety five and both NATO has frequently expressed
Admiration forward while so despite those warnings about where he might take the country though it sounds like you I mean he's been surging in the polls and has a pretty good shot of of becoming
President right yes I mean until now people have been saying that you know he would he was ahead in the this this race but it would go to a second round runoff between the top two candidates and that he would probably you lose that they use the polls evidence to just get back to that argument
But the latest polls show this big should should fat yesterday was a poll showing him Fifteen points ahead
It's still unlikely that the one to be a second round that they win outright but people some commentators are beginning to say that could happen which it did happen it would be a political earthquake is a political

Is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene and I'm Rachel Martin three years ago ... swept across Brazil
Babies were born with microcephaly or I'd normally small heads among other and parents that come with that around the same time BBC producer William Kramer had a child of his own who was also born with microcephaly although not because of the guy
Cramer wanted to know how Brazil's so called ... babies were developing so we went there and produced a radio documentary called the love stories among the people he met there where her ... she's the head of a support group for parents called the United matters of angels
You lost your mind about this on our thinking now not supposed to get him out of whom I gave us two options either be a victim in don't do anything or become a protectionist and the lives of these kids
I talked with a million Kramer about his reporting earlier this week can you introduce us to the women you met so you go to Brazil to try to follow up on the children who were born out of busy a crisis and you meet this network of mothers
Yeah that's right I mean it was it was quite remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds uneducated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened
But they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I when I was that um they were very very big you know they were very tight group loss of solidarity
Very to time and women some of them I'm wearing ... you know political campaigning
Um they certainly didn't take any known since from us that it was a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about doctors as well which is kind of common to special needs parents
So they were quite a strong set of women I mean obviously very different ... the leader of this group which is called the ... mothers of angels [noise]
Uh this is a group in ... states which is a sort of
It's a ... one of the states which was worst affected by the ... the leader of that group is ... Suarez
And she is you know really quite a powerful personality or she doesn't mince words you know she's one of these people that just give you a look and you sort of just stopped talking
A but also very charming and you know she's made a lot of friends with politicians sympathetic him pays ... people have started to try and campaign for the women
What is the health status of these children who were born with the guy I mean you write that in the beginning these mothers were getting a horrible prognosis that their children may not even survive beyond a year so I'm well how are they doing
Well that's right and so around ten percent of them have died most of those so that's about three hundred and twenty children most of us children probably died very soon off the bus
Or a few of them are cut things up chest infections through breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand um there are children who are actually doing pretty well I mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the most as
They they were very mixed group of children so there was some children's you can walk she can stand there was some children who got what we can talk
I'm Still may be a little bit behind kind of bacteria that you know at the at that age but then there are other children who you know they can't roll over and that the fed through achieve into that told me that that much much more um you know disabled
Some of the children who are more physically disabled or actually cognitively left side and some of the children who are more cognitively disabled cannot stand up and and walk around [noise] it's an incredibly mixed thing
I'm not so much so that you actually tell the story of twins of girl who was born with a virus and her brother did not was matter of fact it
Yeah it was you had this for a job that will go minutes of its or is she was cooled or she really couldn't move very much a tool she seemed very aware of what was going on around her but then she had her twin brother who was turned off him who he was acting just like you would expect it to an offer a boy to act
Jumping up and down and climbing on his mom and I know I Know this kind of thing um so they didn't really understand they didn't know why it affected one twin and not another ... ... it's it's quite possible that it was because of genetic differences between them so that they now know that
Some people seem to have a sort of genetic defense against the ...
You write that the affected families are at a turning point why it's such an important moment in in their story
Ice or is that the families had a really thinking about the social aspect so while they're largely going to be like like [noise] what school are they going to go to ... and how would they be able to access to school um will moms be able to go back in and work again
We're able to join and the the actual ... she went around some of the most deprived parts of northern Brazil and she was kind of giving talks to these women and giving the pep talks and just sort of saying you know you need to write to the magnates right to the health effects to tell him to give you a bus to take a charter school you know just kind of thing
And those are the kinds of social campaigning took the issues that they really start to do it now
[noise] I Wonder because you have this personal connection because her own daughter has microcephaly how did you come back from the ... I did it did it change your alter the way you think about her condition in any way
The children were very some some of the children ... the political you mentioned Melissa the twin she especially it was very similar to my gosh you reminded me so much my ... year ago and holding how it was just like holding my little
Girl and her mom was at that point when I was kind of Eighteen months ago when I was kind of despairing and then not Eighteen
Months Katie my daughter has done so much and I really wanted to say to ... she's got it they worry she'll come you know but you can't you know you just don't know where every child different
Ah I just felt like they were very like kind of just as almost you know [noise]

You see well open to American students professors June it is a scholars of cause uh for some of the cases that Tibet because it it's very high or object to it and the uh the comments could be very tough that
Very high altitude yeah I think American journalist and scholars could handle the altitude I mean we have ... states
Well not ... but it could quickly get used to sketch comment unnatural conditions even for Chinese men do with them would not feel very well once they are the what
About weaker areas and far northwest China
Well at this is part of China
So the whole country is open to the rest of them would suddenly this part is also open but honestly it in this part of China with a particular problem that is terrorism the violent extremist groups
I'm sure some people are there some attempt
To create a situation like the ice is in that part of the John
What have you thought about is the United nations has said that hundreds of thousands of people and weaker areas have been put into camps
You see very often widespread ... may not be the true story I think whatever we're doing in that part of China is for the wellbeing and save the security of the people that
Are you putting people in camps to do that
It's not you see first of all we have to take the measure to make sure that

It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin in Washington DC
And I'm David Greene in Culver City California let's continue our series on how China is trying to influence the world this is being felt across the globe today in many ways
But what China's leaders really want is to shape how the world perceives their country they're devoted massive resources to this and the center of these efforts to shape perceptions is China Supreme leader himself Xi Jinping NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports from Beijing on cheese message and his media [noise]
The China Daily as the country's biggest English language newspaper by circulation
I met with some of their young journalists recently at a cafe outside their headquarters they has to be identified only by their English first names as they weren't authorized to speak to foreign media one of them Gary said that no matter what's going on president Xi Jinping is always at the top of the news in fact
He says that's a rule that the government's mobile news app which China Daily runs ... using residency and paying always comes first he says and Premier League ... we always come second that's not to say that they make news every day
But even if they don't their new stays in the top two positions another journalist named Miranda says the news about she is edited with extreme caution
Should she hit
On their plate for the if we can possibly avoid using a name we give give an error in an article related to she would have very serious consequences
State media to pick she is both a forceful visionary leader but also it down to earth man of the people one minute they Trump that she's achievements building China into an economic powerhouse the next they show him holding an umbrella for his wife ...
Social media and used it to broadcast simple earthy messages here he is delivering a characteristic line in a New Year's address and twenty Fifteen
His own way sharpy Mooney funding bull
Meat pies don't just fall from the sky he observes the oh he adds we've all just kind of roll up our sleeves and get down to work
Miranda says some of it seems to work on a domestic audience
Was highly that down here in the outer generation and my family and my classmates all have pictures that she and hung on their walls from what I see there's a lot more important than his family life compared to previous leaders but
Behind the feel good coverage she's use of the media has helped him to consolidate his own political power to a degree not seen in China for decades
Party controls the media and of course that will control cholesterol and basically she Jean King or the message
That's University of Hong Kong media expert David ... he argues that the media is obsessive focus on Xi Jinping is displacing or racing other important news
Contributing to an information vacuum about China just when the world can least afford it but new show you know media scholar of communication University of China in Beijing
Argues that China needs to focus on a main character to tell a story effectively and she is that character
On the job to hunt down I'm going to leave but she we call her leader promoter in chief of the nation's public image himself takes this very seriously
China began taking its image building very seriously before Xi Jinping became president new traces this back to the two thousand and eight Beijing Olympics he says that many Chinese felt that foreign media criticism of their pollution and human rights record spoil their moment in the world spotlight
... down at the we felt or ability transmitter views was inadequate we're unable to speak up
Since then China has poured billions of dollars into its state run media hiring journalists and public relations firms for example the official new Chinese news agency or shouldn't why has expanded its overseas bureaus from a hundred to a hundred and eighty and less than a decade state broadcaster China radio international meanwhile
Has expanded to allow it to put out twenty seven hundred hours of programming a day in sixty one languages
The message to its audiences is David ... is that China's rise is a boom all nations China portrays itself as a provider of public services and solutions to global problems
This is all about China's position in the world I'm In a sense China's rightful position in the world economy will turn to study ... for China will for all tied up with this new foreign policy up the belt and road
More than Seventy countries have signed on to participate in Xi Jinping's signature policy aimed at building infrastructure reports in roads linking the world to China of course China is hardly alone and its focus on its leader and his policies Maria ... a media expert at Georgia State university
Says Xi Jinping has a lot in common with other leaders from Russia's Vladimir Putin to Turkey's Reggie uptight ear to want
To even US President Donald Trump all of them she says use social media to portray themselves as political strongman and to put out nationalist and populist messages
That kind of highlighting the leader I can tell that he's ... he's with knowledge humor and the communication to their channel is a kind of in addition to their communication system at large
Rabbinical ... argues that China's story ended so example of high speed economic growth is found more receptive audiences in many developing countries
We should think about the broader picture that many other countries would still probably continue to see China as strong global actor and potential partner and investor and all of those things
But independent analyst Wu Tang says that China is having a hard time coming up with ideas that appealed to western audience says that's partly because ... says the Communist Party is publicly rejected universal values which argues don't fit China
Mobile's Google News of ways and means we'll see all the November
China's leader publicly opposes everything from civil society to freedom and democracy that gives them very little room to express themselves
If China has an alternative to the west considers universal values it hasn't been clear about what those are despite this tiny appears to a foot influencing foreign perceptions high on its agenda [noise] one of the young China Daily journalist named Bridget suggested this shift as a parent in her newspapers slogan
What would you send them on our model any China I'll go out into the world the world in China now its report on China and influenced the world
This model doesn't make it explicit but it's clear from China's media policies that their intent is not just the shape of the world in a way that suits China's interests but also to leave president Xi Jinping's indelible mark on it Anthony Kuhn NPR News Beijing [noise]

Okay a little Jackson Five music there get started on this last Thursday morning of our fundraising well the last day altogether of the do you view our fault fund raiser and we're asking you to you know remember these numbers the phone number to pledge at its one eight hundred nine zero nine nine
To eight seven or give it doubled you be you are dot org on the last day here's what we need to do it's been a great fundraiser by the way so far we've raised over a million dollars is Germany Hobson you pointed out a little earlier this morning but on the last day in order to have the money it takes to pay for the news and the months ahead
We still need to raise three hundred and Fifteen thousand dollars
It sounds like a lot of money it is a lot of money but already in the last half hour or so we've raised almost ten thousand dollars so we can do it
If you choose to get involved right now if you choose to get behind the news that you listen to all the time here on WB you are if you choose to place rock pledge right now and have your money go further thanks to the last match of this fundraiser last match and it is
Not going to last very long because we are quickly running out of the matching money so
This is a fifty percent bump on top of your contribution whether you give ten dollars a month and the Mars Society members turn it into Fifteen month for WB you are not just this month but for a whole year that's how it works when you give a monthly contribution it's matched for a whole year
If you give a one time gift to say a hundred or five hundred or a thousand or five thousand that is also worth fifty percent more
But we are going to run out of the match you money very quickly this morning so to jump on this while you still can all you have to do is take two or three minutes at the most right now and call one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven
Three hundred and fourteen thousand dollars left to raise now you can also pledged W. B. U. R. dot org or you know there are a lot of organizations out there there are a lot of
Enterprises that are really wonderful things were really proud of
An emotional so I guess if you did commit an act of sexual misconduct assault or otherwise we was in high school or college do you believe that would be disqualifying should be disqualified
I think that would depend on um what I mean I
Guess essentially if the if it really depends there's so many degrees and I think now we're in a day where
You know times are a little bit different than they were back then and what those accusations work but um I think you have to look at the entire life of somebody not something they did as a teenager um you know back in those days there was certainly a drinking a beer that's when you're doing these kinds of things and and stuff that
Um [noise] you have to ... an incident in high school it's kind of um
To believe that at this level of of our federal government that that's what we're looking at to try and disqualify somebody from disposition let me ask you as a result of the public debate over this we're seeing more ...
Till assault just yesterday former CBS News anchor Connie Chung wrote an op ed about her own salt fifty years ago when she was a college student there have been numerous of these testimonials coming out [noise] what do you make of them as someone who defends Brett Kavanaugh who was at the center of all this
Well I I think that
Someone one woman's experience or or because there are other experiences and certainly women have um had these assault experiences and we know that they go unreported and a lot of cases and things like that but that does it on its own on its face doesn't make Brett Kavanaugh or any man
Guilty of doing what they say they don't I mean in our country we have due process and you are supposed to be presumed innocent until proven guilty and this situation has been the complete opposite of that where he was presumed innocent based on a single accusation starting with it being anonymous
Then it would be accusation had to face in the name to it
Than there were four witnesses hall who could not corroborate that story
But have you ever had any friends who had this happen to them just people in your life who have suffered a sexual assault I'm sure that I Do yeah and how many men do you know who's ever been falsely accused
I don't they haven't told me that who they're accuser who they're accusing so I Know it's a very small percentage but that does it's about I think ten percent of the cases I think that the data shows it just doesn't mean
That Brett Kavanaugh is guilty because Ninety percent of the men who are accused are guilty ... there are men who are accused of things and they're not guilty and we can look at UVA can look at um a visit to Duke lacrosse
You know there are instances and frankly this one is a very public one um the timing of this was incredibly suspect um there's a lot of holes in the stories of I'm Dr Ford there's Ramirez is barely credible to New York times as you know do everything operate any of it
Knowing women who have endured this you know that there are eight is common to have holes in one's memory that you can't recount necessarily The Elders
Holes are one thing but lies or other things I mean
I'm you know fear of flying not true the second door on the house um again that the data they the history shows that was that you like indoor has been on for years before the therapy session that apparently was about
This incident there are a lot of things like I said in the testimony that Rachel Mitchell did not follow up on that ah you know now are coming out after the fact
In the fact that we know holes in her story we we do not know it is true that we don't have conclusive evidence either way may never we never but I just wonder including is there any part of you that wonders what if I'm wrong what if he did do
No there actually isn't um and it's just not enough in our country to make an accusation against somebody anybody for any job any position um or just for their life
Without having some cooperation um you know maybe the lesson is that women if these things happen to you need to either report them confide in somebody
Um something like that so that you know you have a strong case but uh that's not the case here um and and all three of these instances one who was much more salacious and the next there is no cooperation
We have to leave it there but we appreciate your sharing your thoughts ... missing a big old car ... Brett Kavanaugh's thank you so much for your time thank you for having me and this is NPR News

Is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep the historian Hampton Sides has been exploring the origins of the u._s. conflict with North Korea he's written a history of Americans in a brutal battle
And when Americans try to unify north and South Korea
They still don't have to radio announcer giving the news of the U.S military landing at a port city near Seoul in Nineteen fifty [noise]
North Korea that started the war invading the U.S back south the United states and its allies struck back with this landing commanded by one of the arrows most famous general
Douglas MacArthur his landing works as this old movie newsreel proclaimed
The war and read the turning point I was a fire started and certainly move all the north Koreans
Seemingly Hampton Sides says MacArthur is forces recaptured South Korea's capital
And he began to get kind of greedy
The new book on desperate ground examines the plan that MacArthur devised next
Why stop there why not go all the way to retake all of Korea unite the peninsula under one democratic government
McCarthy's troops crossed the famous thirty eighth parallel dividing north and south
But what U.S forces did not quite know as they moved into North Korea was the neighboring communist China considered the Americans that threat and a huge Chinese army will soon crossing the border to oppose them you're a landmark called the chosen reservoir
It was initially and intelligence failure we simply didn't know at first because the Chinese were expert at camouflage they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but didn't intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to believe this because
He wanted to finish the job by Thanksgiving get the war over with and so he sweat this information under the rug what
Was the landscape and the situation in which a U.S Marine Division found themselves around a reservoir in North Korea in the winter of Nineteen fifty fifty one
MacArthur ordered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of North Korea to take it and to keep on going to the Yalu but the commander of the first Marine Division whose name is general Oliver Smith
Realized that this was a perfect scenario foreign circle meant he was very fresh and he seemed to know that a big battle was going to happen
On the shores of this frozen lake in the mountains of North Korea sounds like it was pretty cold eighty five percent of these men suffered from frostbite many died of exposure
None of these troops were prepared for fighting in these kinds of conditions
You give an incredible detail of an American marine who is attacked with the rest of his unit by the Chinese it's the middle of the night it's incredibly cold he leaps out of his sleeping bag and only realizes after fighting for hours that he had never managed to put his boots on
You know this is Hector calf Retta who received the Congressional Medal of honor for his exploits that night you may have killed over a hundred Chinese soldiers who came wave after wave after wave at him and his position
The Marines in parts of the battle were outnumbered tend to one by the Chinese and he never kill demand for I'd never been in combat and suddenly her he was surrounded
Twenty thousand factories are Josephine reservoir slog than there are ways to fix the bitter miles to the evacuation point devote enough to snow mountain passes they held off two hundred thousand [noise]
The first Marine Division escaped but Chinese troops retook North Korea and the country's remain divided today the dividing line only slightly changed but the Korean people those who survived changed a lot
They had a different perspective on this story we just heard you focus on one particular Korea and leave by silk who was
Well Dr Lee as he is now known he was a North Korean kid and um escape to the south moved just soul as a a teenager
Only to have the war reached soul in Nineteen fifty when North Korean forces invaded
His uncle and his aunt were both murdered many of his friends were murdered you had to hide out in a house in Seoul he hid
Until American forces entered the city blasting to ruins as they took it back
Thought the capital city of Seoul [noise]
Medium we volunteered with the Marines and they gave him an assignment which was to go be an interpreter in a guard in the very city that he had grown up in in North Korea ham Han
... experiences as an American interpreter in the north
[noise] he was assigned to guard a bridge in his hometown a bridge they called the bridge of long life and he was there to prevent refugees from crossing it he hated this assignment
Or was on the other side of the bridge of long life and that she was not allowed to cross and that his whole family was about to board one of these ships for this great evacuation to the south and that they're going to have to leave his sister there forever
And so he prevail do over the American guards they got into a jeep they hunted for his sister all over that part of the city and they found her and she rejoined her family and and made it to the south lead
By ... survived the war and immigrated to the United states he is now Dr Lee by sort of Cincinnati, Ohio and American citizen and Hampton Sides was able to interview him for this book
Because this story of a divided nation is still less than one lifetime law what is it been like to be working on this book about Korea through a period where North Korea has been exploding nuclear weapons and launching missiles and then sending their leader to meet with President Trump but everything else
It's been very strange and you know I'm living in Nineteen fifty and I'm living in two thousand and Eighteen where there's so many echoes of this war it never really ended we just kind of hit the pause button and a work could break out again at any point
It's kind of terrifying but you know things have been happening in recent months that are exciting because there is such a profound desire both in the north and the south for some kind of a improvement in the relationship
Hampton Sides is the author of on desperate ground the Marines at the reservoir
And the Korean War graves battle thanks very much rate to be with you
This is NPR News says is not important nine do to be you are coming up the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia climbs again over fourteen hundred dead
You know if you're listening to W. B. you are right now we thank you for listening so early in the morning but uh you know you must be here because you appreciate the early morning news on WB you are stories that were telling you this morning including about the New York times story about
President Trump's finances the uh the the story or about the president's
That this is an investigation into sexual assault allegations what it's not as a criminal sexual assault investigation and that's pretty parents are the people who usually do those the local police
Were falling at a little bit or some more than others
That Steven Cooper commander of the criminal investigation division for the police department in ... Texas outside Dallas he's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the ... case
We wouldn't want to have any part of that given the the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV has turned his sons or any potential witness for victim is um let's say ten
If Cooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing
That's because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong
What trauma informed interviewing as saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation
That kind of slow non confrontational style is not with FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something
The FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom ... says you could do an actual criminal investigation into case such as Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it
There are clearly hurdles to delayed reporting but
That doesn't mean we should investigate thoroughly
Trump believes the retired police chief of Burlington, Vermont where he both worked in oversaw sex crime cases and now he helps to train sex crime investigators well it's hard to build a criminal case when the alleged attack happened decades ago when there is no DNA evidence he says you should still try
Looking at the circumstances hearing from any outcry witnesses that the victim ... through the years looking for other victims of this oh fender becomes a big piece of this ...
But that kind of approach especially when you start looking for similar tax but at the same person takes time weeks sometimes months when the police do it and that kind of time is not a luxury that the Senate has allowed the FBI ... NPR News

This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News
I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep let's recall the Supreme Court battle before the one we're living through now judge Brett Kavanaugh's contentious Senate hearing last week recalled some earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown
Between Democratic senators and then federal appeals court judge Robert Bork had been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy lead the attack in
Robert Bork some Erica there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme
Court for Robert Bork the Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination at the Ventura Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat
That as being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about how politics and the government work hike okay Hi fi here's our first question
My name is Melissa I stuck from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does it affect their legacy we're not ... well a hundred and
Sixty three nominations that presidents have sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on
So we have the means that it's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right
Only about a dozen have been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain
And then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas apt to chief also found in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected censor at lunch but by the way he was also the fish to appear before the Judiciary Committee
Well the other part of our question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like this
Different ones have different courses Robert Bork resign from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches than the man President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because it illegally smoked marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until they took senior status if he is Mac
Kevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee cars that caused him to be removed
So young likely as the way you remove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate
That was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for Thomas Jefferson wanting them off to quit because he disagreed with him politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric John Randall off in the house of representatives said hit wiped the floor with chase and so this nastiness is hardly know
A dead end the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing a justice for political reasons and that leads to another question
Hi this is Kelly my her from birth still Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now
Is so what was the result of what is it with these lifetime appointments well lots
Of judicial plans in various countries most do have either a term limit or a mandatory retirement age some at both uh they've been talk of an Eighteen year term limits fares Supreme Court justices here not likely to go anywhere and
That would require changing the law or in the constitution OK Cokie thanks very much and he seems commentator Cokie Roberts and you can ask Cokie your questions about our politics and the government work by tweeting us with the hashtag askcokie

Republican leaders are still trying to convince undecided Republicans and even some Democrats to vote for Kavanaugh and this kind of conversation is kind of the exact opposite of what they're trying to do and I think she probably also point out that the president has made clear that he takes this personally that he and he has a personal connection
With allegations and he says what he believes to be false allegations of sexual misconduct
And that is playing a role in the way that he's responding to all
Of this and Republicans took great pains to not criticized Christine Blasey Ford even going so far as to say she's credible

They're Mandarin language centers and the main cities never joined political Institute's hatched Japan the fool in the general secretary for the privates Moroccan confederation of tourism now runs a travel agency she says the number of Chinese visitors have sky rocketed
Started all this month into thousands or tens of thousands ...
And we closed last year which is about ...
For more than one hundred twenty thousand through this and we are expecting for two thousand twenty around the house millions and what's even more exciting is that Chinese businessmen showing up looking for opportunities we will win with China and China will win with Morocco

This tends to be one of the Steinway motivation for going abroad
This is Ravi per salad an analyst with belt and road blocks that tracks China's ambitions around the world he says the Chinese love to find business in countries like Morocco that have free trade agreements with Europe and the United states but not all of China's mega projects live up to the headlines and macaroni numbers
The reality is those numbers are almost invariably don't meet the numbers that are reported you go country to country Ethiopia Nigeria Poland and you ask them how much the Chinese pledged in the memorandum of understanding on how much is actually being invested and there's a huge huge gap
This may help explain why the construction site we visited intends yeah it's still scrap plans Deborah ... a professor at Johns Hopkins university and an expert on Chinese activity and Africa says she sees this happening again and again
All of these things that China says that they're trying to search that it's not a done deal until you actually see some cold hard cash flowing across the border
In the case of ten year it looks like that might be no hot cash flow in the Chinese company involved the high to group refused or a request for interviews but as soon as that told us that the company is no don't get involved in the ... project
Others have questioned the ability of the heights agreed to take on a project like this ... the China and Africa ... says she hasn't run into the company and her research

Comes to the high too great he admits though that that a problem he says they wanted ownership of the city and that's no
No no uh should ...

This is not what nine WVU are Bob I share with on points you make the ... good morning magna above enlisted Jay Clayton who's also in the studio good morning
Jane happy dollar for dollar match day Bob
Man the only dollar for dollar match in the fall fundraiser as well you know this fall fund drive which has been very successful so far ends tomorrow here on WB you are as we promised it would but between now and then in order to have all the money it takes to bring you the news and to protect the independence of WB you are
We still need to raise about five hundred thousand dollars so knowing that generous listeners have put up their money asking you to pledge they will double your gift if you give it now it is
As I said the only dollar for dollar match in the fall fundraiser don't let it slip through your hands give now while that money is on the table and the number to call is one
Eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or you can give it W. B. U. R. dot org you know how much you loved W. B. U. R. make your money go further by giving now
Than ever again one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven website W. B. U. R. dot org and again the only time during the fundraiser where your contribution is worth twice as much as the amount that you give
That thanks to the members of the Mars Society who are doubling your contribution at ten dollars a month
Twenty dollars a month fifty dollars a month five thousand dollars whatever you were able to give
It has doubled for a very limited time this morning and the only time during the fund drive so
Take advantage of that by giving what you can and protecting independent journalism
The key to protecting independent journalism is lots of listeners donating so that nobody has any more control than anybody else we're just all working together
To make sure W. B. U. R. can fulfill the mission of serving you being fair minded being thoughtful being thorough that's what you're investing in protecting when you give the w._b. you are
One eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven is the number dollar for dollar match available there and the W. B. U. R. dot O. R. G.
Eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven again that's the number to call and the dollar for dollar match means quite simply that your money's going to go twice as far as that you're going to get twice as much done by doing the same amount of work now I Know how busy mornings
A lectern said literally sit above the fray in a courtroom we don't expect judges to get down and dirty where politicians are I think it's bad enough that senators yelling at each other we really don't expect judges to be politicians
If we except for the moment for the purposes of this question his assertion that he's innocent he says he didn't do anything or he doesn't remember doing a thing [noise] what is the manner in which you could have defended himself
That would have left him on tainted
Think it would be fine for him to be impassioned I understand it some basic level the defense it if you feel like you're being wrongly accused of something of course you're going to have passionate about it
But he's behavior on Thursday was frankly shocking in an era where not very much a shocking anymore he interrupted senators he answered questions with questions
Uh it it was it was unprofessional and it was a very surprising to hear a judge speaking like that I don't think a judge would tolerate that from ...
Judge would be shocked um so I think uh you know there was a way for him to make his case
And in fact I think Dr Christine Blasey Ford made her case in a way that was passionate but not overly emotional and that somebody who was talking about how she had been sexually assaulted so
So if a Kavanaugh gets on to the Supreme Court what would you want to happen in cases involving Democrats what do you have to be recusing himself all the time and could somebody make him
A ... no one can make him which is a real concern um there's nothing that forces Supreme Court justices to recuse themselves of course parties would filed motions to recuse where they feel like it's appropriate
I think if you have an issue that concerns women um or liberal politics or even voting cases I think there's a real concern as to whether he can be fair
Issues concerning women you're saying that you would be making an argument or if you were a lawyer before the court that he shouldn't be judging anything concerning women
I mean I that I Do know that I Would make that argument that far but ... like I think there are certain issues look there were already issues about whether he could fairly judge issues on presidential power and there were lots of discussions about whether he needed to recuse at the beginning of this process
Because President Trump might conceivably have some case before the court and over again I'm right
There I think there are numerous cases that could come before the court involving President Trump and a judge Kavanaugh has made lots of comments about the extent of a presidential power so that was a concern already and I think his demeanor last week um shows that there are a lot more concerns about his temperament
Job at she'll be American Constitution society thanks so much and
Keep a new State Department visa policy declared that starting this month diplomats who want to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married Here's NPR's Michele tell them in
A State Department official says marriage equality is the love the land here in the U.S so when it comes to granting visas the U.S is now treating same sex couples the same as heterosexual couples with some limited exceptions diplomatic visas will now only be granted legal spouses
On the face of it this sounds fair says that shed Kumar of human rights watch but she worries the U.S is ignoring reality
Same sex marriages only legal in twenty five countries and perhaps more than learning in over Seventy countries around the world they conduct is
Illegal it criminalized it's been hunted by throwing people in jail by beating like eating a lot of countries how can we ignore that when we make policy here in the United states
She's expecting a lot of shot gun weddings which she fears could but some diplomats at risk back home diplomats and un officials are already here have until the end of the year to produce a marriage certificate if they want their partners to maintain their visa status
They could be exempted if the country they represent respect the rights of Americans at embassies abroad but as ... points down south and international organizations or in a different category
What's really inequitable I think is that the UN or World Bank or other international organization that don't have that option because there is nothing that those organizations can offer the Trump Administration and return
State Department officials who only spoke on background said they will work with individuals on a case by case basis
They say there were only a hundred and five families in the U.S will be impacted by this at fifty five of them at international organizations and the officials at most are from countries that do recognize same sex marriage Michele ... NPR News the state department [noise]

Mrs though if you beat you are bucks here with on point host mega ... good morning magnet good morning about has been a pretty good days so far in Jay Clayton good morning to you I Am president and here's one night
It's a good day and here's why Jay as president because we're ending the W. B. U. R. fall fundraiser tomorrow between now and then
We've had a great morning so far but between now and then we still need to raise four hundred eighty thousand dollars it's been a great morning because people are taking advantage of the match that's on the table generous listeners saying that they will match every pledge today for a little while
So that uh there is so that uh if it because they want to encourage you to give your money as well so that everybody is behind the news on WB you are
Protecting the independence of WB you are protecting independent journalism on WB you are so take advantage of that yourself have your ten or Fifteen or twenty dollar a month to pledge from W. B. U. R. doubled
For every month of the next year or have that hundred or two or that thousand or two dollar pledge that we hope you'll give in the next couple of minutes be doubled doesn't matter what the amount is only matters that you become a contributing listener the pledge line
Is one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or you can give at W. B. U. R. dot or
You know it might seem like it would be easier if we just got a few or a few dozen or a few hundred
Deep pockets to fund WB you are but that would be the shareholder model and that would mean that we would ultimately have to serve their interests so this is a different model this is the independent journalism listener supported radio model not for profit model
Thousands of people contribute each year to W. B. U. art amounts of ten dollars a month twenty dollars a month sometimes a thousand or a few thousand but it is mostly smaller donations and that is how you create and protect independent journalism
No better time to do your part toward that goal then right now during the first last in only dollar for dollar match for the entire fall fundraiser and here's the thing other listeners have already been doing their part this morning they have taken about half of the matching money off the table
Yes she does and and on the stand insisted that that dash cam video which which seems to show the shooting very clearly um you know officer Van Dyke says that that does not accurately represent what happened it doesn't show what happened from his perspective
Um that was an understanding yesterday he talked a lot of things that that he said the dashcam video can't see like McDonald's face and his and he describes his ...
You know no expression on his face he was looking through Van Dyke and then he talked about that action that you heard there in the intro of of McDonald turning toward him with and waving and nice forcing him to shoot 'em as you said none of those things are on the dash cam video
And is this critical to his defense to try to describe his own state of mind and suggest that whatever you believe from looking at the video I believed I was in danger
It's absolutely critical to his defense I mean even if he wasn't an officer acting in self defense or requires that that the person who does it feels afraid for for his or her life
As a police officer the bar or for conviction is even higher you know it has to be what a
Reasonable officer would have done in that moment
And so what Van Dyke even before he testified what he's needed to convince the jury of his that he was reasonably and fear for his life and so he's trying to bring in all sorts of other considerations besides that dash cam video to show why he would reasonably be and fear for his wife likes that look on his face or
The turn that that you can't see on the dash cam video
And I guess that would explain why he took the risk of taking the stand which defendants don't have to do
That is right and and this is not something I expected a you know it's something that we've been asking um attorneys in court Roger ... through the first two weeks of trial or do you think the end I was going to take the stand or what we heard were mixed answers we heard
From a lot of attorneys who said um well you really have to testify out top or not you really have to testify if you're claiming self defense that's what's going to bring it home from the jury we also heard from a lot of other people who said oh no that's a huge risk to be to subject yourself to cross examination when there is that dash cam video
Will have to cross examination go well
Um when bombs or Van Dyke was giving his testimony when he was questioned by his own attorney he was very emotional he cried when he described the shooting when he was being cross examined that emotion and sadness went away the prosecutor pushed him on the fact that his testimony was contradicted by the video and that it doesn't fit what a Van Dyke set in police reports
Van Dyke to not have good answers for that he said he didn't remember what he said right after the shooting because he was in shock and couldn't explain discrepancies with the video and he was he was combative with prosecutors he seemed almost annoyed that he was being questioned
It as an initial reports say anything about that look on the suspect's face or the the turn or anything else
It didn't say anything about the look but it did actually describe in great detail alleged movements by requirement Donald the wave of the knife raising the knife and and it described officer Van Dyke backpedaling from McDonalds none of those things are on the dash cam video

My second referendum would be a politician and addition having people on the fence Simon shouldn't try again thanks for them and what he would do just say in all of
It is really interesting the conservative party leaders including the likes of may have said all along they are not total fans of this Brexit thing but they want to respect the will of the people and that's what I guess you said again what else did she say in a speech
Well it's interesting ... it was actually the smallest part of the speech it mostly was focusing on his domestic agenda jobs the confidence of the conservative party which previously it's definitely been known for as well as just even the diversity of her own cabinet
And that's because breakfast has been really divisive for the party it's been a mill stone around the neck of conservatives in last week I was the Labour Party conference up in Liverpool and they were very they seem pretty United they felt like a government party and waiting and may and the other conservative I think they know they need to stick together
Their worst nightmare is being forced into a general election and losing to the Labour Party and that would put labor's leader Jeremy Corbyn he's a socialist in number ... Downing Street and that's something they absolutely don't want to see
Frank thanks very much happy to do it Steve NPR's Frank Langfitt
This is not important nine ... Jay Clayton magna ... here letting you know
That time is running out your opportunity is coming to an end if you want to take advantage
Of a dollar for dollar match we have on the table this morning your money doubled when you do your part to protect independent journalism on WB you are by giving us a donation a pledge that gets behind the news at W. B. U. R. dot org or give at the pledge line one eight hundred
Nine zero nine nine to eight seven and what we mean is that the pledge money I mean not the pledge money the uh the match money is not going to last all day long and we've already
Consumed about half of it thanks do a lot of people who stepped up to the plate and given the w._b. you are this morning so
Before it runs out before the opportunity to have your pledge doubled dollar for dollar take advantage called the number pledge at one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or give a W. B. U. R. dot or
One of the beautiful things about this matches that it is open to everybody whether the amount that you're comfortable giving is ten dollars a month or a hundred dollars a month or a few thousand dollars as you know not many but some people do give the w._b. you are
Any of that money and all of that money will be matched but you do have to get in on this quickly because we're already more than halfway through this dollar for dollar match and it is the only one for this fall fund drives so
Do your part as quickly as you can add one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or eight W. B. U. R. dot O. R. G.
Again it's one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or W. B. U. R. dot org and when you cut the call that number or go to the website and you really what you're doing by by pledging and contributing to W. B. you are is you're
Doing when I think is one of the purest expressions of what you value right like how we spend our money shows what we value um beyond the things that we have to spend our money ribs over our head and food on the plate food on the plate I get that
Uh but one eight hundred and nine zero nine nine to eight seven is a number to call when you do that you were saying hey I value independent journalism I that I valued journalism with integrity I valued journalism I can trust in a day and age where there's so much information out there that it's getting perhaps a little harder to figure out what information you can trust and what you can't

And I'm Rachel Martin the FBI is broadening its investigation into Brett Kavanaugh this week and with the Supreme Court nominees still in the news it's hard for a lot of us
To get last week's hearing out of our minds author Rebecca Traister keeps thinking about how differently the total was of the two witnesses Dr Blass before it was so deferential so polite so constrained I understand and appreciate
Directly about what happened to me and the impact that it had on my life and I my family
And then in came Brett Kavanaugh his instinct was very public fury on his
Own behalf of his number one in the class I don't know if I was on loan on no no no no no no not this I'm going to I'm going to borrow more I don't know I'm I'm sure I'm going to talk about my ... year in marketing and
That was an exchange between Brett Kavanaugh and democratic Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy during those hearings Rebecca Traister says men
In general are allowed to use a full range of expression and still come off as credible he had in his arsenal the ability to use anger
Fury tears in a way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people [noise] I don't think that Dr Christine Blasey Ford I Can't imagine a scenario in which she would have gone into that hearing room
Armed with that same weapon that seemed tool that she could yell and be furious in her retelling of what
Happened to her racers been exploring the idea of women and anger in her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger
The moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen election anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning on women's march it was also anger
At some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the interim ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march and it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history
And it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious
And it was really just missed and a lot of quarters as being about the pain cats the Pussy hats you know a bunch of women getting together and there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not just running for school board down the road
But this week and of course then that gets us to a year that has women protesters opposing the health care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office in historic numbers and then
Meet you [noise] you lean into history in this book and it's full of examples of men's anger
Being laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example what historically was so threatening about women saying well in part
That anger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protest it in ways that we understand correctly to this is a revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation
They codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government so they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women
[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out are condemned to in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color who do so
Do you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment I think it's
Almost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and
So marginalized for so long when in fact it's women of color who have been the leaders and the leading fingers of so many of our social movements in ways that have remained invisible to us so when we think about me to one of the things that gets lost [laughter]
Is that the definition of sexual harassment stems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color who were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases have been brutally sexually harassing their workplaces
In Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]
It's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement erupts
I think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality of the harm they sustained but in fact
All of that is for grounded by women of color whose story
And if a race as the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise]
That's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks in the past ... years and then
We have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this is a character assassination by the left so is women's anger only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda
Not at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still I think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time
And the kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around calving off is going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future [noise]

This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep one woman found a way to attack high health insurance prices
And that's news because it's hard for any one person to do if you go to the hospital the hospital charges your insurer
Which passes the cost on to you and it's hard to negotiate a better price and that system Marshall Allen of the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica has been investigating high health insurance costs and he has the story of a woman who used her power to hold them down either Marshall
Good morning Steve who is this woman we're talking about uh sixty eight year old grandmother named Marilyn Bartlett and Maryland Bartlett took over the Montana Employee Benefit plan in twenty four teen
And when she took over the plan which covers about thirty thousand state employees and their families and that plan was in deep trouble it's self funded so the employer paid all the health care bills and it was projected to lose about fifty million dollars in the coming years and basically go
Broke so the classic situation here that people and all sorts of insurance arrangements face where they're basically told healthcare is really expensive gets more expensive every year and we're short of money we need more from you
Exactly and if people hadn't noticed the cost of your health care benefits is rising there's about a hundred and fifty one million of us
Who get our health care benefits through our employers
And part of the problem is our employers have been deferring to the medical industry when it comes to the cost of health care and so the industry keeps raising the cost and basically those costs keep getting passed on to the workers what did Maryland Bartlett do differently she had spent Thirteen Years working in the insurance industry
And so she knew a lot of the games she was also kind of a massive nerd knew how to follow the money
And so working with our team is she compared what her plan paid each hospital in the state the bigger hospitals to what they were paid by Medicare and Medicare publishes its prices and so she could see
That her health plan was paying hospitals in the state anywhere from two times what Medicare gets paid to five times what Medicare gets
Paid well and so she said that was too much
It was too much I mean the plan is going broke her charge was to get things under control and so she had to do some really hardball negotiating and why she decided to do which is kind of a revolutionary idea in the health care world is she decided to set her own prices and set the plans prices
Now in this case you had some leverage and actually all employers have this
It really does need our money so she said look you hospitals that are five times the Medicare rate you're going to need to bring your prices down to about twice the Medicare rape
I Wonder if hospitals simply had to accept that I'm thinking that in Montana there can't be all that many hospitals there surely would be a hospital there would just say listen our prices are price
It took some hardball negotiating she threatened to go public with the price variation and expose the high price hospitals she called in the union to campaign against the hospital was holding out and they had a whole campaign state wide they sent hundreds of postcards and made phone calls to the hospital executives and leaders
And eventually all the hospitals signed on and the plans saved about a million dollars a month just from the reduced hospital prices
Is there a lesson here for employers of all sizes that if they put in that time they can get the leverage to hold down what is paid for hospitals and other medical costs
Maryland would say absolutely yes her message really to employers as you need to push back you need to read the fine print in your contracts
You need to demand to know where the money is going and why the costs are so high and get an itemized explanation for all of the expenses and when you do that you know you may need to the smaller employers meaning to join together with other small employers to increase their leverage but they can bring down the prices
Marshall Allen of ProPublica thanks very much

Part of that was denied the right to vote and part of that with segregation laws and the other part of that was re inflating the black population
I hello says Louisiana did so by making it easier to convict African American defendants those contracts within least by the state to do the work that had been done by slaves
Right the Louisiana law was to physically designed to discriminate against minority voices to discriminate against African Americans
Gee park runs the Innocence Project New Orleans she says in Louisiana since Nineteen eighty nine a little more than forty percent of people exonerated and non capital cases were convicted by a non unanimous jury split
That number ... non unanimous jury decide it does not help in launching an accurate
Verdict Oregon adopted non unanimous juries in Nineteen thirty four following a decade in which the Ku Klux Klan was powerful and the state and anti immigrant sentiment was high all either Kaplan is the director of the criminal justice reform clinic at Lewis and Clark law school in Portland
Socialize were were based on discrimination and are like last relics of those times
She wrote a law review article detailing the history of Oregon split jury system
Even putting the history aside I don't want to be convicted when two people don't believe that the states need their case
The law has its supporters Tim ... is the executive director of the Oregon district Attorneys Association
I can also tell you with absolute certainty that the non unanimous jury policy reduces the number of hung juries in criminal cases that go to trial
Last November he testified in support of non unanimous jury is before the state's Judiciary Committee
In doing so clearly saves scarce resources in our criminal justice system
A case had it before the Oregon court of appeals this month argues non unanimous jury to convict people when there's doubt and denied defenders of color a jury of their peers cast Spencer sat on the jury for that case in twenty
Sixteen I don't know how you wouldn't ever get to a jury of peers in the state of Oregon for a non white person
The defendant was African American as is Spencer was one of the two jurors that thought the defendant wasn't guilty
I Do believe he was a night a jury of his ear my voice was kind of silence because the majority which was not just here um [noise] do the other way
The case now before the appeals court could find non unanimous juries violate the equal protection clause of the U.S constitution but all that could take years in the meantime some Oregon lawmakers won a legislative fix or following the lead the honestly want to put the issue before voters for NPR News I'm Conrad Wilson in Portland [noise]

Or there was some big news out of one of the world's biggest companies today the Seattle based company Amazon announced that it plans to raise wages to Fifteen dollars an hour that is for all full time part time and seasonal workers are going to start this next month
It's a bold move for a company that's been in the spotlight lately and not in a good way necessarily NPR's Alina Selyukh is here in the studio to talk through but this change means Hi good morning and just to note here Amazon is one of interest and natural supporters solely to what other details can you share
Right so they she press release inherited a few takes away from that a takeaways from that you mentioned at the Fifteen dollar minimum wage will apply to fulltime part-time and seasonal workers also importantly temporary workers contract workers
Which is where a lot of the scrutiny has been for Amazon specifically they issued a number of few months ago saying that the median wage at Amazon was less than twenty nine thousand dollars a year which is a very uh
Interesting contrast to the fact that the company also this year I'm a topped one trillion dollars in worse and so for the contract workers that Fifteen dollar minimum wage will mean a lot I'm also the number of employees that will be affected by this is pretty staggering it's more than two hundred and fifty thousand
Times on it well I mean I I noted it you just talked about an Amazon has been under a lot of very public scrutiny for how it treats its employees not just the the median wage which you outline but just the conditions of workers is is this change will result of of that public scrutiny
Well it's unclear you know if you follow Amazon if you wait kind of long enough there will inevitably be some kind of a story in the news about um is a specific it's usually specific warehouse in a specific location where some
I'm a criticism comes up about the the way that the employees were being monitored or how much money they're making and general Amazon usually comes back to that to say well actually all of our full time workers um in warehouses well do you make Fifteen dollars to begin with if you're counting all the benefits and things like that
Um but the interesting thing is that this has become kind of a rallying cry Senator Bernie Sanders has gone after Amazon for this base those a CEO Jeff Bass those came to speak in Washington I'm a few weeks ago when I went to that and outside of the hotel there was a small group of protesters
Um they describe themselves as socialist and mainly what they did talk about what specifically that optical
Kind of contrast of Jeff ... does not just the wealthiest man or in the world but the wealthiest man and history running a company where the employees were uh I'm not making a huge amount of money um and they had a little science talking specifically about that
I'm In the other thing to remember is just how ... how vast Amazon has become a few months recently right I mean the larger business contacts for this Amazon clearly is doing well in this moment sort of feeling like they can afford this change
It's I think that's part of it and you know Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gets asked a lot about you know do you think your companies too big
And they did buy a whole foods recently they have a variety of businesses getting into cloud services getting into deliveries I mean we're talking truck fleets of truck drivers fleets of warehouse workers fleets of
Um you know call service people and he often turns it into a bit of a philosophical conversation about you know large institutions should be scrutinized you know it's not personal large institutions anywhere should be scrutinized
Um but the fact that they now do you have sort of this interesting span of workers and retail um and on the business side kind of does make it an interesting development that that that they're raising minimum wage
I mean lawmakers on Capitol Hill you mentioned Bernie Sanders but others have been pushing for a federal minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour how is this move now by Amazon such an important company how's that going to affect that effort
But there is a really big us being in that press release that Amazon issued which is they're saying they are going to quote working again congressional support for an increase in the federal minimum wage which could be huge if you have one of the
Most valuable American companies now lobbying for a Fifteen dollar a minimum wage federally that could be really huge it's important to note that other companies have been moving toward this a lot of the states have been moving toward those
Target as one example I can offer of a company that is going for Fifteen dollars by twenty twenty and also importantly in this moment the timing of this is interesting we're about to go into the holiday season and Amazon says it will pay it seasonal workers Fifteen dollars
Um this is perfectly time for that that creates a lot of pressure on a lot of the other retailers that are battling in this really tight labor market for the exact same types of
People who might be looking for employment right during the holiday
Season All right great explainer NPR business reporter Alina Selyukh for us on this announcement that Amazon is raising its minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour thanks so much Alina thank you [noise]

The ... the most popular sizes are already disappearing a lot of people have been calling this morning to get one of these is their way of supporting WB you are if you would like to get one is your way of supporting WVU are
Just be quick about it so you don't miss your chance of missed the size that you need one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven is the number to call and the website is W. B. U. R. dot org
One eight hundred Ninety nine Ninety seven WVU our dad or gay let out a little chair yeah when we heard the number was six thirty six hundred and thirty thousand which might have had it I just on the the only thing a lot of money it is but it's down from six hundred and fifty thousand just a couple of minutes ago so that's why I was cheering and twenty thousand in a
Few minutes I mean we're so honored and we're so thankful I we just need to keep chipping away at it and by the way I've been mentioning you guys that are in the amount of time we're raising that money Harvard just raised nine point six to ... billion in college I Want to underscore that's what they just raised it to add to their and down and we're about forty ... and I just
Say to Robin down even with this is why we need full participation if one person did that whole ... six hundred and thirty thousand ... even if they did it as the sustain or it would be fifty two thousand five hundred a month [laughter] okay that's why we need you to just jump in and everybody just chipping a little bit
It took some hardball negotiating she threatened to go public with the price variation and expose the high price hospitals she called in the union to campaign against a hospital was holding out and they had a whole campaign statewide they sent hundreds of postcards and made phone calls to the hospital executives and leaders
And eventually all the hospitals signed on and the plans saved about a million dollars a month just from the reduced hospital prices
Is there a lesson here for employers of all sizes that if they put in that time they can get the leverage to hold down what is paid for hospitals and other medical costs
Maryland would say absolutely yes her message really to employers as you need to push back you need to read the fine print in your contracts

And I'm Steve Inskeep just how much further is the Federal Bureau of investigation supposed to look into the life of Brett Kavanaugh
And that's become a hotly debated question after the Senate allowed an extra week to interview witnesses Republican Senator Jeff flake was the one who forced this change she called for a short pause to allow a limited one week FBI investigation of sexual assault accusations against the Supreme Court nominee
Flake worked with Democrats who are trying to stave off an immediate confirmation vote flake appeared on CBS the sixty minutes along with Democrat Chris Coons an anchor Scott Kelly asked this question
If judge Kavanaugh is shown to have lied to the committee nominations over those type of thing so
... a lot of testimony to examine NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is here to more than ... so where does the nomination stand today
Well one thing we know is that Donald Trump is still all in at a rally in West Virginia over the weekend he cast the votes for or against judge Kavanaugh in purely partisan terms here's what he said so
Some great things happening but a vote for judge Kavanaugh is also a vote to reject the ruthless and outrages tactics of the Democratic party mean obstruction mean resist ... for the last Eighteen months
So there is some confusion however about what exactly is going to be investigated the Senate Judiciary committee said the investigation would be limited to quote current credible allegations so what does that mean
Is the investigation going to look into the accuracy of Kavanaugh's testimony that's unclear Donald Trump has denied that he's put any limitations on the FBI he said the investigators have free reign but this is not a criminal probe it's merely an additional background checks so they're not going to be issuing any subpoenas
Well let's listen to a little bit more of what the president has been saying about this
Having the FBI go out to a thorough investigation whether a three day seven days I think it's going to be less than a way but I Do a thorough investigation I actually think will be a blessing in disguise it will be a good thing

Is the point nine W. B. U. R. I'm Bob ... Senator Elizabeth Warren has now said publicly that you'll take a hard look at uh twenty twenty White House bid
It's MORNING WVU ours Anthony Brooks takes a look at the shift in what she'd been saying and whether as a presidential candidate if he runs she'll run as a populist ready to take on political
For more than a year Warren has been swatting away questions about a White House runs saying that she's focused only on her Senate reelection campaign but at a town hall meeting on Saturday in Holyoke she moved to step closer to becoming a presidential candidate in twenty twenty
After November's it I Will take a hard look
At running for president has done a lot to fuel
Speculation that she's preparing to run for president she's raising a lot of money in campaigns frequently across the country for fellow Democrats raising her national profile and she's pushing big national policy proposals in August she introduced anti corruption legislation and has been running ads
Casting herself as the would be sheriff who wants to clean up Washington
The bill has an idea to take back our government for wealthy and the
Among those ideas the bill would impose lifetime lobbying bans on presidents vice presidents members of Congress federal judges and cabinet secretaries it would also require presidential candidates to make their tax returns public something president Donald Trump has never done
Things are worse with Donald Trump in the White House this is the most corrupt administration ever but
In an interview friday Warren said corruption in Washington is bigger than Trump
The problem is in the structure it's how money influences this place and how the wealthy and the well connected get their way over and over while everybody else gets left behind
Warren has spent much of her career focused on corporate corruption as a senator and now as a possible presidential candidate she's taking on political corruption it's a winning issue for anyone who believes it built curry is a former White House advisor for Bill Clinton he's now raising money to build a grassroots movement to fight public corruption
Curry says Warren is right to make this the focus of any potential presidential campaign
Corruption is the biggest problem we faced because it's the problem that keeps all the other problems from ever getting solved this is the closest this divided country has to a consensus on any issue
A recent survey by the Kaiser Family foundation bears that out it found that corruption in Washington is the issue voters are most concerned about more than health care more than the economy and jobs and it's the issue that Donald Trump tapped into when he promised to drain the swamp
Peter uber Casio is a political scientist and dean of arts and sciences at stone hill college he says Warren's anti corruption initiative is a smart way to reach voters disillusioned with Washington but protests you'll also says in other ways she's not an ideal presidential candidate
She is not extraordinarily popular nationally she will be characterized as a leak out of touch liberal professor
All of which could undermine her populist message Jeff deal the Republican state rep who's running against Warren has been arguing for months that she's more interested in the White House than in Massachusetts deal says her announcement in Holyoke proves his point
Well I think Massachusetts deserves a full time senator not a part time author part time senator and so in my opinion if she really cares about you know the White House she should make that a full time effort and drop out of the Senate race
That's not likely Warren is expected to easily be deal according to recent polls butter reason Suffolk University Boston Globe poll found that fifty eight percent of Massachusetts voters say she should not run for president
Warren may be popular enough to win a second term in the Senate but voters also recognize that running for president would be a lot more complicated for Ninety nine W. B. U. R. I. me up and he works

Okay if you're looking for a cheaper health insurance and you can currently find on the individual market a whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the ... the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak
They're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option these
Are a niche product always have been
That's done badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington
It's simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products of them on the individual marketplace
Short term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years that stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days
Now the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies can find coverage [noise] more than eighty percent of people who buy and
Subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans the new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option
Instead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them
But Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk people who think
That they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something and they made by these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually got to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage
That's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA
Policies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that deductible has met
Some people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs
These policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options are look different depending on where you live in the new rules the insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out
The government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people Alison Kodjak NPR in ... [noise]

On not anymore at nine WVU are just ahead Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on President Trump's endorsement I went to staged illusion between Israel and the Palestinians it's five twenty nine
As long as the you know we have the middle east on reformed and pockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism this is the best we could we could about and
You you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want that to stay with Israel [noise]
Uh yes I Want to have that overriding power and I'll tell you why
You don't see this is an interesting question
How come you don't see that much terrorism in the west bank well
First of all we have security cooperation with the Palestinian authority that's good
Um who don't have it with Hamas in Gaza but the bulk of the security operation was a it was done by off
But here's how it's done we have say intelligence about terrorists in one of the Palestinian towns and we would call up typically the Palestinian security authorities and say
Why don't you take care of it 'cause I don't want to send our soldiers there if we don't have to why should we you know and often
We have to do because because we're willing to take the risk within attack as we were yesterday the
Un by President Abbas so they want us to take care of their security but also you know attack us find internationally
Final thing prime minister because I Know your time is very briefly I Hope you got the irony of what I said
I understand I Do final thing you have been very closely aligned with President Trump that has carried certain great benefits for you is there also a risk being so closely aligned with such a polarizing president because he would rather as Israel historically has has bipartisan support in the United states
Israel values is bipartisan support Israel is a bipartisan support in I Believe will have a ... in in the future it's a very powerful
Bond there there's no risk with being so close to Trump
Well I think that ah you know you see that we could have agreements and disagreements with ministers was for example we had you know it's no secret
Of how to disagree with President Obama on Iran but at the same time
We signed an animal you are in the animal you are the memorandum of understanding guaranteed Israel a very important American security assistance for the coming decade and and I appreciate that uh so we can have disagreements and yet have a basic agreement about the importance of our lives

I'm ... now to football anyone counting out the New England patriots after two straight losses might want to reconsider this morning the patriots routed the previously undefeated Miami Dolphins and Fox burger yesterday thirty eight seven
After the victory pass quarterback Tom Brady said the patch need to keep the momentum going
We haven't played well last week saying you know we talk a lot about the things we need to do better and we need to carry more from week to week so this game's great but you know you got to turn to page once you learn from it and you know you ...
You running as this morning for a recap of yesterday's when as he is most Mondays is ESPN dot coms Mike Reese good morning Mike good morning by of everything is right again in New England [laughter]
It was almost like Dr Jekyll and Mr hyde we've had the evil Mr hyde for a couple of weeks and yesterday we got the smart or a doctor Jekyll patch really turned it around there were struggling on off into defense last week but shined on both sides of the ball yesterday why was that well
They did and and one of the players Devon ... he told the story after the game that Tom Brady was in the locker room and said it feels great to be two in two and and you never think the patriots would want to be too into but after they played so poorly
The last two weeks just to get back to that sort of level ground they felt really good about and and I would say if you want to highlight one thing they started faster so they were able to play the game more on their terms
All right let's talk about uh the defense right now are they allowed just one touched down very late in the game they didn't allow the dolphins within forty five yards of the end zone until the fourth quarter how they
That well one of the big things that they did was they played better on early down so they stopped the run and they got back to fundamentals and when Miami had to get a first down they had a long way to go buy them in their first
Eat plays I think they needed ... yards or more to get a first down and when you put a team in that situation it really allows you to dictate the terms
Of the play and they were able to pressure them and really over match them in the game defensive stand out for the parents will there were a few but I Would say Kyle's van noir linebacker and and there was one play in the second quarter that
Really sort of reflected that and it was a bad snap by the Miami Dolphins and the ball was on the ground in the Miami Dolphins quarterback ... really looked like he had the ball in Cairo, Illinois just never relented he came right in jumped on him and really took
Again the patriots just wanted a little bit more
All right back off and uh the patch made plays both throwing the ball and running the ball tell us about the improved running game and the performance of their rookie running backs Sony Michel
Sony Michel finished with one hundred twelve yards on twenty five carries with one touched down and really the story here is that you can't produce like that if you don't have good blocking upfront and it's not just the running back
It's those big offensive linemen and they got back to playing or the the way they know where they can play they blocked a lot better so he was a a stand up with thirty three offensive snaps and then you had the old standby James White
Who had two touchdowns one rushing one passing it running back as well and uh you know he played forty snaps and he's one of their best players that NATO
All right Tom Brady a pass for two hundred Seventy four yards but still ... some on the receiving a with receivers he
Did he's still looking to get comfortable you know it doesn't seem like it's a Tom Brady you know from start to finish that were used to seeing but it certainly was good enough he finished twenty three of thirty five for two hundred Seventy four yards with three touchdowns
In two interceptions I'm One of the big storylines was him getting comfortable with the new target
Josh Gordon who played Eighteenth apps and he's going to really help the patriots he looked OK yesterday he he really did he gave them a lot of energy to catches for thirty two yards and and he just gave him another option you know that's one thing that has stood up to the first three games of the season prior to this one
They just seem limited they need more options to throw too on our fence and he sits right next to Tom Brady in the locker room and he said after the game that he really appreciates the support and love the radius given him as he tries to get his career and really his life back on track

Largest unsolved art heist in history every Monday we're talking to the reporter behind last seen at the new podcast from do you say you are and the Boston Globe this week they look at the possibility that a few gangsters were behind the theft of a half billion
Dollars worth of art they give us a preview of senior producer and reporter for last seen Kelly horn Hi Kelly again getting winning by ... Pulitzer Prize winning Boston Globe reporter last seen consulting producers deeper chin high save money by
So killing an episode three you explore one theory about where the plan for robbing the Gardner was hatched at a Dorchester auto repair shop called T. R. C. auto electric
Yeah that's right T I C ... was that front for a thriving bustling criminal enterprise run by a gangster named Carmelo ... when he was involved in drug trafficking illegal weapons
You name it and uh we now from our reporting that the FBI from very early time is looking at Carmelo Anthony now and his gang for a variety of crimes including the possibility that they knew something about the electric car new museum heist
So Steve tell us more about Carmelo I'm really no well Molina operated
This garage a but didn't spend much time fixing because he was allegedly
It's heavily involved and cocaine dealing out of TLC and there was always the chatter about the Gardner Museum art theft
Kelly the Gardner Museum chief investigator Anthony more a talk to you are about to yours you auto what'd you say
Well he said that these guys were totally devoted their lives and crime and that they they didn't just do things at random they were carefully surveying the criminal landscape for all the possibilities in keeping tabs even on their rivals in crime
They study crime but not the history of crime they study the newspapers and say hey did you hear so and so did such and such is the way baseball fanatic might follow the red Sox
And as I understand that we're Leno is suspected of being involved in one of the biggest heists of its kind in history
Yes indeed in Nineteen sixty to a man wearing a police uniform stopped at the Plymouth mal track which had millions of dollars and he got a million and a half dollars to the exact no one was ever arrested Molina was suspected of involvement
And it was for the time the largest heist of its kind that you see here some similarities I little track record big heist and or even a police uniform if if indeed he then went to where
One of the most interesting aspect of a covering crime stories over the years I've found is when you can gain access to law enforcement tape recordings of conversations between criminals or alleged criminals in an episode three of life seeing you have access to FBI informant tapes
Yes in these tapes are a gold mine they're fascinating they were recorded from inside the act confidential informants pants [laughter]
And what you were hearing them is ... and this FBI informant Anthony Romano planning a heist on an armored car votes facility the Louis Fargo facility in eastern Massachusetts and you hear the details that went into this planning
Every detail rings a bell if you're following the Gardner heist

So Steve what is it about the plan how to use a ... in Ninety seven ... makes you think about the Gardner Museum robbery seven years earlier
The people who were talking about the cause of all the same people whose names were associated with the Gardner heist seven years earlier
But people talking on the tape you're yes the people talking on the tapes they're not getting much detail but they are talking about both Gardner and the ... [noise]

Of the voters we sampled this weekend some like the idea others wonder whether she made the same fate as Hillary Clinton WVU ours Simone Rio's caught up with voters at the harvest there in eastern

The India think you'll refers to is the fact that Warren identify just having Native American heritage appoint that's long been a basis for Republican attacks most notably from President Trump tech gill says floating a presidential run is a bad look for Warren part because she's still running to keep her Senate seat
It makes me chuckle 'cause I don't think she's going to get through the Senate race I mean from the people that I talked to like I told by what they didn't vote for Trump I voted against Hillary Clinton level for Trump again not for Trump against Elizabeth Warren no way you vote for her oh God no oh God no
But ... says it's not just about politics he says he supported Senator Bernie Sanders for president in Sanders aligns closely with the positions of Warren some say this type of voter could be a real problem for one should she run for
President in twenty sixteen sixty two percent of white men supported Trump but they're not a monolithic group
Larry Henderson of eastern is also an independent but he says he wants to see a president Warren I think she's
Got experience in the Senate and if the running for the president doesn't work out is very important that we still have somebody that cares about the issues that we all care about
And it's important to have her there
Um but I Would rather see her
Run for president and get it and that way she'd say well I have experience and then as somebody has come out of nowhere and be like hey I've never done this before but
Let me try it the fact that warrant is talking about the idea of a presidential run in the midst of a Senate race comes as a surprise to some observers among them is Deborah show crowd a political science professor at Tufts she says it's clear Warren will have to overcome the challenge of her own demographic profile
There's something to the idea that people aren't comfortable with an older ambitions seeking powers seeking women running for office that alone could hurt her no matter what her political views are

Senator Chris Coons of Delaware thanks so much thank you Steve
We're good morning now and NPR's Mara Liasson has been listening along with us here Mara Liasson what did you hear there
Well what I heard was that a senator Coons laid down the criteria for what would satisfy him and my thought was that doesn't really matter if it satisfies any Democrats
The only thing that matters is is the process this week long investigations satisfies Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake who are the three moderate Republicans who wanted this
Pause something the president and
A leader Mitch McConnell and Kavanaugh himself didn't want but the mass is that the Republicans can afford to only lose one vote and you have senator Collins saying it's very quote reassuring to the public that we're doing this investigation he's
Um she said it shows Republicans want to make sure we have all the facts to make an informed decision so this might be the kind of thing Democrats wanted but be aware of what you wish for because it just might grease the skin
They're much thank you it's October
And the fall election campaign is in high gear so or the social media operations full of mind games and fall Suddes things that marred the twenty sixteen election campaign NPR's Tim Mak has been asking
How people can protect themselves the online social media world in many ways is an illusion
The Senate intelligence committee recently heard from an expert who testified there is twenty five to thirty times more fake information from automated accounts on the extreme left in the extreme right then there is genuine real life conversation
And with the mid term elections just around the corner experts are bracing for a spike in foreign disinformation we're going to have an October surprise that spread brewing who during the Obama administration worked at the national Security Council on how to respond to Russia's efforts to spread false information during the invasion of Ukraine
Is not a question in my mind of whether it's going to happen it is a crushing only of when and how large
The government and America's intelligence agencies have traditionally been more capable in tracking cyberattacks and espionage
But the Russian online influence operations during the twenty sixteen elections were done All right there in the open something that caught American spies and law enforcement off guard here's Victoria Nuland a top State Department official during the Russian interference campaign and twenty sixteen testifying before Congress
There was a tendency in the U.S intelligence community to look only at classified information so we were as a government not as aware of what was happening in the private sector
Now Americans won't be caught off guard like they were then but we still need to Wade through the sludge of our online news environments and be smarter about the information we read and I'd just here's April ... who's the head of intelligence law at the national Security Agency that's been

So Kelly an episode three which for one theory about where the plan for robbing the Gardner was hatched at a Dorchester auto repair shop called T. R. C. auto electric
Yeah that's right T I C auto electric was a front for a thriving bustling criminal enterprise run by a gangster named Carmelo when Leno and he was involved in drug trafficking illegal weapons
You name it and uh we now from our reporting that the FBI from very early time is looking at Carmelo Anthony now and his gang for a variety of crimes including the possibility that they knew something about the electric car new museum heist
So Steve tell us more about Carmelo I'm really no
Well ... rooted this garage a but didn't spend much time fixing because um he was allegedly involved in the number of different bank ... who was heavily involved and cocaine dealing out of TLC and there was always the chatter about the Gardner Museum art theft

Yes in these tapes are a gold mine they're fascinating they were recorded from inside the confidential informants pants
And what you were hearing them is ... and the FBI informant Anthony Romano planning a heist on an armored car volt facility
The Louis Fargo facility in eastern Massachusetts and you hear the details that went into this planning every detail rings about if you're following the Gardner heist
Well let's listen to some of that tape the first person you're going to hear right now is the FBI informant Anthony Romano and then Carmelo Marlina
