The three point seven percent unemployment rate in September is the lowest since December of Nineteen sixty nine that was during the Vietnam War when many potential workers were out of the workforce fighting in Southeast Asia
Today's labor market is tied for other reasons a very strong economy has boosted demand for workers and the retirement of the baby boom is slowing growth in the workforce
Employers added only a hundred and thirty four thousand new jobs in September and that's the smallest monthly gain in a year it may be an indication of the scarcity of potential workers it's also possible Hurricane Florence reduced employment temporarily in some industries John Ydstie NPR News Washington

Well for columns of massive it's a it's a no win situation for either one of them
They're Collins votes no on Kavanaugh she can expect the primary on on her right if you will just on Kavanaugh so you can expect the primary on her left him in Maine which is a very independent state in the same with Joe mentioned if you vote yes and ... votes to

You know me that devastated Indonesia gathered outside crumbled mosques and on the beach with is an army hit for friday prayers today the disaster a week ago today killed more than Fifteen hundred people that number's going to rise
You've probably been listening to NPR international correspondent Julie McCarthy who's made it to the city of ... on the island is through the less out one of the hardest hit areas Julie what are you seeing
It's extremely dark here but there are a few street lamps on most of the houses appear to be deserted
Very few lights are on um gas stations are indeed open there are lines but earlier that kind of harried
Jammed crushed that's just not there I also thought earth movers for the first time at the Roma yawn a shopping mall you remember that was this huge shopping mall that was destroyed in the disaster but I have to say Robin there is no mass government mobilization
One week later that is absent this is a do it yourself affair I'm full of good Samaritans
Yeah and and in the areas that have been devastated I mean the pictures just ... you know we almost get numb to these pictures of toppled homes and buckle roads and smashed cars in body bags um but you know what how do you take that and
You know you you take it in with personal stories of people
You take it in with the man who sits and described to you and he's had with a far off looking as I
Um this complete conflict that he has inside his his self
That he ... that that he survived but at what cost he kept saying things like
It you you may think we were selfish when we just ran um because their loved ones were left behind in in in his case he left the father behind he said he was he was praying in his house he said we had seconds to
To get out um and they were luckily on the street she looked up germs or saw wall of water coming at them
And just ran its you know in some ways it's it's so serendipitous and miraculous that people survive these these sorts of events because this this uh sue nominee is coming at them like a locomotive and it's just building steam and it's building height and so I think it's a the
Personal stories um of of people who whose lives are completely shattered you know there are thousands tens of thousands of people whose livelihood has been destroyed
The economics of this city robbing are simply not an up and going concern right now yeah and the vice president said it's going to take two years for that to happen
I think by the look of it it will take much longer but you know this question but what does it look like there are you you you would be forgiven if you drove through and thought ah some areas the Joe Joe through some areas and said well there are there what could possibly have gone wrong here
And other areas that are completely
On on recognizable
For example a church moved and entire over and over a mile it was moved by the churning earth below it
In one area I'm ... a vast expanse set on swamp land it must be said was part of this churning of the earth someone called it said the ground was like a blender the earthquake was like a blender just gobbling up houses and its weight then you don't know
How many people are are are are lying beneath that that mountain mountain of mud is what I saw and so that will take a long time to do on earth and they don't have the equipment here to do it yet
And that is part of the mystery of this place I mean it's really not knowing how many people perished
Now we know a French rescuers were very frustrated they thought that with their equipment they heard signs of life under a four star hotel the collapse now they're thinking that that might have been a gas leak or something that they the there is no life there that you mentioned the lack of coordinated government response
So yeah long term recovery but what about you know tomorrow to people have food do they have water
They don't have food they don't have water there are scrounging for it and they're begging borrowing it
On there are people coming in from the outside driving for hours to deliver aid
Um that said what you had
A sort of amassing a at a ... among the big aid effort the ramped up aid effort the Japanese the um the um the New Zealand or is um and the Indians have
Have on the ground here evidently of hundreds of tons of supplies they're just not getting here you don't see evidence of it there was no running water electricity is extremely spotty um gasoline again extremely spotty and people who get it are leaving
NPR international correspondent Julie McCarthy in Palo Indonesia and the
... ... it was also a donkey now Julie thank you so much
Thank you Robin well the United states is not the only country dealing with political polarization Sunday's election in Brazil is expected to be the country's most polarized vote in decades
There's widespread distrust among the electric because a record number of lawmakers have been caught up in a massive corruption scandal polls show that's driving voters too far left and far right candidate joining us now from Rio de Janeiro is Tim francs or the BBC Tim
Or what's at stake in this election in Brazil
Well for a lot of people do say that democracy is at stake and the reason they will say that
Particularly opponents of the man who is leading the presidential campaign including the opinion polls that they said because he ... he's a fall right congressman who's
The sort of sprung from ... ah he's a threat to the Democratic norms are in Brazil and this is just says he is remember from when there was a middle tree dictatorship here so will vote democracy is vibrancy in this country
That people don't take it for granted equally supporters of Mr ... and already said that they are the ones who are going to rescue Brazil's from the clutches of the people who have been responsible for a surge in crime a surgeon corruption and the worst recession
That the country has ever experience so they say that
You know Brazil is on the mortal threat if the left gas and hence Europe's the rights to about ... but also the language people use about what is at stake in this election could not be more fruit
And we should also remember that two of the last few presidents or one of them is in jail right now the other was forced out of office
Yeah and that is ... under pins are a lot of the opposition to the main challenges to this fall right presidential candidates because the work is policy the P. T. to give it it's a Portuguese accident
They would impact she hasn't been she's two thousand and six team
And I only watch the largest corruption scandal that Brazil is that a theme and in fact these mashed much of Latin America at two groups
And ... presidents of messier Lula da Silva who was a two term president in Brazil or the P. C. had
Been hoping to feel the same as the candidate in this election
But he was sentenced to twelve years in jail for corruption of the year and so they put up put this all the men and onto a dodgy who ... more colors a lot less charismatic and he's funny difficulties is the second in the opinion polls at the moment but he's funny difficult
To punch through against the
The brush populism of ...
Or people excited about this election or some people not even gonna bother to vote because of all this other
Thing is I like to be honest I think people are on tens of hooks about this election and I think a lot of people
A feeling that so she's a state so polarized so the choices facing them but they really have to choose the apathy isn't
Isn't an option and I think one of the key things that you have to remember
Here is that although an awful lot of people do feel visual ... is misogynistic racist homophobic a man in the past to to warmly about dictatorship or even about those who
Tortured and killed for the state's
Loss of people feel very strongly that the workers policy has had eight shops in Brazil and on their watch

Protesters clamoring in Washington is Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court cleared a major procedural hurdle today in the Senate a final vote on his confirmation is expected tomorrow let's bring in NPR's Brakkton Booker who's been talking with people outside the Capitol today Brakkton we can hear some protesters in the ...
I mean well this crowd has dwindled updated since the ... ... a little while ago but they're still about two hundred or so people some holding signs that read stop Kavanaugh and others that are said to lead the survivors
Are and they come back tomorrow but I can tell you the crowds will not as big as the word yesterday it was just trying to figure out why but these are some of the most fervent supporters uh of senators who tried to convince to vote against the cabinet nominations
Are there are people they're supporting Kevin
There are some I Would say a handful of
On one hand the not if you saw the worst in support of Kavanaugh from one
Person who actually describe yourself as an independent I talked to him in front of the Supreme Court he said he was there to to push back on this
Circus like atmosphere those are his words a that surrounded the nomination of of cat and he's saying that the Democrats have brought it on themselves and that they they made a spectacle out of the nomination process
There was another gentleman I met a since he was a member of the n._r._a. and was really there
To show support for in our area but he said that he went to West Virginia and a couple of weeks wanting mentioned to do the right thing which in this case was to go to a vote a yes vote for half
An hour and we still don't know what I mentioned is going to do tomorrow in that final vote how far have people traveled to get to Washington
So we've met people from uh from Illinois we vet people from Denver ah we've met people from all from Michigan we've done the furthest I think we've heard for those that someone has traveled or group of people that have trouble is from Alaska from Anchorage
Event uh some folks that were part of a hundred women that that traveled from English to try to get in front of a Senator Lisa Murkowski
Or to try to influence her vote they said uh there was a group of a number of them that with her yesterday and ah they were trying to make sure that she was a no vote which she ended up doing in this cloture vote again it may be seeing which is going to do tomorrow
Well just briefly for act in a lot of ah protesters have made their way into the capital to try to have their voices heard by senators are getting into elevators et cetera what kind of access or protesters getting inside the Capitol just briefly
Yes they're they're still getting in I have not been inside the Capitol today but they're not being impeded by by Capitol police to get in on this process is going to continue throughout the day and and you can probably see that happen tomorrow as well
Right That's NPR's Brakkton Booker outside the capital back and thank you thank you well it's we continue to follow everything
With Brett Kavanaugh at the U.S Capitol today a number of Senate races
Are in the balance with four weeks or so to go until election day let's get to our Senate tracker series this week we're looking at the race in Nevada where Republican senator Dean Heller is facing a challenge from democratic congresswoman Jacky Rosen joining us now from Las Vegas is Joe Shannon host and senior producer at Nevada public radio Hi Joe
Hey how you doing doing well and let's start with the Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen a relative newcomer to politics compared to tell her she was president of her synagogue before Democrats are back in twenty sixteen tapped her to run for Congress where she is serving her first term what else should we know about her
Oh just a quick uh bio she's sixty one she's the mother of a college aged daughter her husband's a radiologist she lives in Henderson which is a city adjacent to Vegas and she moved here from the Midwest after her parents moved here this was back in college
She was a waitress at Caesar's Palace she had a degree from a community college became a computer programmer and then she got on to the national scene really by surprise
When former Senate majority leader Harry Reid asked her to run for the house which she won and twenty sixteen meeting Danny Tarkanian in a really close race
And we remember that Harry Reid represented the state of Nevada let's listen to one of the ads from Jackie resident that's airing on TV just kind of going on the offensive here it opens up with a shot of one of those inflatable Gombe type things you see outside a car dealership blowing in the wind and then she equate that to Dean Heller
Calling senators mindless because Dean Heller beds with the political when first promising to vote against the plan to repeal Obamacare because it would hurt in Nevada Dean Heller from Nevada is a no
I'm telling you right now I suppose we should legislation to ensure the way from ... Americans who played hundreds of thousands but but
Then Dean Heller got pressure from his party leaders
From President Trump loud and clear this was the one we were worried about you were there but you're going to be hell or
Just promise and voted for repeal deciding vote just or how
How big of an issue is that slip by Dean Heller
It's a pretty big issue in those ads have seemed to be making a quite a mark here
About a year ago maybe a little bit more Heller initially at the start of the summer said no he was for keeping Obamacare or the Affordable CARE Act
And then he changed his tune and it was such a huge change the Nevada house representative mark ... who is also a Republican was quoted as saying hey it's pretty clear you change your mind you probably ought to tell people why
Not just for the record neither ... nor his campaign has ever agreed to come on our program to talk about that or any other issue
Or what about Dean Heller um here's one of his ads
I don't have time for politicians talk but don't deliver not telling me what
You're going to you and just do it
Again and get things done forty pieces of legislation to help our veterans parties to pass a balanced plan
Delivered to the actual name Heller is our voice our
Our boys and
Interesting to note that all the people speaking of that ad are women
Yeah that really really stand out look I I don't trust falls but by the late a CNN poll of less than a week ago he's losing big with women women preferred Jacky Rosen my fourteenth points over Heller fifty two to thirty eight percent that's a huge drop from the summer when ... was at about fifty percent with women
[noise] what else do we know about ... other than the fact that he sort of straddling between supporting his party and you know voting against his party occasionally
Yeah now that's really the kind of become a central issue although he ... until this race he was a modest not quite a centrist but just sort of you know he would always vote unreliable issues against Yucca Mountain for instance um
This is the nuclear waste site in Nevada
Yeah about Ninety miles north of here there's a mountain where they want to store the nuclear waste or for the country
Or the health care issue he seemed reliably sort of in the middle it's sort of when I'm Sheldon Adelson the billionaire a got involved he's been called a peacemaker by the New York times he he called Heller and and and said you know uh don't opposed Trump on this
Um that's what the hell are seem to change his vote and um they adolescence in turn have given to his campaign war chest
Is adults in a huge player still in Nevada politics
Huge huge player he's worth tens of billions of dollars maybe the most maybe the richest man in the world um oh yeah he's front and center you need him on your side in order to hold office there [noise] you know this this will be the ... election to see if that is the is the case
[noise] ah any sense of how the cabinet or a nomination fight is playing with voters in Nevada
... said that sexual assault allegation against Brett Kavanaugh was a checkup it did explode across the social media landscape here um
And and of course that CNN poll I just talked about showed a huge drop with women supporters for Heller but I haven't seen a poll asking a direct question of how women feel about Heller in the aftermath of the Capitol hearing what
Would you say is the biggest issue for voters in Nevada this November
This election is I think it's not the heart and soul of Nevada I Do think President Trump will be on the minds of voters Democrats Republicans everything when they go to the polls because through his words his tweets his actions he has made politics about values

From NPR and WVU I'm Robyn Young
I'm Jeremy ... in Washington today it's here and now Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court got enough support to advance to a final floor vote it could happen as soon as tomorrow today's procedural vote was fifty one to forty nine a key swing states
Unless something big changes and Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no today St Brett Kavanaugh is a good man but not the right man for the court at this time
Joining us now is NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg Hi Nina high so where do we stand right now with the remaining swing senators Joe Manchin the Democrat and Susan Collins Republican
Well Susan Collins says she's going to announce her
Intentions on the final vote that she'll do that in a speech on the floor later today a Joe mansion voted to advance the
The nomination to vote and we don't know how he's going to vote and we don't know whether he's conferring with a senator Collins and or and endorse Senator Flake who is also voted the Republican who also had voted to advance
The nomination but still could vote against it although I think the odds of that are very very slim um I think this is you know this is still a bit up in the air but yet to be determined
And does the edge go to Kevin gets confirmed or Kevin doesn't get confirmed that this for do you think
The edge goes to Kavanaugh gets confirmed because usually when you vote to end debate a that means you're going to
Vote for the nominee but not always um as as a demonic online denaro pointed out just a couple of hours ago Susan Collins did this on the Betsy device nomination she was on the committee overseeing that nomination she voted to advance it to the floor
And to ... to ... to ... go to a vote on the floor and then she voted against the nomination
Listen to some of what we've heard today this is Chuck Grassley the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee speaking this morning on the Senate for before that vote
On pleases or judge Kavanaugh's confirmation I'm Sorry for what the whole family went through the last several weeks we should all admire
Kevin always willing to serve his country despite the way he's been prevented it would be a travesty then if the Senate did knock them from the most qualified nomination in our nation's history
And then here is Dianne Feinstein the ranking democratic member of the Judiciary Committee speaking today on the center for
Word hair to determine whether judge Kavanaugh has demonstrated the impartiality the temperament the even handedness that's needed to serve on this great high court of our land
If confirmed he will join eight other individuals who are charged with deciding how the laws of our land are interpreted and apply he would be a deciding vote on the most important issues affecting our country

Republican of Utah even sending a head shot hoping to make a guest appearance [laughter] do you think it could have crossover appeal today or are they even making an effort no
[laughter] in one word or you know I spoke to the show's creator and show runner Diane English in LA in July
And basically she told me she didn't think there would be a show 'em there would be a revival uh if if Trump hadn't been elected president
Um she was a how supportive of Hillary Clinton ran a pack um that was connected to her before the election had a huge party at our house ah
Ah for the election and had like two hundred bottles of champagne that she couldn't open when a Hillary Clinton didn't win and so uh seeing how they affect the Trump has had on politics on media especially ah she's got this show that features these people were supposed to be top journalist
So of course pushing back against that has become one of the major themes in the revival of of Murphy Brown
And because she's so close to Hillary Clinton of course she uh she got the former secretary of state to actually make an appearance on the show so we've got a clip of that or let's
Let's let's check and I also assume you've had previous secretary ... for four years I was a secretary I was a secretary at a very large organization [noise]

I I Do have some experience with it
Do you wonder if you're running as something again I get out [laughter]
No I doubt it I don't think they would have brought up emails [laughter] at any rate um it ... you know Hillary Clinton has been having some fun she was she's also appeared in a an episode of a Madam Secretary that trauma
Um alongside and Colin Powell and I'm I'm a ... and uh other political so I'm ... this show has been very much about pushing back against Trump ism the Murphy Brown revival
And I'm In an in an episode um that just stared you know she sneaks into the White House briefing room and sort of pushes back against some of the things they do so this shows very much about pushing back against Trump ism and pushing back against the monitor shape but the GOP so it it is not a bipartisan
That the original Murphy Brown went to war with Dan Quayle remember him a in a real life needs fiction moment during the Nineteen Ninety two presidential
Election Quayle made of family values speech where he criticized the character Murphy Brown for having a child outside of marriage then the character Murphy round responded to wells criticisms in the show and now it seems like the show is trying to manufacture that same dynamic with President Trump
Yeah there there's a a there was a scene towards the end of the first episode of the revival where Trump was supposedly watching these fictional uh news characters on the air and tweeting about them and then they were reading the tweets and responding to him I think we have [noise]
Murphy you hit me hit back in time harder oh you were
Wearing a hat on [noise]
So of course a reference to wear a Murphy actually a delivered a very effective response to Dan Quayle back in the heyday of the show
I think it was interesting to me I'm a you know I had mixed feelings about this a revival I I didn't I found some of the humor to be I'm kind of old fashioned
And in some of the speech fined by the Murphy Brown character to be kind of a diabetic
And in your face in a way that that uh that wasn't necessarily entertaining and and this bit at the end of the first episode of the revival felt like wishful thinking in a way like like you like you you like it kind of wish the show I'm ... these people making a kind of wish to show would be impactful enough
That Donald Trump would actually watch it in sort of tweet at them
A while I was going on so uh so they actually made it happen within the confines of the show but um what's really happening is that there are so many people that had been saying things like this for so long on TV including most of the late night comedians that we have you know Stephen ... Jimmy Kimmel and
Ah Trevor Noah that it doesn't really feel like Murphy Brown is saying anything new um when when the show was originally doing this kind of commentary uh it's still different because there weren't a lot of shows that we're talking this way and there weren't a lot of sitcoms that were caught talking very directly about things that were happening in the world
Now all of that has changed and I think his left Murphy Brown feeling a little out of step with the times
Well what about the idea also that this is yet another TV network show that is going for the ... factor and bringing back something that was there before
Yeah um I mean in a way this could feel like a like a step too far or some some of the other ... boots I'm from the way the viewers responded to them you had a sense that there was sort of a a pent up demand amongst fans when Roseanne came back
Whatever you think of stars and bars politics um there's the audience responded by paying attention to the show and you had a sense that
Uh fans had kind of missed it and and with will and grace on NBC that revival the same thing now CBS is a little different CBS has done a lot of revivals of shows that are sort of thinly veiled a revival is you know they have a magnum PI they have swat they have mcgyver
And all of these are just kind of an excuse to take really predictable and run of the mill a procedural adventure stories and and and slapped living near the show a over it so
I'm a you know those have been under the radar in a way to get decent ratings but they're not the kind of phenomenon that will and grace
And um and and Roseanne where I think CBS was trying to do that kind of phenomenon with Murphy Brown but the show hadn't been in syndication for a long time so I you know I don't think a lot of younger people we're all familiar with the show and because the the the revised version of it
Um it's still a little awkward and kind of old school I think it's going to have a hard time finding new fans
NPR TV critic Eric Deggans thank you thank you
Any gang top story today the Senate advancing vet Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination to a final vote tomorrow
But the allegations of drinking and sexual misconduct lied I cannot have prompted soul searching at the kinds of elite prep school he attended ... decades ago colleges have been taking a hard look at how they may have committed a culture of drinking and sexual misconduct most had changed
That's NPR's Tovia Smith reports some say there's still a ways to go to many alumni of elite prep schools the picture Christine Blasey Ford painted the drunken debauchery she encountered as a student is painfully familiar
I was deeply shaken and I just posted as anybody else having these really bad memories come up
Alexandra let's God's graduated from the national cathedral school in Nineteen eighty eight with many memories she wishes she could forget
There was a drunk girl in a room um and there was a boy in there with her and there were other boys lined up outside the door and my friend recalls hearing I'm next time next
It was such a toxic culture of power and privilege she says many guys didn't even try to hide it in schools knew how bad it was in Nineteen Ninety to Washington Post reported that seven of them including Georgetown Prep work Kavanaugh went
Centered joint warning to parents about the excessive drinking and sex ed unsupervised parties
They called it a recipe for disaster Georgetown Prep the current president declined to comment but in a recent letter to parents he vowed to reevaluate school culture and to quote work with the guys on respect for women John Paul free is headed school at Philips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts
This has been a call to every educator I think and I think any school that isn't some gauge to him soul searching who's making a mistake
Schools have already changed dramatically since the eighties toll free says driven by evolving attitudes and society at large stand by a student body that's no longer so exclusively the privileged and powerful and he says students are now schools on what he calls a culture of consent and respect
It is changing but it's still a problem on campuses and I certainly can't say that we are out of the woods yet
Then did just three years ago saying all the school in D.C had to ... college yearbooks after discovering seniors at the elite all boys school had included crude and success slurs
That's way too recent this is very disturbing

This is here and now the unemployment rate fell to three point seven percent in September of the lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine that's according to the Labor Department which also reported today that us employers added a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs last month
Michael Reagan a senior editor at Bloomberg News he joins us now Mike Hi Germany well let's start with the number of jobs added a hundred and thirty four thousand that was actually below expectations but continues a long long long streak of job growth tell us more about what we learned in the report today well rate as you mentioned
It was below estimates are the economists in ah the Bloomberg survey had forecast about a hundred and eighty five thousand jobs so this is about fifty thousand below that but it's a very tough month
To get right because of Hurricane Florence um ... you know a lot of companies
That might have been planning to hire would postpone it and a lot of companies were just you know more or less laying people off temporarily because of the weather so they're actually about three hundred thousand people a away from work to do the bad weather
So it's you know most economists are kind of looking past that disappointment in the number of jobs added due to the weather
Um and it just assuming that the same trends we'd seen of of pretty healthy job growth a is still intact
And what about that unemployment rate the lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine [noise]
Absolutely yeah and uh you know Larry Kudlow today saying he he wouldn't be surprised to see it go even further I mean it just goes to a show as you said this economic recovery is still ongoing um since two thousand and ten or ... the nation is out of jobs every single month Ninety six months straight
Um and it just does not show any signs of slowing down at the moment
When we were just talking this week about the fact that companies are having a hard time finding seasonal workers for the holidays because the unemployment rate is so low people are able to get
Jobs I this is totally anecdotal but I was at a coffee shop this morning huge line not nearly enough people are are ... are we at the point now where the issue is that companies just can't find enough people that want the jobs
I you know to to give you an addict do to my own I just noticed that a lot of my friends nannies are are quitting because the employment prospects for them or are good so what does it all




























The president's ah words kind of quitting after Franklin was accused of inappropriate behavior ... that many felt was kind of minor compared to some of the the accusations we've been hearing about it to me to move and but Franken pulled himself ... Arab politics ... the president seemed to be saying he was kind of a a coward for that
Yeah it was it was an interesting point that he made I'm Still sort of sorting through what he was getting out because on one hand he said you know Franken was kind of a wet rag he he took responsibility for what he was doing and he left office of course under great pressure from his own party let's not forget that
And this has been set against the backdrop of what's happening in Washington ... today which is this you know big discussion about whether judge Brett cabinet will be confirmed for the Supreme Court and whether I'm taking responsibility for his actions
But of course keep in mind that when Frank and laughed we you know the governor here appointed a Democrat to take his place he's now running for reelection and it's effectively opened up a potential seat for Republicans so on one hand he's criticizing it seemed ... Franken for leaving so quickly but on the other hand it's presented in opportunity for head ... the most fascinating
But how is the whole cabinet debate impacting of it is this race or is it just falling along party lines
[noise] you know I think generally it's falling along party lines when I spoke to people who are waiting to get into the rally yesterday this is something I asked them about all of them said you know we want him to talk about judge Cavanaugh we support judge cabinet but what was sort of weird was that people said you know we believe that something bad

A possibly lost nearly a billion dollars
A vendor David Cay Johnston of the tax reporter I used to work for the times of teen to some tax documents two thousand five showing you've profited a hundred and fifty million and they're seeing what happened in the decade
Or between that time that went made him swing from a billion dollar loss two hundred and fifty million dollars remember one of the key facts
Documents over the years in ways in which uh you know a presidential nominees of both parties have done for over forty years
And so the times said let's try to solve that and it was able to go back and find a number of ways in which you know what they ... they were essentially tax Dodgers of of questionable legality
Including three ... essentially a shell company called the ... county building supply and maintenance which Fred Trump would buy is equipment from but allow the kids to charge 'em a huge markup of for the equipment
That the White House has dismissed this report but hasn't denied any of its claims President Trump called it a hit piece on Twitter where's this go from here
[noise] well you've seen some interesting action of the New York State Department at that ... of taxation has said that it's going to review a number of the allegations are and and claims made in this article one of the things that makes it so impressive as they include links to all kinds of original documentation so that readers can evaluate for themselves
You know the basis on which that they're making these that reporting a and
You know we will see whether or not this becomes an issue as as Democrats are looked to find ways to take advantage of the unpopularity of the president's taxes she you could imagine that coming back into play as well but this is a huge blockbuster of a story that takes a lot of time to absorb and to understand
And I think you know one real question will be whether or not the Democrats take over the house of representatives and seek to use this as a hammer against the president tried to force or the release of his tax documents
Do you expect other news organizations will put this kind of energy and effort into stories like this are given the reaction that the New York times has gotten
Well and we don't know that they're not uh you know this was something that according to the times has taken effectively at Eighteen months and that they had a well over a hundred ... a thousand pages of documents to review to make this happen several top reporters meant a lot of time on this as well as
Editors and and other researchers and others on it it's incredible devotion of resources but yes when asked to hope that we're looking at things part of the reason the time just doing this as as I said those documents weren't released
And so it's kind of accountability being performed it's also the kinds of forty one which had been able to be done uh during the election season voters are interested in this stuff [noise] question is whether it's still lingers in twenty twenty a very interesting insight into our president and the mythology he wrapped himself in ... ran for office

Do not not a unusually in the United states or other other countries have done it Russia does it um I think it's a little different than what we think of as a little bit to the more subtle
Or election interference that for example Russia has been accused of again a Pence alluded to more covert action smoke more hidden hand actions he didn't spell out what those might be a this this whole conversation about election interference by China was part of a
Broader indictment of what is described as China's growing power and assertiveness both economically and militarily around the world
But you mentioned Russia and I you know some eyebrows have been raised about the White House being so vocal about China
Without the kind of definitive proof of let's say hacking which several government agencies have of of what Russia did and the White House has not been in all local about Russia where there is that proves and some have said that this is a way to sort of
Set up a before the midterms why if the Trump Administration doesn't do well or or you know Republicans don't do well it will be because of the Chinese
[laughter] doing in other words what the president has accused the Democrats have doing he's sixteen election of ... I Will say that uh the the vice president did cite one instance of the hacking attack a computer attack on the Hudson Institute itself the host of his speech today after that Institute
A invited a speaker that China was not in favor of so there was some discussion here of cyber attacks yeah
Look at your damage speech very briefly the vice president reached out to China do you think Beijing how will baking react very briefly
I think Beijing is
Concerned about the aggressive posture that this administration has taken towards China whether we're talking about militarily whether we're talking about the trade posture a and I I think the sort of rhetorical open hand that Pence extended will be overshadowed
By the much more aggressive telling the most of the speech and he'll have caused by Scott Horsley thank you You're welcome itching

This year and now retailers prepping for the holidays got some good news this week the national Retail Federation expects holiday spending to increase by run four to five percent because of destroying the economy but
There's a downside the low unemployment rate will make it very hard for stores to find seasonal workers
... senior innovation reporter at W. B. or he joins us now account hijacked and tell us more about how much people are supposed to spend this year how much they're expected to spend this year and how that lines up with pastures
So the projection is about seven hundred and twenty billion dollars in November and December and that excludes cars and gas and spending at restaurants are really just sort of those gifts around the holidays that would be about thirty billion dollars more than last year and just for perspective a spending usually does grow year over year but the
Average growth rate in recent years has been about three point nine percent so somewhere between four and five would be above average
And how does that line up with the fact that we've talked about mall vacancies being at high levels about big department stores having problems like Macy's
Right so the trend is undeniable I'm In Cyber Monday last year was the biggest online shopping day in history and meanwhile the foot traffic and brick and mortar stores on Black Friday was down by two percent so I think the overall spending increased can help the retailers to do both and I think one really interesting experiment this year
Is way fair the online furniture retail or they are experimenting with temporary
Brick and mortar locations in those shopping malls but interestingly they would just be showrooms you can actually buy them there you see them in the physical space in that order on
Lives of the ... model of where you can go and try things on but you have to actually go on line to buy it um what about this idea that it's hard for these places to attract seasonal workers
Quite so we just saw a Amazon a couple of days suits could increase minimum pay the Fifteen dollar an hour and that increasing it looks like it will be the norm this holiday season the market research firm weak field of research published a survey last week of a thousand retailers
And report the average hourly wage this holiday season is going to be Fifteen dollars and forty cents and that's a big jump from an average eleven in Seventy cents last year
And the minimum wage just above seven dollars an hour a nationally what about the trade war and terrorists is that going to have an impact on how much we're spending on get sick
Tariffs are has an estimated what the overall impact will be but of course we've been hearing for months from businesses saying that the ... or the tariffs are especially on Chinese imports could make their costs to go up and therefore they would have to pass those along to consumers one
More thing or kill them big economic news today and probably driving the markets lower today is that we found that the yield on ten year treasury notes US government bonds reached its highest level since ... eleven what's going on here
Right so it was up to about three point two percent that's the highest in ... eleven as you said this is another sign of confidence in the U.S economy hard to know exactly what goes on and investors' minds but of course they're weighing the risks versus reward and the treasury notes considered very
Safe investment that's why the interest rate is typically lower than what you might be able to get into riskier stock market
But if that interest rate takes up a little bit maybe people don't want to take so much risk in the stock market
And maybe mortgage rates and other things also start to pick up even more ... of WB or thank you so much with your

R. we know you care about WB you are you're listening to it right now you care about here and now having that midday news program in there to keep you informed keep you up to date

Because we have this flash match that five dollars a month a which turns into sixty dollars over the course of the year is now going to turn into Ninety dollars make your money go further for the news it's the smart thing to do one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight center
Down to less than Eighteen minutes left on this fifty percent match the slash matches Emory called it and remember whatever you give whenever you give
You'll be entered into when this brand new twenty Nineteen Subaru from city sides Subaru in Belmont this is really a a probably at this point this is the best chance you're going to have this is going to be the best time left in this fundraiser for you to pledge so why not pledge right now when your money can go the farthest it can do the most good
Why not do it right now this is again you know we we keep harping on this but this is really you know this is how we are able to bring you so much of the news and the program that you count on
Listeners support is a huge part of our budget it's one of the largest parts of our budget and we can't do it without people like you it doesn't take a lot you can do the five dollars a month like Henry said it could be ten dollars a month
It can be Fifteen dollars a month if you can go higher we do appreciate it so much but the beauty of this is a lot of people giving doing their part and helping us reach our goals as a community
One eight hundred nine zero nine
Nine to eight seven or W. B. U. R. dot org and this is what these fundraisers are really about it's about everybody doing their part and when we have these fifty percent matches that like we have on the table right now for the next twenty or so minutes
For the coal industry so if Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court he could be ruling on this case if if it goes that far
Exactly you know and and his whole record or on the DC circuit has been somewhat skeptical of high costs regulations
Um he specifically looked at co benefits the the pollutants that happened to be reduced from a regulation yeah he he didn't believe it should be counted which would have made it a and not cost effective regulation
So those are two major rule changes that the Trump Administration is considering but there are many more uh I'm seen um the industry is getting a big win on a mess
Those are are you watching here
Yeah so the administration has on sort of a a big a regulatory rollback streak in these last couple of months
UPA is working on a repealing Obama's administration standards to reduce methane emissions from oil and natural gas drilling that said potent greenhouse gas hum button so many corners of this ah masturbation on environmental policy either
Robots coming I'm you know the clean Power Plan limiting carbon dioxide pollution from power plants the clean water rule um you know so so many other a regulation left and right that in these last couple of months are moving towards either repeal or significant roll back
Into who's behind all this because I'm sure that this is exactly what industry wants to see
Right a lot of these changes are driven by industry and I either because of previous litigation or lobbying or what have you ah for example Murray energy is one of the biggest coal mining companies in the United states its chief executive Bob Murray as strong support our President Trump
Um the current acting administrator of the EPA Andrew wheeler used to lobby for Murray energy um but also a lot of industry groups national mining association American Petroleum Institute and the like they are largely behind a lot of this but they're also things that the Republican Party and that the Trump Administration of support for a while
To him as a game of energy and environment reporter at the hill and thanks for taking the time to to speak with us about the ... and ... and Peter and you're listening to hear now [noise]

Yeah it really was and I think manager being exhibited kind of ... the Eighteenth century there's loads of
Newspaper articles and report and drawings of the things people were really into them and wanted them to exist I guess
And tell us about that why do they want them to just you know that the you know these were sailors who are coming home and sixteen Seventeen Eighteen centuries with talks of seeing these were maids out in the water they think now that it might have been optical illusions but why do people want so badly to believe that they existed

Good afternoon ... good afternoon it'd be good to have you and I'm I'm pleased to report that we did meet our goal for last hour but as he is the case in the news industry
You finished one deadline and of course another deadline comes along so now we have a new goal for this hour ten thousand dollars we need to raise by two o'clock to stay on track towards meeting
Are larger goal in this fall fundraiser which ends tomorrow here's how you can do your part here's how you can pledge to call one eight hundred nine so
Or you go right on line to W. B. U. R. dot org
And now is really the time to give because for the first half hour we have a fifty percent match from a generous group of listeners so if you're thinking about giving what you've been on the sidelines now's the time to step up and make your dollar go
Further maybe you've been thinking oh I can only give ten dollars a month and that's just a drop in the bucket well that ten dollars just to stop our becomes Fifteen dollars a month in effect because of this generous match and you can trigger that match by calling one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or giving my line of WB or dot org
Yeah ten dollars a month that will be matched or fifty percent for the first year so that one hundred twenty dollars over the course of the year that becomes a hundred eighty dollars and you know you might think well it's not a whole lot but that's how we pay for the news here ... it's not one person coming along
With a five hundred thousand dollar donation it's a bunch of little uh not little but normal people just like you or me and and making their pledge saying All right yeah you know I can I can pledge this ten dollars a month or I can do Fifteen dollars a month or I can do twenty dollars a month and that just slowly chipped away at the number
That we need in order to pay for the news and keep the news strong vibrant and most importantly independent one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or online at W. B. U. R. dot org
Independent really is the key word there were a number of what you're pledging for when you open up your wallet you know newsrooms across the country have had to trim down and cut a lot of recording jobs in recent years which means there aren't as many ways for you to get the information that you rely on to make informed decisions as a voter
That's what we're able to continue to do at W. B. or an NPR but we're only able to do that because of the generosity of listeners like you
Were not about to get a call for a hundred thousand dollars we're not about to get a call for fifty thousand dollars if you can call
And pledged that amount and we say thank you so much and now would be the time to do it because only twenty two minutes left on this match that matches only in effect for twenty two minutes after that your money will go back to normal so if you've been waiting to make a larger donation let's say a hundred dollars two hundred dollars
Maybe a thousand dollars or five thousand dollars now is the time to do it because your money will go fifty percent farther but only when you make that pledge now in the next
Twenty minutes or so so make that pledge now give us a call one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven you can go online to W. B. U. R. dot org and pledge right there remember whatever you pledge whenever you fledged today you'll be entered into wind is brand new

A fifty percent match that's on the board it's in effect for another eight minutes or so but that means that you need to call now to make your money go fifty percent farther when you a call and say let's say pledge a hundred dollars that means in a generous group of listeners are going to pledge an extra fifty dollars to go along
It's going to be a great way for us to raise a good chunk of the money that we need here this hour eight thousand dollars we need to raise by two o'clock in order to stay on target towards our larger goal of ending this fall fundraisers strong tomorrow here's how you can do it call one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or go on line the w._b. you are out of work
And what a great example of the community of listeners that we have here WB or it's a real privilege but not every station enjoys you know we are rely on our community for more than Ninety five percent of our funding that means we take only about four and a half percent
From the federal government and there are a lot of stations that need the corporation for public broadcasting to kick in a lot bigger share we don't have that in Boston and that allows us to be all the more independent because we rely on you to pay the bills to to take care of all the programs that you hear
Throughout the day on WB you are and here we have an opportunity to make that dollar go even farther turn your hundred dollar pledging to a hundred and fifty dollars or perhaps it's your ten dollar a month pledge becomes effectively Fifteen dollars a month but it's a limited time offer only to the bottom of the hour so now is really the time to give
A W. B. U. R. or by calling one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven
Yeah wherever you can give is worth fifty percent more right now but it's only in the next six and a half minutes so
So you really need to get on the guy a get out and get moving right now we're a little under the gun and that means you need to pledge right now if you want your money to go further and do the absolute most that they can hear a W. B. U. R. don't forget whatever you pledge right now you're going to be entered into when this brand new twenty Nineteen Subaru provided by city side Subaru in Belmont and maybe
You know maybe you're like me and I always you know assume when I entered these kinds of sweepstakes for these kinds of conflicts and like there's no way I'm going to where there's no way but you know what someone is going to win and I tell you what we actually caught up
With one woman who won one year this is Carol ... she's the w._b. you our listeners and she and her husband they actually they got an email from Julie in our membership department letting her know that she had one car just like one that you could when when you pledge right now
We came home to a message on the machine and sort of looked at one another and set on this has got to be a scam [laughter]
Julie it sent a matching email so then my checked and different things to be sure that she was telling us the truth ... gun in the forest or it was like oh this is at it this is a beautiful
We're regular donors to W. B. you are because we listen and we enjoyed the station so we just how many times do you make a donation that was one of the questions when max said to me
To do and did this contest and I had to admit I said I don't know because I was donating regularly not donating for the contest thanks to city side and you guys get the new guy [laughter] so that's
Carol Dolores she's the one who won a a a Subaru courtesy of city side Subaru and she mentioned there that she she was a regular donors she wasn't donating for the contest and that's an important thing uh to know is that when you become a monthly sustaining member of WB you are which means you ... you sent us you
Know five dollars ten dollars Fifteen dollars a month you get entered in for every single sweepstakes that we when you could win something without even knowing about it and we have had
Some amazing sweepstakes this this fund drive we've had
Trips to China trips to the Galapagos island trip to Tuscany in Italy these are all amazing sweepstakes that we offered generally pretty regularly as part of these fundraisers and these are all things that you can win by becoming a sustaining member even more importantly you want to become a sustaining member right now because for the next four minutes
Your money goes fifty percent farther once again one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or online that WVU are out of work
That's right the clock is ticking just a few minutes left to take advantage of this fifty percent match that we have from a generous group of listeners like you and we know that many of you were just like Carol who we just heard from you give any way you're not in it just for the thank you gift
But it is there is an opportunity and for others out there it's just that extra nudge the perhaps you need to get in off the sidelines perhaps you've been listening for many years you've been a long time
Fan of WB you are and you've been wondering is now the year for me to step up and open up my wallet even for a little bit and don't think that your ten dollars a month doesn't make a difference it absolutely does in any case and especially in the next couple of minutes when we have this fifty percent match let's take advantage of it uh W. B. Y. dot org or one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight
Yeah for the next four minutes or so your ten dollars a month becomes Fifteen dollars a month for the for the first year of your donation
Remember we still have a lot of money that we need to raise as part of this fundraiser eight thousand dollars we're trying to raise this hour eight thousand dollars that we need in order to keep ourselves on pace towards what we need as ... said you know every little bit helps because that's really the beauty of the fundraising model we have here WB you are it's not one person calling in
With a five thousand dollar pledge if you can do that right now that'd be great because that would pretty much wipe out our entire coal for this hour but you know if you can just be a hundred
Maybe ten Fifteen twenty dollars a month or whatever you can give every little bit really does make a difference when we're talking about the tens of thousands of people who have joined to support WB you are in the past you can do that right now my calling one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven are going online to W. B.
U. R. dot at work I can remember what you are giving for the the funds that we get from you are listening community is what allows us to maintain our independence to go hard charging after the truth uncovering facts that others don't have time to spend because they're so concerned about the bottom line what you give us is that ability to be independent and
To take on not only the daily breaking news you hear every day on MORNING edition and all things considered and those conversations you hear in the middle of the day on our talk programs but also those long term projects press you've been listening to last seen our latest podcast out
There was more than a year and the ... and we're able to undertake those kinds of projects through your generosity and it missed final couple of minutes and this half hour you're able to make that dollar stretch even farther the fifty percent match up until the bottom of the hour at one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven
We're down to six thousand dollars now we need to raise my one o'clock six thousand dollars were almost halfway there with about half
Of the hour left remember right now when you get give it's only about another two minutes or so right now your money goes fifty percent far this let's knock another thousand or two thousand or three thousand dollars right off that number right now WBRC here because people in the past have done
Their part said this is something that I Want to support that I Want to protect
Its here for you because the people in the past doing that now it's your turn to do that for someone in the future so they can discovered WB why they can discover the great programming here one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight
Seven but that's right no one is forced to give to NPR to W. B. or something people do voluntarily it's sort of an unusual business model if you think about it we give away the news for free
Every day and you're able to take advantage of that whether you give or not and yet you're only able to take advantage of it because of the generosity of others and some of you give individually regardless but we also have those generous underwriters and those communities your listeners that are giving even more to encourage people to get off whether it's suppose thank you gifts for the fifty
Now's the time to do your part one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or online at W. B. U. R. dot org
And it really does make a difference that we rely on the community for Ninety five plus percent of our funding it not only keeps us independent but it also maintains that perception
Of independence remember you've probably heard if you follow the news
People attack other news outlets for their ties to corporate owners and those attacks may be untrue sometimes but it's enough to plant a seed of doubt some folks mind and for you when you're listening to W. B. or an NPR you can do with total certainty
That we are independent of those kinds of influences and when you're having those conversations with your friends who may be even more skeptical of the news
Than yourself you can point to what you hear on WB or as air and know that they also see that reputation for credibility whereas they may have questions about others and that is part of what you're giving to protect its that credibility that reputation for independence at W. B. Y. dot org or one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven
I remember very early in my journalism career I had a an older journalist telling me he said the most important thing you have to do is avoid even the appearance of impropriety and all of your dealings everything that you do and I I think for the vast majority I Can't speak for everyone I can speak for myself you know
But I think here WB you are I think everyone subscribes to that idea and I think that's what makes WB you are
And public radio in general a really special place to work in a really special source for news because we don't have
Any kind of a you know outside influence on what we report to you it's I mean are outside influences you the public that's I mean it's right there in our name where public radio were by the public
Means we're also for the public but it also means that every now and then we have to come to you and ask you to do your part to help keep a strong independent and vibrant thirty nine hundred dollars now to raise my two o'clock we can definitely get their call one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or go on line and W. B. U. R. dot org
And we know that many of you would give regardless but we also want to say thank you and so when you call with a gift of even five dollars per month as our thank you give we'll give you a twenty five dollar gift card to Henry bears park

WVU our supporters include the cabin in Beverly friday ten time Grammy winners and vocal hall of famers the Manhattan Transfer standards and their new release the junction tickets at the Cabot dot org
[noise] it was a part about the last game that got me my nails ...
Sea Ford said in her testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee that the worst part of her alleged assault was the laughter from her to alleged attackers they were having a good time she said
At my expense my friend said when he heard that that was with through them that over half a century ago he was seven had gone to visit a cousin who moved to another state there were three other boys they're who immediately made the new kid their target
We're going to catch treat you they said and started chasing him he wasn't even sure what that meant but he ran they tackled him pin him down he said just like glassy Ford said she was held down a horrible feeling
But then his tour mentors pulled off his pants and with their fingernails began to try to carry out their threat while they left and my friends now well over sixty pretty strong decried if that memory
A lot of people have had memories triggered by the national debate in the past couple of weeks Brett Kavanaugh strongly denies that he assaulted lousy forward and many of his supporters are saying well they don't think he did it they believe someone else might have attacked for they believe that
And others do as well as you've no doubt heard hotlines are ringing off the hook with people identifying
The national sexual assault hotline reported busiest day in history last friday the day after the Judiciary Committee hearings with more than three thousand calls seven hundred and thirty eight percent increase
On a micro level at Chicago's rape crisis hotline calls tripled and ... heads the clinical program at the YWCA of metropolitan Chicago they run the city's hotline and all three of the city's rape crisis centers
She joined us from Chicago and welcome thank you Robin and what has it been like try to describe what the phones there have been like
It's been very busy so the day of the hearing we received about thirty calls which is a nearly doubled from the week prior and five times as many calls as two weeks ago for say on friday or calls were a little more than double from the weeks prior and we're continuing to see an increase call volume right what are people saying
We're hearing comments from survivors that similar to Dr Ford they're experiencing are we ... we had a caller tell us that they had their first flash back in three years after listening to Dr Ford's testimony we're hearing from male survivors that
The testimony validated their experience and they're still dealing with the impact
And we had another male caller tell us that he's experiencing intimacy issues as a result of childhood sexual assault um so the symptoms and stress reactions of the trauma are still with folks even decades later
When you say somebody at a flashback you know somebody might who hasn't had a physical flashback might think oh so they had a memory but you're talking about more than that
Yeah absolutely through a flashback is for a survivor
Or re experiencing of that traumatic event they feel as if
They're right back in that moment today if they feel their heart pounding ah they feel their thoughts race or they feel intense feelings of anxiety and it's like experiencing the trauma all over again and it's unexpected and a survivor can't necessarily tell what where when and how a flashback might be triggered
And my friend talked about the laughter that suddenly this you heard of demonic laughter floated back from his past
He also talked about being pin down and I had another friend telling me just imagine regardless of who might have been somebody larger than Fifteen year old girl with all his weight leaning on her putting his hand over her face more than likely covered both her mouth and nose
And this friend had me do that and I'm I ask anyone you know who can now do this and you can't breathe loves the Ford said she thought she was going to accidently be killed you know in other words this about sex didn't do people do people when they come for help or when they call for help do they talk about that aspect of it
Absolutely they're talking about all the details of of their trauma they're talking about
Is the feeling of being choked of being
Of being and mobilized of being frozen we know that when the experienced trauma our brain is going to react typically in one of three ways we are going to fight
We're going experience fried or we're going to fleet and was lousy Ford is reporting a in her testimony is that there was an aspect of being frozen as well less intense feeling of fear and we're hearing about as well from the survivors that we work with we usually
People have a flashback she's also explain dust that people called to say that they thought they were seeing Dr Ford you know a college professor ... presidency too and she was Fifteen and they did the same thing what does that mean
That means that their their body and brain their neurobiology literally takes them back to that moment and we know as we talked to survivors about their trauma narrative
They are able to define frequently what the worst part of that experience was and so it might be the worst part related to the the disclosure it might be the worst part related to the response of the alleged offender but we know that sort of ...
Of the way the trauma is stored in the brain to literally re presents themselves and re experience that trauma an incredibly intense way
Well some of us thought that she
Actually sounded Fifteen at times and I didn't know if that's what you meant that she was actually going back to that moment
That was certainly my a sense of her when she was testifying I wouldn't be able to speak to a what that was exactly like for her infant yes yes yeah look
The majority leader of the New Jersey state house an eighty year old the Retta Weinberg

Bette Davis President Reagan's daughter a revealed that she'd been raped by him using executive Chris Wallace of Fox News anchor went on the air to talk about how his two daughters confronted him to tell him that there were things happening in their high school that he didn't know
... you know it was happening to his daughters maybe not the full attacks that we've been hearing about but something very troubling to him so this has started this national conversation
But on the other hand Brett Kavanaugh as strongly denying that this happened Christine Blasey Ford is not believe a lot of people including it seems President Trump who initially said he found a credible but last night as you well know in a in a rally mocked her lips was new then

To inventions or scientific discoveries when they award these prizes and I think that's a terrific thing and this year I think they got it right
Last year the Nobel Prize in physics went to three scientists or who helped recognize the detection of gravitational waves are in space this year as you said it's for work using light what does it tell you about the research that's going on physics today
Interestingly of course the tool that we use to measure the gravitational waves uses lasers as the sensitive element to detect the gravity ways so
Um one way of looking at it is that the discovery last year was for real scientific discovery whereas the prize this year looks at an invention but I think the important point here is that this invention that's being rewarded this year is actually being used for basic science
All over the world uh and so this interplay between invention of a tool and the use of it for science you can't really a find a boundary between those two ideas but we do tend to distinctly a reward one or the other

This this year and now Republican Senator Jeff flake who positive vote in the Senate on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to make time for an FBI investigation said today he was troubled by the tone of Kavanaugh's remarks last Thursday
I Hope that I Would sound that ... if I were a if I felt that I was unjustly maligned but then it went on and the interaction with the members was sharp and partisan and that concerns me and I don't myself you give a little leeway
Because of what he's been through
But on the other hand we can't have this on the court we simply can't
Some senators are also raising concerns about what they believe to be misleading testimony from Kevin let's bring in the Washington Post Philip bump for more hyped up hello how are you doing well and first of all Kavanaugh said he had never attended a gathering like the one that Christine Blasey Ford describes in her allegation here's Kevin
Dr Ford's allegation is not merely uncorroborated it is refuted by the very people she says we're there including by a longtime friend of hers refuted
As you report that is misleading how so
Well it's misleading because it hinges very directly on what you mean when you say the the the sort of gathering that has been alleged by four right so we know for example according to Kavanaugh's owned counters
That the word got things like the ones that Ford alleges are gatherings with very particular people over the course of the summer of Ninety needed to win is when this allegedly occurred
And is relying on a lot of nuance intentionally I think are just sort of shield that sort of mass that he also
That's the the allegations refuted there weren't really refuted in the sense that he he seems to be hoping that people will assume
People who are gave statements about the alleged incidents so they didn't remember any such gathering there was one person mark judge who said that he never seem to have not acting the way that his alleged but no one said no this thing did not happen
You also point out that there's an event on July first in Kavanaugh's calendar that does fit the description that for gave
That's exactly right it does it does loosely I Will say that you know there is a one of the things that's important to note and one of the reasons I think this has become such a partisan fight is that there's a lot of gray area around a lot of this but yes that July first gathering specifically includes mark judge to Manchester for a guy named PJ ... Smith who a Ford says was there
A it includes drinking and it is on a weekday which Kavanaugh sort of tried to downplay the extent to which are his friends got together for beers on weekdays there all these ways in which a that event reinforces even if that wasn't the day on which
An incident had occurred it reinforces that such things did happen over the course of that summer
Which is something the cat and I went to great pains to deny
Kevin as your book has also become the focus of scrutiny this is Senator Sheldon Whitehouse reading from Kevin ... country
... view I don't know if it's booked are being ... how do you pronounce that
Our first of flatulence we were sixteen okay [noise]
And so when a your friend mark judge said the same put the same thing as your book page back to you at the same meaning it was ...
I don't know what he did but that's my recollection and we want to talk about flatulence ... age sixteen hundred year book page
On 'em game until about that's not what proved means well it's sort of unclear
What proved means in that context right I mean I I I'm not really a booth truth or if you will on this particular subject I mean there's you know in high school you have little terms that you use with your friends and and they can very pretty widely
But it seems pretty clear that the broader effort the Kavanaugh was undertaking there was two each time there was a pretty obvious a reference to drinking those maintenance of your book he tried to redirect away from the fact that they were talking about drinking heavily
You know he he said that the beach week routes club which is pretty obviously right a reference to him drinking Latin and vomiting was a function of him having a weak stomach so whatever the definition of booth is however it relates to drinking the fact is that the euro country makes very clear that drinking was a big part of his high school experience
And just by the way I mean of course it's crowd source but the Urban Dictionary says the move to reverse anal sex or this is Sheldon Whitehouse later talking with Kavanaugh about another term and is your book devil's triangle here is
Devil's triangle drinking game as of play three glasses in a triangle
And
Your plate quarters you know okay so ...
What about that one and again I'm going to refer to Urban Dictionary uh and it says now because of what's happened in the last few days that are the devil's triangle is made up game of quarters with three cups or engine to try and go the rules are unknown because the inventor of the game Brett Kavanaugh could not explain them under oath
[laughter] right so uh this is it again this is this is a bit of flying it's not really clear what the intended usage was at the time they are all sorts of uh of suggestions about it but one thing that I Will notice I went back and I looked at Google has the tools allows you to search a books that they have indexed I went back and look the contemporaneous news reports

This is here and now this week the Trump Administration announced that it had reached a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada a revision of NAFTA the north American free trade agreement
Joining us now to talk about that and more is Larry Summers the former secretary of the treasury under President Clinton former top economic advisor under President Obama and president emeritus of Harvard University Larry Summers walking back to her now
Glad to be with your Germany and let's start with this trade agreement the new U.S Mexico Canada trade agreement what do you think of it
Never seen so much ado about so little I thought the old trade regime between Canada and Mexico in the United states was a good one
And this one's not very different how it could possibly be worth ... alienation of major allies I Can't imagine these are relatively small changes
The vast majority of NAFTA is continuing
As it was this has been a major diversion from the important domestic challenges facing the United states and the important international challenges but I'm
Happy with the new agreement from simply because I was happy with the olden Raymond and I can't imagine why someone who was profoundly troubled by the old agreement should be happy with the new agreement
So this is more in the nature of a publicity stunt than an international diplomatic act
So when President Trump said this is proof that my strategy worked that I put pressure on Canada and Mexico and I got what I wanted and or dairy farmers are going to be in better shape now you say what

That's exactly right it was this unintentional lifestyle creep we originally moved into this little five hundred square foot apartment in this little beach town
And our our costs were much lower than and you know as we got older uh and we had a baby or you know some of our knees were were changing but also our tastes
You know we found ourselves eating out quite a bit we found ourselves up moving to a larger three bedroom apartment and you know we moved there when the recession was in full force but fast forward a couple of years and things were gaining steam and rents were going through the roof and you know I'll be honest it
My financial literacy wasn't in top shape at that time and so to hear that someone was that happy living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year as well so intriguing to me in the beginning
Well the other thing that happened is that your wife Taylor she looked at a retirement calculator
So uh once I started going down the rabbit hole and learning about some of these tactics and strategy
At the time my my heroes I implemented the retirement calculator kind of understand our situation and when I first plug the numbers into what current spending was
It looked like we would probably be retiring in our eighties and uh and when I ran some models on what I thought we could live on reasonably based off of some major life changes uh I realized that we could probably retire in about ten years if we really stuck to it that is what put her over the edge
Okay so this sense that you could be unburden from the cost of your own lifestyle that you could get out of maybe a rat race you've gotten into did you not like your job
You know it's funny I personally really like my job in it for me it's not about work for me it was about uh bring myself from this idea of mandatory labor
You know there's passions that I have that may not necessarily coincide with earning a lot of money or earning money at all and to have the time to pursue that felt like more like the type of life I'd want to live so when I realized that there was a potential for that I mean it was intoxicated
OK so a couple of things first of all when you say this mandatory labor many of us just said you mean a job which is you know how the world turns around but what you and your wife did just to keep the story going is it's a major part of this FIRE movement it's called arbitrage you moves you had to move to a a less expensive towns here in Bend Oregon now
But I just kind of God allowed something that I'm seeing from a lot of these people who are in the FIRE movement
A lot you seem really creative so you are making a documentary about your FIRE movement and you're writing a book about your FIRE movement haven't you just replaced your creative director job with film director author [laughter]

This year and now the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine was awarded today to James Allison into Sudoku hunt joke for the discoveries on how to use the body's immune system to attack cancer
Allison is the chair of immunology and executive director of the immunotherapy platform at the University of Texas empty Anderson Cancer center and joining us now is Dr Peter pitchers who is president of empty Anderson Dr pictures welcome and congrats to you and your colleague on winning a Nobel Prize
This is fantastic news of course for Jim for empty arson but most importantly for cancer patients around the world
Will tell us a little bit about James Allison's work in immunotherapy to attack cancer well Dr Alison is really dedicated his entire life and his uh research career to understanding how the immune system works and more specifically how it works
In cancer patients and in the biologic setting of cancer in his uh maintenance I was to understand how to block a protein on T cells that acts as a break on their activation in essence enabling those T cells to be freed up to attack cancer cells
So explain that in a way that everyday people
Drew level [laughter] well in our bodies we have a group of cells that we think of as the soldiers of the immune system the T cells and those T cells are really held in check to ensure that those cells do not attack normal cells in our body or caused autoimmune diseases
And part of that break process also impairs the ability of those cells to attack cancer cells in Dr Allison really understood the underpinnings of how that break works and developed approaches to release that break so that the immune system could in essence target and attack the cancer
And so what has that meant for cancer treatment and general
Well this is really opened up an entirely new field in cancer treatment that we call them you know therapy and we see that really as a fourth pillar of cancer treatment joining surgery chemotherapy and radiation
In creating entirely new way of approaching cancer treatment that can be combined with the other treatments are sometimes used in isolation alone
Do you think we're going to get to a place because of this where people don't use chemotherapy and radiation to treat cancer absolutely
I I Do believe that this will lead to an sites and two opportunities to see this as a ... form of tree mad and allow us to reduce the side effects associate with other treatments as we really look for new ways to treat cancer what
Kind of results have you seen in patients whose cancer treatment includes immunotherapy
Well we've seen spectacular resolve
Including patients who are surviving for decades as a result of these novel treatments when we look more specifically at the populations that have been treated
By the drug that gyms team has developed we can see the twenty percent of those live for at least three years with many patients living ten years and beyond
These are really unprecedented results for patients who really had no other options
I genes Allison started his career at Indiana or send in Nineteen Seventy seven and then he returned in twenty twelve to work on
A the empty Anderson moon shots program which we've talked about before basically allowing people to work on things that might pan out it might be game changers or maybe they won't ah ... how many examples like this have you had of the moon shots program really giving you a good results
Well there's a myth shots program really has enabled us to move into what we think of his team based science and we're seeing tremendous successes as a result of this both scientific discovery as well as policy initiatives that we've moved forward in Washington in Austin and other state capitals
I according to the world Health Organization's international agency for research on cancer an estimated Eighteen point one million people will develop cancer and nine point six million will die of cancer this year how are you about the future of cancer treatment right now
Right now we're in an unprecedented era of cancer treatment we have the combinations of targeted therapy immunotherapy and the use of science as a way to drive discovery as opposed to the historical approaches of screening the environment for compounds that might have anti cancer a fact
This change in research strategy coupled with the types of innovations that are heralded in today's a Nobel Prize award really open up avenues that create great opportunities for cancer patients in the future

This this year and now in Washington state the number of school age children who are homeless is way up
The Seattle Times recently found that in several rural and suburban areas the homeless student population had more than doubled between twenty ... twenty Seventeen and ... the number is up to thirty four percent in the past five years
Across the country about one point three million homeless students are enrolled in public schools
But why is this happening in a time when unemployment is below four percent in the economy is booming well it turns out that may be part of the problem Carly ... is family resource coordinator for buffalo school district in ... county Washington one of the district trying to figure all this out quarterly welcome
Yeah thank you for having me
Those numbers are shocking what are you seeing there appears county
We definitely have seen a significant rise of our homeless families and the last few years
Two years ago we had about three hundred and fifty homeless students enrolled just this last year we enrolled seven hundred and fifty nine homeless students [noise] um this year we don't have a total tally yet but I can tell you right now we're well ahead of the numbers that we had last year do you have any idea why
Yeah I go out in the field and I I speak with these families I see these families and it it's very difficult to meet with them you have to go out to see them to really understand
The layers of the onion that these families are going through there's multiple layers of it but I I truly believe back in two thousand fourteen when we had our economy boom
We never saw rental prices as high as fourteen hundred dollars you used to be able to get a small apartment or a rental unit for you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars
Um since then um rentals have gone up it is a lot more difficult to find section ... housing and affordable housing for these families especially if you are a working family and you're working minimum wage job at twelve dollars an hour forty hours a week
Your incomes going to be about Nineteen hundred dollars for the month and then fourteen hundred of that's going to be going towards the rent so that doesn't leave you a lot for crisis that happened um there's many different factors that are leaving these families just on the edge of becoming homeless and
Really it's a matter of and when that happens then they're on the streets
No you are just outside of Tacoma, Washington not far from Seattle one of the most expensive cities in the country are you seeing a an issue where people are getting priced out of a of a place like Seattle and then they're coming your way and they still can't afford housing is that what you're noticing
Yes absolutely we are known 'em for a bedroom community is what they're calling us
A lot of families are coming out to our area to find the fourteen hundred dollar rentals or as cheap as they can um and they will commute as far as two hours to work on a daily basis and like I said it just takes a loss of a job or that one crisis or they didn't have money saved up for
An incident that happened before things start to crumble underneath them and it's a symptom
Of the good economy which is the most fascinating thing about yes yeah [noise] so for an elementary school kid who is homeless in your district what is a typical day like
It's very challenging and first off
Than getting identified because they don't want to be identified they're afraid if they tell anyone that they're living in their car their children will be taken away from them um it could be their immigration status that they're afraid of being identified from
So really a lot of the homeless families that we have those children go without until we get them recognized
We recognize them through a variety of just being aware and paying attention to our students at school which students are getting lunch which students are sitting without lunch um which kids are on the chronic absentee list um who's coming late tardy to school every day
And you notice that and then what do you do do you sit them down and ask them what's going on at home do you ...
Yeah it's you know I find my role becoming an investigator [laughter] because they won't come to you you have to go to them and you have to be very gentle with it
I go out in my community and I do drive ... to go to the address if they have listed in our system just to see kind of what the house is like a lot of times I just go out to the house and cold and knock on the door they totally don't even expect me but it's just you know they're not responding to me and I just want to
Ask them in a gentle way you know hey I'm here for you how can I support you and a lot of times at that moment they will just pour in and just explain everything and then it's building a relationship from there to get them the services they need to address the barriers are experiencing
It's not just your state of Washington it's a lot of other states especially across the west and seen reports out of Idaho they've got the highest number of homeless students they've seen in years um there's a report out recently about a jumping homeless school kids outside of Anchorage, Alaska
