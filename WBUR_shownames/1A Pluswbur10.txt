This is one egg on Todd's where like in Washington red states blue wave phrases we hear all the time now in America but on election night in Nineteen eighty four news anchors had to explain to viewers why they were coloring certain states on the map red and certain ones blue
Red states are states we have for Jeff as having those ... are regulatory shows with
Explained in detail there by the network news now fast forward to election night sixteen years later a far more dramatic event the two thousand presidential race was the closest the country had ever seen
Fan bars fan by CNN right now is moving [noise] our earlier that ration of Florida [noise] back to the [noise] too close to call call off
Now that's the night that red and blue clashed into their current meetings that night when Florida was blue than it was too close to call and it was read then unknown
... started to hang and then Bush Gore you might remember that it's also the night according to my guest Steve corner ... when our increasingly divisive politics came to a head
And established America's polarized identity as the red and the blue and in fact that is the name of his new book they're reading the blue the Nineteen nineties and the birth of political tribalism
Steve ... is the author he's MSNBC and NBC News national political correspondent
And he's in the studio with me Steve it's a pleasure to have you it's great to be here things have me Steve we're going to talk a lot about fascinating political history we're also going to talk about where we are now in our politics or electoral politics the house the Senate the Kavanaugh hearings which have captivated American undercurrents of the politics there
But let's go back to two thousand because we just took it down into those memories of hanging chads and Bush Gore and the recount in Florida and the Supreme Court deciding the results of an election
Um that's where your book begins and also where it ends why was that such a pivotal moment for political ideology America yeah no I mean I I think it's the two thousand election to me which
Is you as close to a perfect time I think as we're ever going to see in a presidential election
Um it was the perfect combination of the nineties all of the political wars of the Nineteen nineties Bill Clinton Newt Gingrich Hillary care Ross Perot pitchforks Pat Buchanan impeachment all of these these major battles these major forces
That shape politics created this division that
When you looked at that map on election night two thousand and you saw the entire south with now painted red red for Republicans the entire northeast
Minus New Hampshire barely a was painted blue for Democrats the Pacific coast you could see these
The stark geographic boundaries and they were more than geographic they were they were cultural boundaries they were demographic boundaries and I think the nineties really to me it's the decades those colors sync up with the parties those colors took on a partisan meaning political meaning in people's show sides
And it's almost ... two tribes were formed red and blue and and I think that framework

This is one eight on Todd's will like I'm Talking to MSNBC and NBC News national correspondent Steve ... about his new book the red and the blue the Nineteen nineties and the birth of political tribalism well here is one well remembered moment from the nineties I take you back to president almost president at this point Bill Clinton
You answer that question is I've never broken state law
And the experiment and ... didn't like it didn't inhale and they're trying to do
[laughter] Bill Clinton and the run up to the presidential elections in Nineteen Ninety two are the deceased late Christopher Hitchens went to Oxford with Bill Clinton said the idea that Bill Clinton didn't inhale it Oxford was probably true because he knew first hand that Bill Clinton chose to take his marijuana in edible forum
That's what ... used to say he was no friend Bill Clinton by the way we should stipulate that
We heard from Susan who sent us an email I Believe that our political risk started well before the Nineteen nineties the Vietnam Conflict was one of the most visited issues since the civil war and we still have never recovered
And not ... tweets us on where I was in high school when Gingrich and company produced their contract with America I remember peers who had been pleasant with each other suddenly became antagonistic suddenly politics became a team sport that experience is one of the reasons why I today and non partisan
A Steve you're nodding and I think that type of reaction to sorting
Might sound familiar to you I Want to go back to the history and just a moment but before we do I want to get to a moment and tribalism in politics
Where we are right now I Want to talk about and Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham back during the impeachment was a member of the house he was an impeachment manager he helped impeach Bill Clinton and then ... before the Senate to make the case has a prosecutor that Bill Clinton should be removed from office because of the Monica Lewinsky
Experience I'm now Lindsey Graham is also made himself highly visible these last several weeks during the rec having hearings ... angrily defended cab and he said the other day and the hearings I think everybody saw it I'm a single white male people want me to shut up
And I won't shut up and he was red face and he was furious on behalf of ... cabinet and presumably white men everywhere but contrast that with the Lindsey Graham of twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen and even twenty twelve
Here ... Lindsey Graham at a roast dinner and twenty Seventeen poking fun at Paul Ryan speaker of the house but making a point
You're forty six years you've been the vice presidential nominee ... the Republican point
You're the speaker that the Republican controlled house you're smart you know the budget that were for you have ... good temperament and disposition and the judgment of Solomon you are dead men walking
As far as [noise] back in twenty twelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quit to me at any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough to survive as the Republican Party the future meeting Republicans
Had your broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics
Flash forward to the Lindsey Graham of this week
I'm a white male and I'm not gonna take it any more
Stunning what does this transformation that Lindsey Graham ... vacation in the ... you about where we were in in in where we are yeah I'm ... tells
Me that the divide this deepening any idea tells me that the the lines that were kinda drawn ... that you saw and the two thousand election they say that we've lived with sense
You're only going deeper and the moment you talked about there and twenty twelve after twenty twelve election
There was ... you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of um establishment nationally looked at the Mitt Romney's lost ... Obama and concluded what Lindsey Graham ... demographically the way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term
They came up with that autopsy report they were gonna change on immigration all this stuff
Donald Trump comes along and violates every tentative this of this autopsy and wins
And I think it it's not just the one the general election and that's a huge part of it but the fact that he was able to sweep through the Republican Party like the primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen
Told Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixty one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's it I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump
Of dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race ... called him a kooky called him a bunch of things um in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world how ... resonated with their voters it told them where there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe that we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want ... understand
... granted more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death now with this party
So what is Lindsay Gramm thinking now is he thinking I have to win the Republican primary and twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last
The last gasp ... the Republican Party and I'm going to be a senator for one more term or is he is he converted what's he think yeah I mean look
There's ... there's all sorts of theories about this and I don't know but ... I'll give you a couple of them that ... that that jumped out at me what is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about the Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons of Donald Trump's rise and his ... during popularity with republic
Office holders as you are taking a major major risk
If you are seen as separating yourself from this president your neck primary especially if you're Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being a being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that there's also the theory that hey part of this is
Lindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises or if you change your tone on Trump the way he as if you go off with him maybe if you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons to is it is again
Lindsey Graham looking at Trump than twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party to go down this road
And then seeing down from when the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one I think tells Lindsey Graham and just ... more broadly tells Republicans that this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically
Kennett last is the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over we can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacturing and fast enough
To be a party the future I Wonder if
When he closed his eyes at night whether he's
Changed his mind about that or not James sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard and because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle I usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised at how often several of my neighbors expressed their genuine irritation with me that I can endorse candidates from both parties
Very tribal instead of an evaluation on the merits and in Steve you're not him because that does not sound surprising to you
... what he's describing his ticket splitting yet to be a political science they the voters who go and they
A Democrat for president Republican for Congress they split up the ballot just election two election that that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket has been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and in that that is just the rise of polarization the driver was All right let's get
Back in our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve corner you so much of what your book is about uh we talked about the speaker of the house Newt Gingrich who are on led to believe did not talk to you for this book although although he certainly could have a when he was a young rabble rousing congressmen
Who was willing to defy the normal rules of congressional decorum in May of Nineteen eighty four he delivered an insult on the floor of the house to then time speaker from Massachusetts the legendary Tip O'Neill
My partner to speak or as you pointed out to us again yesterday are in charge of this house if you are saying to me the urine postmaster isn't capable of delivering from one member to another the male and the system you run then I think you may want to appoint a commission to look into the post office
Now maybe a veiled insult there that might take a little bit of parsing but give it back story and why Newt Gingrich was slinging an insult at uh the well respected and legendary Tip O'Neill
Yeah there there in in hindsight now you look back Thirty years and you play may say well what was the big deal to deal with Democrats had run the Congress at that point for Thirty years
They were seen as the permanent majority I mean Republicans weren't just the minority party they were buried deep they weren't even close you didn't go into an election saying maybe the Republicans will get it maybe they won't it was like maybe they'll get to a hundred Seventy feet for this you know that that was how deep in the minority they were in here was Gingrich um who was in his third term from Georgia
Beating the speaker of the house she was at that point eight Seventy two year old old school Boston politician Tip O'Neill
Man of the house beating him into a fight on the floor of the house of Neal actually left the speakers rose from came down to the floor that have stood to debate Gingrich and and we have that very sound here's Tip O'Neill and his response

While we're talking for the most part about what politician said and did in the Nineteen Ninety so how do they define their ideologies for the American people it's not just Washington it's polarized we've been asking listeners for memorable moments from politics in the nineties and here's one
And the president is right in many ways we are a shining city on it for the hard truth is that not everyone is sharing in this city's splendor and or if there is this fair Mr President and the faces that you don't see
Them places that you don't visit and you're a shining city
And believe you're hearing from Mario Cuomo their former governor of New York maybe at the peak of his political career the shining city on the hill well here's what I was going for another
Moment or the moment that listeners sent us from ... the early nineties I take you back towards any [noise]
To be president President Bill Clinton June Nineteen Ninety two on the Arsenio Hall show remember him well for for for any off before that year presidential candidates didn't really appear on nighttime talk shows at all so that was something new talking about how
Politicians grappled with media coverage during those years achieve that was a moment not just because of the president appeared on Arsenio Hall but he seemed to offer an alternative
To gosh even Pat Buchanan speech there is a religious war in this country very stark very serious and in a lot of Americans agreed with him here was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun the guy you want at the party
It was also the moment that was June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall show Bill Clinton was actually running
Not in first or second but in third place in the presidential race at that point versus Ross Perot [laughter] begging place was Bush the incoming president in third place buried I was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton and so they were his team he remembered the bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two
Had was thought to be an electable he'd gone through the scandal about Gennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam draft he'd gone through the I didn't inhale moment that sort of hard in this image of slick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer Li ... scheme is way out of
A out of everything and so they were trying his campaign was to change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around
Interviews with you know traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about gender flowers and the draft and all that so here was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show like Arsenio Hall
Which was very hot at that moment you're showcase a different side of your personality
And and it was Ninety two it wasn't just arson you Ninety two was the year
... media had been expanding in so many ways in that media expansion ... really met up with politics presidential politics I mentioned Perot who was running in first place at that point the entire Perot phenomenon began
In February Ninety two on the CNN show Larry King large came in and Larry King would sometimes have politicians on and sometimes aging celebrities and they'd spend an hour and they take calls
And Ross Perot was on in February Ninety two and he said you know if the if there are volunteers out there who will put me on the ballot in all fifty states I'll run for president as an independent in just from that
A movement sprung up organically across the country to do in Texas about two months later volunteers committed two hundred and fifty four thousand signatures to get Ross Perot on the ballot and he was running in first place by June and he was doing talk shows

Now Rebecca Traister you started to paint a picture of the history of women who've gotten angry and made their mark their anger is not always shown in the same form as somebody yelling in the face of a senator like Jeff Flake on live TV but anger nonetheless and Brittany Cooper you've written a book
About finding your power in rage uh tell me a little bit about that theme and how the story fits into the moment [noise]
A shore so part of what happens is that women are told on as many of your listeners say that to be angry it to be irrational
Um and I had a student when I was a graduate instructor confront me um and said to me that she loved to listen to me lecture because my lectures were filled with what she called the most eloquent rage ever and it was a wakeup call for me as someone who had run away from the angry black woman stereotype my whole life
Because I didn't want to be discredited as a black woman moving through predominantly white institutions
And so my student who was a young black woman thought and be a kind of authenticity and she helped me to realize
That my anger wasn't keeping me from doing my job or showing up offering quality lectures are material
Or material but then it was actually helping me to do a better job and so in that moment I made a connection that I've been encouraging other women to make which is ... knowledge that we have the right to outrage and so reject ideas that say that when we're angry about legitimate injustices
That this in some way make the irrational or makes our claim illegitimate
And when we then begin to own that anger doesn't mean that we would come destructive or harmful it means that we happened to the energy and power and we start to use that energy and power to build the kind of world we want to see 'em and more women need to give themselves permission to do that
I'd given myself permission to do that on and in this moment I Am on the front lines of saying women outrage have the potential if we own it and if we don't apologize or
To change this very scary a trajectory of this historical moment we have a lot to be afraid about or we have a lot to be angry about opposite that anger is the catalyst worth being able to do something about the things we see
Now let's move from the Senate committee hearing room
In the hallways around the Senate um and even the books that are esteemed authors have written onto the tennis court and the U.S open for another moment that American shared within the last couple of weeks
Serena Williams in her match against Naomi Osaka at the U.S open here's a cut I'll bring you back there to refresh my memory of anger on the court Serena Williams infamous exchange with umpire Carlos Ramos
[noise]
Suresh I'm Shawnee you shared this moment along with the rest of America us arena is a champion and one of the most famous black women in America somebody who got angry and somebody found who found that anger or weaponized against her
Ah yes I I think that what we saw in response was everything that Brittany in Tribeca and I are have been talking about it
Was interesting because there are so many egregious examples of men behaving in the same way but not facing the same policing or penalties mean she
She was a defined that was levied against her is the highest ever for verbal abuse in the history of the u._s. open I Believe and so in that moment
... says if the responses of the people that really just wanted to see her in isolation acting um it and this exchange with this man but then there were people who really looked at that exchange within the much broader context of
The power dynamics in the moment in history in the context and the legacy of discrimination within the sport that she has faced
And so I think that one thing that has been unexplored in the bigger conversation about that is the central and pivotal role of title nine in understanding women as
Leaders or as people who have the right to defend themselves or engage in public conflict
Um what she was really doing was I'm asserting her right to defend herself and to have dignity in the moment not be accused the way that she was accused
And with sports I think it's important to note that we now have not one but two generations of women so a generation of role models who have benefited from title nine in the lessons of title nine which we tend to think of it as
Um athletics but it is really about leadership and the ability to act together um in teams to manage conflict to make the nuance distinctions between being assertive and being aggression and be aggressive and being angry
I think we're seeing the ... of of that now in our political life
So there were some pushback though to Serena Williams behavior on the court and the reaction to it even from within the tennis world a Brittany Cooper I don't know if you saw Martina Navratilova his response to this arena Williams episode a couple of days later but she wrote an op ed after the U.S open and she said Martina speaking now
Said yes women are treated differently yes there are double standards
But Serino was wrong her encore behavior wasn't appropriate paraphrasing just because men region umpires and act like babies on the court doesn't make it right in a champion Serena should not emulated
Right I'm Martina Navratilova was wrong or she did this thing that women are conditioned to do which is rather than use it as a moment of solidarity she tried police arenas conduct I'm as a lifelong tennis fan I'm I Am livid but Martina Navratilova reminded me
That up until this moment most white women in tennis have not been allies of the Williams sisters um do when I watch tennis with my friends who are African American and us fans we often talk about watching the matches on you because of the micro aggressions that come from white women
Who are often knocking at the Williams sisters and having things to say but let me also add
That one of the things that was most infuriating about washing the way in which Ramos treated Serena
Was that there was a broader context to her anger not only did he accused her of cheating but this came out on the heels of reports that members of the USDA had been showing up to her house
Unannounced and testing her over and over again on grounds that maybe she was doping even though she has come clean on every drug tested even those statistics show that they were testing her double the amount that they were testing any other players on the women's side and so she had been subjected to repeated indignity
And then as the best tennis player of her generation and perhaps ever see that has a referee who accuses her heating and she's one more grand plan that any woman other than Margaret Court and any woman in the open air

Entourage were like sitting in for Joshua jobs when we're talking about the power of women's anger in the current moment in America
I'm Talking with Rebecca Traister for New York magazine and the cut author of good in mad Bernie Cooper associate professor at Rutgers University and author of the new book eloquent rage and also ... director of the women's media center speech project and author of the new book
Rage becomes her now I read an email from Karen at the end of the last segment said she was hurt disappointed and angry wounded about the treatment of Hillary Clinton into twenty sixteen campaign and I don't want to go there because Hillary Clinton is one prominent famous
Woman well known for navigating the shoulders of how women are supposed to express themselves in public now Hillary Clinton
Has a history of being very careful and very deliberate mindful of appearing angry or emotional she's been at it for thirty five years in America
And in fact it was news in the two thousand ... campaign I remember this when she shed a tear in New Hampshire one tier and it was at the top of CNN for like a new cycle
But people are saying that the twenty sixteen presidential campaign I'm Hillary Clinton in fact was was tone police listen
I regret deeply how angry [noise] the tone of the campaign became [noise]
Not her
Fault says one audience member when when Hillary Clinton very deliberately in that fashion says I regret how nasty the campaign became
I'm ... I'm only does this moment has clearly struck a chord Rebecca Traister who's watching here in the studio with me out on strike you know she was off as she was very very careful in her choice of words there to even as she was commenting
On it I mean I think it was um
It was ridiculous that this woman was called inauthentic while being held to the standard
Of careful control in her voice and her facial of parents and her body
And her motive expression I mean
The two candidates um that were her primary opponents for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders could act in unhinged ways they could show up looking unkempt they could pound podium Z
You know they could turn red in the face and as men they could leverage this enormous tide of populist anger and that was a gender card nobody wrote about that as a gender card ride there were all of these conversations about
I'm Hillary Clinton as there often are with women because we associate gender with women and pretend men don't have a gender
Um and and so they could do that and she couldn't leverage that political power and we saw that over and over and over again throughout the campaign
Record ... is so right about this and I'm In fact the thing that the irony of what we were told about Hillary Clinton
Both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump or congratulated by the political pressed for their particular skill in channeling the anger of their supporters this was their gift they were able to give voice to this frustration and we were repeatedly told that some of the authenticity of Hillary was that she couldn't convey anger and passion and yet
Every time she spoke too close to a microphone somebody said you're yelling your shrill um she really got directives at one point Joe Scarborough she was giving an ex ... a speech the night she won a primary and Joe Scarborough sad smile is if it was like some cat color on the street smile more
Um she was told that regularly
And I think that that's again an example of of not having that tool to wield she also has done remarkable writing and talking herself
In instances where I've interviewed her and she's written about it in our own memoir of the campaign about the process of not using that anger she writes particularly about that second debate where Donald Trump came up behind her and kind of loomed behind her
And how menacing and aggressive his body language was and how during
The debate a presidential debate she was doing internal calculations thinking can I turn around and confront this guy she said she thought about turning around and saying get away from me but then she was thinking no no no that's gonna redound negatively to me that's gonna make me look bad
It's gonna hurt me strategically and the debate and so she didn't and one of the things that that little story tells us is about
How much energy women expand
Modulating considering strategizing thinking tactically about how to use their voice how to suppress their voice how to channel their anger how to swallow their anger what to do in order to be rhetorically effective
And and I think that that's something that that all three of us are writing about and thinking about is the amount of time and energy women spend doing this kind of maneuvering around the rules around are angry expressions
I Want to I Want to talk a little bit in the last
... section of the show that we have about where some of this anger goes because this is a moment in America and what's to be realistic moments had a way of feeding they just do and and so I'm interested in where this goes when
The cameras and all of the writers who aren't Rebecca Traister and Britain Cooper are not as interested anymore you know in in a couple of years I think that might happen and I want to know where this goes now we've been hearing from so many wanting listeners I Want to play you another mash up of some of the women's voices who've been reaching out to us about how they're feeling
My name's Aaron I'm calling from Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is Sarah I'm from Cincinnati when I let my anger bubble over and I get really angry out loud it
It really doesn't do much good I find that if I express a strong opinion or even just a bit of discomfort with something I'm perceived as being angry are overreacting women yelling even in this day and age that very acceptable men don't have that same problem and I'm
Starting to feel like maybe it's not just a personal issue I'm dealing with what's going to be nice and and uh and keep our mouth shut however I Am so angry so angry right now maybe women all over the place you're dealing with it I'm turning my anger
Feel like I'm not alone but still pretty discouraging I think that's what when they have to do we have to take that anger hold onto it and that's how we're going to take back this country
We're hearing from listeners women who it feels like there's a scene there are transferring
Some of their personal rage I'm sure a lot of it's in in personal life not just political life or cultural life but into action taking action industries taking action maybe at the ballot box we got this tweet from Tracy in Jacksonville I'm One of the thousands of women using their frustration to run for office
Running for the Florida House district Fifteen I Am focused on my determination to be a voice for all and the focus on issues important to Jacksonville families Tracey as one candidate who says that this moment of anger is very important for her motivation of Brittany Cooper I Want to talk about where
This goes in terms of maybe the midterms that might be the most immediate effect um
None of us knows exactly how that vote is going to turn out but it seems like any pollster
Or political analyst worth anything is looking down and what they call the cross tabs and noticing that women are mad women are going to vote and women are going to form a tidal wave in twenty Eighteen one way or the other [noise]
Absolutely and that is as it should be um I'm particularly heartened by
The Stacey Abrams campaign down in Georgia we have the opportunity to have the first black woman I'm governor of a state of a former slave state of the ... practically campaign they're all of these progressive campaigns that are being run and here's the thing we've been seeing that since twenty sixteen we had a wave of
A progressive as sort of radically progressive black mayors in the deep south
And so one of the things that I Want to challenge folks to do as we think in this moment is to actually look at what people of color are doing not just women but particularly black women in these elections the ways that we have that channeling our anger
On for decades and decades and that started with the way that we voted for Hillary Clinton in this most immediate political moment
Um but to your earlier point about whether or not our anger can be sustained
Um I think that I think that this can be sustained I think that we have to remember that the women's movement in this country though it goes through ebbs and flows has really been a solid political project uh since uh depending on how you count eight seed thirty one or Eighteen forty eight
So we're we're two hundred years in a almost here and so I think you know
I'm I think that there is a real opportunity for us to make some change here and I think the women see that um our power in our ability to frame issues in ways that include the most American and take care of the most marginalized American um I

This is one a I'm Joshua Johnson in Washington when Dr Christine Blasey Ford described for alleged sexual assault before Congress on Thursday women across the country and the world we're listening there were also talking
... testimony brought to the surface difficult memories and sexual assault survivors who never shared publicly what happened to them started doing so at home on social media and workplaces including ours
Most of one a production team is female and most of them identify as sexual assault survivors one producer described for assault as a clear abuse of power she says at a previous job I had an entire
He got me to go to his house on the pretense that I was getting instructions before watching his cat then he got me drunk kissed me and put his hand
On my chest another producer said her assailant was well known to her she told us it was after a night of drinking in high school
By an ex boyfriend and I said no over and over and eventually it just let it happen I remember kind of retreating into myself and
A federal thing on a corner of the ceiling like Christine Blasey Ford the women on our staff sometimes fixated on unexpected details one said the lights of passing cars or when
I remember feeling so exposed and scared as they've shown to the window of the car we were doing it in it hurts so badly and I burst into terrier and
Immediately after [noise] here's what another producer had to say he was a
Guy I had a crush on I remember flashes of image as him pulling down my shorts and underwear his hands on my chest and I remember that I couldn't
Move and one last account from our team it was an eighth
Grade when I when I was actually assaulted at school by another student I told the dean of the middle school but no action was taken I saw my attacker almost every day until we moved away
A few years later hearing these stories is like a gut punch I never would've imagined that so many of my colleagues were directly affected by assault and harassment let alone most of them
I Am furious and frustrated that I Can't do anything to a race what they've been through these brilliant funny driven skilled women who do way more to make what happened that I ever have or will but perhaps that fury and frustration or naive
Perhaps I should have assumed that at least some of them had been through it and perhaps you have to today we'll explore this moment of reckoning not just for the Supreme Court and partisan politics but how breaking the silence could change our society and our culture

I'm twenty eight and the freedoms of dark it's a challenge to have sex with the man I Love without seeing terrible scenes in my head
Another listener emailed I couldn't listen to Dr Ford's testimony I was raped when I was Fifteen and never shared it
The thought of listening to the testimony was too difficult for me to handle I Am proud of the women who are speaking out but there are others all around us were silently coping by the way we should note as we did at the top of the program a lot of what we are going to be discussing today
Has to do with pretty Frank descriptions of sexual assault and harassment so if you'd like to listen to this program later on when you were more emotionally prepared for it away from the kids out of time maybe when you're ready to discuss it as a family you'll find the whole conversation on line at the one a dot org that's the words are the number one letter a dot org [noise]
What's that another voice to the discussion joining us from NPR in New York is Marvin Gaye a member of the New York times editorial board more walking to the program thanks for having me not one Saturday you wrote in the times and accounts of your salt and its emotional aftermath in part you wrote quote
I never felt compelled to share my story before because of this so unremarkable so common because so many women have been through worse unquote
Unremarkable what made you think of what you had been through as unremarkable and what changed your mind
You know for years and my friends and I have been
And colleagues as well just sharing stories swapping stories and you know in bars and and trips abroad of of ours sexual assaults of our sexual harassment
And just knowing how many of my friends and have been through similar experiences somewhere on that spectrum I just you know as a journalist who I never want to make it about me
And so my instinct is to tell other people's stories and I'm hearing from some of my friends and colleagues
During doctor for its testimony though I'm getting text messages about the kind of pain that they were in uh the pie TST it made me rethink my decision to to stay silent on my own experience can
You share with us to whatever extent you feel comfortable what happened to you
Sure so um it was over a decade ago I was in college and um you know I I was at a party with a boy at who I'd had a crush on I guess for a long time I think and we both had and an interesting one another and
When you drink a lot I was Twenty years old at the time on and he drink more than I did ah one thing led to another and we uh ended up back in his place and and we were having sex and that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was
A rougher frankly than I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise
And um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to
'em and it was very painful and I I'm often to stop and and he eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly and you know I think ... family is probably too drunk to kind of know what was going on is what what I thought at the time
And you know afterwards I dated him and I think
Now I Know that that's a very common experience but you know at the time there was no nationwide conversation about these things so
You really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame um in what had happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends
And you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what it was um which which is really what helped me move on
Now last week professor Conan A democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked professor forward what her strongest memory was of what she accuses judge Brett Kavanaugh having done to her as a teenager here is part of what professor Ford said
And they hit the camp this is the laughter ... laughter between the two [noise] and they're having fun
Can you explain for us from a neurological perspective why it is that certain aspects of assault stand out in people's memories perhaps by way of explaining what the hippocampus ... and what it does
[laughter] um they hit the campus as a part of the brain involved in memory and um [noise] doctor for it and her testimony talks about I'm being afraid she's going to die or that he's going to kill her
And the human brain has specific parts that are involved to encode fear and if you just think about it I'm I'm that's because fear especially in prehistoric times kept us alive um you don't want to see a lion and have to think oh is that dangerous or not should I run away
You when people who can encode that ... that fear that lion and immediately react well escape and survive so I'm
Similarly and fear memories I'm like the memory of an assault on the brain becomes hyper focused on specific details so it's really common to remember perhaps the color of the person's eyes
Or sound or the Muzak or like Dr Ford says the laughter because that I'm even just hearing her talk about it really makes my heart clutch you know it's really emotional
Um but forget other details like uh the house you were in or the neighborhood where the street um those aren't those are irrelevant in the moment the assault is happening um so I Hope that sort of helps explain it but it is yeah brain operate
It kind of feels like when you're you know the way she describes the way he described it it feels like that experience you have when you're like watching a scary movie you know you were walking through a haunted house you'll forget all the decor but the thing that leaked out at you the kind of forced your adrenalin to rise dots wouldn't codes that that's a great example yes
No more you said that a moment she's mia Lauren important Lawrence Taylor these moments than coach so intensely are there are ways to weaken the power of them in the mind or did you just kind of have to deal with those things kind of trigger those images that are super vivid how do you work through those or ten you
There are many many ways to work through those I'm Talking about it and getting support whether that's a therapist or us a community support group or a ... a an informal group of friends can be and getting validation talking to the right people can be incredibly helpful
What we do in our empowerment self defense classes are is
Help people find their voice and find their physical power a talk therapy can accomplish a certain amount but I'm a professor Conan will tell you
The trauma also lives in the cells of your body and um you need to have some kind of so magic um release of that and so mad at basically means so much is bodies so um we we do role plays of practicing standing up for yourself or asking for what you want and we also do hitting
And um that can be that can really move the trauma through an out your body you're not only reclaiming your power but you're also releasing whatever you've been through

Back now to our conversation with Lawrence Taylor of defend yourself New York times journalist Marvin Gaye and Harvard University's terrorist and Conan we got many messages in our inbox as I said here's one more that came in to us
Virginia forty two years ago I was raped by my brother and it was only last year that I was able to knowledge that and begin dealing with the fallout from
I keep hearing people say well why on earth would she weighs thirty six years and it really happened it must be alive and I can tell you exactly why
It doesn't matter that we were victims
When we are raped we feel wrong we feel shame and humiliation and embarrassment and we don't want to admit it to ourselves let alone to anyone else
If it was not a violent rape that left obvious mar it's easy to pretend it never happened and
Emotionally it feels like the right thing to do
Because you're so scared and so hurt and so it shaped
Live thanks very much for sharing your story with the market loved to get your reaction to that story particularly the shame the humiliation the embarrassment the comes
After that incident like that after an attack like that
Wow and it's powerful um you know [laughter]
So I spent many years in therapy and not necessarily certainly not just because of of my assault or it was one of the things of many that that I dealt with but I have been so struck by by the number of friends and colleagues and acquaintances who have reached out to me after I shared my story
And you know sharing things they haven't told anyone before
I was molested I was raped I you know it goes on and on and on and and I really am also a huge fan of brain brown and social research or reality shame and vulnerability right and I I and I have become a huge believer that shame need secrecy to survive
On and of huge part of the reason I decided to share my story is selfish it's because I
You know I don't believe anymore at that the shame that I'd been carrying around should have ever been my own shame and so in telling my story you know I I was I feel huge sense of relief I was able to to discharge that
I'm into the public arena where I Believe that belongs 'em and no longer hold onto that I feel freer I feel lighter and hearing from others who haven't been able to kind of go there yet they don't have to write a piece of how they can share it with a friend
Or family member but hearing from them I I Believe that I I did the right thing at least for me because I'm the thing that I'm most emotional about now is not my own experience it's knowing how many of the people I Love and care about and know are in you know the kind of pain they're carrying around
And that ah I guess for me that's where who I Am as a journalist meets who I Am and my experience as a human because I just it makes me very angry um and it it really
Watching you know watching Brett Kavanaugh for me and for a lot of us was kind of the embodiment of that injustice and
That's that's where I think you know the real power in and sharing our stories and power numbers comes from
Lark I just wanted to um that speak to what this
What lives shared about her experience there are very honorable powerful reasons not to tell
I Am not in any way ever going to diminish someone who feels unable to tell or who makes the choice not to tell 'em that it can be internal reasons like lives shared it can be ex journal reasons like I might get taken away from my family or I might lose my job
Um but they are all very real
At at the same time I'm One of the other things that live did not bring up is that
We have more control over our own experiences and how we shape at them and how we interpret them if they're solely ours and we don't have other people telling us how we should behave
Sarah emailed I went to a small liberal arts college where sexual assault was rampant one day I met up with a friend and she gave me some vodka and I don't remember much else my next memory was me face down pants down with my quote unquote friend
On top of me still inside me I never thought of him that way never consented and barely have the strength to get him off of me when I tried to tell people what happened I was called a whore lucky because my rapist was apparently attractive to others
And I was called a complainer
And people wonder why survivors don't come forward pat emails when I was Thirteen Years old a podiatrist begin molesting me he was thirty one he told my mom he had some worked I could do for him if you check patients in this
Movie theaters you taught me what a glory hole was he had a friend of his implant an IUD in me this went on for almost two years
More and let me speak with you for just a moment I Would love to get your reaction to a clip from White House advisor Kellyanne Conway who spoke to this weekend about her own experiences with being assaulted listen
I feel very empathetic frankly for victims of sexual assault sexual harassment
And rate that
I ... I don't expect to judge Kavanaugh or Jake Tapper or Jeff Flake or or any body to me how responsible for that responsible for their own kind that
That was Kellyanne Conway speaking to Jake Tapper on CNN lord what do you make it become
Well first of all I'm Glad she came out as a survivor um you could feel the emotion in her voice ... it's a side of Kellyanne Conway we none of us have ever seen before but she seems to put the blame entirely on herself being responsible for your own conduct when we know that
The
Aggressor is the only person responsible for the harassment abuse or assault you can for where anything you want you can get is drunk as you want if there is not a rapist there you will not be raped I'm I'm Sorry that that she's
Carrying that and it's a really common thing that a lot of people carry
Carlos wrote on our Facebook page I Am a fifty year old male survivor of sexual assault
By a man who was my mother's boyfriend at the time to this day and it's difficult for me to trust any man aside from my brothers because of this I rarely hug any one and I'm ... extremely protective of my daughters professor Conan would you react to that I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of how
This might be playing out differently for male survivors of trauma versus women who have been traumatized
Thank you for bringing this up because I'm
One of the things we haven't talked much about is that men are also victims of sexual abuse and assaults um and that the effects on them I'm of developing anxiety phobia pie TST are similar to that that women experience after being assaulted
And I think for men who are victims of sexual assault if it's possible there's more stigma there is even more stigma in terms of being able to come out
Um and um be heard um so I so in terms of how this is playing out I Wonder how men are feeling in term of do they feel and they identify with Dr Ford or did they feel like their experiences are being neglected um I think if more men um
Who were able to and felt comfortable speaking out that actually it'd be really helpful to move the conversation you mentioned earlier about a men's involvement and I think people have mentioned hearing from ... Mel perpetrators but

This is one a I'm Joshua Johnson in Washington Congress is often deadlocked on legislation but there is lots of action happening at the state level from immigration to gun control state houses and governors are passing bills and voters are proven ballot initiatives
Today we're launching a special series called the state we're in
Each Monday This month we'll explore the bills and ballot initiatives dominating the debates in state capitals what are the state level trends tell us about the political direction of the country
This time around we'll explore trends in gun legislation and proposals around the nation today also marks one year since the mass shooting in Las Vegas at an open air country music festival it left fifty eight people dead and hundreds of people wounded
After that shooting many people called for more gun control measures particularly on bump stocks some states passed bump stock restrictions other major restrictions went nowhere
But this year some things shifted after another mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida a gunman walked into that school and killed Seventeen students and staff
That sparked a movement led by students survivors in states around the nation started restricting got access including some states with Republican governors
Joining us in Studio to discuss it is Scott Greenberg executive editor of state line a journalism project of the Pew Charitable trusts Scott welcome back to one day thanks very much for having me joining us from NPR in New York is Chris Brown ... president of the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence Chris welcome
Thank you so much and joining us from Texas Public radio in San Antonio is Richard Feldman the president of the independent firearm owners association he's a former lobbyist for the n._r._a. and he's the author of Rick uh Shay confessions of a gun lobbyist Richard thanks for making time for ... thank you
We should note that we have made attempts every single week to invite the president of the n._r._a. on this program we are eager to hear
From Mr Oliver North thus far or in treaties have gone unanswered but that invitation still stands Scott Greenberg let me start with you this has been a heck of a year for the gun control movement and also the gun rights movement in the U.S
Give us the broad overview of what's been going on as I understand that there are about fifty new laws restricting gun access that move forward including and fourteen states that have Republican governors right
That's right and uh we tracked this since the shooting in Parkland, Florida a last February because uh it what we found and this is really interesting was that up until Parkland even with uh the many other mass shootings unfortunately that have taken place
A that for the most part states reacted by expanding gun rights I'm up until Parkland Parkland seems to have shifted something or perhaps a because these students there um
Became so politically active it's so outspoken a so quickly or that following that um [noise] incident it seems that ah states have moved from the other direction as you noted

Just won a I'm Joshua Johnson we're discussing trends this year in New state gun laws and proposals part one of our new series the state we're in we're speaking to Scott Greenberg or executive editor of state line Chris Brown the co president of the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence and Richard Feldman president of the independent firearm owners association
Richard by the way before we keep going we mentioned that you are a former lobbyist for the un already
That firearm owners association for those who may not have heard of it that's that's a separate organization from NRA right or is it affiliated or is there any relationship no just clarify
No relationship between the two I headed up the firearm industry's trade association during the Nineteen nineties
Gotcha okay thank you I just wanted to make sure we're kind of clear on on the the distinction between your organization and the and the n._r._a. Scott Greenberger I Wonder if we could talk a little bit more about red flag laws and their impact the Jerry Brown the governor of California the outgoing four term governor of California
Just vetoed a bill that would have expanded that states red flag ball Jerry Brown is a Democrat very progressive but also thoroughly pragmatic and has pushed back
On Democrats given the rate of ways so this is an unprecedented in terms of getting vetoing something the Democrats would have wanted but what do you make of the veto
Well a ... you know California of course is a very blue state of progressive state and already had um
A a relatively speaking a pretty strong gun control laws in place so I'm In the Jerry Brown has a governed as a a pragmatic a liberal and progressive and so um [noise]
Uh you know in this case he felt like it perhaps you know with some of the concerns that ah Richard raise that uh
It went a little too too far um and a return and it's a question of of balance but I Would add also I think it's interesting that generally speaking a that a lot of the debate um post a Parkland has focused on
A these so called red flag laws or I'm
A limiting the gun access to guns for people a domestic abusers
You know the argument or the ... argument for for such a long time was that a guns don't kill people people kill people and it seems that now rather than trying to revive a for example on assault weapons ban uh the assault weapons ban from the nineties
Or people who are in favor of more um uh safeguards gun control are pushing on red flag laws are they're pushing on background checks and it seems like that's a potential uh common ground between people who are
A very strongly support their Second Amendment or what they view as their Second Amendment gun rights and and folks who would like a um some more ah controls and safeguards speaking
Of the end are a governor Larry Hogan of Maryland who's a Republican had an a minus reading from the national Rifle Association here he is endorsing a red flag law in February
I've said for years um that we need to do more
To keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill
And people with criminal backgrounds that's why we will push for and support
What is known as red flag legislation in general this policy would allow family members for law enforcement to petition the court for a lethal violence protective order issued by a judge which were prohibited individual
From having any firearms or ammunition
If the judge has clear evidence that the family member foes was a an immediate and present danger um ah causing injury to themselves or to others [noise] individuals with a mental illness should not have access to firearms period
That is Republican governor Larry Hogan of Maryland worth noting that he's a minus rating from the n._r._a. drops to a seat
As a result of huge support of these kinds of red flag laws Chris I Wonder what impact you think that that kind of influence would have on more states passing these kinds of extreme risk laws
I think it has a positive impact absolutely a and I think governor Hogan actually there eh he's doing the right thing and be you know he's a politician he has to be aware that that has an impact
On his NRA rating and has an impact on decorating decorating gets them as well and I think it relates back to the initial point
That I made that is part post Parkland really there is a groundswell of activism on this issue a huge new slate of polls that had been taken
Which show in every state across this country a vast majority well over fifty percent normally in the seventies or supporting exactly these kinds of measures
They're sensible measures they're pragmatic measures and they balance appropriately or the you know the second Amendment rights says of gun owners
West at the idea that we all want to be safe in our communities one of the most heartbreaking components of my job is getting polling data back and focus group information that really appealed to difference
About these laws in this context first
Americans overall when they ask about their fear associated with being shot
One of the most profound quotes I got back from a recent poll is well most people think I have not been shot yet and and that is a very concerning thank the second is many Americans are actually ashamed
About the epidemic of gun violence in this country and they want pragmatic solutions
Say certainly applied governor Hogan forgiving the right thing here but I think he like many politicians are looking at what their constituents want and moving forward knowing that these are popular and populist positions to take
I hear you Chris in terms of the pragmatic argument but you know when it comes to gun laws their constituents in their constituents I mean Vermont is a good example of that I mean ... was one of the states to ban bump stocks as part of a larger package of legislation on guns this year back in April Vermont's governor Phil Scott who was a Republican who had an a rating from the n._r._a.
Signed these laws in these bills into law
Nobody's got said he changed his mind about them after police
Foiled and alleged shooter's plans to storm a local high school and basically kill as many people as possible now here is some of the sound from the signing ceremony as he was signing outside the Vermont state house he was being heckled by opponents to gun restrictions listen
I support the second amendment [noise]
Our way you can really gearing everything we can make our kids in our community safe [noise]
Where our kids are afraid to go to school and parents are afraid to put them on a bus
Her police the tools they need to protect victims of violence or families can step in to prevent a loved one in life [noise] and
Part of the signing ceremony on the steps of the Vermont state house with Vermont governor Phil Scott who is a Republican Richard Feldman Philbin when you hear that moment from the signing ceremony ... what does that tell you about the the nature of this debate in states across the country
Well I think in many ways the pro gun community led by the national Rifle Association is somehow
Cornered itself by its own success on the politics of this issue transcends the policy of this issue and therein lies so much of the problem in getting this to be focused in a way
That we can achieve results that
Work for everyone and we can but not when we focus on the politics but only on the policy we really have to align those two and dealing with the perceptions versus the realities in this society it's highly
Unlikely that anyone you or I Know directly is going to be shot it's a statistical thing but of course it's gonna make news and we're all I'm
In the same boat when when we see things day in and day out we feel it gets all around us we deal as human beings with these perceptions um for so long now um

Back now to our conversation with Richard Feldman Chris Brown and Scott Greenberg or a few more different kinds of laws that we should touch on before our time is up we should talk about the minimum age is to purchasing long guns and rifles for states
For the past new laws that would raise the minimum age from Eighteen to Twenty one uh Florida State representative who ... who was a Republican sponsored new legislation on new gun control after the shooting in Parkland, Florida he had an eighth grade from the n._r._a.
Serious speaking on W F for TV in Miami about why he agreed to raise the legal age this is an edited version of his interview
A determining what age someone can do something is a judgment call and we do it in in many areas of our of our law making and so I think it was for that on was the fact that you have an Eighteen year old a who did purchase his wife and I think without that partake in fact he probably wouldn't have seen that [noise]
What about law abiding Floridians who are Eighteen Nineteen Twenty years old some of whom have gone and served our country and fought for our country overseas what do you say to those who feel like their Second Amendment rights are being
For what particularly that group of people that you mentioned are covered in the mall so if you have if you're a correctional officer if you're a parole officer if you're a law enforcement officer or or you served in the military society has already said that you're trained and can carry a firearm so this bill would not unfair that even at those ages
That state rep Hosea will leave out in Florida Republican state rep speaking to us for TV in Miami Chris I Wonder how you think it will play out with this law particularly because the n._r._a. is challenging it in court
Yes than our as challenging it in court I think a Marion Hammer has done a very effective lobbyists there for the
NRA for a long time um had as suit filed within twenty four hours of that measure passing
I think that it will certainly withstand judicial scrutiny from our interview 'em and be upheld and I think it's a natural reaction to that a mass shooting involving you know that are often
Um with schools individuals who are within that timeframe of Eighteen to Twenty one uh and I will know that Florida passed a package of laws or the minimum age being one
All of which were a really designed to address the that type of issues that we saw
A from Parkland at the age of the shooter obviously the fact that this weapon was actually kept in the home where he stayed on secured
And that's why the extreme risk laws so important so we're seeing these kinds of package bills a reviewed and introduced that the most notable point for me is it passed in the state of Florida
Rat has long been one of the strongest a sort of incubator ... of the ... legislative agenda and I think it's very telling
On obviously the reactions of Parkland and that that activism that took place immediately following a the Parkland shooting
I Would like to come back to save storage in a moment but there were ... by the way we did a program when we visited Salt Lake city
About guns in the mountain west states and and the nature of gun suicide in the mountain west in which
A state representative who joined us showed us one of these safe storage lockers that does open with your fingerprint I tried it it it works it's it's pretty fascinating you can find that conversation online at our website the one a dot org before we move on to other kinds
Of gun legislation Richard Feldman because I just get your sense in terms of
The ... real view on gun legislation DNA has said that so measures like bump stock restrictions could be examined maybe through the administration's authority on a federal level rather than the state level
Or we just kidding ourselves here should we just come out and just see the n._r._a. is not in favor of any new gun legislation that can be passed on a bipartisan basis are we trying to make the n._r._a. more can fifth wheel and more collaborative than it really is
Well first let's define something I'm always a little bit of a loss to understand when people talk about the n._r._a. ... member of the n._r._a. there five million and already members
Um there's the board of directors is the senior leadership there the consultants there are many in our race
There's my uncle was a card carrying life member of the IRA and we'll show you his card on demand if you ask with great pride
Is so many will myself included um but I I think we're talking about the senior leadership of an already here and um
Again when I said earlier an array finds itself institutionally boxed in a corner of if you're calling it gun control no matter what it is it could mandate that ah when you turn Twenty one you're given a gun
They're almost institutionally have to be against it because of the terminology in the political position of the terms gun control
Do you think they mean are they mean different things to different people at different times but
You know what I mean about Wayne LaPierre Oliver North of the leadership of the national Rifle Association what we hear you know from the big ... the main figures who speak with a national voice for the n._r._a. it's the
You know the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun it's those ads within the last that say you know they are coming for our freedom and they use their media and the n._r._a. as you know ... you know liberties left the place that an array that's who I'm Talking about
What you're talking about that's politics that's galvanizing the true believers that's about membership that's about fundraising
That's about a organizing for the next a political event both sides do it and there's nothing unusual about that whether we're talking firearms or the environment
Or any other hot button issues in America everybody does it that way perhaps we see it a little more
Distinctly in the firearm debate than others when we've been put on that side Scott well I just want to sides
I wanted to ah just ah to to add to that that you've seen on some of those issues issues you just mentioned and perhaps uh we're going to begin to see it on gun control as well that in cases where state legislatures are gridlocked and the power of a
Um the gun lobby is such that ah that lawmakers won't pass anything I'm a there is another outlet in many states and that's about initiative Washington state will have a ballot initiative in November that would raise the minimum age to buy a a
Semi automatic rifle to Twenty one uh Oregon people in Oregon and supportive a similar measure came close to getting out on the ballots we may see that I mean that's that was a pattern with marijuana legalization for example so that that might be a that might be coming in the future
Let me get to a few more of your calls and comments we did get a call about state gun legislation in Missouri for the person who was working for a democratic state reps office this is what she left in our inbox
This is Emily uh Laughlin calling from Missouri state representative tracing the curies office
In two thousand sixteen Missouri has house they'll six fifty six eliminating all permanent requirements for concealing Kerry and the state of Missouri leaving a loophole that allows domestic abusers to possess firearms since two thousand sixteen there's been a bipartisan effort to close that loophole
Leadership and the Missouri legislator will not news that spell or make it a priority to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers instead during the past session we spend our committee time focusing on bills that expand gun rights like has done Nineteen thirty six known as the guns everywhere bell that little lemonade almost all of the state's gun free zones thanks
For your dating on money
