[noise] [noise]\nAnd um you know it's interesting you know when we were able to welcome folks back to talk about this that means things you still happening and um since she was joining Scott I'm any thoughts on hearing the moves that I'm ... I'm a went through when a nuisance he reached\nOut to them in him again here we are looking at ease auction house oh Scott any thoughts\n[noise]\nI usually I Know when ... were in charge\nScott any thoughts\nWell number I obviously have ... with that and so I Can't speak on behalf of ah the auction house in the same was true receive\nBy specializing in the art work I work with any number of both artists auction houses galleries museums and private collectors\nAnd this is a very important discussion that of course thank everyone for participating in because\nIt's only through these types of conversations on through greater education if we're going to be able to hopefully accomplish to think\nIn the first is to clean up the market and so far as the small amounts of illegal material that you can use to be bought and sold and\nAlso to try and instill amount of confidence in terms of not only the native art market but especially in terms of native arts and so\nWhat are your thoughts on knowing in working with all these different types of folks um about making this flow better is there a need for tribes to open the door or um any thoughts on on how we can do to a point reduction houses now once we have an item first thing on\nThe list let's check with the tribe um talk to me\n\nOh I can only speak for her as my experience with some of the auction house was ... and there are those times when the material is culturally sensitive\nAnd it's only by knowing what is culturally sensitive that we're able to them and for him to come signers of the problems with the peace and informed them of some of the options that they have and so far as not taking things to sail\nBut as Shannon pointed out earlier the other types of Avon such as donation\nHowever one point of clarification is that while the number of nations are willing to sign the\nVirus form eighty to eighty three which puts a monetary value on a donation many nations have objections to doing that for him obvious reasons and so what I like to see is that\nThe institutions that are beginning to pop up on cash charitable donations\nThey're trying to help facilitate these returns whether it occurs through something like buybacks which is what happens with the previous sales at ease and we of course thinks the Annenberg Foundation so they're helping the buddy other instances where\nPeople can Joan banked property and it's still a tax deduction\nAnd yet be serving as somewhat of a middle man\nThe five but when you see free comes in return the item unrelated use to the nation so that they're not put in the position of having to put a price on a sacred property\nThanks for that and I do want to remind folks ... if you'd like to join us one eight hundred nine\nNine six to ... eat is the number anything or any are collectors listening a how do you feel about efforts like we heard earlier to get items food from an auction does it make your job more difficult can be considered not collecting native items because of the attention they get at these auctions you can share your thoughts\nWhen he'd hundred Ninety six to eight for each is the number\nAnd Scott when we hear about some of these um disputes or what is the ideal outcome 'em over these kind of items\nI feel like I'd like to think that one objects are sacred\nBecause they are returned to the nation I Do think as a means to be more education on the part of the public and specifically as far as the market and so far as what is and it's not safe for it\nAnd just because something is old as not necessarily always means that it's straight for it\nYou know Shannon had mentioned something earlier and so far is stolen property and unfortunately that happens however there are other instances were items are viewed her say legally purchased or they are just it from\nA member of the nation to someone who was a collector\nAnd the um goes situations you know the the legal issues I think are very very clear um [noise] so it's a situation of where the market has to correct itself\nAnd the ways that it's going to be able to do that is by working not only with the nation's um but of course with collectors so that they have a better understanding of what can and cannot be sold\nThanks for that you know what I'm also wondering if we have any tribal leaders in the audience to we think about all this money to hundred and Ninety six to eight in the number and you know I'm definitely want to hear your thoughts on this in any maybe even\nApproaches you nation is taking but like any thoughts to start off with\n[noise] ah what were his one start with Senator Kerry Ali sensitive and it's it's so important considering um there were things that types are going to at the moment\nUm I think it's important first of all I think that this is something that everyone has sort of work on collectively but if we were to think about where does it START I think it's important for try to engage with institutions\nLike museums or cultural centers because unfortunately as we all know\nNot very many tribes have culture centers are museums and\nSell 'em typical office in a culture departments it's sort of their responsibility to sort of create some sort of information that is supported by um like the tribal council administration and then share that with these institutions so that may be an auction house\nHas questions and they can get a hold of someone who is part of the tried they held the confidence to be able to maybe get get into contact\nWith someone who's working with one of the institutions to get an idea of what is sacred because there is a difference between a culturally sensitive sacred and objects patch on the right and when we're talking about law there's a difference between of things and\nWhen I uh went to some of the things that I went to create a created a collection guide for the Smithsonian and I may I and I went back to my tried I went to the um when I was seven which is a group\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd\nEven listening to native America calling them parakeet would and we are talking about predicting secret items were being sold at auction in what about a month would you like to see stronger laws to prevent items of cultural patrimony from\nBeing sold um DC fat I'm\nA there are ways to improve relationships with some of these places enter tribes uh what about art dealers are individuals who sell them or were they fit into the conversation phone lines are open everybody's enjoyed it invited to join us you can call in and wanting to hundred Ninety\nSix to ... feet are with us on the line from Santa Fe New Mexico meaning Sanders and she is a curator writer and cultural consultants come to us from them combination and Nina thank you for being here with us in just won't give you a moment to um wrap up your side door or anything more\nOn on what this really means go ahead\nAbsolutely [noise] um so I had a kind of add to what I mean I think he he has a really great idea there needs to be sort of a centralized non profit if you will that handle a lot of the thing you know that\nTheir responsibility would essentially be two tribes in creating collections care management\nEducating helping to educate collectors a tried lawmaker auction houses universities tribal colleges the students and travel colleges\nAbout what is a sacred object what is it an object of actual money and\nHow do you handle those things and I think it would also be beneficial for them to help us to try to build culture centers and build museums or a place where they can hold these items where these items are safe\nAnd I think that would kind of\nThat would help with a lot of this because there are quite a few institutions and individuals they're willing to return these items that tribes don't have anywhere to keep them and um these aren't obviously like for us\nWe have things that we wouldn't return to the river to the mountains there are things that we could keep in storage facility that neat standard [noise] um\nBut that isn't going to happen in how we have heard of someone that create like a centralized place where all this information is happening at everybody trust\nIn and I'm Wondering make sure I'm Wondering to what room maybe are\nMuseums complain all this money ask that question to our next guests Neal thank you for that um we're going to go to Mount Pleasant Michigan right now to fail to shine and Martin and she is the director\nOf the ... Center for an issue not be culture in life we ... we should ban the pot of water meat Indians also a descendent of the could hurry band of Lake Superior Chippewa my pleasure to have her here Shannon I'm\nAnd she said what do you think about this idea that's been tossed out and you know expanded further um of of a central place do you see museums are needed museums fitting into this or\nUm any thoughts on how to make things better\n[noise] well it was you and then to win a monitor uh yes there there are always ways to open up lines of communication so that tribal communities\nAre given a information regarding these types of of options as well as a active and ongoing looting of archaeological sites secret spaces that are that still happening to this day throughout the country and I want to commend my colleague\nUh Shenandoah Laughlin who is the executive director of the association of American indian affairs and they have taken a very active role\nIn providing a platform and opportunity and a network of forests to address these very critical issues as it relates to auction houses private donors\nAnd an underlying that uh the Native American graves protection repatriation act\nAnd how we can uh strength and this act as well as a strength and relationships with the United states a department of state and homeland security when these are options are are um are happening overseas\nAnd when we think of the laws shouldn't even how much stronger do they need to be\nThere are um a happening overseas\nAnd when we think of the laws shouldn't even how much stronger do they need to be very specific line if you could write one into one of these laws um that I think needs to be saying or put into protecting um any thoughts about laws changing them growing them or even indeed\nWell amending laws like ... and the ... archaeological resources Protection Act to um extend beyond what we would call you know nineteenth and Eighteenth century arrows I mean these laws\nAre don't always protect our our ancestors that live long ago so when these items oftentimes that are looted from mounds or very old sites a fall into the hands of private donors these laws don't always\nA extend that far back to provide any type of a recourse for tribes 'em to pursue as far as a legal action and penalties\nAnd soon when we think of ... a year from her two nations in their room in on this um what are your thoughts\n[noise] we'll tribal nations uh we need to continue our our network of information and granted there is a diversity are always within tribal groups and and regionally\nA but we need to you know stand together to um provide more support to organizations that are are raising issues nationally and internationally regarding these issues [noise]\nUm I ... the second\nA triple Indian tribe or Michigan and the ... center\nWe are part of an alliance here in Michigan that represents the twelve federally recognized tribe to ... to ... state historic tribes\nAnd that's called the Michigan ... cultural preservation and repatriation alliance Mac ... so I Would encourage other tribes and other regions to take a look at our website are bylaws\nAnd we have a very hard stance regarding\nA protection of our our cultural um items are sacred and ceremonial items as well as sacred sites and the return of our ancestors from museums and institutions nationally\nUm through our work we've also began to develop a protocols and communicating with a historical societies and I would take a look at historical societies as well they're often private and many of their collections come from private donors and\nTheir funding is is um sometimes month to month and when these historical societies close\nTheir doors their collections then become a open to any and all who may be able to purchase them but we work with these Historical Society is trying to compel them to donate their items back to the original tribes or or the aboriginal territorial tribes that ah they came from\nAnd so she knew when it comes to issues like we raised earlier in our mode um auction houses like one in New Jersey and the one in Paris selling items that possibly could be a cultural patrimony\nAnd getting those items back Shane what is your side to work with the auction house or just mind back in her new she's with that\n[noise] well we prefer to work with the auction house and try to reach out to the private donor\nI'm speaking to them directly regarding the the moral and ethical issue of trafficking a sacred and ceremonial objects and or a burial objects\nBurial goods are fewer belongings are often times on the auction block and you know what we need to understand that you know and and to speak with him that these items are not art you know that's that's something that\nGets a justification for them to uh sell these items to the highest bidder when they classify them as art so we need to uh um provide opportunities\nRadio satellite service can buy bread Michael

are still young enough to take the challenge and have a ... and a and a half of the big heart\nBut what does that American Heart grow smaller asks I way way we'll get to that and a few minutes I we ways name became well known here in the west after he was targeted by the Chinese government for his activism before that he was working in relative obscurity in Beijing in the mid nineties and for some years in New York City I look back\nOn those years now as an important season in his life\nIf you're among the winter then you come to spring here come to summer more and more pressure as us time his new book\nCapture some of those times it's called I way way Beijing photographs Nineteen Ninety three to two thousand and three and several photos he documents the final days of his father I change what a China is fine as modern poets and an artist who like his son felt the wrath of Chinese authorities\nAfter he passed away I feel your failure\nAlone and they don't belong to anybody and uh and maybe that's a moment you want to act so that's a a psychologically ... parish and for me to become a\n... suffer myself a new boss of yourself yes just like the godfather fail\nSo I'd like you if you would tell us the story of the preparations for his memorial after your father died in Nineteen Ninety six because the Chinese officials had their own ideas about how that offend should really unfold right\nYes is this a communist society Irish and have a clear hierarchy you know so he was a kick out from\nA Communist Party and he wants the same generation is a state leaders chairman long drawn out of people they weren't together but uh but he was having to criticize us or writers in someone against the party so your father was in that inner circle with now\nOh yeah yeah they're really core which is support sort of ... or ... ... of course have being cut out a from a party\nOr the untied revolution and uh spend about ... years somewhere yeah I well not just allowed to write towards his name's totally disappeared in the public as a memorial how did that memorial first they decided\nHis body has to be covered by communist flack is very high on there and uh I mean you're you're part of it is a revolution but I feel\n... uncomfortable you know I said you know you should not do something to somebody already passed away which you know it's me and goes to his way so I made that argument that says we don't need to cover his odds flag did they resist ... yeah they they told\nMe this or that you'll find that doesn't just in Ontario family\nWhich is very good argument they say a recent belongs to\nThe Communist Party or states was it a convincing arguments though no it's not as a ... is ... just her mind and has suffered so much that they took being covered by that\nPiece of red but I'm ... with his Hummer and cause that sickle said cool yeah I'm All right for me it's brutal hurts me and then there were the flowers flower as\nThis kind of Sarah money\nThey owe you seems to have a paper flowers you know if someone you know spend the next day a week later somebody dies they oh yeah I uh same I Will walk in the room I feel no no no we don't need to use an isn't being used before so they say why they're going to do I said that\nWell buys a fresh flowers my father's point his art has seen he life us so much relate to the highest a static document\nOn a moral judgment so I said I have to change it solely send out a A R people to follow them all they'll fight for some Beijing city well I Know they made a\nFresh for bad so he can sleep in the middle but still covered by this red blanket\nWall your father was ill you\nDid this performance I that's all I can call it a you intentionally smashed itching dynasty ... and a ... dynasty earn and you were a photograph smashing another are and how did these ideas come to you especially well your father was was dying not very much ideas is there any attitude\nOr some kind of a stupid ridiculous uh action ... to that kind of ... and all the time was your intention to shake up the Chinese public no it's not possible you'll have no path for the rest of society is seeing the sleep and they don't care\nIt was interesting when you said about smashing the vows you felt it was almost like a child acting out\nAnd I want to ask you about the middle finger because it's a photographic motif that you've used pointing a finger at the Hong Kong's skyline appointee middle finger at the Eiffel Tower Chairman Mao I felt like when I saw this it's like a rebellious teenager has just gotten a camera for the first time what is up with\nThe finger is just so sad to say about ... now I realize that don't do that anymore because I'm a girl older you know and the U.S individual in this society when I was kind of do I mean it's just ...\nSo you spent a lot of time in the United states do you feel you can still count on the U.S to be kind of the beacon of free expression around the world\nI don't race sinks

quickly these billions of tons of carbon might be released\nI think the the scary part is that we don't know what an extra four degrees of warming will do to this huge amount of carbon that's Stuart hearing that from ... we're trying to actively to figure that out here and\nHe says it's hard to accurately assess greenhouse emissions from Arctic soil because the whole system is so complex but it's also hard because humans have never won the planet up like we are now\nWe have nothing to compare this to at least from our species perspective wearing what climate scientists call no analog situation a massive global experiment\nThere's enough that we turn on that big Arctic permafrost machine or we don't know what it does [noise] um and until we actually figure out what it does maybe a good idea

the Trump Administration is getting ready to impose taxes on the other half of everything the United states imports from China that we don't already have terrorists on bart\nAnd we've got new figures on consumer spending this morning we consumers that is spent more for the seventh straight month last month and that's indirectly I'll admit I guess it's the marketplaces debris better shore and where when imagines things go from here with\nConsumer spending more and more and more for the past seven months without wages ramping up you might wonder whether some kind of issue is going to drop\nThere's no reason to believe that if there were spending it's poised for a material to slow down\nJames von ... is with economic forecasting firm I just market GDP Growth was three point five percent in the third quarter faster than economists were expecting\nThe state of the consumer is pretty much the best it's been in in decades and you know that's characterized by low unemployment

more hours we've been having more people be hired even though the wages for individuals have been going up rather modest late they're starting to pick up or now\nAs long as jobs keep getting created consumer spending should be strong so what might threaten jobs well terrorists one\nOver the next six months or so it's likely that we will see from flowing in employment and income as firms take a

company together red hat and IBM hope to take on the big big boys and cloud computing Amazon and Microsoft says Chris gardener at Forrester Research\nThis is this approach to say look we don't want to be in their shadow when it comes to how we want to be the first one player\nIBM hasn't been first that much lately like of course to monitor what the Sloan School of management at MIT says big blue

approved by voters rather than legislators called the ... is chairman of the yes on prop ... campaign\nHe blames the poor infrastructure situation on mismanagement\nThe politicians have more than enough money to fix the roads they just keep diverting the money so we don't need to add the cost of living burdens to working families to fix roads they should be putting the existing gas tax into roads rather than increasing it\nBut even if the gas tax word stay the same it wouldn't be able to keep up with the demands for one thing these prices haven't been indexed to inflation another reason

hundred none none needed\nAnd with us today from Tulsa, Oklahoma is dean Martin and she is a chef and she is Cherokee our pleasure to have shift here with us a tailor a thank you\nFor for kind of open things up here and let's get to taste em because so many people who are wondering okay what is it tastes like are we heard a little bit of French chef men\nIs about some of the food uh he has eaten or prepared um tell us more about how some of the smoking pace and maybe even while you're favorite ways to prepare it\nWell a would be a word that a lot of people like to use whatever they're describing the flavor of world rabbit a is Jamie\n... or ... you know they don't really know what that now or later is um I Would think that that kind of grass fed beef as car got mail and and be a little bit of that at some of our wildlife that we would use for game a hunting [noise]\nOh it is definitely a flavor profile that is a unique to its own uh talked about rabbit Leslie I'm I work with rabbit in\nMy corner a year and a Tony training but we're a little different um but privately they surely similar in fighter ah they have a little bit more ah interesting flavor profile work with\nSurprisingly there fairly similar in favor a they have a little bit more\nAh interesting flavor profile to work with um [noise] so I Would definitely recommend trying it with a after you cook it I'm trying it with little no additional seasonings and then go from there\nJust kind of learning you know how how you like to put it on your plate and I'm Taylor what about the nutrients do we get something special from either squirrels rabbits that we don't from other meats you know\nWell Quil in rabbit tend to be very lean meat\nThey're very healthy it does take quite a bit for your body digests so definitely um they're on lowering calories a so they wouldn't be something that could add interest here way find 'em and\nAnything of course uh that the animals we eat we get that from them so because of their non corn diet and they eat mostly that's and and vegetation um that could influence their\nFlavor and ... nutritional impacts so in my opinion I'm not a food scientist but I definitely would say that you do get um a little bit more than just a regular old crushed life me like or chicken\nOr anything so that maybe we have somebody who's studied some of this you want to add to the conversation give us a ring Wayne hundred Ninety six to eight for each can even share your favorite way to eat small game animals one eight hundred nine six two weeks for eight is\nThe number and I'm sure it takes a certain kind of skill you mentioned a little bit about this earlier Taylor I but what kind of lessons about food come from small game hunting and of course cooking it up\n[noise] um well uh with small game hunting it does take a little bit of it I have to get out and go hide things so you are physically active and you are going to go to church for your food in planning accordingly based on what you bring back um [noise] so\nUh\nThe uh\nUh sorry would you mind I totally lost I thought I was on I was on the phone thing there would you mind repeating the question\nSure we're talking a little bit about lessons you learned from hunting and and preparing these kind of animals\n... correct [noise]\nAh you definitely have to have a level of respect for life worth\nA lot of our um ... and ... a full tales including the smaller animals they all had less straight ties now how big characteristic type but then the uh in hunting these animals that are from our members\nOf a Cherokee um folklore [noise] ah they are to be honored because they're getting their life for you um we would avoid certain animals because of their grandma O'Neill\nUm significant but uh the lesson that was always learn from England you put your effort in and it will give back to you\nAnd I wonder how that compares to some of the folks out there with you or time\nShare your thoughts if you want to share a cultural aspect to all of this of taking small game give us a ring one eight hundred my nine six to ... we're going to introduce folks to an avid hunter coming to us a member of the White Mountain native corporation uh his name is just coaching and he joins us today from\nWhite Mountain Alaska just thank you for being with us\nYou're a good morning\nAnd just tells them about the side of hunting and just as a team or about lesson you learned and um I can only imagine what you're about to tell us go ahead any thoughts about what we learn a when we started hunting small game\nWell there's um a you know I'm In in some parts of rural Alaska you know it's\nUm you know it's almost daily I'm a you know to to grow up there on a daily basis and um I think I think probably one of the lessons learned but everyone is a you know one further Glenwood somebody's planning with somebody I'm and I'm\nHaving a plan on my which location where people would be the first uh um\nArea to look for the smoking um and ah\nI I think the murder is wondering especially when we're kids you know we you know we would find it to learn from you know when we talk amongst each other when we're no first second grade on though would\nBe one of the ... um remember um you know ... years ago or a young age I guess this is uh what are the most\nI'm big into just how does it work when you're going out to I mean do you go out there and say okay I'm going for doesn't ruin for five you know talk to me about one of the hunting trips\nWell we just um you know the we pointed out um you know what would be looking for a widow ... Bruce ... robots um my mom and in many parts of a\nRural Alaska uh we we we mostly on what we're going on on what season I'm is so right now it's fall and we're going to be looking for what we've been looking for ...\nWhich are undergoing now and then just when it snows it's for the last a book about them you know I'm really most switch over to another small\nI'm ... years um three hundred right now with them\nAnd I want to hear the taste but um I got a caller on the line uh that wants to join us and if you want to join us when he hundred women six to eight four feet we have Lucille who is in

call\nOne eight hundred nine nine six to eight for eight and it's also one eight hundred nine nine need if it's going to take a call and go to a caller in northern New Mexico listening in on king you and him commenting forgiveness Rene go ahead you're on your\n... during this morning do now so yeah that's the question earlier that I don't think uh [noise]\nWell I I'm not sure if anybody touched base on yet yes much dish and or culture or how you see small game as opposed to a big game and I wanted to touch that was okay sure sure\n[noise] so [noise] and my tribe or my father always taught me that even the smallest game that you kill needs to be um [noise] respected I'm\nWith the utmost respect as if as if it was either ... or a moose or a deer or announced [noise]\nAnd a\nStory I remember when I was [noise] gee that was probably like\nSeven or eight and a I had a wooden bow and arrow that eastern Asia and I had shown that first Jack rabbits with I'm Sorry I Can't tell with a bow and arrow and I was so proud and I ran a home and my father had me put it in a special place\nAnd he came and he\nEmbraced the animal and uh [noise]\nUh forgive me as I get emotional\nUm she feels so proud of me and she started teaching me about respecting the smallest animal because\nOf hearts just like any other animal may have soles they have children and there are a part of our culture but real ground puzzles and I'm\nFrom that moment on my father and I had a bond that no one could have a break and\nHe taught me about the traditional spiritual isn't hunting the game and even the little town hall is to be respected with the most most respect and I I ... some of my cousin ... family members the same when you bring all\nYou know you put it in a special place of the family can embrace\nIt whether it be a tail a jak rabbit a quail um\nGees it doesn't matter it all has heart they all have lungs stay all breeze they all bleed red and\nWhen you're done you're you send it home you send it back to the spirit world you send it back and this conversation is very emotional for me because this time that my father and I went to\n... and you know what I as I feel you and you know many of us can remember greed hunters in our families who taught\nHow to do this in a very respectful way um and even explain why you are give respect these animals and they really appreciate you just even that reminder even though it's small game um it does have an important role\nIn in a place of respect caller I Do appreciate you giving us a ring and I guess with that too I'm\nReal solution good thoughts to those folks who are getting ready to use this part of the season for hunting and remembering stories like this or why are you do what you do when you go hunting lazy we're taught thank you for your call there in northern\nNew Mexico I got to my folks are going to introduce you to work and say hello to twenty recast the door and she is an indigenous food activists and cultural project

also in Anchorage, Alaska we have and Sadler and she is the creator and host of Anna's Alaska off the beaten path she is you pick and a pleasure to say hello to her as well hello and [noise]\nAnd she is the creator and host of Anna's Alaska off the beaten path she ... been a pleasure to say hello to her as well he'll go at\nIt more than a hello\nGreat to have you here and to give you a moment we just heard from a caller on the Mexico um you know very emotional about those connections in lessons he learned about this and I'm Wondering does not extend to the way you were taught to about\nA ... game or even just incorporating it into you know our daily diets go ahead\n[noise] yes and that's actually applied here where we live um [noise]\nYou're looking in a traditional approaches hunting is not just taking the game but also having respect for the animal isn't being and being part of the natural world which is Nicole from Missouri\nAnd while you're in the game is not just just for sport you're taking to feed your family taking\nAir also I'm taking a moment as the man from New Mexico have mentioned you know paying that respect to the animal and because he's feeding your family\nAnd you still part of this natural oil that has his family also but he did was just by creator knowledge to help provide for us [noise]\nAnd so when we think about just even another extension of all this we heard from\nA chef and in taking us back two times before a you know we're people more settled today and we heard from a hunter and then there is a special role of where some of this game goes next in both twins to you and and uh\nUm take it from there and talk about preparing a small team or anything you want to tell us when the about um you know going in in incorporating it into diet uh go ahead anything there\n[noise] okay and incorporate into today's away eating okay my re introducing a several species of smoking on England is called ... and it's a desert ... it's sustained Apache

doctor Janine peas is with us she is a faculty member and humanities and social scientists little big corn college although principle of the chicken ... immersion school\nAnd didn't even before the break you were telling us about this rapid word collection each ten days that I'm came together and collected almost Fifteen thousand words and you were mentioning I'm One of The Elders ah\nWas saying that he was using words that\nEr and collected almost Fifteen thousand words and you were mentioning I'm One of The Elders ah was saying that he was using words that he hadn't used a in a very long time please continue\n[noise] well we were I'm able to have you know topics that involved memories from long ago when conversations that they had had with their parents their grandparents a local story tellers or even folks in the community gatherings and\nSome of The Elders were saying well I went home and I was visiting with my wife for talking with my brother and we remembered all these others\nOther words that would pertain to those topics\nSo it was like opening chapters that probably had been you know maybe close for a while\nI'm with the discoveries went on a we found that there were a number of young people really really is it surprising number of young people who had been raised by their grandparents and of course we know who these people are but how much crow do they know\nWell it turns out we call these are folks are college forbid uh children raised my grand grand mother grandparents that we have some young or you might say\nFountains of knowledge who have an amazing a grasp of the whole language and we're um so The Elders were able to recognize and I and some of The Elders were saying to me these young people know so much\nWell you know when they were raised by their grandparents the knowledge skips a generation of ... most them closer to that\nThat time when probably our community was using a solely the crow language for\nAll communications um and you know we've never had a chance to say well let's assess how much we know is individuals the crow crow people don't go in and take a test and no and get to know what they're what the depth and breadth of their vocabulary as\nAnd so individuals came in like after the session they come in and said to me you know something there's\nA new words I've never heard before but there's some of these topics I just know so much and I didn't realize how much I Know that I can share\nAnd the value of it the treasurer of it that was the astounding I think measure across the board is the people that were in the sessions just came to realize I Know so much I Know this and how does this sort of the dimension the depth and breadth of what they they could contribute\nAnd you know a lot of our elders have retired from\nThere or whatever their careers were and uh the potential of their contribution in this initiative goes well beyond our first Eighteen hundred topics we expect in the next year to have one or at least one more rapid word collection initiative\nThat will take another Eighteen hundred topics in our living language and we're ... we're just really excited to see how that that goes\n[noise] well I Want to talk to you more about that this is such a fascinating topic to put a dictionary together\nOf 'em are indigenous languages and to have that opportunity to have elder sit together and uh\nExperience that that's so cool and what do you think about it give us a call the number is one eight hundred nine nine six she we for eight that's what's a one eight hundred nine nine you know one of ... voices into the conversation on the line now we have a ... she is the Choctaw language curriculum coordinator for the Mississippi\nBand of Choctaw Indians where she is also a

... rolled member of the tribe as well\nEither ... or they don't\nAll right thanks so much for all of you joining us today I'm On the other would start with you um ... tell us about the dictionary that that's a you have for the Mississippi ban has talked to\nA low right now what we have is the teaching dictionary that we um put out in two thousand fourteen it's considered a child version and it has sixteen hundred words\nThe reason that we wanted to publish a dictionary was because we were going to be teaching that chocolate language in the schools for thirty minutes every single day and for people who haven't had a lot of conversations in Choctaw with little kid\nAnd I was like a daunting task so we gave them a dictionary that hopefully help them you know I'm a lady simplify the language a little bit for the little kids because\nOur kids are growing up not speaking chopped off and um it's not natural for a um speaker to uh you know be patient and um\nCome up with the word is it'd be you know to simplify for a little bitty kid or non speakers [laughter] that's great and and do what did you hear from the teachers about using this this tool\nWell I think it was helpful because I'm\nThe dictionary that they have access to is the buying tend to one and\nUm it's really um it's really thick dictionary and it's got a lot of obviously words and\nI'm the injuries are really long\nI feel like the simplicity of the teacher dictionary has been really helpful to them and we also gave them access to it um the PDF document so they have it on their phones and they can search for things like you know if they want us a butterfly um especially with the\nSpelling size they know how to say hush hush the Bolshevik but they don't know how to spell it they can look it up on their phones are in the I'm teaching dictionary book\n[noise] decent I understand you guys went recently to a conference and learn a little bit more about putting together dictionaries tell us about that\n[noise] [noise] Oh yes ma'am we had been collaborating with some\nLinguists over the years there and help this document the Mississippi charcoal language and I'm just turned out there I'm

I. T. I. is a brand new stations from you will be in South Dakota it's owned by the shining rivers who tribe and they're airing a native America calling\nFor the first time today hello and welcome to K. I. P. I thank you so much for carrying our show we really appreciate it we're talking native language dictionaries today if you want to get in on the conversation there still time the number is one eight hundred nine nine six to eight for aid that's ... hundred nine nine\nNative I'll be on a TBI is with us She's the Chuck Todd language curriculum coordinator for the Mississippi band of Choctaw Indians and I'm a ... we were talking with Janine before the break about um ... different ways to approach a\nTeaching the language was apps and a new variety of things um how how would be nice decided or\nYou're going to approach you know building a new dictionary when you do something like a rapid word collection\nWell right now I Believe we're just using that data bases that we have um you know somewhere it's from the ... area and\nI'm Erin brought a lot of work from the eighties that if I'm constantly having language development meetings which we just got out of a you know every time we hear a new word I Try to censor Jason and\nHe puts it into the data and that's basically I think how it's progressing we have a ton of example of phrases and a sample Senate says\nThat were written down I'm In the last Fifteen Twenty years that we're going through and I'm looking at a lot of them and I'm like oh it's just ... dictionary and especially when I'm trying to you know correct or not crack by like\n... um I find out that slow these might not be in the database so that's basically how it's growing\nAll right and do you mean um when you did the the rapid word collection was there any time when there was maybe some disputes about a certain word or I mean I you know maybe not like fighting among each other but you know differences of opinion\nVariations of words and how they're pronounced our language is very descriptive and we were involving people from six districts we have three bands of the ... of the uh follow kept people and so we found\nThat um people and we generally are people know that there are differences in the fans and also even some familial or even localized differences are we found that there are families and a localized groups\nThat have named every technology that's come along\nAnd there are others that didn't do that and so um you know if we were originally thinking well maybe we'd have to be inventing where it's we haven't had to but the discovery is it among our people there's variation and we welcome that a discussion\nAnd it got rather lively some of them were saying well this is the way my great grandfather's set it I was a little kid at his feet at this\nAnd it got rather lively some of them were\nSaying well this is the way my great grandfather's set it I was a little kid at his feet at the sweat lodge and I heard him say it this way and someone from prior which is eighty five miles away said well this is the way it was said by and so on like that and they talked about it so but what the what the process allows and a and welcomes actually\nIs to have that variation those don't have to counsel one another out they are included\nAnd that you know the difference maybe a slight variation in the word itself but we want all of that in there because we want to have a a dictionary that represents the living language and it's so important to do that when you start restricting\nWhy it said there's this is a way this word as sad as opposed to this well you know you take the the very vitality out of the language and there's reasons for those differences and they talk about that in the sessions\nYou heard the verbal the discussions that went on and and uh they got really quite lively and sometimes very hilarious and sometimes actually emotional and the sense\nThat there are things they hadn't remembered and the reference to the people from there you know back generations um stories that had been told of even warrior experiences\nAnd battles and all of that came through and so we're\nUm it's it's the whole gamut I guess you might say of reactions but just because one person says it this way and another says it this way doesn't mean that they eclipse one another no\nAnd um but they need to agree also on how it's spelled but listen to it and how is it spelled and they each each of the groups had to appoint among there among the five of them someone that was actually writing down the words and with the proper accents and all of that so these folks\nAre all literate in the language is well we really have a wealth of speakers you know we've got twenty five hundred very fluent crow speakers at least that count actually maybe somewhat slow alone because that comes from the census and you know do people identify themselves that are like when the census taker comes around but\nWe have a wealth of information\nAnd knowledge and we're at a perfect I'm really moment of\nLike you might say it's a pivotal moment for us to be able to collect our language in this way and the dictionary then becomes a major learning tool in wherever these learners are and we're hoping they're everywhere but we of course are very interested in our youngest learners\nHow do you feel about um non native or non crows using the dictionary using the work that you raised in a to learn the language themselves\nYou know from the beginning we're just very interested in having every learner anywhere who wants to learn the language we're a small group of speakers were small tribe there's Thirteen thousand members of our tribe and probably another five thousand descendants this is the location of the of solitaire\nPeople this is it a our audience isn't something that's going to go worldwide\nUm but there are people here in there who are interested in the crow language and all of our apps are free um our books are online can be purchased by anyone and when we have our summer Institute for language learning we have an intense\nA crow language learning for beginners anyone can earn rural were very anxious to have anyone who's interested in and\nNo not the market isn't huge [laughter] but we're not interested in being restrictive at all\n... ... interesting I mean I Know what about you how do you feel about I'm a writer who in the Mississippi Choctaw\n[noise] um well I don't think there's as much interest as some people might think like you know there's not going to be a ... million people coming in and taking the dictionary and you know learning the chocolate language but\nI'm ... ... calling we saw life so much interest from the linguistic community and um I think it's good that they have an interest in shock though because like me personally I don't understand like every grammar rules\nAnd then someone else can explain that to me who looked at the dictionary like I'm all for 'em you know whatever helps\nOur language at this point because we don't want to\nYou know my generation the twenty to thirty year olds to die in Seventy years and take the language with us and all we leave is you know the written word and\nUm I'd rather be able to have it explained to me and then I can explain to someone else can we create speakers yeah and that's going to take a lot of effort is that takes you know people who are members of the Mississippi talk to 'em that's great and whatever like I said whatever helps\nNot you know getting high cook I mean I Do go much much Iraqi make would

upcoming flu season your flu vaccine protects against those viruses it does not protect against other viruses such as cold as stomach viruses or I guess other very different influenza viruses that are not in the vaccine\nCreate so we'll just make sure we get our flu vaccine every year to stay up to date [noise] and [noise] we may have touched on this but can you talk about any side effect of the flu vaccine\nUm we do hear quite often you know people wondering if they're going to get sex and getting them back into\nThat as an excellent question the flu vaccine cannot costs glue illness are it can cause mouth bad effects that may be must be mistaken for the flu comment body flex from the flu that includes stored and us redness swelling from the shot\nYou could also have had a fever\nMuscle aches than idea\nThese side effects are not the flu if experience that all these effects are usually mild and last only one to two days the viruses and the flu shot or not alive they're killed viruses any side effects you experience I not contagious to others\nI think that's really important knowledge and so you cannot get the flu from getting the flu vaccine I'm anti you may have some of the symptom mentioned but that they will go away and wants to today's today\nSo joyous you weren't going to talk to us a little bit about the people that are at highest risk for developing a slap on the mind telling us about that\nIs the people that um we try to encourage or they every other health care a physician and a practitioner try to get the um people that have a diabetes\nHeart disease type a pressure people that go to um dialysis which are [noise] people also there are ... have aids and a\nHalf immune system um problems with their immune system they're the ones that we try and target and that we need to get in as soon as possible so that they won't be exposed to the virus on later on down the line [noise]\n... are just making sure that if you are kind of in one of those categories that you do go ahead and get the flu vaccine as long as it's safe for you [noise]\nUm [noise] so ... how would someone do if they had the flu it talked about the vaccine but now let's talk about how would you know if you have a clip\n'em it's mild symptoms are\nPretty mild sometimes um you can have fever and cough sore throat runny stuffy nose body aches headache chills and just feeling tired Fifteen and sometimes not all the time uh\nDiarrhea and vomiting all those are the main um symptoms that will kind of show up to [noise]\nOkay that yeah that definitely sounds like a slow so having a fever cough a sore throat runny nose body might besides that you might have to live or not but it it's a possibility um do does everyone needs to go to the emergency room that has a symptom\nUm you know ... up these symptoms I mentioned earlier those are mild symptoms and yeah it hurts when you have money eggs but you don't need to go to eat or um because it's a viral infection and when you have a viral infection and there's no antibiotics\nThat well I'm sure it you just need to stay at home\nUm bed rest is recommended a lot of fluids and taking Tylenol or for your fevers can help and\nIt has its encourage that um if you are feeling sick and we're coming up into the seasons where um we're doing our traditional dances our culture um where people are going to the cave us now so um\nIf you're sick you need to stay away from going to the chemo for it to close and passing this virus to other people that are there that's very important you need to if you know you're sick you need to stay home\nI think that's a really important message for all of us that at first feeling sick sometimes at MIT past us to stay home and rest which is what our body so [noise] um [noise] but I Would imagine enjoys that there are certain circumstances in which going to the emergency room would make that would you say that so\nYeah there's always times when you know that um it's more than just a mild flu especially for children to be a tend to get more sick more faster um\nHave you noticed that your child is breathing faster having trouble breathing that kind of have a bluish tens around maybe they're um miles [noise] ah their fingernails and they're not drinking their real tired they're not waking up [noise] um\nWhen you try to interact with them and they're very irritable they're not wanting to eat 'em\nAnd you just start coughing fever you need to um make sure you get them into the hospital Archie are to have them check as soon as possible and also the adults to [noise]\nIf um [noise] adults are having difficulty breathing like having shortness of breath painter pressure to that just are abdomen confusion more\nSevere vomit um [noise] I don't I'm not a mild form of [noise] the flu and the\nGreat so thank you for that clarification so just feeling a little bit by the amount of um ah you know just runny nose and stuff [noise]\nBut Haitians so just feeling a little bit about maybe a mile off some um ah you know just runny nose and stuff [noise] possibly don't need to be seen in the ER but if you are worried by all means like\nYou bring 'em yourself or your child and so that wraps up our talk on the blue um we do have a special guest here today with not a ... a hundred\nJohnson she's one of our family positive about November he'll be awkward for her and I will be passing the Mike over her\nHigh every one I just was listening to this excellent conversation thank you so much for us to protect 'em for putting this show together um and thank you so much that we enjoy for coming out here and for all of the work that you've been doing vaccinating so many people in the community I think that ... I just wanted to\nUm emphasize a couple of things that I was hearing which I think this is really great information as we're providing and especially the difference\nBetween kind of mild flu symptoms where it's okay to stay home and symptoms where you might need to come into the emergency department if you're having real difficulty breathing not being able to keep yourself hydrated those kinds of the one\nI just wanted to share because we were having a conversation without the help under about how we have a lot more availability in our clinic right now so if you're kind of unsure which category you fall into was just something that I can just stay at home and get better or is this\nSomething that is something different or needs to be checked out you can also call for an appointment at that will be how Chris I'm sure just called them a number talked to the appointment unit and we can often get you in with the same day appointment with your provider if you have one or with another provider so that's another way to get\nChecked out um although definitely emergency room with always available\nAs well that's a great point Dr Johnson thank you um and that phone number for anyone listening is Ninety eight seven three seven six hours and and you can offer an appointment if you don't have a provider you can get one set up we're lucky to have a bunch of new providers your\nUm and we have a lot of available detail by all means we would love to the un clinic and these you know ...\nAnd then the other thing that I just want to share is that I've had a lot of peace and I'm\nTold me that they don't want to get the flu vaccine because they feel like one year they got the flu vaccine and then that next week they got the worst that they've ever had in their lives do you guys all talked a little bit about how\nThe flu vaccine can't actually caused blew 'em so I just wanted to kind of share my theory about why that happened I think Mickey you mentioned that it takes two week right for the flu vaccine to actually work so you're not protected from the flu for the first two weeks after you got it\nAnd so if when people do get a really bad blew a few days or weeks after they get the flu vaccine we think that's just\nBecause they weren't protected yet and it was just kind of random chance that it happened after the flu vaccine I Would encourage everyone to get the vaccine um to keep yourself protected um but I also can't promise it's a hundred percent America um it doesn't protect against every single fu straighten right [noise]\nRight well thank you so much for coming out and we look forward to having another house called talk I'm In the near future at your flu vaccine thank you\n[laughter] or or or\n\n... ... and the

Titus ... is inflammation of the gums that's when the gums get red and swore an angry and infected\nAnd then the next one is the paradigm Titus and that's when the infection spreads and gets into the supporting structures around the cheap like the bones and the ligament and those kinds of things and actually can progress to the point that our chief fall out\nThe third kind of oral disease that we have this oral\nCancer and there are things that we can do to prevent oral cancer\nAlthough it's not like ginger by this and I'm ... and tooth decay which are completely preventable oral cancer can be caused by things like smoking tobacco drinking alcohol we can also reduce\nUm some of the other bad habits but we have like picking at our gum tissue one other thing that is really important that we can do is if we're of adolescent age we can have the human papillomavirus\nVaccine and the ages to start for H. P. V. vaccine or eleven twelve years of age and\nUp to Twenty one for boys\nAnd up to twenty six for girls so parents out there the H. P. V. vaccine is really important in preventing cervical cancer as well as oral cancers [noise]\nWow I didn't know that that HDTV vaccine which is a cancer preventing vaccine actually helps prevent um oral cancer to 'em so with project zero I Know that a lot of the focus is on pregnant women so um what are come come in oil problem um that pregnant women face\nSo that we have a three different oral problems that pregnant women face the first one is to the case which I'm Dr Helms talked about a little bit second one the\nGum disease which is also joined divided\nIn Korea Don Titus the third one is a non cancerous or oh gross I'm including ... granted brand new Loma I'm and that's basically when it's caused by a humble not changed in the bacteria okay and so it sounds like\nPregnant women can kind of get the same dental problems that anyone can get 'em why is it particularly important for pregnant women um to um be concerned with oral health\nSo gum disease has been associated with peach farm labor and that's because there's a hormone that I'm pregnant women have called the London which increases the information and then the ... and\nI'm also the hormones that stimulate labor [noise] the second one is gum disease and it's also associated with low birth weight and babies the third is if my mom had tooth decay she can pass it on past the bacteria on that causes tooth decay to her newborn baby wow so those are\nReally important reason so the house of a mouse during pregnancy you wouldn't think about it but it actually\nUm if it's not in a healthy situation could and potentially increase the chance of preterm labor of low birth weight babies that's incredible um and then the other one is that\nAnd the bacteria that a mother has in her mouth I'm after the babies born I'm Dr how you were talking about the good bacteria versus the bad bacteria and that um if the bacteria balance isn't good for the moms and that bacteria will get passed to the baby and then um\nThat infant might start off as kind of a unfair shot at having good health and um preventing cavities and things like that so [noise] um or how this extra important for pregnant women um so how do pregnant women keep their mouths healthy what should they be doing\nTo the first and most important thing is and brushing we want moms to brush at least two times a day for two\nMinutes so you can play your favorite song that's maybe two minutes long while you're brushing your teeth are we saying your ABC's their kids um and that two times a day at once right before bed and then\nWhen you wake up in the morning [noise] and we want to make sure that we're brushing our teeth with foreign containing to see and that's another important steps sometimes\nWe get to safe and we don't realize that that isn't half right in there [noise] we also want to use 'em a cleaner like Fox or to like ... at least once a day so\nWe're brushing two times a day and then with watching once a day [noise] we want ... I'm In a month just either dentist as\nSoon as she knows she's pregnant and sometimes there's a lot of missed out there and that is um when you're pregnant you're not allowed to go see the dentist actually are for almost um most of dental um problems so dental treatment it\nSaves through altering masters and in fact the negative consequences of not going to the dentist are greater than the treatment risk\n[noise] we also want moms to get for it punished treatment to protect their teeth and reduced the bacteria which will reduce to reduce the chance to passing the bad bacteria onto her baby the\nFirst step it is I'm chewing pilots sometimes so say let's all as a ingredient in some of the gum and you want to look if you're buying gum you want to look at the ... and that should be the first ingredient in them that you have\nSome of the gum and you want to look if you're buying gum you want to look at the ... and that should be the first ingredient in them that you have\nWe also want to reduce their sugar in ... which I'm we want to do all around not just for or a house but we don't want to drink soda you don't want to drink juice and\nWe want to limit our bread and tea so pregnant women have changes in their diet they might not be as healthy and if I'm pregnant mom has morning sickness she should rent with water after vomiting and not brush for at least twenty minutes that's because the accent of sitting around them\nUm others mouth and you don't want to act that you've ever been to the teeth if among should um brush your teeth right after she throws up [noise] wow I didn't know that either\nBecause I feel like when I'm at least when I was growing up it doesn't taste very good and so brushing your teeth might be something that um someone might want to do to feel

fundraising event [noise] can you share with our KU what our listeners what the event is Justin [noise]\nThe event is an annual fundraising campaign that we hold and I believe that one of the uh [noise] what the strength of this challenge is is this for hope you pull in a lot of snow this is that we're\nVery competitive people that were very spirited and that we show a lot of pride in the educational institutions whether this high school\nOur team in support of this awesome challenge um we know that that ASU in a deal and you know they are sort of the the sleepers a cells of the of the competition they like to wait they don't show\nAll of their cards until the last minute so um but we are out there\nThe Arizona crushers is basically anyone else who is not an alumni with ASU innate you or your day and I want to\nActually uh submitted a challenge to chairman pneumonia must and she is an artichoke to make a donation this morning to the crushers and we'll look forward to it spirited competition and uh we look forward to your continued support and thank you for having us here this morning on radio\nSure so you want to add anything to that yeah\nI'm wow a and a very nice for the challenge there so you have these pressures and they have all kind of unusual names like artichokes\nGang [laughter] um but I just wanted to talk a little bit or butter Hopi students and we have a puppy students who are attending universities across the United\nStates Alaska Louisiana New York a majority of course are in um Arizona but the pressures of course are\nEveryone outside of our three State University and I wanted to mention because it is Halloween time there is actually\nA college um called trans solving a university and we have a hope he's attending that college and they are getting funded because it's an accredited um university and I'm just wondering I Wonder what their um mascot is in there but we got\nTo get them included in the pressure's\nThere you go so hopefully our alumni or an and students right now I'm listening to this and I'm for families out there can you want listeners we do streams so you can go to W. W. W. dot KU Y. I. dot net so sure that information I'm with those that are\nNot here at home so that they can they connect it here and here's this awesome\nUm conversation that we're having with these so it sounds like I'm this challenge can get very competitive\nSo you want to share that with us Justin [noise]\nWe weren't sure if you will for it does get very competitive and it's funny because you know people really do do that the flavors at our website because on our website you can check the progress with the challenge you can see what the donation\nThe visit our website because on our\nWebsite you can check the progress of the challenge you can see what the donations amounts are up to date for each team and so some of the\nThe chief members or friends if ... there'll be a refreshing the page every so often especially towards the end waiting to make their last minute donation to whatever it is that's going to get them over the edge or sometimes you know you folks calling the office\nAnd saying you know we're we're we are how ... how much more do we need to be on top\nAnd then sometimes they'll they'll make that difference over to get them up on top and uh it it does get very competitive and so you know you are if if you're somebody that has a a Facebook account and during the ... church where he'll cut time between you of being a few and you see a lot of the trash talk that happens during that time it had\nThat type of atmosphere is kind of similar to to with our our members and and with our um donors and so it's interesting and it's all for you know a good cause and so the winter's over all our our students and they're the ones that ultimately benefit from\nThe competitiveness of all of that are involved with this challenge\nMost definitely think he dressed in All right so who who who either pass winner who's who's one before\nAnd and so it's interesting to to prep for this interview I had to go back through the archives and the history of this challenge\n'cause I've only been with the ... for short period of time in in this uh the inaugural challenged started in two thousand four and so this year is our fifteenth year of hosting this challenge and so going back through the history of this challenge I told a looming\nThis morning that you know this this\nChallenge may be renamed to the the the in a new alumni challenge because they have one eleven times during the history of this challenge\nAnd each of Arizona State University of Arizona there's an crushers each have one once and so each team definitely has the big three underneath their belt but ah as a with every year coming I think he's a team has a chance to to get another notch underneath are both going forward [noise]\nWow that's amazing and northern Arizona university the lumberjack there are just right might down the road um so you want to add anything to that conversation anything else popping in your mind yeah\nOr something that just come across the and you know she pulled out and even mentioned this earlier being in Arizona State alone being a true true ruin and go from the will is that in twenty Seventeen which was last\nYear uh we we did win the challenge which was our very first victory and you know I think that uh that was kind of a monumental moment for for a few alumni because uh throughout all these years you know at that time he does the fourteenth any also you know fourteen years of challenges to finally pulling out to be victorious so you know that\nThat was definitely something cool to see to be able to seal the border [noise]\nYeah I'm sure your classmates will say how could you forget that [laughter] yeah I had anything\nYeah as a in a U M lumberjack alumni\nUm where where are proud of all our wind but you know because of our proximity of the ... nation to flag we do have a lot more students attending that university and a lot more alumni so truly sheer numbers but I'm both an issue and then you have a as long\nAs crushers um those are much further away but they've started to work on strategies to reach out to their groups and um yeah last year you know I asked you took us all by surprise and\nBoy we didn't we didn't um stop hearing about it until early part of this year and they rub it in and I'm sure they're getting a rabbit and again\nAll right so I'm ... can you show and I came I listen is again when did when did the challenge began and does it end or what what's the plan\nThat the challenge began\nA last week on Monday which was October fifteenth and then the challenge goes all the way until next Monday October of twenty ninth and so Lewinsky to share some information about how to get involved about how are we accept our donations and so that would be the the date to circle on your calendar\nIf you do you plan to donate in October twenty ninth to make sure that your team a becomes victorious so all you from the devils out and hope you land throughout the nation I Hope that you'll rice the challenge\nSo is there a time or is it that come down to the time it\nDoes and and that kind of depends on the way that you plan to donate sore online donations are going to close at ... pm and that's on October twenty ninth\nAnd that would be through our website but if you plan to mail a check or money order then that just has to be a dated by October twenty and I use for it to be able to count towards the uh the competitive side of the total for each team [noise]\nAll right well um how can the alumni\nContinuing to support this effort [noise] yeah the alumni\nCan do several things first of all just mentioned the our use of social media we have a great tool that we call word of the day hope the word of the day and the staff\nOr had created words and they describe it and they sent it out through Facebook while during this two week alumni and challenge each of the groups have been given a two spots two words of the day so for example you know with the University of Arizona\nWe've um we used to be fair down as one of the word and\nThat once you get that information those view of a graduate to get that out and just encourage your friends family colleagues to consider donating to don't people can go to our website\nWWW dot Hopi Education Fund dot org and you'll find that you can either donate\nOnline or you can pull up I pledge form and I run that off and get that over to us we do accept pledges so and they will be counting into the total\nIf they are received before the end of the challenge um that's really important [noise] so um the main thing that alumni can do is get into the spirit get into the competition share this information with your um all of your contacts and that that alone will help add greatly to the challenge [noise]\nGreat\nOkay so we're coming down to they end up our conversation here with the heath whose the Hopi education and down might find if you're just tuning in this case why I have an eight point one s M and this is Bonnie gene here in the studios with\nThem and my neck [noise] Justin\n... and Kansas I'm On now and we kind of coming to the end up our conversation regarding the alumni challenge so um I you know this ... you know it sounds it it is\nA lot of time that challenge is a lot of fun but I'm sure there's a lot of work involved um in you know carrying out um any of that\nWe will refer to them as she's so congratulations ... for your recent selection as president of the education and ... fund can you tell our listeners how long term is as president of peace [noise]\nA Scully thank you Bonnie I'm all he's president serve a term of one year [noise]\nOh okay is that for every year so every year the the heat as you are the huge organizations like someone or are you so much that are you in a\nWhile you are nominated and elected by the executive committee normally a this takes place the election takes place at the annual meeting on which we hold in October and the executive committee will come together and nominate individuals and then those vigils\nThan I'm elected by a majority and\nA person who is elected becomes the president for the air\nWow okay I didn't know that thank you for sharing that with the shore and um what other requirements to serve as president a few [noise]\nWell it is preferred that as you come on board as a board member with the heat wave that you do spend some time getting to know what all of the committees to do so we have four different committees as part of the Hopi education endowment fund we have\nThe nominating committee those folks work on nominating and finding individuals Hopi and non hoping members who can serve\nAs board members we've got the marketing and resource development committee the Finance Committee and the executive committee so while it's not a requirement that you serve\nOn different committees that it's recommended that you at least had an opportunity to understand\nEach role and responsibility that those different committees play 'em to the organization in large part but the the only main stipulation and requirement to be the chief president\nIs that you must be an enrolled member of the ... tribe [noise]\nOkay great thank you for that I didn't realize that the organization has um several committees as well\nAnd that's probably a whole nother subject that we can talk about later on so thank you for sharing that with us and again congratulations ah I'm sure you're I'm feeling like you know you have a heavy load that you're carrying\nWhich you know any\nMore we usually has a low that they're carrying it doesn't matter what what what how you lead the ... when you're leading the people [noise]\nWhat is your vision for the hope your education and development fund [noise]\nWell I think first and foremost um my vision um [noise] as I step into this\nThis leadership role um for the he um [noise] just fill in my heart that\nIt's important to keep our mission at the very forefront of everything that\nWe do [noise] um [noise] to continue to do the best to to grow and secure additional funding that will grow the endowment so that we're able to offer more healthy students opportunities to further their education\nUm you know and to be able to continue to do things like the alumni challenge and some of the other events\nThat we put on annually as fundraisers but you know I'm just the coordination and logistics of having these fundraisers does require money as well and so\nTo continue to to grow that funding so that we can offer more programs and and um support our own support our hope the people and support their educational endeavors um that will always be at the forefront of um\nOf my main responsibilities as well as making sure that you know as an organization where we're reaching out more to other communities to other businesses to let\nPeople know you know that we're here um to let them know about our mission and to just continue to um\n[noise] do everything we can to to support a\nEducational dreams for our hope people that are here and I think one wants to add to that\n[noise] yeah um I said it's it's really great to hear that from President ... on issues brand new um because our mission is called her reading and nurturing\nThe future of our hope he people through education by safeguarding and growing or perpetual source of funding so division and she just shared with you fits right into exactly what we are here to do for people [noise]\nShe just shared with you fits right in to exactly what we are here to do for people\n[noise] great thank you for that um there is a lot of um miss understanding about how the heat wave 'em and set up and how and what their um mission as an division and we'll talk about that you know and then a little bit here\n[noise] um [noise] this is another question um that we want to\nAsk you because that's what we're experiencing right now and the end after president among\nThe is I'm done with her conversation um if you want to chime in the tribe is going to experience funding shortages due to the closure of the coal power plant and the sale of cold which the Hopi try receives royalties from what is a plan\nTo continue to support our hope these students with their endeavors of continuing education [noise] and it's a two part question what impact will the closure have\n[noise] two shoes\nThank you for that question ... and um I Want to make sure that I stress tests that the impending closure\nOf the Navajo generating station\nAnd the royalties that had been distributed to the heat wave 'em all those those royalty checks will stop coming in our effort and the organization\nIs strong and healthy and we're going to continue to um [noise] do our best to grow the funding and\nTo provide opportunities to 'em through the various programs that we report and uh we do realize a it is not um\n[noise]\nYou know it's going to be challenging for sure I'm looking at a shortfall of funding that we have generally been able to rely on but understanding also that you know the the Hopi education endowment fund a\nTakes his responsibilities and um and it's a\nRole in the community seriously and so we're always looking ahead you know ten Fifteen Twenty years down the road and um it's not to say that we knew this was coming immediately but but we knew that there would be a time where\nThe royalty checks would stop coming and so it's because of the careful planning and the thought and consideration and the whole purpose that the\nOrganization was set up as an endowment fund that we're gonna continue to be able to fulfill our mission uh yes it is going to be a little bit more challenging but where\nOpen to looking outside the box and being creative um and you know broadening our network and uh like our\nUm former chief presidents\nHad said Dr Angela Gonzales you know she said she was a big fan of friend raising and so there's a large network of\nIndividuals' that serve on the Hopi education endowments on as a board member and you know we're going to really tap into the resources that that we can bring to the table and continue to fulfill that mission\n[noise] do you like to add to the um him\nA thank you I just like to add that um to share with those of you who may not know about the heat wave 'em in Nineteen Ninety nine\nMen chairman Wayne Taylor junior um [noise] created a task\nTeam to create a fund that were capture education money for the sheet or for the Hopi people um he was mainly concerned about\nThe scholarship money should the mine never close not really knowing about a one disclosure would happen a recreated the fund and\nWe started out with a what they call a corpus which is the first donation that we can never touch of ten million dollars from the tribe\nSince then uh all of the royalties that were a lot of to education have been coming into the she ah which range from one hundred Seventy two hundred thousand dollars a year or\nThe opposite view but do\nYou read the book is a

but um it really took like maybe like three or four dates in\nAnd this is coming from my experience cause for experience can be different but my experience was around maybe a secularist or eight which was probably about two to three weeks and I just really felt this connection that I've never felt with anybody else\nAnd it was an connection in a moment I realized I could\nSpend the rest of my life with this person and we could eventually grow it's just something that you know I as we as we look at a couples that could be so powerful especially in our communities when how good families and good homes we look for those people too\nThat could be so powerful especially in our communities when how good families in good homes you we look for those people to to kind of help our community\nSure and I want to bring in our guest to join us from San Francisco California is Roger Kuhn he's a license marriage and family therapist in private\nPractice in San Francisco and Roger our pleasure to have you with us as well and give us some thoughts and we just heard from parents about when he knew he was ready to get married um talk to us a little bit about this and how\nMuch it should go into it and how do you know um your your thinking the right thing and and not caught up in some male ah any thoughts Roger\n[laughter] yes I was so much goes into to it to this idea of how do I know if somebody is the one or is there such a thing as the one oh because sometimes people will get 'em will have proposed to somebody maybe three or four times before somebody says yes or they made us their current partner multiple times\nGo for that person has said yes so that is such a subjective experience that somebody might have as to knowing when is the right time\nUm I think when I work with a couples that are thinking about getting married\nI'm In my practice I always ask\nThem about the values that they have an individually and then what type of values would you like to have\nAs a couple I'm from an indigenous perspective this might also be a thought about as a traditions or particular cultural values of that you would like to make sure are a part of your a union with someone and if you and your partner don't know those values\nIt's a great time to sit down with each other and discuss\nHow do we want to have children what are we going to do with our our money um what do we think about banking do we want to\nUm take care of our parents as they get older or do we want to invite other family members to live with us a lot of discussions I Believe should happen beforehand um so that should they ever come up in a relationship you've already thought about it together and that might happen by\nA visiting with a psychotherapist such as myself I'm speaking with different community leaders are just asking around your friends and family what did you do what works in your marriage or if I Want the best out of what might be\nOkay and\nWhere do you think about that advice you ask them any question did you ask those questions before you ask someone to marry you before you say yes to somebody asking give us a call one eight hundred Ninety six to ... ... is the number ... voice\nStudents from Minneapolis, Minnesota we have Dr around my room and she is the director of behavioral health of the Native American community clinic she is from the Ridley Ojibwe nation in a pleasure to have a year after my room welcome to the our\nThank you so much for having me\nDr Myra anything you want to add to about knowing when a person is ready for marriage\nI you know I just want to echo what I've heard here um which is really the idea of\nYou know you identify someone you want to marry like this admiration and respect and\nUm you know connection on values and beliefs\nAnd you know I just said that and add to that that really you know that there's the maturity level that's also needed 'em to be ready and what that means as fat I'm you understand that conflict as normal that you're willing to\nHang out at ... and that kept on ask you both grow and change that\nUm that those are not meant at our tease me ... west defensive master criticism button that that people really can create a space of honesty and openness um so that people can both grow individually and also as a cop all [noise]\nUm and I would just mention is while you know as um you know you grow and develop some of your values and beliefs might start to shift is while I'm not only a couple but individually and just being prepared to\nUm keep working on building strength and keeping that connection in the relationship is really important\nAll good advice and maybe you want to add\nSome to one eight hundred nine nine six to eight for me is the number and um we're hearing about healthy scenes and things to consider when it comes to asking someone to marry you but we know that there are different scenarios and so I'm Wondering are there any ribs signs about um\nUh reasons why you shouldn't get married or or you know um any thoughts on on when you get married him and it's not for the marine reasons I'm Katie ... go ahead Roger\n[noise] a thank you\nSo one of the things that I also wanted to to mention that some people might experience or not necessarily be thinking about is that\nMarriage is also a legal concept [noise] um\nSo it is yes about respect and love and also marriage come away with marriage comes as legal aspects as well and to really think about um what might be some of the laws in your in your area that that you might be impacted by should you do or something like I had\nA legal marriage with somebody um so this is one thing that I Want to ask for help people be mindful of as well\nIn what would be some of the things that caution or why those can lead to things\n[laughter] well I'm a you know oftentimes we we we forget that you can have an amazing marriage with somebody and then things might change I'm so for example somebody in your family might pass and leave you a bunch of money\nMaybe you didn't have money beforehand and now there's this new windfall in the relationship of what happened so that money should your relationship then um and er you make different choices in your life\nYou can also be complicated by um issues such as raising a family together um when you get married with somebody then and have children with them there there might be also different legal ramifications to think about as well\nUm I don't think we should necessarily always cautioned against the Galileo thing because because marriage is also this really beautiful aspects as well\nUm it's just something that I when I'm working with people that aren't married that are thinking about it to think about how how we define legally from a structure uh that are important to recognize and even such as a property and on what happens in those types of instances of because they're they're they're really impacted when we find that legal contract with somebody\nAnd I got to throw that should there what about bad credit\n[laughter] yes yes thank you so it is possible you should really check the state that you live in or the depending on the financial structure of the government that you um the area in which you live a but taking on marriages sometimes\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n... listening to native America calling and we are wondering what are some things couples should think about before they decide to get married what's your advice or caution to others about getting married joined us by calling one eight hundred nine and six to eight for each one eight hundred number\nNeeded and with us today from about bringing Montana insurance the friend boys and he is from the black feet nation sharing his story about marriage proposal uh you can share in years to wanting to treat ...\nNative also here with us is Dr around my rent director of health services are actually director of behavioral health at the Native American community clinic in with us too is a license marriage and family\nTherapist Roger ... and I'm Glad to have anybody here with us thinking about this and Roger willing to turn to you too um it's great to hear that parents got the answer he was looking for but um what do you if you don't get into you're looking for does that mean backup walk away or or what next\n[noise] Ah yes congratulations deterrence um how beautiful to feed to see that unfold I watch a video and I I really enjoyed that\nAnd sometimes it doesn't happen that way you don't always get what you might be a happy ending\nThat might not mean that the person that you are I'm sure you know for ever um it might mean that you need to ask them um is there anything that you should know\nAnything that I should know about our relationship or anything that you're not comfortable talking about maybe we can go talk to someone else such as a therapist or in the leader or or spiritual leader a religious leader depending on your fate that might be able to help us um work through this um\nIt might be that there are communication issues are a couple of issues around sexuality that each work through in order for the American to forward in that way [noise] um so I Would say like you don't necessarily have to think of it it's like I Need to give up now but maybe how and my partner and I I'm\nSerious if we're serious how can we actually use this as a mother to learn how we can deepen our relationship make our relationship even stronger so that when we do say I do when we do say I'm the U.S let's get married that will be in a much better place\nAnd Roger I'm you know this from experience to you're married um anything you can tell us about what he was like for you um initiating this process or any loved ones also help you a proposal\n[noise] yeah sure you know um my my story a little interesting um\nI think it's also important to talk about you know ... or any of the true spirit\nOf listeners out there are ... folks that are listening I'm when I when I got married um we weren't on my my partner and I weren't allowed to to get married and we lived and so we traveled to another state or where we could legally married um which at that point with an ... Massachusetts a\nProposal that we had was was actually based on watching the news of the two thousand election\nEnded up being you know happy that President Obama um how one but also feeling very sad that a proposition eight o'clock for ya outlawing gay marriage\nI mean I kind of looked at my partner and he started talking about this you know what would it be like to um to actually get married because we had really thought about it for that because it wasn't an option or else\nAnd it failed at that moment like yes I wanted to click it or to\nBe seen to be counted as a married person and it felt like radically political at the\nSame time it felt scary to me because I wasn't sure how my tribal nation we're going to or what it would accept my marriage so that you know according to also recognize that although a marriage for spirit of\nTea and if people now are all in the U.S [noise] um we we still don't have the stories that we might see what the story or an other stories of people might talk up today because of the impact that I'm\nA lot of negativity about a same gender or same sex marriage in and outside of Indian country that's still a pair there today um I like to say that I Am married but I Do have a husband and I'm real proud of that and we do marriage incredibly well um because of all the ins and outs of shared with all of it\nI like to say that I Am married but I Do have a husband and I'm real proud of that and we do marriage incredibly well um because of all the things that I have shared with all due today because we talk about our values and we talk about um having honesty is the foundation of of our relationship we talk about sexuality and health and moving forward and finances and\nSo we can get to the love part and get all that other stuff out of the way and just be able to focus on the laws and we both\nHave incredibly supportive families or that supported us too and that's important and also a part of your community which helped me a feel positive about my choice to be a married person\nWell thank you for that Roger in them you made me think of family members to in their space for you in this conversation um\nWhat was your room when somebody was proposing or maybe the parents and have some thoughts to you can join us one eight hundred number six to him for aid is the number let's go ahead and say hello to our caller Gregory in Las ... New Mexico tuned in on key\nHim Gregory thanks for calling your on here\nI'm like you I just thought I'm sure it is a subject that I think will solve a lot of ah it doesn't come to everybody from ...\nBut I really think maturity should be a focus of um a lot of of of marriages for myself I got married when I was\nI'm sixty five I got married when I was sixteen and um I think it was much better than if I got married when I was thirty because for me at least I think my a lot more hormones are growing up working for a long time\nI got sixty I realized I wanted to do something besides the vote on my time to myself and I wanted to do devoted to someone else and when I first daughter I'm just at age or you know over a\nYear or so after um something up in laws are have\nYou ever went up for all of a sudden I realized that you know she was the most important person so anyway I'm just saying maturity has a lot ... Lewis I'm motivated you to explore those other areas that you guys were talking about\n... ... ... and ... any thoughts for Gregory\nYeah I just think that that's a really great comment on that he made\nI think I'm a lot of people have kind of misguided beliefs about you know what marriage is that there is a perfect person out there and um\nAnd you know it's in the media and and I'm a part of the cultural belief that I think a vast um and so I think we really need to challenge that as family members and as community members\nIn support people in their marriage is and I'm In a really help them to become better people and um work or not only to support them as a couple but individually as well\nUm and and and I don't know that um we necessarily do a great job at that um so you know the couple working at not only um building their dreams and goals together as we've been talking about but also finding community and family who support the relationship I think is very key\nAnd that's what my right he talked about Gregory talked about maturity and reaching that point where he was ready um are there any signs that you know you are not ready for marriage\nYou know he won that um I see in ... I'm a licensed marriage and family therapist as well in working with couples a\nLot of times when people aren't able to communicate honestly and are not able to let their guard down enough to um you know share some wounds that have happened in the past and really evaluate how that affect their behavior in the relationship\nI think can be a real challenge don't tell somebody able to do that kind of work on their own\nUm I think you can also do that in the context of a relationship if you are already married but\nUm you know just know that that work does need to be done so that you can be honest and open it in a relationship\nBy quantum broadcasts rations native non profit organization [noise] funding is provided by the liberation for public broadcasting support from the public radio satellite service by Britain Michael David Boies the Native American radio network\n\n\n\nYou are listening to tell you why I hotel a eighty eight point one FM and K.

mystery of Saudi journalist Jamal ... disappearance and suspected murder the Saudi Arabian authorities denied\nHaving anything to do with it now they admit ... died inside the Saudi consulate and assemble as a result of a fight few are buying it all along President Trump is facing mounting pressure to punish Saudi Arabia if it did murder ... for the president has been reluctant to do that\nIn part because he says American Jobs are at stake\nSix hundred thousand jobs more than that and be very hurtful to this country if we said oh we're not going to sell us he's\nSo how many Americans would lose their jobs if President Trump stopped\nSelling weapons to the Saudis arms and security analyst William hearts on studies weapon sales at the center for international policy we looked in a crunch the numbers for us you've heard President Trump's figures he mentioned six hundred thousand jobs in that clip just a moment ago how many us defense jobs actually depend on Saudi Arabia\n[noise] well it's hard to know precisely but you know a year and a half ago the president said it was forty thousand jobs there hasn't been a major platform where they've actually signed the deal is President Trump came into office so even if they you know decided to get rid of some you know they had made\nUnder Obama we'd be talking thousands or at most tens of thousands of jobs not six hundred thousand or even a million which he said the other day as well you know\nIn the economy with a hundred and thirty million people employed it's just a blip I mean obviously if you work in a particular factory or things are built that are getting calls on the savvy to different matter but it's for our economy as a whole it's certainly not much I'm certainly not a reason to arm of murderous regime that's not\nOnly kill the journalists but is bombing thousands of people in Yemen\nThe president talks about Saudi contracts and Boeing and race you on your saying that those contracts date back to the Obama administration so just tell us how many deals are currently signed and what have the Saudis paid for\nAnd there was a big here in the Obama period where they offered sixty billion dollars worth of weapons all of a couple of packages so now does have gone through but uh Fifteen fighter planes Apache attack helicopters those happened and those were worth tens of billions dollars\nSome of that money is already swelled and then started delivering the fifteenth so the money is water under the bridge that's already been spent we're not going to see it again it would be hard for them to interrupt a deal that's been slow because allegedly they need these systems so what's actually on the table that light changes to jail for a missile defense system called bad\nWhich was introduced during the Trump period and\nThey have yet to agree on the details so in theory the south and say well you know this particular deal we're not going to go through with\nAnd is there any risk if Trump or to Rena egg that in China or Russia would pick up any of the business\nSaudi Arabia is whole military is built on us and you have supplied weapons communication and maintenance and repair parts it would take a long time to turn that around\nSo William just give us the big picture here how important is the defense industry like all the jobs from planning to production how much of the U.S economy depends on defense goods and how much is that is relying on Saudi Arabia\nClement with one of the people leading the federal government's effort to help shape for us and other coastal Alaskan communities under the Obama administration when he was hired and twenty ten the federal government has already issued to report describing the threat to these villages in no uncertain terms\nThat said you know thirty plus villages are in trouble and that are going to need some attention\nThese reports said the communities were in quote imminent danger and ... was one of the places on the top of the list\nNow at this point you might be asking yourself why ... in such a precarious a spot to begin with\nI heard something to the fact of the junk asking about why did they why did they build their community and I'm barrier argument and this is Kelly any walk for factored matters because the church and the fear of Indians are fair school\nIt's built any ... any what Cirque and polar council and Alaska Anchorage she grew up in ... and she says until a hundred years or so ago there was no permanent village on Sarah chef island her ancestors lived all along this part of the coast and they used to Ireland frequently but they didn't live here year round\nAnd that's the thing they were kind of line of manic um who didn't have permanent settlements and that sort of thing\nBut all of that changed in the early Nineteen hundreds when the U.S government and the Lutheran Church came to coastal Alaska and build churches and schools it was an extension of the colonization process that had already swept through the lower forty eight states Alaska Native people were told they had\nTo send their kids to the new schools or risk having them taken away over time the population of this part of the coast concentrated on Sarah tap Ireland so this thing called development committed these people to a spot which turns out to be directly in harm's way\nWorse case scenario of course is a a storm comes at it and forces them off that land um this year\nThat actual climate again at the Interior Department she set out to get federal agencies to help protect people and coastal Alaska from the threats of rapid climate change his breath\nAnd other towns were already engaged in planning her own solutions for the sticking point with money moving a whole town is a complicated and expensive affair one federal study pegged the cost\nOf living ... a hundred and Seventy nine million dollars and it's just rough doesn't have that kind of money they don't\nHave any kind of money actually forty percent of people live below the poverty line many homes don't have running water but Congress was not supportive of helping them make the move many members weren't and still aren't willing to accept the human caused climate change is even real\nSo finding dollars was very difficult to manage to get some grant money and some grant program spun up but the boys just embarrassingly difficult to find those dollars within the federal government\nIn twenty sixteen right before leaving office President Obama signed an executive order protecting marine resources and the bearing sea and setting up a new structure for helping Arctic communities respond to climate change climate was optimistic that would finally bringing meaningful action for ...\nAnd he thought it would stand up under the new Trump Administration\nFrankly despite all the anti climate change rhetoric up these new folks uh I wasn't worried about climate\nChange adaptation because ... you know you're you're addressing issues that are very clear in front of you people are being directly impacted by climate change it's not a model it's not a theory it's fact\nIn the course I was being very naive\nLess than four months into the new administration President Trump revoked Obama's executive order the project was that\nIt was a clear shot across the bow that hey uh doesn't matter whether you're working on reducing greenhouse gas emissions or protecting people imperil anything that has a with climate change to it has to stop\nThem a few months later Clemens got reassigned to a totally unrelated job for which he had no qualifications and he wasn't alone\nWhen I found out that dozens more senior executives like me had been reassigned or realize that it was that I was part of the\nPurge Clement found a lawyer and filed a whistle blower complaint which is still pending he also wrote an op ed in the Washington Post and started speaking publicly about what's at stake not just his and his colleagues jobs but the people of many coastal Alaskan communities\nAnd governments should be scrambling to try and find ways and dollars to get people out of harm's way and find innovative ways to do that is what government does and that's what's appalling about this\nWhat would you say to people who are like um well it's your problem why should a state of Alaska or the federal government or anyone else help you if you need two hundred million dollars to move go find two hundred million dollars and good luck\nTo you yeah well they'll just saying the same thing to Miami pretty soon right so I mean what happens up there uh in the face of climate change is an important bellwether for what's going to happen in the rest of the coastal areas of the United states right I mean we're all American citizens and we have some expectation that we're not on\nHer own right and and that's one of the things that makes this country great [noise]\n\nI reached out twice to the department of interior for comment but they did not respond [noise]\n[noise]\nSo given how tenuous the situation is\nI reached out twice to the department of interior for comment but they did not respond [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSo given how tenuous the situation is [noise] why don't people just leave shift rough like if they can't relocate the whole village why don't the residents just go somewhere else no are fair banks or Seattle\nThat's the best cultural death to these communities each one of these villages is its own distinct alter their own distinct dialect to ask them suggests assimilate into another village somewhere is to ask them to let go their culture entirely with it I guess it's horrible [noise]\nEveryone I met ... seem to agree on this they want to stay together people here depend on subsistence hunting to feed their families and that food is shared with elders and others who can't go out\nAnd hunt in fact people it's just rough rely on each other for all of the essential for life they visit each other when they're sick they take care of each other's kids and they know that their future depends on keeping\nThose relationships intact\nVoter respect your vicar for or community for and then also a fertile such a way I feel this is Stan Lee talked to the vice mayor of ... that would have to work ... do you know it come from families retarded are good for the community that girl bring from your\nFamilies on the search and rescue team here and he knows better than anyone just how bad things can same gas [noise] he is frustrated by the indifference in Washington\nAre are very rude or proven go ... and climate change and all the credit arrived a look at it or or um you know\nJust really is a case study and how climate change can be understood in isolation from history politics this community is where it is in large part because outside institutions wanted to exert control over these people and their way of life the United\nStates government was very effective when it wanted to make people settled in this particular place but it's so far proven completely ineffective and helping them to get out now that it's clear they need to relocate\nFor America could over Iraq were treated our go toward ruined country\nJohn Clements says that we're likely to lose at least one coastal Alaskan village within the next ten years it could be ... and doesn't take much imagination at all to picture it wins wailing the waves rising and the frigid water rolling and crashing\nOver this island on a dark winter night it's a nightmare scenario and it's completely possible that's why Stanley talked he says they need to relocate and they need to do it together\nWe're not trying to make a new oh we're ... we're going to know these things for them ... to ... results [noise]\nOn some

A. either done\nA hey by the way you're just fell and then you have a plan some voice\n[laughter] where do you want to share today\nYou know I just I just love it I just love somebody that's so so down to earth and I just love it you know I just don't believe that the attorney that it was a set up um I'm Sorry I think this whole measure for a voter id is to\nSet up you've got to be a US citizen\nAll goes on the native I'm I'm happy made of and we have nine one one system\nAnd ... emergency people find them they got an address they got to have an address so I don't understand the whole\nOr on this everybody here that ball physical address hottest nine one one emergency services find them without a physical address hot is it hot as a UPS fight a modest FedEx find them you got to have a physical address\nShe had done that today ... that's a good point and a good question and I want to throw that to James Tucker\nSure ... so the issue really is that a lot of the folks that live in Indian country of what we call non traditional mailing address and is it can be that they share a PO box they share a rural route address oftentimes they don't have physical addresses I'm One of the things that we found 'em in the field hearings was there was a lot of testimony particularly from the Dakotas\nAbout how the the variation that Don Was talking about is is a problem in Indian country that um the nine one one system they they are having difficulty matching it up with the physical addresses because\nIn many parts of Indian country uh there's simply is no residential address I'm Jacqueline get probably correct me if I'm wrong but I seem to recall that from North Dakota the evidence showed that around a\nThird of all of the Native American I'm a Native Americans who are eligible to register to vote did not have a traditional mailing address either because of a shared a post office box\nUm you know I'm just simply not having a traditional mailing address like one two three elm street where it may also be you have a physical description of where your house is located\nYou know I ... I I'm located five miles north of the intersection of a road one and the I wrote to I'm In the first Hogan on the left three miles up from a\nYoung lady you know didn't let me ask you that and then how how is it is it just because the nine one one operator in the area you know um where people are and so uh when they're calling their like this come out to our our house I mean it's something must be written down somewhere\nWhile it's it's a problem that they're continuing to work on in Indian country because there are homes even today that they haven't matched up with with uh nine one one system but what are the things I should I should point out and this is especially important in terms of even voter id requirements\nSo the national voter registration act allows you to have a physical description through by drawing a map of where your house is located\nSo that even if you don't have a physical address the traditional address you can still registered to vote and under federal law the election officials are required to accept that the problem that we've seen as we have testimony for example from Arizona\nWhere there have been instances in which a local election officials have used the physical ... you know the the map description that voters have given that they are allowed to give under federal law and they've actually use that as a basis for purging voters\nBut the main issue you know in terms of um you know when you're talking about a ministry elections it's not just confirming whether or not someone to set aside\nThe bigger issue from an election administrator standpoint is making sure that you're assigned to the proper precinct and you can do that without having a physical address if you just simply describe where your house is located at federal law says that's enough\nRight Don thanks for giving us a call from Newtown we appreciate it and you're listening in North Dakota or anywhere else and you want to talk about voting\nAre you going to vote in this upcoming election or have you experienced barriers to voting give us a call the number ... ... hundred nine nine six to eight for eight and sort of prairie rose she is in North Dakota as well hey there Perry Rose now a Monica\nHey everybody thanks for taking my call\nAbsolutely okay North Dakota are you are you concerned about uh being able to vote this year\nI'm I'm not but um I Do need to tell you that when I when I first moved to Newtown a few years ago um I moved into a new apartment building just north of northern light in Newtown um and I had to wait over a year to uh to get an address from the nine one one\nDispatcher so to say that we we we all have an address that's not true because our our family we got home down in rows grand um North Dakota which is near white shown on the corporate hundreds of Asian and we appeal boxes because it's a rural route there's no like physical home address because nine one one has included that to come out yet and there's a PO box that right\nSo that year that was the fourteen I'm I voted with my tribal ID and I didn't have to have is going on there right but because I had my tribal IDs and I lived in North Dakota are choosing at a minimum number of French Conan I gave them my eternity bell I was able to vote 'em\nAnd I do have to say to that um you know North Dakota we got rid of the affidavit system of voting because there were some elders who voted a Mad Men election cycle to the center I'm ... I'm\nBecause people about them and so we totally got rid of that system too and so there are very real barriers\nYes in Newtown Dakota to voting um and I just am honesty and it's crazy to me that the indigenous people in this country are being denied voting because we don't have proper residency like that's total craziness and so\nThird anyone was comical comes to Albuquerque November sorting through the fourth indigenous creators illustrators writers designers actors producers from a world comic books doing so I thought\nThat was the film TV and graphic novels indigenous Comic Con highlights amazing work and brings understanding about these two Jews experience to the world popular culture informational weekend passes him a chance to support me to be\nAt indigenous Comic Con dot com [noise] [noise]\nOh no no no no\nNo no no\nNo uh uh uh\nOh\n\nHey hey hey hey\nA a a a\n\n\nA a you know hey I'm home\n\nYou're listening to native America calling today we are talking about voting and barriers to voting and there's still time to get in on the conversation give us call one eight hundred nine six to eight forty eight Jim checkers with us he is from Wilson ulcer\nAnd a gym before the break you were mentioning there was a hotline you can call if you feel like I'm you ah have experienced the barriers to voting\nYes yes I was going to make two suggestions one is that\nIf I'm before election day one of the things that would actually help out a lot of those states where you have voter registration deadlines which is most states\nAnd many of those deadlines already passed or will be passing in the next few days because we're close to the election it actually would be helpful for voters to contact their election officials confirmed that are on the voter registration lists\nIf they're not um and they should be or if they experience any kind of problems or issues between now all the way up through the election they should contact the election protection hotline which is run by some of our coalition partners with 'em and see in the lawyers committee and that number is one eight six\nSix our votes um and again it's one eight six six our\nVotes and what happens with that information is it's communicated out to people on grassroots organizations like courtesy used as well as um organizations like the Native American rights find um that have lawyers and again we will try to work with for voters to try to address those issues as they come up on election day\nAll right let's take some calls that Gilbert in Farmington New Mexico tuned in on K s U T either go\nA little bit more because I Want to pay my two cents in on just listening to talk of\nMexico is I won't go long term you turn to [noise] we'd have elected officials who um\nWork with the county government than I guess what they've done is mapped out county aides in the house members fools researchers\nLike Shultz show the county itself has done on this work places Seoul mapped out so I just thought I Would throw down in\nOkay ... thanks for sharing nuts and let's go to Lucy in Santa Fe tuned in on K.

substance but as you pointed out that's not an excuse that doesn't make it okay I'm In it usually isn't the cause of it more of an amplifier um and then um sometimes\nPeople who are actually a victim will turn to alcohol or other substances as a means to kind of self medicate from either a\nPast or an ongoing trauma or stress or painful experience so there's a big connection with um substance abuse and I'm preventing and treating substance abuse can make it easier to prevent and treat domestic violence\nBut one isn't necessarily causing the other one as you pointed out um what are some of the effects on children exposed to a domestic violence\n[noise] one thing that we always need to remember too is on domestic violence is a learned behavior so children I only have a tendency to have trauma from Whitney skiing or experience domestic violence but they may start to learn that kind of behavior and think that it's normal um\nA lot of sense does the trauma include um depression sadness I'm no hope for the future although there are some examples of [noise] um some of the things that they start to think about and not being able to trust authority even um\nAnd having heart having a hard time in school not just with the situation they're experiencing at home but their trauma that they're experiencing sometimes doesn't allow them to learn effectively so on top of them having a hard time and missing school with an incomplete homework\nThey make 'em [noise]\nThey may have a hard time absorbing material because a lot of time when when children are in these situations is involved a lot of science and and it impacts their brain as well and including learning so that has a huge impact on them on all aspects\nTheir physical health their emotional health and even um how they'll be in the future and\nWith their relationship mhm and that's a really important points um in terms of kind of how cycles happen within families too and um you mentioned something about how\nUm children can potentially learn that um that kind of behavior is normal and even though it might seem like someone who grows up in a situation where I'm One of their parents is abusive towards the other parent or abusive towards them it would make them never want to I experienced that but sometimes I'm to the contrary um\nIt kind of normal lives is that and there can be a risk of repeating and the next generation\nSomething that was experienced during childhood [noise] um so that's one of the really important\nReasons why we want to try to intervene and try to prevent and then a tree and stops domestic violence [noise] um so this is kind of a grim picture here amber about\nUm domestic violence and about how\nUm how common it is\nUm which I don't think we actually mentioned you know needs to just just off the top of your head about how common domestic violence as I was just playing some up um [noise] quit which is at the national level um one in three women and one in four men have been\nThe victims of some kind of physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime so that's really high one in three ... um\nEven higher for on native peoples and so um we kind of really stressed out and all native communities we need to be talking about\nThis issue right and I think I'm a lot of times people who are in a domestic violence situation\nCan feel so alone and so isolated in it and um you know it's probably true there is no one else in the bedroom no one else in that home necessarily um but to know that you know one in three and probably higher um means that you know a lot of the women that we know of 'em have been through this and that\nIt's not something that I'm One person is only experiencing um so what are some other resources out here and we talked about how\nUm common domestic violence is how extensive it can be how um cycles can develop where it's hard to be able to end or leave a domestic violence situation um so what are the resources out here at the um for someone who is experiencing a domestic violence situation\nYes and a lot of places are resources are very low and so out here on hoping we actually have quite a bit um for the first one that we always work with is the Hopi domestic violence program they offer\nA lot of ... uh services and resources including education legal advocacy victim advocacy men's education and even more we also work with the Hopi behavioral health services substance abuse prevention center\nHope the social services hope the resource enforcement services the bureau of Indian affairs office of justice services victim services sorry that's the one [laughter] and there is also on the national um\nHop NATO's help line um called strung hearts needed help line and they have a balanced tailored specific meters on\nPeople and so on and you share that phone number with our um our listeners just as something to put into um anyone can put into their phone and call 'em for resources I'm In support over the phone\nYes I'm their number is one eight four four\nSeven six to eight for eight three\nAnd they provide services at no cost from Monday to friday from nine AM to fight thirty PM okay so now that these are not a\nTwenty four seven hotline but I'm kind of um a daytime um central time um during the weekdays um a resource specifically targeting I'm native communities and anyone I'm looking for resources or help with domestic violence so that number again is one eight war for\nSeven six to eight for eight three\nAnd that's a strong heart native help line so that's a good resource um that anyone can access um but there's also quite a few resources here I'm On the ... and I have um been able to work with the all the domestic violence I'm French\nIn program um and they are really wonderful advocates and I've gotten them involved with um [noise] patients than um community members and so that's a really great resource that we have here and then um I just wanted to share for anyone who's joining us that this is house calls on K. U. I.\nEighty one ask them I'm Kendra Johnston your host\nFor this week a provider I Hope you health care center and I'm here with my guest\nAmber ... was the membership and outreach coordinator for the whole the tea well women's coalition to end up you know\nA really wonderful organization out here at home or be working to address prevent and I'm intervene with domestic violence so amber I'm let's talk about safety planning which is an important topic for\nPrevent and I'm intervene with domestic violence so amber I'm let's talk about safety planning which is an important topic for\nI'm someone who is in a domestic violence situation and I'm trying to figure out how to end that situation how to get out and and what exactly is safety planning um and how can um how can we help someone with safety planning [noise]\nA safety plan is defined as a personalized practical plan that can help you avoid dangerous situations\nAnd know the best way to react when you are in danger this plan includes ways to remain safe while in the relationship finding to leave or after you leave so it's a lot like planning for any other emergency like or dangerous situation like a fire drill on\nAnd then it can include things like emergency exits important documents important phone numbers or even extra cash for food or transportation so a lot of time on this is very individualized for each person and meet them where they're at and\nThe people that can help with safety plans are um dopey domestic violence program the strong hearts needed help lines or even the national domestic violence hotline um\nIf they need help um you can also do it on your own too and they're just on the Internet mhm but it is an important thing to think about because I think a lot of sometimes our first reaction\nWhen we hear about somebody within a um abusive relationship as well why didn't they leave right um but it can be a dangerous time is that um and so it's important to um have support and plan um and that's something that um you know in leaving I think there's an expression about how\nUm you know leaving as a process not necessarily a a single act and we're going to get for that too um so that there's a a planning process that can happen and safety planning has an important part of that and so how can um a friend or\nFamily member best support someone who is experiencing domestic violence\nAs friends and family members we can uh it really can be as simple as being supportive and listening and telling them that you believe them and support them in their decision on no one knows the perpetrator better than the victim\nAnd we need to believe her or him when they say that they're scared and not to blame them and ask them why don't you leave where when are you going to leave 'em\nBecause like you said leaving is a process and not a single act and oftentimes when that's that ... that time that they're leaving it is very dangerous [noise] so continuing to encourage them and let them know that there are strong and affirming their\nExperiences and and letting them know that you're there that they're not alone is something that that can go a long way\nAnd the and the day\nAnd ... and and\nAnd hanging\nOn the day and the other day and I and\nHang out\nAnd\nYeah\nYou know\nAnd I hang out and [noise]\nI and I [noise] I hang out here and\n[noise] and [noise] and\nAnd and\nAnd I\nSay I am and I am\nMarried and and I am I and\nAnd I show and\nAnd [laughter]\nAnd and and\nThe\nBank to\n\n\nBuying or or or or or or or or um or they're\nJust really ... me down and they have\nBeen around been through my ...

year the whole me too movement which began in Hollywood it did gain momentum across the guilt India started talking\nAbout it but what she wanted to pick up ... is an account for a young woman who talked about her feeding it to stand up comedian and that actually kind of you know the good old but I just ... and\n... and ... and how do you need some ... some ... million dusty event on too fast and that does then it became\nReally intense notice them and came out together and\nActually even talking about one particular person that wants to ... fans because they see this and one of those moments when people talk and then it took us out\nWhat's been public reaction alike to me to how women reacted andme men\nI don't know how to put it you know for the audience so just a site now but it just a moment you can go to a mixed reaction in only didn't notice the men and men who are seemingly limited and\nThey see that this is a moment of truth in India which has been vacant for so long and it has been extremely brave of these women with them for what media goes to be supportive but\nThere's also Venus more criticism off from of college and some of them and welcoming solid and days I'm kind of backlash water that you know the ...\n... what he'd be brief that it's going to affect a lot of men who were innocent but I think overall support has been banned and overall has GED given that impetus to women voice and it's almost as to what feminists politics can do to shore state [noise]\nSo I just want to ask you one more thing because there have been several incidents in recent years that have prompted national conversations over sexual assault and abuse in India I think the twenty twelve gang rape of geology saying uh she was given the name nearby uh there was a lot of media attention in India all over the globe but then\nAfter the trial for the perpetrators international discussions it kind of felt like that news quietly went away and then there'd be another attack that wouldn't get much attention to situate for us what's happening now and what feels kind of like a pattern up to now is this different\nIn each one has and they've seen that happen and thousands of men and they came out and treat protesting and demanding the law in our life there were changes it became most shake definition of rape was why didn't they passed that did use violence against women you know\nIf you look at the data the number of violent incidents again Roman has not gone down this is also true that more than in a folder to do both dead cases of violence\nThat laws because I Know of course you know that last said that if they have eight or ... or ... young person than ... option captive punishment is something that in government puppet people in gender has a little kid because he had the yesterday such a Kenyan nine people shut but ...\nIt does something feel different now\nI think what is it different is that people are talking about it they didn't have coming all but I think that is a big move and they much more as he ... that you cannot just lie down and take it I think\nBut I think that is a big move and they much more ... that\nYou cannot just lie down and take it I think for me as an Indian woman this is a big change it has taken they they don't just like the end of this is a problem and that just has to be dead debate and each one of us have to come forward in ... in every possible point ... and it's something that just\nBecause of the the the the the ... it definitely\nThe BBC's Rebecca ... in New Delhi thanks very much for your time\nThank you [noise] or

M. K. U. I. O. P. upper upper milk I might wanna be like a key way your public radio station\n\n\nCame on the twenty ninth of march next year or that basically until the thirty first of December the following year in other words twenty twenty or economic and trade deals between the u._k. and you would remain unchanged and now they're talking about extending yet another full year in order to increase the chance of negotiating a full treaty\nAnd meanwhile hanging over all of this is just the specter of it Britain might leave the EU without a deal might just crush out\nYeah and that's something that everyone is it's quite worried about um besides AQIM have snarled borders in price hikes for good or if it would be a problem for a lot of the countries including Germany for example where analysts say that the cost could exceed a hundred and Fifteen billion dollars if there is a hard bread that as it were a hundred and Fifteen billion\nWhile NPR sort of hard enough and reporting from Brian thank you sir right You're welcome Mary Louise\nSo what would a hard Brexit means for British and European\nEconomies George Parker has written about this piece of political editor at the Financial Times joining us from Brussels where he is following the negotiations welcome back to the program I like if there were to be no deal at all what immediate changes would take effect on march twenty nine when the u._k. leaves you\nWell they could be quite severe original depends on what kinds of new deal we actually end up with if it was a tightly chaos chicken acrimonious no deal with everybody ended up firing places each other in person left to you in very ...\nDon't you and indeed than you could see some very serious serious impacts on the border say you would have a immediately you'd have to check some real good coming in and out to the u._k. which doesn't happen at the moment\nThat will quickly to she use cues the pool is coming into person I'm very quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across the borders in Europe they would run out ... structures were closed down\nOn the bank of England is full cost this could be actually a very tales can damaging actually for the British economy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency plan and getting on the case in case this happens to cook stockpiling of medicines\nFears the fresh food could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool that will be quite bad\nAnd the pursuit call me will secondary because\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves or lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been a some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines don't you go to school districts the place where there are ... for the moment you could have she's running about ... miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile\nCues things just wouldn't be coming through sites so there are concerns that they will be shortages something more distant from the pool it's a pretty serious sets of our series of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasuries made an estimate says about what happened in the medium term\nIs Britain was to leave without a deal with I should be once the initial shock of cost you would end up with just a lot more\nBureaucracy and that type of the borders and that without to business costs will make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because if you have less access to the European market to potential fatalities as well and he got treasuries estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about\n... percent smaller than otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big hit as productions has sort of an aircraft crutch a losing Heisman\nThis RINO to immediately but I have a time for some of the airport place can otherwise it would be\nTough those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe if you have leaves with how to deal\nWith for the rest of your this has always been something that you're a skeptic some person of clung to the idea that you wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because ... percent of the major destination for European experts say they will the U.S an effect on\nA manner of European produces a third term and they won produces them from the top producers in Germany or you name it they ... they will be affected because you pay off the production will become the biggest single\nExport destinations for movie of the European Union countries but the point is is a symmetric shocks most it's true that to other European countries was suffering as a result of the new deal\nThe biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or is this sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's more of a lesson to be honest I I mean we all questioned the Y. yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's not a couple of months ago\nThe differences between the two sides and not really a steak is I often percentage or by the politicians there was another potential problem which is to reason either put his promises ... can proceed she that has to others to have very divided policy back in London and I think actually ... which are shaking a deal\nInside the British Government could actually see the positive and negotiations with our European\nPartners type anything could happen but I think my face assumptions still despite all the negative noises around is a common sense will prevail on that will be at the at the end of the day\nGeorge Packer the political after the Financial Times thanks for joining us as always a pleasure\n... um [noise] [noise] ...\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News when most people make a mistake they say I'm Sorry\nBut what's your company do when it makes us take a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith hosted the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin how he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nLike really really interesting study as a way to study apologies so the study was a part\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou bet butch super low unemployment presents his own problem how do you recruit people into jobs that me\nAnd for the next few people clan and I'm a citizen of the Navajo Nation thank you so much for having me today I'm really excited it's\nSuch a great topic I let me add one more voice to the conversation on the phone we've got jak Soto he's a college readiness pathways program manager at the American Indian college fund and he's to me and ... will come back to needed my calling jak\nI think you have to say more\nFree if you want to introduce yourself a little more\nUm you know I'm fine thank you\nAll right well Janine and let's start with you um so you know I mentioned a couple of these common apple or questions that are you know a ... most of the seniors are probably filling out the common after a to apply for the colleges that they want to apply to um ...\nWhen you get there the whole list of them you know I think it's like seven or eight different questions that you can choose [noise] ... what do you um how do you like help students decide which one of the questions is the best one for them to pick for writing there I say yeah\nOf the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services on me\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] my\nWedding won three in this last seven I Can't stand the\n[laughter] well we\n\nDon't [noise]\nMrs native America calling I'm Monica brain sitting in for care gate would it's time to start thinking about getting our high school seniors off to college if they already know that they want to apply the next step is the application which includes\nAn essay give us a call if you have questions about writing a college essay the number one eight hundred nine nine six to eight for eight or if you remember writing a college essay and you want to talk about what you wrote about uh give us a call we\nWant to hear that as well the number again is one eight hundred nine nine native on the phone we've got jak Soto he's the career readiness pathways program manager at the American Indian\nCollege funds and here in the studio and we have to in a dorm me she's the associate director of college horizons\nAnd I'm jak before the break we were talking a\nLittle bit about uh how you write about yourself without sounding sort of egotistical and and things like that um you have any suggestions for really hitting that\nThat first sentence I Know you know in journalism that that first sentence that you write the the first thing that you say is is really critical because you want to draw people in\nTalking to us about that\nWell I mean I think that you know one of the man you know as I'm inferred from the work that goes riser\nDoes with the students is really sort of getting to that um or the who the individual is so I think that you know the one thing that I like the students to think about it like when they when they sort of ensure that these are two\nParts of it went in knowing that you want to go to school to make a difference in something I'm so consensual I think you know what does that look like you know is a pretty straight\nGo to school to make a difference in something so consensual I think you know what does that look like\nYou know is it pretty straightforward you know type of way of entering the conversation and yet they\nAre thinking Lawrence actually about your future and you're wanting to sort of demonstrate that you really have been I'm thinking more critically unintentionally again about like what you're doing and why is a school that you're writing to re fit\nInto this broader church so you you need to you you need to include a little bit of information about like your your reflects to major in that and that's\nAnd that's a part of it they ... really is just to be able to sort of tell people you know I Am going to school because I Want to be calm or I Want to make a difference or I feel like this and it was a track that you know\nI'm as a directory though I I Want to put my you know in the past\nTwo but I mean those are I think that that's a pretty very basic you know way of thinking about it\nAnd then a is there anything in a college essay that you really should not be writing about that'd be a question I so I used to be on the admission side of things and we got\nEssays about all kinds of crazy things come you know we had as we've come across a despot of many different topics and I always emphasize the fact that it's\nIt's again much less so about the topic and it's more so about how you write about yourself you've got to remember that the ultimate topic is do you\nRate so um you're really wanting to be reflective as Jack was mentioning and it's always important to have another set of eyes on your essay to avoid anything that might be a little bit off base or inappropriate or maybe just it doesn't sound like you so I'm at our program the the folks that are actually acting\nAs counselors at our program they're going to be represented admissions representatives from our partner colleges so we work with a little over fifty partner colleges um from around the country and those admissions are ups are going to be working with our students and\nYou know we've got high school counselors working with our students and really just helping read through that essay and make sure that sounds like them I always suggests the students you know have someone else from home who really knows you well maybe a teacher a mentor a counselor look over your essay and and make sure that it it you know your voices coming through in in that way\nWe had a caller Arlene who from New Mexico called in and suggested that young people should be writing down their experiences as they happen so that they're fresh and that can give them an inspiration for the essay so what do you think of that suggests it I\nWas a great idea I mean I think journalism your ideas you know be helpful but um you know just like we said it sort of like a conversation that you're having with and it was an admissions representative or in in mission committee really letting them know what your goals are\nAnd why you want to go to school which is something that the jak keeps emphasizing that I really agree with really thinking about what\nWhat's that college education means to you what it means um you know to your nation to your family and and really getting students to understand\nNot so whatever process works for them is important um er is is you know effective but I think you know writing is a process and and the students should remember that that it may take several draft me may take some time and they should allow themselves that kind of time [laughter]\nYeah yeah I Want to talk a little bit more about the procrastination of this process I mean this was October I don't even really know like if this is the this is when they should have started or maybe it was in September or was it last year that the students were supposed to begin\nTo you know there there's really no I'm hard starting time or for a student I'm generally this kind of the early admissions application season and then I'm kind of the regular admission season where things get really crazy for a lot of students happens between January in March so on the earlier\nThe better you know we always say whether you're asking for recommendations whether you're writing your essay starting earlier um\nYou know the earliest you can is really it's really the best way to go we're talking about writing your college essay to get\nInto college or grad school today and if you've got\nQuestions about that give us a call the number is one eight hundred nine nine six to eight for eight also love to hear from

like early decision at some of the the um Ivy League schools for their son working on essays there we actually have um some scholarship essays that are coming up a one event one of the common ones right now\nFor our school is is like seeing all the time when you experience failure and and how did it affect you and what lessons did you learn um that that's been kind of one of the common ones with our kids currently because that's that's always hard like for\nAnybody to to talk about you know something that didn't work out for you and and the and how you overcame it um your adverse cities um and I think for the students that I work with here at Red Cloud um it's really hard to to talk about yourself\nLike as in our culture we really talk about you know to be humble and and you know you don't put yourself out there but in these essays that's really hard to do to put that to have our kids to do that I'm so that that's kind of what we've been working on it at least I've than the last last month\nI is there a way to to be balanced about that to to still feel good about being humble and and honoring\nUm your your heritage and honoring what you've been taught but also I you know I Know the ... the majority of these folks who are reading these applications are not native so they're not going to understand 'em when you're you know not sharing these things McCain oh\nYeah yeah I definitely think that balance like and that's something we're constantly really trying to um to share it with our students like finding this balance between because yes like here in Ninety nine percent of our students here at the\nSchool or or Native American um and here they are they're going to be going out into the world to college to a school where you know that they're not going to be that percentage\nSo so definitely a lot of 'em are counseling and stuff and and that transition from this place to the next um definitely trying to help them do that um it's just so much into so much

an alumni of the program and I think it really it really changed me because it it got\nMe to think outside the box I I wasn't really thinking about schools out east or really that far away from home um and I think once I realized those things where\nReality if I worked hard and I really maintained a good relationships you know with my teachers with my counselors there is some level of persistence that goes into that\nYou know I I went to um Albuquerque high school right here in Albuquerque and we have a lot of students that are counts or have a really heavy load there and ah you know I really commend the work that they do and I certainly had to be\nPersistent about showing up to their office and checking in and letting them know what you know things I was involved in and what things I wanted out at the college process and so I Do recommend that students um you know take take take that kind of responsibility on in the process\nAnd the ... are you having similar conversations with your students about being persistent taking ownership of this process\nOh yes I mean we we we are constantly having those conversations with I'm not just the seniors but all grade levels\nUm I really think like in the last five years here we have um [noise] um we weren't so technically savvy I'm five years ago and then we've really stepped it up because we've gotten a lot of students on to college and\nUm you know they have to be able to to step out the outside that box in and ask for and that's a big thing is asking for help um for for not just our students but I Would think made a student who um just because they're so used to their their family\nEither you know and then to their external family extended family um so I think really trying to get them hey can I Do this or have check check
