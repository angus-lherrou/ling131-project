conversation\nAbout sexual assault and harassment that may have helped some women in the hotel industry achieve the goal they've been fighting for for a long time getting their employers to do more to protect them from sexual assault was made headlines a few years back when a hotel housekeeper accused Dominique Strauss Kahn the former head of the IMF\nOf sexual assault\nThat case was settled out of court but the problem never went away here's the world's Alison at at a\nImagined is you're a woman working in an office and you're in the middle of a meeting all of a sudden your meal co workers starts to undress it's hard to imagine that happening right well if your hotel housekeeper chances are it has happened to you\nYou know I'm not doing time and I'm assuming oh no one's in the room so I'm gonna put my kid and I'm going into the room so this particular time you know I'm not answer this I mean there's gas is standing there completely ...\nThat's ... she's a housekeeper at a large hotel in Chicago she asked me not to use her last name or the name of the hotel where she works she's worried about how speaking out my impact on job she says that when this happened she was more than just scared\nLike it just it made me feel disgusted angry so I just kind of like bad just left\nShe recorded a tour manager but she says nothing was done\nSo it's one of those things happen so much in housekeeping where your managers kind of feel like it was just an hour and they just say okay you don't go back to the rooms today\nBut she did have to go back she brought another woman so she wouldn't have to be alone and fortunately that just wasn't there\nBut he wasn't asked to leave to twenty sixteen when members of her union UNITE HERE wanted to ask her and her co workers from questions about sexual assaults on the job she knew this was her chance to make change happen\nI'm like oh okay and one of my coworkers were sitting next to me like you know just kind of knows me like you know they come and talking about sexual harassment and I'm I'm like this is our opportunity to kind of share things that we deal with every day\nWith Tony and other housekeepers in the union set up to survey more than five hundred women about their experiences on the job nearly sixty percent of women they talked with dealt with some form of assault by hotel guest\nThat lead to action last year housekeepers and Chicago successfully lobbied for device to keep them safe\nIt's called the panic button and it was part of a city wide campaign known as hands off pants on to\nThis is one solution [noise] it's they send a message that science was in danger he knew that there'll be ... she's the head of housekeeping at the ... hotel she shows me how the safety device works\nPress the button and hotel security is on the way housekeeping\nProject emigrated here in the nineties from what was then Yugoslavia\nShe's always worked as a housekeeper her story is not uncommon according to a study done by the American immigration council the top occupation for foreign born women here in the U.S is housekeeping with nearly nine hundred thousand women working in this sector for having the panic button has made her\nAnd her staff safer I honestly think things are great I think it is great Chicago hotels are required to give this device to housekeepers but sexual assault in the hotel industry is a global issue\nSo what are some of these larger chains like Mary on June to keep their workers safe to say in Paris or get by\nSuch heightened awareness around safety and security so we're dialing up in the space but I think it's important to remember there is no one magic answer\nThat's Erica Alexander she's the chief lodging services officer from Mary in international she's talking about the new devices to rolling out in the U.S and Canada but the company has no current plans to put panic buttons into the hands of their workers in other countries\nThat are a huge problem because we understand that you know the Mariette brand doing the right thing when you're in the United states around the world\nThat's Cathy find gold she's the international director of the AFL CIO she says that back in June housekeepers from Chicago presented at an international labor conference in Geneva they inspired other housekeepers working in South Africa and around the globe to push for hands off pants on campaign\nThat is happening here in the United states and Mary I can't do it in the United states they can do it in China where they have masses and they do it throughout Asia Latin America\nBefore the me too movement last year housekeepers like Tony I didn't have much of a voice when it came to safety on the job [noise] they've been trying for years to get their employers to protect them\nAnd then all of a sudden all of this stuff started showing up in the new and I'm just like this is incredible on my book could do like we we all have to say like we've started something\nAnd they have five of the major hotel chains have promised to install panic buttons in older hotels nationwide by twenty twenty but for so many people around the globe workings housekeepers there's no button that can press\nTo stop them from being assaulted on the job for the world Alison ...

far end of the earth remote villages in Russia for example but getting into can also be as easy as going online and doing searches the investigative news websites doubling cat and the insider did both\nAnd in the process managed to reveal the likely identity or one person allegedly involved in the poisoning of a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. the suspects name is Dr Alexander Michigan according to the investigation\nHe's a trained military doctor who worked for the G argue Russian Army intelligence\n... one of the building cat reporters who worked on this case you went through a pretty a lengthy process to identify Alexander Michigan what clues did you actually have to work with\nWhat we had a little bit to start with just from the information that Russia had released and also the British authorities\nIt is to identify Alexander Michigan what clues did you actually have to work with\nWhat we had a little bit to start with just from the information that Russia had released and also the British authorities had really about the cover dennie guy so\nWe now know his real name is Alex intermission before he was ... and he's in his outcome Petra which was his covered that it was totally fake identity they made up out of nowhere for him to travel under\n[noise] um and so we had some information about that cover identity quitting his birthday um where he had to pass passport issue too which is a very small town in the middle of nowhere [noise] I'm In northern Russia\nSo that was a good starting point\nSo to talk a bit more about that process how you you've got that starting point where do you go from there so we have a starting point if we can assume that he probably use some of the same information cover identity from Israel I looked into a bunch of database of some of them are openly available some of them are late um Russia is a very corrupt\nAnd leaky society and because of that they're linked databases from driver's licenses and insurance stuff and voter registration and addresses and stuff all over the Internet you can find that you know where to cross referenced everything we can find and we found him ... about a guy named Alex in Michigan by the same birth dates and disarm roughly the same village in the middle of nowhere and northern Russia\nAnd after a bunch of digging including actually\nFinding someone to go to his tiny little village where he's from and finding locals who I Am currently he was a local DJ before he went on medical school\nYeah he was he a DJ at the local club the one club I'm sure they had in the tiny village so we once these countries in these databases of cross referencing the tiny bit of information we think we're probably matched the true identity Michigan\nI gotta say some of the ... in in your process to you and your investigators really seem to have to put your cells in the mindset of a spy\nAnna way I mean a lot of this was just a lot of very creative thinking thinking of\nUm any vulnerability of what would leave a paper trail on the spy and Russia so you know maybe not you can't find his birth certificate right because maybe that's all the information has a new way forever but again these spies have real lives to they have a family they have kids or you can find information that we tracked back to them\nSo I mean yes maybe some of this kind of spy work but it was very very basic routine research I actually learned and you know high school or college or you know searching\nLooking for an interesting details cross referencing them and what's actually\nNow that you've got a name what else were you able to find out about Dr Alexander mission like do have evidence that he was working on behalf of the Kremlin\n[noise] yeah I mean this guy is listed his registered addresses at headquarters and the cherry which when I was glancing absolutely insane like why would a secret spy list his public address like on his driver's license that address to the you know see I ... the ... one of the CIA [noise] well he did it because of you know if you get pulled over and his car\nTo cop pulled up the address and he sees the address of the you know the Russians CIA more or less and he's like oh actually you know everything you can just go you know you're fine so\nUm we ran the address I'm at a traffic that we found a three hundred and five men all between the ages of twenty five and fifty\nAll had the same register to address the difference when I had written a mosque out all these men almost certainly are often you that you are you\nAnd they all listed their vehicle registration address 'cause they get to want to pay traffic fines and they get pulled over or they get older for drunk driving or speeding the cop just let them go right because they don't want to mess with somebody in the intelligence services are really everything just goes down to laziness and I guess corruption in a way to 'em and that's how the owner abilities however the research that's um played out\nSo the headline in the guardian on this news and treat me it said a string of own goals by Russian Spies exposes a strange sloppy knows so what is your take on the possibility that this was not sloppy and his butt intentional that Russia want it to leak who these men were\nI mean I suppose it's always possible right because we know every time any investigation to make Russia or China and saying well they want you to find right well if they want us to find a wide no one published or because you know these insurance\nRegistration is for these eagles the J your headquarters [noise] you know they've been doing this for years and years and years and years and registering new age is the address and like your you address it it makes no sense when you think about it and it all kind of boils down to again just corruption in laziness\nA few weeks ago your website building cat identified as a second

GBH has spent a year looking deeply at how all this has impacted people all around the world they're documentary the Facebook dilemma is airing\nOn PBS this week we want to focus on one country discussed in the documentary the Philippines where president Rodrigo Duterte day is accused of using a coordinated army of trolls to silence critics\nGave it any patriotic for me I'm In line skates sponsoring highland name chemical [noise] so this is just trying to democracy on [noise] and where our lives are probably [noise] playing like a coup\nFrontlines James Jacoby worked on this investigation and joins us in the world studio thinker coming budget thank you [noise] uh what is the place of Facebook in the lives of most Filipinos like how much of the population has access to it and\nHow much do they interact with each other by the up while it's remarkable the story Facebook in Southeast Asia it's amazing that\nThey've pushed aggressively into south east Asia to Philippines and to me in all other countries and they are essentially the de facto Internet and a lot of those countries because they offer Facebook as part of a data plan where people don't actually have to use the data in order to use it and the Philippines it's between Ninety\nAnd a hundred percent of the Internet users in the Philippines use Facebook as the Internet basically and\nMaria wrestler who who's a\nThe women were interviewing in the film from the Philippines runs a big news organization there she talks about the fact that it's their public space it truly is\nTheir public space in the Philippines um in terms of their allies so Maria restaurant we just heard from we'll hear more from her in a moment um we've reported on this or that a\nOccurred in Myanmar where fake news actually lead to violence headed Rodrigo Duterte day the Filipino president weaponize Facebook during the election campaign and twenty sixteen so what happened is Facebook actually offered a lot of help to to tear today during his campaign for president\nAnd help them to really harness the power the platforms helped his campaign really understand how to use it effectively and as Maria wrestle reports after he was elected he essentially weaponized if by turning all this campaign machinery all these accounts that he was controlling\nHe had a network of fake accounts and paid followers that were just sending all sorts of lives about policies and\nAlso going after critics in a rather vicious hateful way um and in some cases are trying to incite violence against people\n[noise] so uh on Maria ... uh the the activist I mean she worked for a prominent news website in the Philippines Rappler media and when she started noticing this problem she actually brought it to Facebook retention in twenty sixteen as we learn in the dock here's an exchange between you James and ...\nWere you given an explanation as to why they weren't acting [noise]\nNo [noise]\nI think one game\nAnd they were focused on but the thing is that\nCountries like [noise] ... ... [noise] I don't have this guy is what happens when you bring everyone onto a platform not exercise any kind of rules\nIf you don't have those rules for getting wine country chaos so\nJames what did Facebook tell you about the way they responded to the Philippines and to Maria\nRussia's complaints well Facebook has set a number of things in response to it on one\nThey said they were too slow and addressing the problems that Maria brought to them and it wasn't until Maria\nProduced and published a three part investigative series that exposed the fact that there were these accounts that were spreading hate speech and misinformation that Facebook actually took action on those accounts but as she tells us the problem is ongoing interestingly\nRecently and as a as I think it was an April Facebook is pain Maria rest as organization to be a third party fact checker of things that are going viral\nOn Facebook in the Philippines\nBut as she put it to us recently they're completely inundated and Facebook still doesn't really have handled the problem there does that suggest you know hiring her as a factor that does that suggest Facebook is kind of pursuing due diligence or they were just trying to plug the hole I think that that\nThere are fact checking project that they're trying to do all around the world um is what they're seen as the first step toward a solution or at least containing the problem of hate speech and misinformation have\nPeople on the ground that are fact checking material in the home country in the language and um it's really an outsourcing of it\nAnd what's also fascinated about it is that where you're ... restaurant runs a news organization and she's utilizing resources that would otherwise be put toward reporting and doing fact checking riots going viral on Facebook yeah um if you zoom out of the Philippines a for a moment I mean many of us are\nClosely watching Facebook's operations here in the U.S and abroad and the the big question which you raise several times are they doing enough at Facebook to stop these campaigns whether it's disinformation fake news hate speech uh what do you think after spending a year investigating all this and actually being at\n... you know H cue for Facebook\nWell they um it's an interesting question because what does it mean enough and I asked people at Facebook you know what's the standard for success here\nBecause there's no ability for us to audit them were really left in the position of having to take their word for it and whatever it is that the standard that they set for themselves but there's so much that we just don't know but as a ... this this is a writer Alexis Madrigal from the Atlantic ah\nSays in your dog and it really\nWas a really powerful quote the very things that divide us the most are the things that get the most engagement um talk about that a bit and ... where that's most evident right now well\nWe've got our mid term elections and um and we've had you know the the horrific events here of the past week and scenes that whether it's the shooter in Pittsburgh or the attempted bomber um these are people that are very radicalized on social media polarization and\nFilter bubbles are are real thing on social media and this kind of reinforcement of world views that's the main discussion happening right now I think\nJames after a year of working on this er and investigating Facebook or are you on the platform or what if you were or you know off it I I'm On that I've always taken a I have a very small footprint on their um which by the way it doesn't mean much in terms of what data they collect revenue um but uh\nAnd why not call it a synagogue\nWell pretty ultra orthodox establishment which he represents an Israel conservative and reform Jews or or reconstruction issues or any Jews are not wanted ox Jews are not really considered full juice in her eyes\n[noise] so what do you attribute some of these ten ear reactions as he put it to what happened in Pittsburgh\nI think it's cynical politics you have somebody like Naftali Bennett who is the diaspora administer\nA officially is also a former aide of nuts and Yahoo and now turns rival and uh he tries to always play for based it's even more right wing and Yahoo and he should I Would argue no better\nBut yet he's still found a way to compare the hand that shot down a lemon juice preying on a Saturday morning to the same forces that fire rockets from Gaza\nInto Israel I her ma which I think also shows like a disconnect completeness understanding of history\nYeah I mean not Taliban it also got on a plane to Pittsburgh um there was another reaction to from the Israeli ambassador to the u._s. so wrong ... um he was on MSNBC blaming anti Semitism on both the left and the right he's blaming both sides\nWant to think forces in college campuses today is anti Semitism and no fans of anti semi usually not me I'm not seeing on college campuses they're coming from the radical left so we have to stand against anti Semitism whether it's on single life whether it's on single life yeah\nUm I think here again Israeli\nJews are not following the intricacies of right versus Latin America I think a lot of Israeli Jews would be no firm hold support Donald Trump they don't really care so much credit domestic policies they don't really know very much medicine I think all these it's important to others really due to the Trump support Israel and the Trump support strong Israel so ah\n... comments I think perplexed American Jews than they do Israeli Jews\nAnd to tell me a bit of a reaction among some of Israel's left wing politicians to what happened in Pittsburgh\nUm I think over all although there has been expressions of condolence expressions of shocking at heart [noise]\nThe the new kind of quickly moved on here I think a lot of Israeli Jews don't fully understand the impact that this had on the American Jewish community they don't fully understand the place them in a God life for American Jews they don't\nUnderstand that or American Juniors and synagogue is a second home it's a place where kids grow up and Hebrew school where they hide as I did you hiding out for for me to school in the bathroom with my friend and a place where you would pray to come of age\nAnd that you you know this is a place where people feel at home I share a story I did a lot of reporting about the residents of Pittsburgh and the people from scroll hill and I'm\nOne of the stories that move the mouse with the story of Jerry Ruben ... six years old he was one of the amount of people who were murdered he rushed to the sound of the noise\nWe don't know if you knew the gunfire at that point to go help and that's when he was shot and and as an immoral and Pittsburgh people spoke about how he had this\nInteresting custom dream orders hottest which is the Jewish prayer memorializing the dead and it's set in every single service she stood up\nHe always stood up for the ... and that is traditionally a time and only those who are mourning actually stand up and when asked why does he stand up every single time he said well I have no children and one day there will be nobody to stand for me so I\nStand for all of those who have no one fan for them and on Saturday everybody stood up instead for Jerry in his memory and I think on\nThat sending out to the standing up together is such a metaphor and I think\nOverall Israeli Jews and Israelis in general they don't need to send a guy in the Jewish community because they had their church unity within their own lives and in a way that American Jews if they want to find community they want to find\nA sense of solidarity among themselves that they find it in the wall for the synagogue and that is another sort of way that Israeli Jews and American Jews you know don't can act\nYou know the president does reveal are quite a few differences between American and Israeli Jews what would you how would you sum up those differences like what's the bumper sticker\nHere [noise] me think um\n[noise] that American Jews and it's really just aren't you there and you can pass rate now say American Jews for the most part are liberal like consider themselves\nVery much attached to their immigrant roots and because of that they tend to support rate for immigrants they tend to very much believe in the Senate this repeated in the Bible is an editor tenant would just\nBe kind to the stranger because you two are much once the stranger in Egypt and so there's this very strong desire to knowledge that you know American\nJews have done fairly well to themselves in in America and feel fairly successful and silver and comfortable um and I think that comfort to the lens that just sort of be more liberal and more open where Israeli Jews\nSeal feel under attack they feel very much for the the product that sort of post traumatic coast Holocaust world where they look at\nThings very much in this sort of zero sum game in time you know a person's them whether it comes to Arab neighbors or you know I'm fresh from and somehow an Israeli the trend towards that it's like circling the wagons in fear\nAnd America jewelry and have a transit of toward plurality Jewish pluralism openness and I think his decisions coming more clearly now and for a task tragically in some ways highlights a splintered\n[noise]

look at organisms and um you look at a coral reef clearly we're losing more corals than we would hope and that means the race have changed in the environment is essentially out hey the capacity of the call themselves to adopt\nRoof case died last week at the age of fifty six just months after being diagnosed with brain cancer longtime friend and collaborator Virginia was since gates was one of the very first scientist to make the connection between coral bleaching and global warming\nShe started in the Nineteen eighties ended up very early days when none of us understood what was going on with able to show that corals to just strange pay lanes and she was able to tie it to warming and at that time we were just starting to understand what global warming was\nOver the years gates became a bowl of teacher and an eternal optimist in a field whose future looks grim until her desk gates led a research lab at the University of Hawaii that's trying to figure out ways to help coral adapt to warming oceans friend Virginia wife says she was also a regular and vibrant public speaker\nI remember her ability to light up a room and make everyone in the room feel like she's talking jets to them she had this wonderful silky highbrow English accent\nThat she joked with thrift secret weapon and she was able to tell the story of coral and she was brilliant at it she really excelled at it\nI Know you've described her as an iconoclastic or feel why\nShe was and I kind of class in a couple of different ways the best one to think about right now is this idea of assisted evolution\nOf world very controversial it's the idea that humans need the help corals evolve faster to be able to tolerate the heating that's happening and some scientists really think that that's not our place to do that and\nBut others led by roots really feel that we need to try upper righty options\nShe's the first to admit it may not work but if you don't try it\nThan we can't know but personally I feel very strongly she was my class in terms that's the way she approached defiant she dislike pushing your colleagues decide to get ahead and she was much more about cooperation and encouraging\nAll diversity brown people and women and because of that sometimes she wrestled tattered but\nShe ruffled feathers to make the world of course I Am a more inclusive cooperative place\nSuch determination to help these coal race or in the face of in the past few years several major coral reef bleaching events and the rest of the news isn't good I mean Karl research expected to be almost\nCompletely destroyed in coming decades and yet Rick Gates remained so optimistic how did she retain that optimism most studying something so depressing\nWow it's such a great question mark how I think all of us are trying to bottle that um especially in light of her life she just looked forward and she felt like\nYou know we can try hands up and give up or we can look for solutions than I think her enthusiasm really instilled that same passion and a lot of other people\n[noise] what is the one memory of Virginia that you'll always hang onto about Rick Gates\n[noise] laugh you know she was not a big person but she had this huge laughed at silk around people in restaurants would turn around and stare on each other and she laughs she left early and often and it was infectious\nVirginia was a biology professor at Oregon State university and a longtime friend and colleague of coral researcher with gates who died last week Virginia thanks for telling about Ruth and our condolences to you thank you so much Marco

were presidents ... why do they feel it had to do this now with Trump not just play the face to face with the Trump team but also triangulate around him to get this new NAFTA source\nWell the reason for this was quite simple that's our core economic interests were at stake that even just the auto sector alone there are a hundred thousand jobs and in many many many more jobs that are dependent on that and the idea of twenty five percent tariff on a Canadian article\nIn the United states that sharp in mind but I Do want to emphasize one thing which is we're talking this this thing is over from

tariffs that are still in place\nIs an safeguard if if Trump tries to withdraw from the deal now the the L seems\nTo be the deal at this point and it's a matter of passing through our respective

would hope that this will that a ha or a more positive relationship between Canada the United states and Mexico\nWe can't afford not to take precautions and anything can happen as we've seen record as part of taking precautions and saying this campaign is going to continue indefinitely\nRoland Paris a former foreign policy advisor to Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau thanks very much for your time\nThanks Marco the new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada brings more certainty to the U.S economy that's a good thing but here's something else to worry about new estimates from the congressional budget office show that our government's borrowing\nIs off the charts by historical he's done standards according to the CBS show and just a few years we'll be spending more money to pay the interest on\nOur national debt than we will spend on our defense or Medicare to put it another way the U.S has become one of the most indebted nations on earth we as the world's Jason Margolis to help tell us what that actually means\nA few years ago when the Republican Party didn't control all the reins of government deficit hawks like Congressman Paul Ryan work constantly banging the drum about the perils of a rising us debt here's Ryan speaking to CNN in two thousand and twelve\nWhen a crisis right in front of us and what brings down great empires past and future in debt and there's really nothing to prevent it\nAnd here's Donald Trump speaking to CBS one he was running for president\nI Will tell you we are sitting on a time bomb and Hillary Clinton doesn't have a clue and President Obama has pretty much devil's a dead since he's been in office and somebody's got to pay the price we have to start chopping that debt down\nBy one to Obama was out and Trump was in the Republicans were singing a different tune under Trump and Speaker Ryan spending has gone up and the Republican tax cuts have blown a bigger hole in the budget today the U.S debt it's at Twenty one\nTrillion dollars a huge scary figure\nBut also kind of meaningless by itself\nWherever the threshold is too high we don't know but rising forever is definitely an unsustainable on big problem and we're the only a vast economy on an unsustainable course\nEconomists like Jason from an at Harvard's Kennedy School of government study what's called the debt to GDP ratio how much a country owes versus how much it generates all the other advanced economies it's falling\nGermany France Mexico Argentina Mongolia they're all carrying a smaller debt to GDP ratio than the U.S if you look at a list of how we rank internationally and the U.S is sandwiched between boot taunted and Jamaica were carrying are heavy debt load since World War two\nEconomists say when you're in a time of recession it's time to spend to get the economy going again when the economy is roaring along as it is now it's a good time to save says Chris Edwards he's the director of tax policy studies at the Kato Institute libertarian think tank in Washington\nThe Republican Party I used to be a ... outside of the national defense areas or the party of spending restraint but they no longer are you don't hear anything about ... spending restraint for major Republican leaders and the fact that we're in an attempt to Europe and economic expansion\nNow and that keeps rising is really extraordinary and very irresponsible unless Congress fundamentally changes of\nIts path we are headed for a Greek type crisis\nBut what exactly could that mean\nThe rising a debt ah you know could could create a crisis situation where interest rates are spike the government has to take drastic actions perhaps you know cutting benefits a Social Security and other benefits are radically or hiking taxes are dramatically which will damage the economy\nSocial unrest people taking to the streets as their savings rate could that happen in the United states of America mark gold wind doesn't see us as the next Greece but he does think we should be paying more attention to the dead\nOne of the scary things about that is we probably won't know where to deep in debt until it's too late gold wine is a senior policy director with the nonpartisan think tank the committee for a responsible federal budget I don't think we're headed for Greek like crisis because unlike Greece with our on our own currency\nAnd we can actually make her own party but I Do believe that our current path is unsustainable\nAnd I do believe that if there isn't a course correction at some point um we will face a financial crisis who actually potentially create a global financial crisis that's\nNot as bleak as a full scale Greek crisis bordering on anarchy Jason firmin at Harvard doesn't think either of those scenarios is likely he served as chair of President Obama's council of economic advisors and says the debt should have never been our number one issue in the first place\nBut I don't think it should drop off the list of concerns entirely either\nWhen it comes to the United states' debt right now he says he subscribes to the termites in the woodwork theory\nThat every year they shut the weight your prosperity a little bit and we do a little bit worse off but without ever thing ever being really dramatic\nStill after a while your house will need to be fixed and continually delaying repairs we all know

S. for asylum one of those is obviously family separation what are the others\nWell the reason that the Trump Administration would separating families but it's not just be cruel it wanted to detain all asylum seeker indefinitely if you're detaining refugees only based on their migration status and they don't present any kind of risk society or risk of sleep that constitutes arbitrary detention under international law\nEnds in right now along the entire length of the U.S Mexico border the Trump Administration is pushing thousands of asylum seekers back into Mexico and tons of that it's safe for them to wait there we also found that\nThe U.S authorities had been encouraging Mexican immigration officials to deport does decide on the cruise back to the very countries where they slip persecution or threats of death and that's flat illegal under both US law\nAnd international law so there's these three interlocking\nPolicies and since we released a report both Republican and democratic members of Congress to come just asking for more information we're hopeful that as we get closer to the appropriations process that Congress can use the power of the purse to compel the department of homeland security to be more forthcoming\nBack now to Maria the Brazilian grandmother seeking asylum in the U.S with her grandson brain griffey says Amnesty International with President that Marie is final immigration herring and it wasn't looking good for\nWe actually witness as judge such compel her\nIn the courtroom to give up her asylum claim in order to be reunited with her grandson special needs before being deported back to Brazil implication was all of a sudden fame some air strikes is saying we want to close the loop holes but we can reunite you with your grandson so you don't get deported without um so what you see here's a clear threat of\nPermanently separating the grandmother from her grandson\nAt the threat of being deported without him and we saw in terms of post a grandmother and a grandson in the long term consequences or grade she actually had a medical emergency where she had to be rushed to the hospital\nBecause of health that you're so much for the mental anguish of being separated from her grandson with special needs and she presented in court and still it for a longer attention finally actually it was only when Congress person\nPeso O'Rourke got involved that she was released it'll turn to reunite with her grandson where our Maria and her grandson today\nThere in Connecticut he's still under the custody she was seeking to move from we can visit to having guardianship of him again but she has to go through the bureaucratic hoops while she also appeals from Saddam claim I spoke with her a few weeks ago\nAnd she said you know I Need to go to a psychologist I'm scars a deep I forget what I was saying I Can't sleep at night it was all the symptoms that I've identified myself worked in war zones I bet she told me you know that when she first saw him he wasn't being taken care of properly\nHe was in this heavily air conditioned room just shivering saying you know a mommy mommy why did you hear and Everytime they leave each other after a visit all day and they both go through the suffering because they're reliving the moment to the separation\nWas EMS international prime griffey another story now about family separations is one with a twist assorted about Seventy years ago when the border between Alaska and Russia was officially closed\nIt was the start of the Cold War and the Soviet Union impose what was called the ice curtains the border finally reopened about three decades ago but even though travel is possible\nA lot of families live on both sides of the ... sea remain split Emily ... recently spent a week with one family waiting to make the trip from Nome too caught up in Russia\n[noise] in a tiny kitchen in an apartment and known Valentino can you get cut off aid to pop\nUp for it I go and washed for [noise] how you do [noise] that are really fun\nFor her two daughters find and all of that try to keep our mind off the rather that kept us grounded here on the west side of the parents strange how I have two parents [noise] many years [noise] I'll come up either\nWay primary fire parents crane not identify say hello can you can actually rents and gamble a lot of LA\nJohn St line finally gonna bearing the it's only about eighty miles as the crow flies from their ... that's the tiny coastal village where can you can correct\nIn Russia and pass away three of her sister or brother napkins and and many of her friends start west communique isn't really that far from home but getting there and it's tough\nFor starters the runway on the Russian side often gets ...
