[{"month": "10", "state": "NV", "station": "KUNR", "content": "It's two o'clock [noise]\nHey Jenny here before we start today shows on what you know that this episode contains descriptions of violence and sexual violence and it is probably not suitable for young children so if you've got young children in the room or if you're not feeling up for it just be one\nWay you're\nNot\nListening to radio lab [noise] radio from W and why [noise]\nThree two on hey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab and today we have a legal case well it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal case\nIt's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal\nCase this case it's it's um what my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away it it gets under your skin and this is Lisa ... I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nHappy Columbus school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she said that I'm not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna feral who brought us the story and under whose skin it also seems to have gotten yeah\nIt it just made me\nNot know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nSure Jim Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist former newspaper guy for the post ... he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the ... which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people ages Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping in the Adirondack pulled off the road a aside wrote off route thirty\nThey made up of makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two towns and went to sleep for the night\nAnd on Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM to the campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they saw was his middle aged men peering into the tent\nLooked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on a sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck\nSunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck and\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he got\nThe other campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing a semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen ah of killed before and I'll kill again I'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods took them into the woods near a brook\nIn pairs of two with him behind them are the kids of course we're scared out of their wits he pulled out some real ups basically he had he had each them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun at him and then the last one he tied so after we had the four people tied he went back\nTo the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip dumb blue ski and because the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear\nClearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled with voice get really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happening to him\nWhat was happening with the man is ... buck knife\nYou step inside times and the cats\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running neck Fiorello ran to his car Carol and melon asking ran through the woods [noise]\nBut the man caught one of them David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had to lay down in a ditch next to\nKind of monitor the situation I guess so Freeman in um the killer laying in the chapter then our men come men that the other two Cantor's the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert locals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted done a killer and Freeman laying down in the ditch and when they did Freeman\nBought a done a killer and Freeman laying down in the ditch and when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun and he's going to shoot\nAnd the man with a gun just kind of stood up\nAnd calmly and Cooley walked into the forest and us began what was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road as you can see\nWhen the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in the state police standing by our there was a scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down on manpower into a ... patrols men\nArmed with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods they eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate when it comes back with an ID A\nThirty seven year old Robert De Niro Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward to today he was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape temp seven years now armed with a thirty thirty rifle and nice\nAnd the story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday how do you feel at night when the people got panic when you're all well one of the doors are short of our people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fast I don't hear that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left\nBarbecue smoldering they left behind coolers says the manhunt dragged on what happened was Carol was able to use those camps in that food and those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men now\nThe police following the lead and that he had stolen car and he had been citing\nThe police follower lead that he had stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on him\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest summer\nThat day a conservation officer named ... spotted Guerra\nThese a freeze or drop your gun something to that effect and Guerra started running\nLow blocked fire four times got 'em in the back\nThe arm and the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw a girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but\nThat you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\n\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with them they're really in the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing\nBut you wouldn't talk\nAnd it's at this point that the story that I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this is a law professor Liesl arm and again he's\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording so the guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank Armani Frank H army and Brenda the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or or\nYou never know whether to pronounce it or money or urban [laughter] that's Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use our money but it is our money\nA couple of months ago producers Simon I learned I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York this our money's now in his eighties he's retired\n[noise] my name is Frank our money and I was the attorney for Robert\nGirl um where I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like ... how did this whole story start for you well\nWe're just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I like ... flights go forwards I'd like standing up for the little guy and that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for defendants you're fighting the state and tear it\nAnd he was doing really well he was well respected had a good reputation but then he met Robert\nDe Niro yeah life you're strong to take him out you need a forty five and a or juice had that feeling the this guy is dangerous and love of things are going to happen\nThis is a year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers he represented him at first on two pretty small things wind won\nA schoolteacher headless self to his child he was sued the school and I talk to them a little bit\nTo the school and I talk to them a little bit and then he had an automobile accident I represent them um that\nBut then pretty quickly it gets dark Garrett was charged with trying to kidnap to college kids that kids got dismissed but then\nWe kept picture for [noise] um molesting some younger kids\nTwo very young girls it's ten eleven Darrell was released on bail he skipped this court date and just disappeared and then we pick up where we left off the murder the manhunt and an August ninth the night Guerra got captured Frank gets a call from\nThere about thirty minutes don't you talk to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went up the back door [noise] took of driving that lady friends car to try to lose any too\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here\nMay be as far as we can walk up to this old abandoned mine [noise]\nI went out there last February with reporter Lauren ... and the town's supervisor of Mariah Tom ... says it's a road that goes to the mine is or what is your after the minds it was then sort of hilly area off the side of the road is this a\nTrail of her own or you're just a very icy that day this hair is used to be an old roadway [noise]\nWe're walking up a very wooded hills is fairly deep there were no leaves and all the trees were black and I'm Sorry skeletal walking right and they use\nAnd I'm very skeletal walking right in the same area that Armenian that's just the only way they came in here so\nHere we are in our Sunday suits and here we go tragedy choose for is looking for the case\n[noise]\nBut none of them were just looking around [noise]\nAnd then [noise]\nWe found this when her ... well\nYou see the air shaft there they find this air shaft which it was just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the ... the my coffee carefully let's get any such thing yeah you don't want to fly down there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank Armani lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight did he takes out\nAnd then don't see how my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak the blue shoe a blue\nSneaker [noise]\nAnd and a leg I said to myself this son of a bitch does it end he yells back up to ... get me out of your boom me back up\n\n\nEventually algae found the other body ... body she was in a cemetery workout had said he left her but our money wasn't there when the algae founder so what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's play that out what what are your options shirt so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right no you can't\nYou just can't we took her to know to keep the confidence is over ... under the current rules\nWhich have developed quite a bit since the time this happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or a substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that has yet that can be or we'll be right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up and even if they have hired\nDetectives and even if a local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's no if if if the people are already dead than you who the law is ... that's right\nThan you who the law is ...\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is\nIs to to play this part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates ... even if everybody hates you even if maybe you have yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person\nThat fights as hard as they can for the client\nThe lawyer is the agent of his client only only the agent of land or also citizen and a member of the ... and part of the justice system and there's a\nThere's a there's a double murder here and families seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right is there a ... year building on on the side of tell just tell tell\nOf course a soon and I knew Mr hawk from bowling [noise] 'cause his ... daughter were in the same class and I knew him from church and\nOne or if you have to be amenable to feel\nThe anguish of the parents of the family and yet you you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\nBetween the two more morality [noise]\n\nSo now what is coming up that hard but it's even harder\n[noise] we'll be right back [noise] [noise]\n[noise] Hi this is already from Arlington, Texas

I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right they do they knew this thing\nBut it was a client was very guilty of something they'd found the bodies of these two girls and a no brainer what is it what what's their next move well\nSo they decided to put the burden plea bargain that take this information to the prosecutor and say I have information that will help you solve some cases some case yes\nAnd in exchange I Want you to give me a better deal for my clients to get Guerra into a mental hospital instead of a prison Oso right away they are going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give the moon and you're going to take a little well\nThat's kinda gross oh yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank perspective he's got this information\nAs a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargains then that's a way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client\nSo report Jim Tracy again they called a meeting with Henry McCabe investigator from the state police the duct tape and the district attorney\nCalled a meeting with Henry McCabe investigator from the state police detective McCabe and the district attorney armies office and when they met army ... search the briefcase was up to be a an investigator make sure they weren't wearing a bug\nBecause they're paranoid there's going to be a wiretap or some sort of bug and then a Belgian presents the deal he says listen I've got information on two bodies\nI Want you to agree to put my client in a mental institution instead of sending them off the president and the prosecutor apparently very quickly put two and two together and immediately thought\nAt least they told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven as for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room most of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was love feast\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that\nI don't go was here are just was a lawyer to do this job [noise]\nUh I mean I was a good lawyer ...\nThrough art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and bell gee did a good body is case it's taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what a people thing what if what if what if\nYou think so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class\nSo I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham just stand\nUp um I agree um his duties to his client who represents his client's best interest if you've\nBeen sitting in on these classes and in talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to it they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n\nSo from from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families involved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of\nPhone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she initially didn't want to go\nOn the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing your mind and decided that she did want to go on the record okay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm a mother\nSusan was the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing while she was camping with her boyfriend and she's who our money in Belgium founded\n... and she's who are money indulge you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn this story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools were teaching and and if you had any dealings with also about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nI 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical classes totally and comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes it was yes\nYou were the only in talking to you that I Know that it may be they ought to think not only about the criminal who they are trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal shot in their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um the did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes in only oh my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing\nWe flew immediately and and went to the police station and uh when we were there sitting with the police men they received a policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call at the unease my daughter's boyfriend\nWhat his body was found and that's that's all we knew and we never really had any updates and nobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just\nNever really had any updates and nobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was or some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later\nAnd in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a total Eli\nThe lawyer maybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of\nOf horror and [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law schools\n[noise]\nSo anyway just to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professors law students there um when they approached though says it's with a lot\nOf sensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain the I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it and so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk\nTo you to kind of um let you have a chance to communicate some of that experience yeah well it's impossible to\nReally communicate and words\nI mean forty years later I'm Still I I ... and it's still a struggle to discuss this because you don't ever go away as long as I live so\nI don't I guess\n\nI'm Wondering if we've been talking a lot of um substance\nWe've been talking a lot of um substance I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know that you're going to share I don't know you don't have to but\nWell\nWhat can I say she was she did receive her degree past she must when we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where we're too difficult for us\nAnd [noise] and Danny what's her boyfriend had best jets that summer\nAnd he had a full scholarship to harbor any uh graduated just before and so to live and I'm sure the other two children had great future I had a true and\nIt's just a horrible tragedy\n\nSo horrible you know to be in the position\nTo live [noise] I mean how do you release whose daughter you know would would excuses for you to protecting the person to kill her new justification you couldn't just apply in my mind\nI don't expect them to accept it but it's a way it is\n\nUm and then you get just a minute of silence I tear if that's OK\n\n\n\nEchoes of dogs coming out new things tend to travel up the hill kind of bouncing around a water I think it's some deeper down in their ... thing I Can't tell which tripping everything up here it's frozen solid sure what that is um I think I'm going to turn background\nWhich had put some flowers or something", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab

know\nAnd\nListening to radio lab [noise] radio from W and why [noise]\n[noise] hey um\n[noise] [noise]\nHey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today too\n[noise] [noise] they're gonna start\nThis show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times he's a guy we've had on the show before and say something\nHigh [laughter] than [laughter] okay I think it's a good thing\nWhere we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started again what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nKilled when I became a national\nStory [noise] there was a lot of ... and the press how many people do is they killed in the United states about by the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what would we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire me arrived hasten Harris than double John or animals become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trend in one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply yeah the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part\nI said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police for an itself in\nThe police department it does on the local level however uh it doesn't exist in any accurate way up by a broader agency it and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida in two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers are the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you\nTwo thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers submitted for department of law enforcement\nBut I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database\nMost of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that's right so Ben and his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nBirth birth study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records laws and legally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places and ... and sat down and started emailing\nEvery single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nAnd three hundred and eighty eight emails\nAsking for five years or so is paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting now for\nThis involves a year of work how many police departments getting lawyers involved is is a massive thing that evolved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThings that have been put together\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of Bush of that\nA while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here\nTo check it out yeah how many how many accidents you think you have sitting on the stuff probably five thousand pages I have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me sit six feet tall we got him broken down by county but you can see uh [noise] so a or B\nUh [noise] so a or B county ... in Boynton Beach uh all the way through the\nAlphabet and you basically just have a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across the entire desk by\nThe combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represents\nA eight hundred and thirty one\nShootings I Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and the and in six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise]\nSo we did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team didn't involve a an armed suspect was or chase\nAll the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those bullets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and\nUm [noise] you know hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons and some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there are lots of link to it from my website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations in other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency to keep track of this stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest and sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after you\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers of states that he about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category and he says you know what you see like on the most basic level\nAre are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is the case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence in the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds any time of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases the whole suicide by cop\nWhich is where somebody who's usually a mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally person is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door and raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon\nSo it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know\nThe news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line in dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question what do the number say about race I think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that\nA forty percent of people shot by police are black and that is\nScent of people shot by police are black and that is a dead as out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nAnd your what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nSouthern tell us much right now but the breakdown between the ... for their same demographics and as we've that they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve\nSome form of resisting arrest you know and we talked with in the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent\nYou know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty the numbers themselves don't really get you very far and present six kind of ... he says one percent or more years just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what gets me is like the I don't know it's back to\nWhere we were in why we want to start this methane gas bill just moved by the single case is the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is\nYou know I mean they're all written in this uh employment investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler receive a call on this is the Cato as Daryl police speak Fowler approached department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles\nArmed with a knife and apartment to five five but every one of these things every report is at least one human life someone was either you know\nHuman life someone was either you know [noise] more often than not gravely injured or killed [noise]\nUh so we have on this table that the investigation of death [noise]\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one people\n\nSo we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay times as we grabbed a couple of soldiers right off the Montgomery giant boulders to act to follow wherever those stories might lead\nMatt guilty and then traveled around Florida and a few different occasions talking to the people behind those statistics you heard and today we're going to bring you one of those stories\nAnd if you're interested after this episode you can head to our website radiolab dot org and you can hear part two of the series where we follow a totally different story than the one we're going to tell you about today but I'm not I guess a will just turn it over to you now you're okay a ... day one yeah where was this place in\nSylvie by and I wouldn't be doing anything\nDo after the event ended up community center crystal took a bunch of the mom they'll gotten their cars and drove over to this like little gem shop\nLike you guys do this after every every event or no for no just wanted it on a trip to no good ones and has been telling everyone about them\n... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nSo no we didn't know anything about this but they must be part of the different types of learning as part of just hoping remind you right we all just simply trying to find our way\nTheir personal gathered like probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the largest age at certain point because it was talking to these two women and she just had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like some deep [noise]\nThen I open my windows and I just knew will go through my house she says his age comes her down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christel House\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over the crystal\n[noise]\nMid sized one story house in the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin were in the kitchen cooking chicken\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together they like they bring with them or their own stories these stories of grief of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun [noise]\nAnd the night before they'd all gone out dancing together [noise]\nTo be some earth wind and fire [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton we start to stay over it and how we see each other head on the couch you know um air mattresses it becomes like a huge sleep over\nAnd the rest of the policy for up talking you know getting to know each other you know some sort of shows resource like therapy for\nLet me pass but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really stuck with me I Believe we're at a sex Marlin problems to\nWin crystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either\nTwelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we were basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass\nSo we usually the video that frequently just saying now that that's\nMom's house probably over like right now and then the police caught attain behind them was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here [noise]\n\nAnd that's why we call execution a vegetable garden 'cause the guard and once the\nGoing and all that but I I Am then 'cause ah when they when they you know when they took him away in released into down the type of stuff we came back here is all you can smell what's going on\nAnd so now like when you got any like it's it's not it's it's not as bad now but just the association for when I'm cleaning onions and you get that smell like it just you get those flat ... in\nYour country and it brings you right back here mhm yep\nAnd the toy was just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\nSometimes ... some of the other one that started to cry\n[noise]\nAnd then you don't want me to uh take some yeah my ... a lot a little bit of fun to me a couple of women had to be their phone my\n\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera with this sort of straight face a three to one\nAnd then let me\nThree two one\nLet me all started walking back up to the cars [noise]\nFirst of all I just want to thank you for just sharing with us but I Know [noise]\nTo say yeah I Know yeah we haven't been I have a law\nIt was also the great science we've run out once a week\nAnd I three o'clock in the morning [noise]\nRemember the and I used to tell you I saw how do you live so far away from\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nYeah my son was about Fifteen minutes that every time I visit\nHome I have to go there all the time of course\nYeah that would force how could you not\nKnow what you do you want to go take a chair\nSit there yeah\nAnd he's crazy because like it\nIs it fair yeah\nAnd he's crazy because like if a if a cemetery like a little bit further out\nAnd it's crazy you know about yeah like a certain time every\nDay and it's been a little white man we share everything like that but he literally I think he does he like going to have lunch with every day\nBy day and it would be lovely if it's a way I like going on and all of that and it's a little what got us all wasted not do\nYou think he's chair of the home\nNever go but um [noise]\nSo the trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happen to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip\n[noise] are you\nAre to me to reveal who was the mother Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nShe was on stage with Michael Brown smother Eric Garner's mother\nI watched as my daughter was loaded into the ground\nIt was around the time that a few of these women started called themselves the mothers [noise]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC\n\n\n\nAnd it was weird because in this short amount of time [noise]\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nOf felt like at the time a support group and suddenly become\nComing up and put it down a cop with a gun a man with a knife\nAnd a look at the razor thin life or

officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we hit home or the officers use time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans unicorn tried to stab one I mean you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal commands first warned them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nAnd it's important 'cause there are guys partner was holding a gun and have you heard that hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest in communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual\nThat they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead I mean it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek\nIsn't just a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there is no connection there is a lot easier to see somebody whose name was faceless and I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that and establish some kind of a poor that made the officer think of how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nAnd actually after we finish watching a video and I was packing up ... told me that just a couple of months after that incident\n... through the neighborhood if you want to miss it on

chiefs and twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for these forests and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is\nFor us and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is the sanctity of human life [noise]\nAnd just a month after ... put out those principles to the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police\nAnd the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against these guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job in somebody's principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive conversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago\nHuh I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women\nWho have a have become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing the way police things done in America at least maybe slowly right but cumulatively it\nDoes I hesitate to use this word but it does make it does

spirit of the bleep we should say this episode a contains some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no don't don't see that we have to say that we don't we have to and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping so we must what we've done is is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with a you may want to make one on it yeah anyway the story comes\nTo us from producers Simon at her so let's start can we start in two thousand eight sure about what the song yes please [noise]\n\n\nSo ah December twenty seventh a sunny Saturday morning ah this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of\nFacebook\nWas a humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies that right there\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering Stephanie newer\nWhat are you calling in\nNursing has been like breastfeeding the intent was really just\nAnd has been like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would upload those photos to Facebook in these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this [noise] they want and Facebook to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [noise]\n\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this small\nPeaceful protest would turn out to be\nThis morning a face off on Facebook and one of the opening shot Facebook triggered hordes knows what would become a loud but to face with rockets\nAnd global\nBattle embattled Facebook today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches but but rather something that I think is a deeper than both of them free speech [noise]\nViolence against Rohingya Muslims what we can say in what we can't say that again by just like ... to ... when we\nCan see and what we can see it led Mueller right kids in front of\nMe on the Internet [noise]\n\nThank you Mr Cameron and Mr soccer America got to\nYou subjectively prioritize or sensors speech\nWhat congresswoman or we don't think I'm overdoing of censoring speech\nBut there are types of what what what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook where you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of I can say on Facebook that digital document it's about fifty pages if you print it off\nAnd diet in bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the glow which made me wonder like\nWhat are these rules how were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test so ah let's start back a on that morning and two thousand in the morning that you could argue started at all\n[noise]\nCome in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was a big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch and just\nSo I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when one of whom was actually in that room at that moment and now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did\nAnd now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought into read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so\nAt the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind\nThis was in the early to thousands seismic change in the week and the Internet hierarchy and this was like the deep dark path and ice space time is now the most visited website in the U.S Facebook had somewhere in the neighborhood of\nTen million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table each\nOf them in front of their own computer and things that come up onto their ... to Facebook\nAnd on Lake meaning like I use or saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards this is Kate clinics she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing\nAnd and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content and then [noise] that content\nAlong with an alert would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen most of what you were seeing was either\nNaked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason why someone had reported\nBecause it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying and Everytime something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at that computer would\nEvery time something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at the computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it down and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou turn your pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do at this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you or you both wouldn't known you Google some things\nIt really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard uh what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards at the at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there are a one page long and basically all this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad taken down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breastfeeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until [laughter]\nRise a fight for the rights that Brett\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but\nAccording to Stephanie me are those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group\nWho had organized ironically enough through Facebook so to coincide with alive protest it just ... you know typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse in two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding\nTo an image of\nBreastfeeding and then change their status\nTo the title of our group a Facebook breastfeeding is not a pain and it caught on social networking website is under fire for any pollinate on photos of women brand new meeting their children in twelve thousand members participated and the media request started pouring in the face of God\nSent by sitting in that I didn't hundreds of interviews for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine in New York Times Washington Post\nSo the Internet is a trusting of Dr phil it was a media storm and eventually\nPerhaps as a result of our group in our efforts Facebook was forced to get much more specific about their rules so\nFor example by then nudity was already not a lot on the site but they had no definition for nudity they just say no nudity and so the site integrity team that those twelve people at the time they they realized they had to start spelling out exactly what they meant\nPrecisely all of these people at Facebook were in charge of trying to define unity\n[noise] well I thought I'm going\nAre generally we\nFound out pretty quickly ... none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nUm so there's a lot of reading for me happening\nA lot about the good work at ... at a certain convey for now I don't I search by these you know sorry she worked in\nI mean like we just came out of there [noise]\nI Know your life in fact\nI Know you're lying in fact most\nPeople wouldn't even admit they work for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in like in India that they find\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to walk the do you want to be named or do you know where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather do that that's the only find you know I just kind of land victory I don't want them\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to uh admit that they worked for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAct flew about ...\nWon several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which is your Facebook you might want\nYou know I I signed up to monitor graphic images just given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact that that's going to have I I tell you guys are so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his head phones [laughter]\nIgnored ...\nCase by case by case by case forty five I Will test every day which just image and efficient and it's just such a\nSize five thousand a day you just said yeah I was like it was a lot of case he\nHe said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every\nThree or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day oh\nWell ... if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nThat's just like they all got ... um it's too dangerous to X. rated or\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things\nThat we had to explain to you know people will be squashed by attached to you know people in cages ... like\n[noise] a Thirteen year old girl I'm having sex with an eight year old boy and it's not just watch it over and over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up at night as you do that is\nAbsolutely absolutely ... percent um it can be up at night uh\nCatching some thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax he had to start avoiding things\nThat they were there were specific like I said I couldn't watch it was like okay so ... ... S C I was like okay and then I had to wear exploding like nope nope I have to walk away\nAnd I just I had to I I it's just it's too real [noise] I I saw that I it's it's classic adjusted\nThe different moderator I spoke to describe it as being the worst side of humanity you see\nAll of this stuff that you and I\nDon't have to see because they're going around playing cleanup yeah what a job well ... and ... and it's worth noting that are more and more this work is being done in an automated fashion particularly with content like a Gore or terrorist propaganda\nOr they're getting harder

or so I have\nMemories of of watching some of the coverage shelling new images just release of the Boston bombings I remember seeing the photo published online and it wasn't long after that\n[noise] someone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the orders events here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly voters going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this images reading like wildfire across their platform is it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like should we allow it or should they take it down according to their rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone\nAnd so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yep however half the ... says\nNo the other people are saying this is newsworthy essentially this photos being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediate\nBend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately received\nPush back well I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and\nThere are no exceptions there is either or their mistakes were improvements we made the guidelines for moments like this do edge of the other side shoots\nBack oh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe's publishing this all over the place and we're taking a down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy how how do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of\nThe stuff that in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down but before they can pull the lever\nWord starts making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources an executive ... sent down in order\nWe were essentially told make the exception\nHuh\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this doubt\nYes oh yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook is just become a publisher ... but they don't think maybe they have but they've made a news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization\n... and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like Facebook a sort of collective scrap book\nFree speech like is Facebook is sort of collective scrap\nBook for us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you\nWant or yeah it is it now a news organization strength parents\nThey let me let me get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get the one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook is\nAnd this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this is a a\nView us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and I said you're responsible for your content which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamentally at at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products\nBasically sucker burg and others that the company are arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the well Facebook currently sits\nOn this little idyllic legal island where are\nThey can't be held liable for much of anything they're subjected to fewer regulations however were were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside what ... what really strikes me about all of this is it's here you have a company that really uh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both\nBeen crafting a set of rules that are both as objective as possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound than what people find interesting more important what what people find newsworthy ... he'll give and I'll give you an I'll give you a great example of this\nOr that having just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of northern Mexico and it's a video of a of a woman being grabbed and forced onto her knees in front of a camera\nAnd then a man with his face covered grabs her head pulled her head back and slices her head off right in front of the camera and this video starts being spread\nI Can't

I just got the ... now you're try\nThis one of Robert Krulwich and our producer someone wheeler talked to a writer Adam Gopnik about George Carlin was George Carlin mentioned\nOh because Carlin is a wonderful sort of folk philosopher language you're talking about the comedian meeting yeah [noise]\nIt's like saying is about the English language it's about middle expressions we use we we all stay in the little sayings and expressions that we use all the\nTime oh this is one of his great subject really seemed to examine these expressions and all the more interesting because he was he didn't even have a high school education you know so he was not something that he got from schooling and one of\nGOP next favorite curling nurse and I really like just want to just about how Carlin hated euphemism I don't\nLike words that high the truth I don't like where's the conceal reality I don't like euphemisms and American English is loaded with euphemisms because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality economy was wonderful about things like that was about both as he calls and we I've known\nPeople in this country normal people we shift them all away and we brought in these senior citizen [noise]\nIsn't that a ... he was on some of\nWe use you for his I've just been through my father in law died four months ago and we went through those same horrible business that we all go through in intensive care ward where the doctors and nurse practitioners have a language that they've been taught we just want your father to be comfortable he's gravely ill\nThat they've been taught we just want your father to be comfortable he's gravely ill is gravely I mean she's dying right and we want him to be comfortable means can we give them enough drugs to the hill\nPass out before he dies and so and so it's certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing but no one is full what we're mocking is the absurdity of the effort to disguise something that you cannot disguise book Carlin's real point was that it it like does\nOur reactions to it that actually have like a cabin negative fat and it gets worse with every generation and he has a whole bet it's about um shell shock becoming pie TST no he goes no because it's in four different things\nIn the first World War that condition was called shell shocked\nThey used to call it shell shots simple ... direct language two syllables shell shocked and then it became battle fatigue\nBattle for the fourth of those now takes a little longer to say doesn't seem to hurt as much and then after it became battle fatigue then it became operational exhaustion [noise]\nHey we're up to eight syllables now then it became post traumatic stress disorder ... we've added a hyphen and then it became peachy as the post traumatic stress disorder that pain is completely buried under jargon\nThis wasn't or will notion that you could erase sensitivities if you blended out the words so if you stop saying oh yeah we just tortured the guy if you say some free choice\nOf interrogation or enhanced interrogation that makes a big difference in part of a curling saying is that like now that his pie TST we are not having the appropriate reaction to it I mean its shell shocked\nNot having the appropriate reaction to it I mean its shell shocked\nI'll bet ya if we'd have still been calling a shell shocked some of those

nothing to keep his yogurt company in business you did what any self respecting entrepreneur does he called his mother and borrow thirty thousand dollars from her\nAnd on the Planet Money will look for small tweaks to annoying problem it's an hour of economics and innovation on the Planet Money and how I built this up next from NPR on KU when are\nWe get support from Nevada humanities presenting chicken and stirred an arts and humanities mixer\nIt's a fun tag team lecture onto seemingly unrelated topics piracy an opera Wednesday October Seventeen six PM and under the rose brewing details in Nevada humanities dot org\n... up and run a rubber ... radio lab and today experiments in translation\n\n\n\nLet some number five how does it make the robbers all without a ride ... corner they should give them the by whom I better he's ... the deadly bugs little ... ... you know you try\nTo you guys mind if in the remaining few minutes we're going on an\nArmy fishing expedition sure sure it's the here's here's the here's our quandary girl okay what's your situation we're doing Sean ... recently we sat down with a reporter and science writer Carl Zimmer to talk about\nOur name ... we're talking about something else in our name came up at the end 'cause heres why ever since we started doing this show Robert got his [laughter]\nHis I got a little insistent little interest in a good year like our innate we got to learn it yes I said that are and I was like what do you want to do and you're like I Want to do or nay and I was like but is there a story and you're like no no I didn't\nSay that I just said that that ... that that if you understood what our innate does you'd realize the translation is profoundly important to our existence that's why I said yeah well as often happens you or\nMe down as like All right fine let's just try it and they'll say you know so we're talking with Carl Zimmer we brought it up and unfortunately I think this is a day when you were out of\nWith Carl Zimmer we brought it up and unfortunately I think this is a day when you were out of town not secure your son was getting married yes he was and uh her I was doing like tech team work for me\n[laughter] okay All right so the definition of translation and biology is taking a sequence in DNA and using the genetic code to translate it into proteins ... ... ... and the discovery\nOf this was maybe even more exciting than the discovery of the double helix structure\nReally yeah it was bigger than Watson and Crick yeah well at least equivalent wow so here's a quick story so what happened was\nOkay so just to set the table here we all know the DNA is a thing and that when you're born you get half your DNA from your mom and a half your DNA from your dad and Francis Crick and and er James Watson just figured out the structure of DNA that basically\nThe rest of the of DNA your recipe is comprised of four bases in a long string a T C and gee that's it he's the problems he like we humans were more than DNA we are these flashy pain piles of muscle and bone and all of that stuff all the stuff stuff of us comes from ... yeah\nWe have like a hundred thousand different proteins and our body different kinds of pertains to the question was like how how does all that good generated\nLike how did this for simple base has become the acids to become the hundreds of thousands of proteins that make us us\nDo you make the transition ... people were thinking of this as just this incredibly complicated problem that might never be solved and the first person to really think seriously about this was not a geneticist as cosmologist named George gamma huh and gamma just said wait a minute this isn't the\nThis is cosmologist named George gamma huh and gamma just said wait a minute this isn't that complicated this is just ...\nThis is a code problem ... thought okay I Know the DNA is ... four bases ATC and GE and ...\nDays somehow create hundreds of thousands of protein so I just need to think\nOf a of a clever way of [noise] you know creating a little code machine where you\nPut in the DNA the ACC TGI keeps\nGoing and then out comes the protein\nHow what what simple code could I Do to do that and just sitting there no experiments no nothing just thinking this guy came out two sides I think that ourselves read our genes three bases at a time\nLike instead of a T. C. G. A. C. cannot thought maybe it's a TA C. C. G. P. C. A. A. C. A. G. A. T.\nIn other words whatever it was it was reading the DNA and sell maybe it was reading it in triple not care because if you have a sense of three or rather than to game I figured well that'll give mathematically would give you more possibilities and that might put you on a path to making all those hundreds of thousands of\nProteins now this was just a guess but shortly after the double helix duo Watson and Crick and a group of other scientists worked it all out they they've figured out how you get from physically get from DNA into proteins\nHere's how it works sort of inside the cell the DNA is sitting\nThere and [noise] all coiled up [noise] a set of molecules come along attached to it as if it and make a copy of\nThis coffee is now made of ... which is like DNA very similar and still in the base", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "13", "locations": [["Vermont", 44.00034, -72.74983], ["Nairobi", -1.28333, 36.81667], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Columbus", 39.96118, -82.99879], ["Seattle Washington", 47.60621, -122.33207], ["Dulles", 38.94877, -77.4491], ["Carlin", 43.084, -7.82892], ["Carlin", 43.084, -7.82892], ["Vietnam", 16.16667, 107.83333], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Salt lake", 40.76078, -111.89105], ["Bronx New York", 40.84985, -73.86641], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Boston", 42.35843, -71.05977], ["Nevada", 39.25021, -116.75119], ["Nevada", 39.25021, -116.75119]], "not_found": ["Miami Washington DC", "TA C.
