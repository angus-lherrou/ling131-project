I didn't\nThan I don't think he would say yes I think\nHe would say no just goes back to what\nI think Spencer was worried about\n[noise] I think Spencer was murdered them out and was\nJust the possible side effects of a frightening [noise] on that region rent [noise] and how he might not turn out nearly the same afterwards it was very risky\nThey all turned the questions over and over in their heads for twenty four hours the truth is that they were faced with the small but very scary possibility that Spencer could die without the surgery so like most people do when faced with the options they opted for life with at risk that that life would be depreciated they opted\nFor potentially worse off life over the fear of no life at all and that Thursday they watch this and to wield off to a brain surgery\nThey pay the holes in the hospital they bought rounds of coffee in the cafeteria just\nLiterally watch this analogue clock on the wall kind of ... through the minutes and\nOnly go to the cafeteria and playing the piano ... for gas and that calmed me down a little bit classical uses those things out of the time\nYou know finally Dr Kim uh came through the double doors into the cafeteria and he still\nHad his scribes on in his mouth was pulled down hanging around his neck and he looked there was just it was just this little corner of his mouth that was turned slightly upward and that told me it\nIt went well and he said you did the right thing\nSo [noise] yeah that felt good [noise] [noise]\nSince I was alive vegetative but that was expected he woke up very slowly at first she couldn't walk or talk\nReally he woke up very slowly at first she couldn't walk or talk to take care of himself [noise] but over months and months and we have with his family by his side he re learned at all [noise]\nEveryone was watching every step of the way to see if the surgery which had to pass right through every important region of the green [noise] had somehow fundamentally changed Spencers spending [noise]\nTo see if his career had come true really [noise]\nI feel like before my brain surgery and after um like a completely separate person\nYou know they they took out a piece in my school for no reason no how many weeks like ... three weeks\nSomething like that and there's like a picture of me in the hospital has made a tape my brand of my head as you said you know just all and like I Can't I honestly can't remember like anything before my whole\nSurgery so this was his worst fear supposedly becoming a new person but ironically it doesn't matter because he doesn't remember that old person who feel that um\nI I Can't it's like I woke up in a new wife so different person you know it's like two separate lives\nYou gotta pay with you is that okay with me yeah\nI mean it\nDoesn't matter if it does or does it like that is what it is I there's been times when I haven't been okay with it but but I get worked up and it's like why am I getting worked up or something I can do to change it so I've learned for it to be okay and I'm totally okay with it now but maybe like a year ago I wouldn't have been okay with it\nIt doesn't get hearing aids I think you know ways you could have changed\nNo no not at all\nIt just seemed to me I Love that this is really great new age\nIt all it just seemed to me I Love that this is really great new\n[laughter] thank you thank you yeah\nIf you ask his family his mom and dad his brother they say he's an actor leaders changed and these memories messy but that thing that made Spencer Spencer that's still there\nAnd just let me ask you a question I asked you your brother and your parents what do you think our nature what makes us is that determined by your brain and what happens there ... or is that you can buy something else something spiritual that doesn't live anywhere physical\nI don't think it has to do with your brain maybe a little bit I think I have to do with your heart in white or metaphysical hard

are you doing today show up Hi Jason Smith Tommy Caldwell basketball John Dickey the pro rock climbing pro free use of the really the greatest brave to keep paying travel the world and climbed the hardest in most exotic\nIn two thousand north base sponsored the for them to climb in the mountains of\nPurchased on the scale famous yellow [noise]\nThis location in Kurdistan has been popular with backpackers especially Europeans for a long time not just climbers going there so for about Twenty years before we had gone there there was people traveling there every year so how do you mean they got a destination yes\nThe climbers we're used to massive peaks and dangerous clear faces but still as their helicopter descended into the care to valley and the yellow wall came into view they were blown away probably what\nImpact of this none of us that we weren't ready for with me the scale of the Himalayas just how much bigger than mountains Arlen everything we have over here at first it was a little bit difficult to wrap our heads around\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand and I was trying really really hard to establish that connection that's just what I wanted to even if you didn't need a hand I wanted him to have to take my hand to get up\nAnd ended up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me a rifle\nI was like well that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turned around and I\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turned around and I very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind holding this for a minute\nAnd I think that's probably one John's frame of mind starting to shift and I grabbed up to his hand and I pulled them up and he was just so happy and smiling from the area and he was patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like padded among the switch shoulder and they're like ... like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our characters in us completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their cause and we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to Abdul asking what the story was here and um to try to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goats and they praying they mind their own business but there's this guy in their country that's in charge for a really bad guy elected himself president for\nLife and they're not allowed to freely study their religion\nThe men were from is Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time there was a communist leaning dictator\nType figure several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of Muslim splinter groups with specific demands like the captors\nExplained that John but we were all going to go to this other place and then his boss was going to get on the phone call\nGo to this other place and then his boss was getting get on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this hour and then when we're all going to go home\nTheir captors plan was to focus international attention on hostages and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believes that they could not count on ransom rescue their best shot at living was to skate by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned the job that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and um my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember back in myself are pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try and wait it out Jason and John wanted to take matters into their own hands and the idea of killing somebody and and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our captors as is evil and you might think even though we have seen them murder somebody I very much saw them as victims of circumstance in some ways I specially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired\nMercenaries like I could look at him and be like who's to say that I Would it be right there in the same you know doing the same thing he was doing\nJason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but he would strategize about how we would pick up rocks bashing the schools are\nStabbed their next with sticks to gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice\nIt's very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to make for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little pony or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throat so am I going to jump on this guy and just by just throw his teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker raw and um yeah of the many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody than others\nUm\nAs they marched onto the rocky terrain one of their captors ... split on now is only two characters with guns to foreign climbers they walked and walked for a whole night and the message for a day and then did again and they did this for three days starving\nAnd I came up with this really good game to play to pass the time [noise] um where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was\nAnd you start imagining exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagine eating it and then you start trying to count again and then finally one of his\nBroken asks what time it was when we take guesses and it turns out than five minutes\nAnd I I think that's probably one Tommy changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I mean it was just on comprehend ... we were starving to death we were always shivering on your teeth were super sore from chattering all the time but there's just felt unbelievably long they did have a few things going for them\nJust felt unbelievably long they did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it does hungry sleep deprived men they could also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nAnd do seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said so here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your guns Base Camp and I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain along with only one of his men as guard and that one guard was to the Nineteen year old\nHe kind of started as weird where we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come in me to [noise]\nAnd then we were all going to go together somewhere there was safe and obviously a myth that he has bombed the story that I spent a week selling to us and bought a hook line and sinker [noise]\nAnd so I grabbed his arm and back then to not [noise] a shirt pleading with him not to go\nIn danger is out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he was had to tear himself away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him enough ago he he has this look of like you know I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off\nThey split up dual tracking down towards the Base Camp well Jason and his crew led to up the mountain now it was four to one [noise]\nI felt like my rib cage was going to explode there is just as ...\nGoing to explode there was just this ball and excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just wanted to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun and one guy has got to guns and a hand grenade a knife and you remove like all of that and you leave flight one down kid with a gun\nWith four other kids I completely changes everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate they basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on this sort of trend especially since it was the middle of the night and so John and I'm immediately\n\nCommunicated to each other that they was game on and this is going to happen and we all started kind of moving up that\nMountain together and I'm always trying to find [noise] uh\nI'm trying to always kind of direct to away that looks like the easiest way to also puts him in the most danger if he falls off it gets pushed off\nAnd you could tell that they were there like this is the moment I should I should push him right now this is our chance and then\nAnd then they wouldn't I stopped on a small ledge with Beth and the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something and I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this you think I should do it\nAnd she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything to them than believe morally and killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chance to survive [noise]\nTommy just kind of came flying over the top of me and were racing up the class and it just\nSort of scrambled up over behind him and she wasn't expecting it at all and but as I\nJim and she wasn't expecting it at all and but as I was reaching out to grab his guns drop the sense what was going to happen\nAnd he turned towards me up close to him I reached out to grab his gun strapping a poll as hard as I could and you just toppled over backwards\nHe just kind of wanting to sparks through them in like an eternity looked at me and he looked at me we made eye contact the whole way down\nAnd so he had the ledge in front of me maybe ten or Fifteen feet in front of me and\nHis whole body let us really horrible uh cracking sound because really loud and then he tumbled off of the darkness and\nI sat down and I just started falling um [noise]\nAnd then Beth [noise] showed up you know right after that and she sort of sat behind me\nI like that I can unjust zone out and just focus on peddling dropped my head down to really like look ahead cranks revolving\nJust
