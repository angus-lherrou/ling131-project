In all the years uh of living under my parents' roof I never broke a bone um my mother and father never one time had to take me to the emergency room and I strongly suspect that um we never had to\nUh buy a second box of band aids and the reason for that was pretty simple my parents were spectacularly protective\nAh and and Harvard over me to make sure that no pain or physical injury should occur\nI Lived in a state of New Hampshire but never set my feet into ski boats um I don't think a piece of athletic equipment ever crossed our threshold my\nMother made sure that I didn't enter the

Christmas my father ah through the tree across the floor\nUm my mother was gone surprisingly often and when she was it was left to me to hide the car keys\n[noise] and maybe because of that although I grew up to have the um the life of a certain level of artistic expression that heavy looted my two I'm enormously artistically gifted parents the goal that I found most elusive and wonderful was to be part of a happy family\nAnd I believe that my best shot of having happy\nRelatives was to give birth to them [noise]\nSo I married quite young at twenty three an artist I'm and though I Would come to realize over the years that we had surprisingly little in common um we did both share a passion uh creative passion although he was a painter and died was a writer I think we both\nMean you'll be

actually although I Love what I Do and I feel really\nExtraordinarily lucky to have gotten to do to do this all the years that I have um my one complaint\nAbout being a a writer for the page is that I don't get to see and hear the response of a reader to my work um\nAnd here the response of a reader to my work um so at the mosque they did and I could hear people laugh\nAnd I could hear people gasp sometimes [noise] um I also learned a lot I could feel when I can feel when you're losing somebody you can feel when you need to pull him back um\nIt it's it's a very immediate form of storytelling that actually has informed my writing for the page as well and not just my my memoir writing but but absolutely my fiction\nWe talked about how rarely writers get to experience firsthand the reactions of their audience back\nA million years ago when I was a reporter in New York City I remember one time riding the subway to Times Square and seeing somebody open up the New York times with a story that I had written and I was looking over her shoulder and I was so excited to watch her reading\nThat's so cool guy and I'm sure the person reading it would have died and she knew she was the next to the author\nI don't know I think there are probably greater thrilled in her life but but for\nMe um to be able to hear laughter that most of all to hear laughter\nPart of what makes you are writing so brilliant is your willingness to be vulnerable and like very open on the page did you feel even more vulnerable will be on stage with direct experience with the audience\nThe more willing you are to to expose your flaws and failings I Would just say you're humanness the the more you will the more I Will relate to an audience world audience will relate to me\nSo I wanted to ask for listeners who I

seats my father drove my mother was in the passenger seat my older brother to my left me in the middle 'cause I was the middle child and my baby brother to the right\nAnd one time on this road trip my

the driver's seat my mom and the passenger seat my older brother to my left my younger brother to my rights and we drove from Fort Knox Kentucky to Greensboro North Carolina to visit my father's parents my grandparents\nThat one point on the trip my mother said that she wanted to take a nap so she took off her seat belt and she sort of nestled herself and her seat\nAnd I said I wanted to take a nap to so I turned around um and I straddle the hump in the back of the Cadillac and I put my head down on the seat and went to sleep\nThe next thing that I remember is a there was a screech and scream and a crash and we'd been in a really terrible terrible car accident so remember\nI was six years old and my only contacts for car accidents was television so when I remember is if we had a musical soundtrack the music was gone and what was replaced was\nA heavy breathing and it was in slow motion and as I lifted my head and I look to my left I was facing the back I looked at my little brother who's trying to catch his breath which is probably the heavy breathing I heard and I looked in front of me in the car had been split in half we're kind of we hit an embarrassment\nSomebody hit us um and then I looked at my older brother\nSomeone that hit us um and then I looked at my older brother and he had blood on his forehead\nAnd as I kept turning around and I looked into the front seat of the car I saw my father still in his seat belt unconscious lying on the seat and then the dashboard the center of the car was also split in half and\nTo the right of the dash split and the dash there was\nBlood and teeth and above that\nA crack in the windshield and a little bit of blood there as well and I kept turning to the right and my mother was unconscious still lying where she

I may have some Still Alice is leftover if you're a fan of Presley but after those were sent off I started thinking about the reception [noise]\nI don't like the smell of flowers that give me a headache if I decided to make all of our center pieces I Would create flowers from buttons from his family and my family I made my wedding bouquet I created flowers from pieces of my grandmother's wedding dress and my mom's wedding veil\nAnd he went along with all of this [laughter]\nShe actually went with me to thrift stores picking out all the mixed matched vintage plates we would use for the reception and tracking down all the little talk first for the twelve cakes we were going to have is twelve I'm a big believer in cake so [noise]\nThere were things he cared about to mostly the music he actually wrote a song for me to walk down the aisle he composed it an orchestrated it and send it off to the band and we got prepared for our big day that's going to be so beautiful like an anthropology catalog threw up over everything but [noise]\nThat's what I wanted [laughter]\nWe got married on April twenty fourth which isn't my grandparents wedding anniversary they had been married sixty four years when the day of my wedding and I thought by picking that day it would bring the same good luck\nAnd we were married outside St Louis Missouri in a town called ... core which is his hometown in his sister's back yard so on\nAnd his sister's back yard so on April twenty fourth we hung all of the twinkling lights and the trees decorative little stars put out tables and my beautiful center pieces and on every seat lay down a custom made played bill I had done for the event\nNow all of this preparation he failed to mention that April in Missouri is tornado season [noise] I was actually watching a YouTube learning how to fold napkins into the shape of swans when the tornado siren\nWent off and then came the rain and then hail\nAnd wins and it knocked all of the table that over and all of my beautiful center pieces into the mud six months of making them every night\nAnd they were destroyed no one saw any of it\nNo luckily I was marrying a circus clown [laughter]\nThe only time that's lucky by the way\nWe had invited all of these ... people but we hadn't trapeze artist and jugglers and if there is anything they know how to do this pitch a tent so [noise] up once the big top\nAnd we cleared out the branches and threw away all of the handmade bunting I had made got my grandparents out of the tornado shelter that they had been trapped in I'm are ready to begin\nRabbit was supposed to be the ring bearer but she was not having it and she wouldn't get into a little card I made so we just proceed without her\n[noise] um [noise]\nWas looking forward to the song\n[noise] I was looking forward to the song\nHadn't heard it and I realized oh they're not going to play it because the bandleader had a heart attack [noise] he's fine um but they didn't feel comfortable playing it without him so instead I walked down the aisle to the theme song from the west wing [noise]\nFavorite show so um [noise]\nThe photographer had never shot a wedding before so she forgot to bring a flash 'em and some guy showed up and apparently brought a stomach virus that I had not registered for um [noise] so throughout the day people kept getting sick and dropping like flies amongst all of this\nThe worst part for me was that my dad decided not to come\nI didn't ask\nHim to walk me down the aisle and so he said I'm not going to be there and I have a stepfather that I've had since I was seven years old and I didn't want to get into the politics of which guy on which arm so I decided to walk myself [noise] but he didn't like it and so he chose not to come\nTo my mom called him I called him and he said well I send a check\nAs if that's the same thing\nOn his only daughter and he chose not to come to my wedding and that will always be true but I Can't do a father and daughter danced by myself\nSo I I danced with his dad my grandfather and as we weighed beneath the big top\nAnd as we weighed beneath the big top he looked at me and said your dad should have been here\nAnd he should've been and then\nMaybe he would have seen the small fire we had in the kitchen [noise] all of our hamburger spiders just went up in flames [laughter]\nBut\nHe also missed the double rainbow that came out after the storm it finally passed by and he missed our friends singing a song from Britain to do and and also has to pay and jump around [noise]\nAnd\nSo after all it wasn't the details that made the day I had thought it would be my custom made crossword puzzle policemen and specialty cocktail I have made [laughter] which is just jak and coke\nBut [noise] in fact it was our friends\nAnd the family that showed up for us\nAfter all the details don't make the day\nAnd they don't make the marriage either because I'm not married anymore and I don't think a perfectly sunny day and matching escort cards would have changed that we shouldn't have gotten married there are some things even take can't fix maybe\nIf I hadn't been so caught up in all of the preparations I Would have realized that but there are no articles on interest on how to stay married and Martha Stewart doesn't really tell you what happens after the big day is over\nBut even though it began with the storm\nBut even though it began with the storm it didn't end with one we were married increase corps which literally translates to broken heart and my dad says now [noise] [noise] well it looks like I didn't miss anything anyway\nBut he did he missed a part of my life\nAnd he also missed our friend I'm a meat loaf cover artist called pot roast um\nIt was also are videographer\nSinging karaoke in the garage well all of our friends stamps and the pedals\nSo we missed a lot\nYou would think that with all this I Would sort of be sick of weddings mean they're people who think they are a scam but I Love weddings I Love the details and stuff and I became a wedding planner\n[laughter] I've\nMarried about twenty five couples and they've been no tornado that any of them we've all been beautiful had perfectly detailed days I have added more and more pins probably about six thousand now all of these ideas going through my head\nAnd so if I ever get married again I'm totally going to a low [noise]\n\nCarry at him [noise] in addition to being a wedding planner Kerry also\nRuns an online store called the plumb fields shop and\nHer dream to be a magicians assistant I'm just putting that out there for you carry all it takes is one big breaking to see some pictures from carries wedding all the MTV Neal visit the mosque dot org I keep meaning\nAll the empty details visit the mosque dot org I keep meaning to ask Carrie if she includes karaoke led by pot roast as part of her standard wedding package that would be a big seller I think\nComing up a

U. in our public radio [noise]\n\n[noise]\nYou're listening to them off radio hour from PR acts I'm Jennifer ... next up our final story it's another from our show in Albuquerque with our partners K. A. N. W. here's Tristan reef live in New Mexico\nIt's a bright spring morning in the middle of the back woods of Oregon and I am volunteering to cut trail with my partner ... he's just ahead of me on the path and just suddenly I Know that it's time for me to ask the question that's been building up between us for months now have this\nJune to have a baby silence\nHe turns around and I see that he is laughing at me\nThis is the stupidest idea you've ever had [noise]\nNo I don't want to have a baby\nIn his defense or we had our hands full we were actually already parents a one year into our relationship his sister couldn't take care of her kids and they came to stay with us for a little while\nI'm well a little while became a long while became forever and our adoption of helium Riley had just become final they were ages five and seven and we were just trying to get that teased a freedom that comes when you have big kids [noise]\nUh the second reason that he said no is because he knew that when I asked if we can have a baby I was asking if I could get pregnant and give birth\nTo a baby a this\nTo a baby [noise]\nUh this is in some kind of a feat of modern science or I'm just transgender\nUh for me that means that I was born female uh I was raised as a girl or the best way that I had when I was a teenager of explaining what was going on with me was I used to joke that I was a gay man trapped in a woman's body\nUm and as I got older um that's literal feeling a feeling trapped in the wrong body got more and more pervasive and painful until it became um literally unbearable and I wasn't sure I could keep going [noise]\nUm and then I met a transgender person and I realized that it wasn't a joke at all actually was a gay man trapped in a woman's body a and this was great news um because it meant that there was a solution to this problem um and there was a name for it and there was a community of people that I could go to um but most importantly it meant that um\nI could stay alive a and I could transition and I could be happy um which is what I did\n\nUh I started taking testosterone and that made me look like I Do now like every other gay man in Portland [noise]\nAnd it turns out that I'm the kind of transgender person who was just like fine with just hormones I didn't have any other surgeries or anything which means that I have a fully functioning uterus and totally healthy eggs and Beth is not ... he's just a normal gay dude he's not normal he's special [noise]\nYou know what I mean so between the two of us even though we are two men we have everything we need to make our own baby [noise] uh and we know\nUh and we'd known dozens of other transgender men like me with beards and everything who have given birth to have the beautiful children we knew it was possible a but it had been hard for pretty much all of them and that was really worried about my safety um navigating the world as a pregnant man I'm but\nI uh live in a world of rainbows and unicorns ah and I just hoped that it was going to be okay and I also am not good at taking no for an answer I'm so eventually he did say yes and I went to a doctor and everything was in good working order I stopped my hormones um and we started trying a\nAnd a few months went by nothing happened um and I started that thing maybe it wasn't going to happen for us after all and just when I started to feel peaceful about that I woke up one morning and I felt really gross [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd I had read all the pregnancy books you know everything about pregnancy and I've been tracking everything on the ... you know um but it wasn't the right time for me to get to be pregnant and so I refused I think the pregnancy test and then they made me and I took it\nAnd there were two lines and I was pregnant and it was going to be a baby and I'm so excited but also super scared because you have to do a lot of things to get ready for a baby like pick a name and buy diapers and learn how to take care of the baby [noise]\nHaley enroll even toddlers when they came to live with that so I didn't know what to do with a baby um and then my body started to change really quickly I'm an all of those uh mark\nI'm an all of those ah markers of femininity you know everything just got bigger everywhere and I had anticipated this um that it would be the worst part of being pregnant\nBut it actually ended up being okay\nAnd I think it's because really early on to my transition I just had to like um accept the fact that my body is is going to be like different I Can't go back in time and be born with a body that's more like they have sort of my dad than I could spend the rest of my life I'm obsessing over all the things my body cannot do or\nI could get excited about the things that I can do that their bodies can't which is to create life so that's what I did um I just leaned into that and then I just let everything else go\nUh in weight around this time we had a chance to tell her story publicly\nUm and I don't know about you all but basically every store I've ever heard about a transgender person has been um something terrible has happened to us um and that's I think why it had been I'm so scary for me to come out as trans um because our lives our misery says the media\nAnd I thought maybe we could tell a different kind of story um because yes that there is hardship and and being transgender especially for trans people who are not like me I'm transgender women and trans people of color\nBut for all of us there's also joy and love and in resilience in family and I wanted to tell that story and I and I hope the world was ready um and we didn't think it was a big deal for me to be a pregnant man everybody else did\nA pregnant man everybody else did [noise]\nI don't know if they still say let go viral um but that is what happened um to our story basically overnight I'm pregnant man was everywhere like Yahoo News if anyone's don't read that um CNN a Washington Post people magazine\nPregnant man and I thought that maybe this is good you know maybe people are ready for this next evolution and what it could mean to be transgender and I live in Portland and let me tell you people were ready\nFor my story in Portland I'm In Portland like maybe if you see a pregnant man at Starbucks that's not the weirdest thing you've seen that day [noise]\nThey were into it you know I'm\nIn like trans kids would come up to me with their parents like in the grocery store\nUm and just say thank you for helping them understand that there is a little more than one way to be a man and and more than one way to be trans um a lady once told me that she adopted her niece too and she thought it was marvelous that my body could give me the life I deserve well also bringing new life into the world\nBut outside of the Portland bubble I'm not everyone was ready for this story um I\nReally good friends with the ... and ... because I Would just get hundreds of messages on Facebook that was just that um people would tell me that I wasn't a man at all I'm just a really ugly Harry woman\nHarry woman and that I was going to give birth to a monster and then one woman sent me a message that said as a Christian I Hope that you give birth to a dead baby\nBecause that baby will be better off than a baby that has to be born to someone like you I was six months pregnant when I read that message\nNow I have been trans for a long time Fifteen Years I'm actually at age thirty five I'm I Am past the point of average life expectancy for a trans person in America today [noise] um I think that I'm resilient and and strong and and powerful", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "18",

feel physically enhanced with that happens\nIt's almost like a part of your body and you bring it back to your teammates we share our winnings and so you distribute five thousand dollars bad here ten thousand dollars trapped there and everybody gathers around ecstatic and it's almost like they're feeding off your own flesh and [noise] after earning my living that way for several years I sold a book about the experience of ...\nEventually someone but grudgingly they paid\nI took away I took every hundred dollar bills that they had\nI took away I took every hundred dollar bills that they had in the casinos are small place I also took every fifty dollar bill [laughter]\nAnd a lot of the twenties [noise]\nAnd I took this one and just stuffed it down my pants that I was physically ... expanded\nIn this weird for cheaper and way sort of like in the old days but I turned around and I wasn't in Las Vegas I was in this ... this small place where there were twenty five or thirty people all staring at me customers or the casino\nPeople who work there weren't going around and everybody there knew exactly\nWhat I had just one and it seemed me at the cashier they knew I was getting paid in cash and so I moved briskly for the ... and a briskly across the parking lot and I started the engine of my car drove out made a series of strategic you try to ensure I wasn't being followed\nAnd then got on the interstate five north towards Seattle through the woods in the dark of night it was five PM but at the Pacific northwest so\nExpanded in this way as I said but also I felt this team in the sense of\nParanoia averaging on terror and I kept looking back in the rearview mirror examining\nThe headlights and the distance trying to into it if any of the cars back to their look menacing

time she heard him tell a story at a party\nIt was totally silent with everybody turn to you holding their attention telling this unbelievably riveting story and thinking that at this party is actually what we want them off to be\nAnd he has to come do this at the players club you know in front of two hundred and fifty people instead of twenty five and then lessen the bless your heart you did agree to do that and did it and were brilliant\nWell I think part of part of the whatever might happen with with card counting story specifically in a room has a lot to do with the nature of the stories themselves because people when they're hearing them are I think struck with the possibility that they just can't decide if the person is in fact\nA lunatic thinks that he goes around winning casinos and has paranoid delusions of being chased by casino personnel or in fact a deft um you know genuine professional\nSo you so you had been telling stories like this to groups of friends at dinner parties for years and years clearly but what was it like the first time you actually stepped on stage with the purpose of telling a story to a crowd of strangers\nIt was harrowing it's like a dozen body of experience you're there in the spotlight is on you you're not really aware of your limbs or the rest of your your body in the normal way that you would be when Josh\nIt was or the rest of your your body and the normal way that you would be\nWhen Josh ... resigned no plane left at casinos he was appearing on them off stage ongoing seemed name Lee Aaron Blair\nOr did it a under a pseudonym\nI'm In part because my name at that time still has some value\nTo sort of value of a card counters real name tends to deteriorate overtime as soon as he has become increasingly aware of it\nUm but also because it's long been obvious to me the card counter if you'd legally changes his name should change it to three or more first name's presents a piece of ID chew a person that casino he can claim that any one of the names is actually the first name\nAnd you know depending on how familiar the casino personality is with that particular form of id they're often you know they see ideas from all over the country there are often confused I'm so that you can create from one legal name multiple aliases based on a genuine id [noise]\n'cause you're the master this interview ...

her sister lived in Domenico where she was born and where she grew up they call road uh\nBy letters they wrote to each other a letters that they would see up in an envelope and post a and the letters would be taken on a boat that would\nMake weekly stops on the island of the ... the islands I think you would in Wynwood island\nUm and uh the letters\nA word that they send to each other was written in English\nWas written in English proper English but the language they spoke the spoken language was French ... ah the letters um\n[noise] uh I never knew what the corps was about because when they we received a letter in English they received each other's letters in English\nThey then would respond to the letters verbally in French ... so I couldn't understand French ... and I was never shown the letters but only I knew\nA certainly from my mother's side the reaction of the letters um this was incredibly ah interesting to me ah everything my mother did was interesting to me I I'm adored her but mostly what I adored about her that she adored me [noise]\nUh [noise] so I liked to see her angry or it was interesting to me to see her angry and speaking in this language which I had no interest in learning at all [noise]\nUm because in any case it wasn't a proper language was just a broken language also lead or toad\n[noise] um [noise]\nEven truly a well as I say I was very I adored

off age are most times the most important most defining stories from my personal life\nHere Sebastian on crafting this story\nYou know I Do a lot of public speaking and I'm used to sort of talking and explaining how things work\nAnd then I started to understand that that's not what the law says\nYou're really doing is telling a story\nTo understand something more deeply [noise]\nThe story that you're about to hear includes images of war and it's not suitable for children I\nWas told at a mosque night called I witnessed stories from the frontlines here [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nI uh first went to war when I was thirty one I grew up in a wealthy\nOne I grew up in a wealthy suburb\nI spent my twenties or writing short stories and trying to wait tables\nAnd I got to thirty and I guess the best way to say it is I didn't feel like a man I didn't feel like I was a man and I thought war would be a exciting and intense and then it would transform me in some way\nUm\nAnd so I got a backpack and I put a sleeping bag in it and said no books and pens and a few thousand\nDollars I went to Bosnia during the civil war is are able to try to learn to be a war reporter and war was all those things that I thought it would be I mean the thing about war as it does not disappoint but it's also way more than you bargained for\nUm for example this the first time I saw a dead body it wasn't a fighter most of the people\nDying words of civilians and it was in Kosovo during the civil war\nIt was a girl who's sixteen Seventeen years old I always imagined that she was probably really beautiful um she'd been\nI'm taken by served paramilitary forces are and\nThey took her up to a field above a town called ... and they did whatever they did to her and then they cut her throat and when I saw her it was a couple of weeks later of summer it was hot and it's the only way you could tell she was a girl or\nAnd it's the only way you could tell she was a girl or really even the only way you could tell she was human or was that you could still see the red finger nail polish on her fingernails and that girl stay with me for a while she was more than I bargained for\nUm\nI remember the first time I got ready to die prepared myself to die I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war and I've been out of the front lines that it was\nA going getting pretty bad out there and I've tried to get back to Freetown and I got an a jeep with a few ah Sierra Leone and soldiers who really weren't good for much and then another couple of journalists and we're driving down this empty road back towards Freetown\nAnd these rebel ... stepped out of the jungle in front of us but their guns level at us and we came to a stop and we just staring straight ahead while they argued about whether to kill us\nAnd\nI tried to get ready I was hollow I was ... and I didn't have any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt at all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I could see the little\nBlack hole the bullet comes out of you know one pointed guy\n... his gun and started to shoot another guy grab the barrel inject it up I mean it was like that for Fifteen minutes\nWell all these little black holes are staring at us\nWell all these little black holes are staring at us I thought it was attorney inside those holes and there are so small the thickness of a pencil and attorneys in there and I\nCouldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look out for some reason they didn't kill us and we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back for more I kept going to more wars I felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it kept going back I remember the first time I froze in combat\nYou go to war you think you think you're going to be brave\nHave you don't think that you probably don't go to war and sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan outpost\nRestrepo twenty minutes positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and um but this day it was really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against them sandbags\nAnd some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nAnd would you have to understand about voices that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoots at you\nSo much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters the first thing that happens is you you ask yourself am I getting shot at because the sounds of bullets make when they go past you is pretty subtle\nAnd then the gunfire arrives a moment later\nAnd then the gunfire arrives moment later yes I Am getting shot at and then as everything goes crazy well the boy\nThe boy a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face that's what I felt\nWhat's the angles deviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right now what's the\nMath on that angle you don't even want to think about it um\nAnd then it's all you can think about well I was paralyzed\nBullets were coming in hitting the ground hitting the sandbags smacking and did everything I was paralyzed those behind some sandbags and our gear was right right over there just a few feet away cameras bulletproof vest\nWe're getting attacked from three sides they're coming up under the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire and I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington photographer we're on assignment out there\nHe finally jumps across that gap any grab stuff he throws my camera to me it throws my bullet proof vest grabs this stuff is throwing amateur soldiers to the soldiers are pinned down to and it gets back and I have my camera in my hand and I started shooting I start working and then I'm fine\nI'm not scared anymore Tim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer and obviously\nVery very brave a lot braver than me um\nHe was also really kind of thoughtful about war and I remember at one point he said to me you know [noise]\nThoughtful about war and I remember at one point he said to me you know war might be the only situation where young men\nAre free to love each other on reserve easily without it being mistaken for something else that was Tim and that's why we were working together we decided to make a documentary\nAbout this little outpost we were going to call every struggle and we were going to spend as much of the deployment as possible at this in this little spot on this ridge in eastern Afghanistan so we were going to alternate trips and I I tore my Phillies on this trip\nSo I had to go home to kind of ... So Tim took the next trip\n\nHe was on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation up up in the mountains on foot very bad seeing a lot of lot of guys got killed a lot of American Soldiers got killed and wounded\nAt one point um the American positions got overrun they dragged off a wounded American soldier at night in the middle of a firefight\nThey got him back but it was bad out there\nWay worse than anyone back home really knew you know and in the middle of all that same broke his leg he's a ten thousand feet up on the ... with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long\nAnd the medic examines his foot and says well is broken and we can't get a medivac and we have to be off this mountain by Don and we're going to get hammered\nHere's two Advil\nAnd Tim new Tim knew that if\nPrepared to walk all night on a broken leg for it\nIf you're not prepared to walk all night on a broken leg for the for the sake of thirty men you shouldn't be out there and he did it I don't know how but he did it he got down off that mountain so we finished up our deployment\nAnd um that's how we started to think of it are deployment [noise] um and er nothing you know the rest of it was okay the worst was in the beginning actually and uh and we started making our film Restrepo and um\n\nIf the the film did really well and started it started with this scene um that was very took me a long time to be able to watch it actually I Would always close my eyes when it came\nUm what's the scene where I'm riding in a Humvee 'cause I took the next trip after Tim broke his leg\nOr running in a Humvee and all of a sudden everything goes orange and black and the Humvee got blown up", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "25",
