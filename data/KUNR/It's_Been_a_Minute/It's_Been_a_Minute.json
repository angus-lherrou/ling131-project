[laughter] All right let's talk now about another thing that I Love besides Halloween candy uh movies yes\nWas difficulty romantic comedies yeah um I Want to run you through a few of the films that I watched over this summer a there was one movie in which to overworked assistance set their bosses up each other\nAgain and we need to be miserable people\nThere was another movie I watched this summer where a teenage girl private love letters from mysteriously males to all of her crushes I think it's really cool that you\nThink I have called inspectors in my eyes\nTo let her through then there was this\nOther one where the bride got left at the altar so then she went on our honeymoon with her strange father\nGot credibly drunk at night and I blacked out because [noise]\nThat's what's on the ground and hunting though the funding about all these movies are that these were all rom coms on Netflix you heard clips there from set it up\nTo all the boys I've loved before and like father have you ever watch any of the movies to entry okay which to I watched um Taliban that lived before of course so good and set it up yes let an awful lot\nSo good and set it up yes letter I so love lovely\nFeel retro about him I feel I feel like it stokes a particular part of my heart same same\nSo these movies along with a bunch of other rom com release it on Netflix all summer we're part of this big push by Netflix to get some scribe or as to watch from any comedies on the streaming service they even had a name for this big push they called it the summer of love nice uh and last week they put the data out some of the data out and it turns out that\nTens of millions of people watch these movies across the world this summer some eighty million people yes so I wanted to know more about this and Netflix in the summer of love so I called up someone who's been covering the summer of a lot of very closely\nHer name is ... when I met she a right for the onions Avi club she'd been closely following the summer of love so we talked all about it\nHey Glenn how are you good how are you doing I'm good thank you for your time oh my gosh thanks so much for having me super excited yet I haven't been kind of digging out\nFor several days now upon discovering that without my knowledge Netflix quietly made me fall in love with rom coms this summer and now you didn't even now [noise] um they called it the summer of love what exactly is it\nUh yeah some of them was like a menu of rom com movies that Netflix kind of unfurled at the beginning of the summer a that as it turns out it's not flicks reported recently for the third quarter report eighty million viewers watch and it's not even\nNumber of views that viewers so if you're like me and you watch them like four or five times a piece you you can even multiply that now\nYou watch them like four or five times a piece you you can even multiply that number\nEight eight million people watching his rom coms my big question and first question about all of this was like what led Netflix no or I think\nThat rom coms would work for them you know we've seen the movie studios and like the box office not really take to rom coms for many years now it's hard to find them in theaters so knowing that trend line what made Netflix they will just might work for us\nI think they just spied on completely underserved market\nYou know if you look at the summer box office the top ten movies are all sequels and genre\nAnd comic book crossing offshoots\nYeah you know it's all like Mission Impossible ... infinity war so if you want to see things blowing up\nAt the multiplex you know you're living in the golden era but if you want\nLike just to have a nice love story at the movies except for crazy Rich Asians the summer you were kind of out of luck so for Netflix it's kind of a combination of factors that they did they not only are churning out these rom coms are also\nTagging a women creative forces women writers women directors some of them you know this is the first movie they directed or they've directed like TV episodes before they're adapting way novels they're finding creative forces that really have been under used\nAnd it's worked out really well for them\nYeah why have the big movie studios at the movies in theaters widely left rom coms writ large I think\nThey're uh they're not the safe bet that they once were like if you're going to you're going to put like ... million dollars and then\nDollars and infinity war but you're going to get more Brazilian dollars back\nChannel with rom coms there was a a golden era you know one Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts you could just basically put Graham with anybody like let's move on to build up next why not ... but then\nYou have something like Reese Witherspoon invincible on and for Christmases and tanked and these are superstars you're paying them a lot of money and then you're not getting your money back\nAnd it's also for the movie goer you know if I'm going to get a sitter and talk my husband into going to see a movie that you know romance themes like it's going to have to be\nA kind of special event where for Netflix you know it's free I'm at home there's really no risk for me to like watch set it up and if I don't like it I'm just going to go watch Gilmore Girls reruns again it's not a big deal\nBut then you end up liking set it up and like if you're like me I've watched it three times and then Netflix is going to send me more possibilities for that rom coms honor and I think that's how it all exploded\nYeah you know I think the thing with a rom com it's perfect for me a single person to watch at home alone because the last thing I Want to do is been twenty dollars and see a lovely ... end up together river on screen and then I got to go home alone [laughter]\nOh yeah if you can do that with a Ben and Jerry's and a frozen pizza I mean that's not a Thursday night you got that going out\nTo yeah should we expect movie studios big movie studios are putting movies in theaters to react to this Netflix news and say oh we should start making rom coms again like does Netflix's summer of love and its success lead to more wrong comes in actual movie theaters um that's an interest\nRom coms in actual movie theaters\nUm that's an interesting question I\nI Do wonder about that because I mean crazies rich Haitians did so well because we just want a you know a lovely\nMovie like that to see you later and and the the story that I wrote another thing that was really prevalent we had a ton of commenters\nAnd because the question is like well why did eighty million people watch this like what is the big question I mean other than like markets or whatever people are just like more depressed were you know we're stressed out we want escapism we want you know we want like just an easy fun movie maybe we don't even want to see things one up anymore I Know that's hard to even like\n[noise] and from the John us and James all night foundation helping NPR advanced journalistic excellence in the digital age\n[noise]\nYou're listening to it's been a minute from NPR I'm Sam Sanders and wanting to our listeners this portion of the show contains descriptions of sexual abuse of minors probably not good for kids\nWe've discussed the me too movement a lot on the show\nMe too and politics me too and how we would be two in journalism and NPR's newsroom even now we're going to talk about me too and sports\nAnd the dozens of stories you've been hearing for months about young elite athletes being abused by their coaches the doctors the mentors people they should be able to trust their reality\nPeople they should be able to trust\nTheir reality and causing a great deal of physical mental and emotional pain he never sailed I mean you take advantage of ... and our dreams you\nThat's on my butt gold medalists alley Raisman she was speaking at the trial of Larry Nassar he was convicted of sexually assaulting numerous young women under his care\nAs a former sports doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State university Nassar was recently sentenced to up to a hundred and Seventy five years in prison in the wake of Nassar's trial top Olympic officials have been forced out most recently Mary Bono resigned as the interim head of USA Gymnastics\nAfter a lot of criticism she held that job and were less than a week today you'll hear from an elite athlete who came forward with her own experience of sexual abuse in another ... former speed skater ... barrel she was sexually abused by another skater when she was just a teenager and\nSo he helps drive my teenager and I to and from practice which both of our family is really appreciated and so anti would almost pick me up every day and we'd frequently go to\nThe rink and skate but you know sometimes we in other places but even if we did go to the rank and skate when there was molest station that happened before and after I mean and the rink parking lots of high school parking lot\nFriday was Fifteen Years old and training to be an Olympic speed skater in New York state when thirty three year olds Olympic medalist Andy Gable entered her life he was a skating God he quickly became brought his mentor and helped her family out\nAs I said he used to drive my friend and I home from practice in the summer and he'd always drop her off first then\nIn the summer and he'd always drop her off first\nThan I mean I can picture clear as day back out of her driveway go down the street stops I take a right and you go to my house and it was like that every time and then one time at that same stops on he took a left and he went to the um a few streets over and there was a dead end\nWhich in hindsight it's\nInteresting that he knew that there was a dead end there was a dead end he pulled the car over took office he found he turned to me and he said can I guess you\nWould have had a minimum I said nothing I just sat there [noise] um I\nWill sit here and honestly say I did not say no and an open door to not run away\nBut I was frozen yeah I mean people say there's fight or flight but there's free and that's what happened and\nI remember after that when we put our seatbelts on and turn the car around I remember just being like a fog or a I mean now now we have an especially I was like W. E. T. F. [laughter] yeah you know and run shocks probably ... percent\nAnd only ... how would I tell anyone who would believe me what proof have\nWhy would anyone believes that he would do you know I mean just um and it wasn't violet\nIn what we think of as traditional violence so he wasn't a stranger it wasn't a windowless fan and you know all that that we pretend to make these people will be so\nYeah that I mean honestly God that is the day my life changed\nWould keep doing this in in ...\nChanged he would keep doing this in in the ... the the contact\nBecome more intense but yeah so so a lot of people say you know like what is what do I mean when I say molested so to\nAnswer that awkward question on any I never had\nSex and the traditional um definition of sex but basically the legal terms is digital penetration um and he would put my hand on himself when he was he wrecked um [noise] and you're touching follow me and I was Fifteen and he was thirty three\nWhile Andy is taking advantage of you do see also like getting close to your family at the same time\nI'm very much so so ah he [noise] he had um a growing issue was skating and so he saw my father for his doctor for that and\nMy mom he came over to the house a couple of times and I took piano lessons from my mom oh my goodness yeah\nSo have you and your house yeah for me I wasn't from your mother you knew what he was doing to she did not know wow so how did that feel\nI don't even know I mean\nI think it it was such a time of\nConfusion and I was so dedicated to wanting to skate\nThat I didn't have any other currency you know I didn't have any\nSee you know I didn't have any anything to barter I didn't have money I didn't have 'em anything the only thing\nThat he wanted for me was my ... slot body um and um it was it so confusing because like I said he wasn't violence with me and he\nTook care of my skates which is very very very time consuming Amir blades they're not flat so there's a slight rock to them nothing like hockey skates but there is something they're not straight they're bent to go left and the offset\nAnd so as especially as a kid like myself gets better and better and better I mean the improvement curve is is pretty steep as a kid and so I'm\nAs you're getting better the all of those metrics have to change and for the night did any at all but trials surgical winner club had a lot of athletes competing I mean we sent more people to the Olympic trials than the national training program sent to the Olympic trials\nSo our coach you also was volunteer had a fulltime job and a family\nUm he and he took care of my blades and I mean our coach\nAndy and other top skaters are higher priority so he helped me out in a lot of ways and my mother said if you want to go to a skating find a ride to the rank\nAnd Andy was my ride [noise]\nDo do you think she ever thought that he was your boyfriend did you think at Fifteen that he was like something approaching a boyfriend\nI definitely did because I didn't know what else that could be yeah um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "It's Been a Minute", "city": "Reno", "day": "27", "locations": [["Washington", 38.89511,

minute here with two guests today Chris guiding her legal editor bus be news how busy as your week been\nIt's been a week we but we we have a lot of\nThose recently so that is true that is true awfully or with Elena sell your business correspondent for NPR guessing you're we've been pretty busy as well ... well I'm so glad you both made the time to talk with me to wrap up the week of news\nAnd I'm so glad to be playing the song with I'm playing for you both are right now it is a new well old but new prince\nSong is called Seventeen Days\nThe day you\nKnow he like I'm already ready for the weekend just listening to write that one voice on the\nSo this is from an album of old prince demos that was released late last month the album is called piano and the microphone Nineteen eighty three and it's these nine and release prince demos from way back then\nAnd so the thing about this is that like these aren't like finished versions of these songs because of the demos a scratch tracks just prints at the piano playing the songs to show his band and his team how they want to do the songs with the full band later and they're just really interesting moment and Nissan but\nYou can hear we're prints starts to beat box to basically show the drummer how he wants to Trump's this out\nOr how he wants to Trump's this out [noise]\nIt's just amazing and so but what's so weird about this that like because these are demos there are big questions as to whether or not want to just released right also famously fought streaming services like YouTube and spot of five so the fact that you can hear these songs on those platforms\nIt's weird I feel guilty hearing this stuff but I also love it yeah I mean I think that that's one of those those things it's sort of like your journalists a instinct is like yes we want to see this\nPeople must know but what he wanted people to know exactly\nWhere\n\nAnyway Alina and Chris er here with me to look back on the week of news and culture and everything else first we're going to start by having each of my gas and me to describe our weekly news and only three words ... you had been\nCovering the opening of the Supreme Court term this week you've seen the current justices back on the bench you go first\nI mean we were in this a strange position again of violence starting out as Supreme Court term with only eight justices and that the thing was that within the court like\nAnd finding Amazon like he's been coming out for a while now to reduce the bill that's called stop basis act a you know that no [laughter] yeah\nAnd on Tuesday when Amazon came out with this announcement I talked to Senator Sanders and his line was I got to give credit where credit's due and Amazon and Jeff Bezos made the right call it's a good decision so it's\nYes PR is definitely part of it and another really huge element to all of this is that the economy\nIs presenting an extremely tight labor market there are more job openings than workers and Amazon is heading into this season um holidays are coming up they're going to be fighting for these workers they that they need but also Walmart needs and\nBest Buy needs and all these other retailers need and you know having a Fifteen dollar minimum wage in this this bumping 'em coverage of that I'm sure it can't\nHurt helps them attract workers while I can talk about Amazon all day is you know [laughter] [laughter] [laughter]\nSo I just signed for break or when we come back I'm going to talk with two high school students in Texas and their friends nominated them to be on the home of course a but they're both young women in this set up a bit of a firestorm and later my conversation with film director hike Baron hope he turned his politically charged Thanksgiving\nShe turned his

I asked them about their homecoming story or the your average teenagers in the high school band Sicilia plays ... stories in the color guard so where are you both now\nOur gross hiding in a corner or near an all [laughter]\nSo fun fact I also was in marching band when I was in high school I Am from Texas I'm just about an hour south of you guys night where did you go I went to a jets in high school for two years into Clemens high school\nWhere did you go I went to a jets in high school for two years into Clemens high school in shirts for it to you know I was a saxophone player I was a drum major so I'm having fond fond font thoughts of my days hiding in the corner and we\nActually played jets and at a competition on Saturday\nReally small world small world yeah [laughter]\nThe Syrian story there are a couple and their friends nominated them to be on the homecoming court\nWe just want to say just want the opportunity to win together or we didn't have to come together but I mean we didn't even have the chance for at least originally we did it\nSo do you want it to run on the homecoming court as a king but the school administration told her that only boys can be teens and only girls can be queens\nCecilia and stories said that this made it impossible for a gay couple to actually win together they push back in the school actually changed the rules that same day they decided to have no gender the titles in the homecoming contest no ... no queens\nOn the homecoming courts would just be known as quote royals but that didn't make facilities in story happy\nI mean it's definitely a step forward it's another way of avoiding acknowledging a same sex couples\nStory how do you feel about this\nThey think they were over compensating rather than just reading and that well it shouldn't have been at a gym there they should have just made it so you are voting ... regardless of gender that just shows whether or not they were now that the chain\nOr green or anything between and it was up to that it wasn't up to that school and we're going to take out come on circuit check out check your guest one couple wants to run together\nA spokesperson for the school told us quote we can say that we believe the resolution is an appropriate one\nCan say that we believe the resolution is an appropriate one often independent school district is committed to creating a safe supportive environment for all students and staff including those who identify as algae be teach you plus since the changes sodium story happened dealing with the fall out\nOf the students support them but I don't like the outcome\nThere pretty much the same way as we are when they say that they don't think that this court did what they should have done they don't like the new policy it isn't that what home coming is\nTo post ... about um outside Austin ... what are hearing about it that comment on why they're not very positive\nWhat's been the worst kind of comments\nThat originally basically saying that we're that we're not we're snowflakes rational or special treatment and that is exactly what they would have expected to electing a same sex couple is not ... how would come after the house\nPeople really think is going to ruin homecoming\nMobile ended up taking away the whole homecoming tradition\nGotcha is they're going to be other stuff that you all go through throughout this year are you a senior year right yeah that will have to I mean like there's probably going to be\nOther gender roles for other senior year traditions as well my kids are gonna be a situation when it comes to prom king and queen what happens next uh\nYes actually that's one of the teachers that has been talking joy throughout this whole issue venture backed off and land jumped she was like and I can't wait until we get to Prague either I\nUsed to be running for prom king and queen how that turned out my goodness so there may be more drama I had before the years done [laughter] please [noise]\nIt'd be pseudonym limits of soda and stories they've been dealing with this fall out some students support than others don't like the outcome the votes actually aren't done yet that's going to happen next week but this story really made\nMe think like Austin, Texas is a pretty progressive city not just for Texas but for the country\nAnd so you have the school administration that is trying to in some way be an ally to these young women but even they can't figure out what the right language is what the right term should be I think\nWe're in this period where defining and letting gender roles be more fluid can be confusing for some\nPeople I I just celebrated my forte first birthday and one of the things that I've learned is like that means that I'm getting older and\nI'm not going to necessarily understand how a younger group of people is looking at things and I mean we could have been having the same conversation Twenty years ago and somebody saying like\nThey're trying to be supportive why aren't they okay with just being known as friends why why why do we need to talk about the fact that they're a gay couple and\nThat they're together like that's like talking about their sex lives there has have always been these issues about how we use language in what it means and\nNPR's Alina Selyukh a business correspondent for NPR I'm I Know

Thanksgiving dinner table said grace or whatever you do and then immediately began to fight with your family of course you have things get heated\nBut also hilarious politics and stuff and then at some point maybe you like me said to yourself at that table well dang\nThis could be a movie I should have pitched that screenplay because now that storyline is a movie and it's coming out this month the movie is called the oh it is directed by and stars I Baron hopes he's an actor an improv comedian who you may have seen before I'd\nBaron Hill to best known for his role on the Mindy project he plays the weird and lovable nurse Morgan Tucker's uh I also started and HBO's east bound and down and back in the day he was on ... TV show which I loved\nSo this new movie the ... it is a political satirical thriller in which a very contentious Thanksgiving dinner with a politically divided family uh takes a really weird turn and suddenly becomes a life or death situation\nTiffany Haddish plays the wife of I Baron hoped his character and he tells us all about what it's like to work with Tiffany Haddish onset I can I talked last week the morning after the oath premiered at the LA film festival I got to go to the premier it was a blast\nI talked with ICC at NPR West in Culver City California enjoy\nSo I was there as a monster movie nice to see in your element I met you I get out and I went down and I have my wife I mean it was like\nWe got to be with us she did go to ... which I'm brushing like the bad news I get you [laughter]\nI'm like I'll never got a man listen uh people asked George Clooney if he's friends with Brad Pitt no it's just a way to go I didn't know she was reading\nUm you were dressed up working the red carpet do you like to kind of stuff you know\nI'm not a big fancy dresser type of guy but it's part of of you know part of the deal and it is it is like fun than my parents come in town now you know they get Peron makeup done a lot of makeup done and us\nWhen we're ... we go uh you know it's it's it's fun to go and you always see some fans are and stuff so it it is fun and exhilarating but it also it was fun to kind of come home at the end of the night and you could talk about it and stuff\nWas this one different because it was your first and directing the movie can definitely I'm always just kind of you know an actor for usually so when you go which you know you're proud of the movie you're not proud of the movie but it's just a small part of it and\nYou can either take as much credit or have kind of you know no accountability and you just kind of show up for the party and stuff but for this one because it is\nThis movie is so kind of a personal to me it's something I'm working on for for almost a year I said yeah this is this I'm going to give it all yeah\nYeah I could tell they were working I was working with him I was talking to everyone you got you got any kind of German so let's describe this film for our listeners without sport largest weather's\nSo if you can imagine a politically charged America that is incredibly divided can imagine that uh\nA politically charged America that is incredibly divided and imagine that uh but I but there's there's a there's a presidential administration that's that's obsessed with loyalty\nAnd they have introduced state it's not compulsory but it's a highly suggested um loyalty oath [laughter]\nSo ah the deadline to sign it is the uh Friday after Thanksgiving Black Friday everyone's favorite holiday [laughter] yeah and so the whole movie takes place during that we can Thanksgiving and and my character Chris uh\nIs very liberal and very upset about what's going on and very into consumed by the twenty four hour news cycle\nAnd his wife is Tiffany Haddish [noise] uh the characters ... she's played by Tiffany Haddish I don't I Would also kind of like in the middle of it has to go to prepare for girls trip exactly that would be kinda cool yeah and she's kind of you know\nTrying to keep the family together and just trying to do her best to keep going forward and we have everyone coming to the house mom dad brother ... brother conservative brother a slightly left of center sister kind of the whole family's all over the map and\nThe first kind of half of the movie\nIs really all about you know try and your best to not talk about politics at the holiday table yes let's leave it there let's leave it there yeah did your family Thanksgiving inspire this at all it actually did a it was right the Thanksgiving right after the twenty sixteen election how hot one it was a hot one that people didn't know what to say they were all shell shock yeah\nAnd that for dinner the three of us kind of gotten his argument and there was a little bit of wine involved but you know what struck me about the argument was that we were all on the same side we all voted for the same person rather enthusiastically Mm I think my brother has kind of position he was a little more of a Bernie Sanders\nSee my brother has kind of position he was a little more of a Bernie Sanders guy and I think his position was you know will burn it could have won this [noise] and you know my mom lives in in South central Ohio and she was saying well they forgot about the mid west they gave up the mid west which is ridiculous and I was kind of like well it's ... fault and this\nAnd it just struck me that if we're also aligned and novel and ... and we're fighting what's going on to their tables around the country and and so I I knew that that arena would be like a really fun area for us to explore and I knew it can be funny and potentially explosive\nYeah what I Love about the movie and you miss 'em that it it it it makes us all think about how and when and how much we should talk about politics\nI covered the last election in my ... him oh throughout was like people to talk about it more because of this stuff shapes the nation and we put the hard stuff to the side are only preached to the choir here to talk about more but now\nI'm usually like everyone just shut a thing I was like\nYou I was the guy for a good year and a half that\nSit down at dinner with some friends first and talk about can you believe that this is insane and I did that thing where I was like I don't understand how people are not talking about it is what is bigger what's the bigger news story and you're in my lifetime that were happening now there's not one night and so I I I was getting frustrated at people's\nFrustration with me talking about it and what I I recently\nI recently started trying to find that balance a little bit and like if you are just are just on Twitter all day and you're just you're just raise your blood pressure raises your blood pressure and I think you know when I wrote the movie I was like I Want to put myself in the head of Chris my character who really\nLike I Want to put myself in the head of Chris my character who really as obsessive and he's consumed by the cycle so I had to CNN Fox News or MSNBC on twenty four\nReally and I was reading it and it makes you crazy too [laughter] it is a a a a\nSlightly romantic story but I'm ... right after we first meet them um I really wanted to show the wear and tear that that she was going through with him um because that was very very much based off of my wife really yeah so well my wife who is it is you know politically active and she goes to the\nMarches and has very little ... in the U.S to NPR I'm Steve Inskeep her little she does not in the area [laughter]\nI'm a I'm there was one morning where it was like six twenty five in the morning and I uh she was in bed next to me and she was breastfeeding our or newborn and I was reading some article that was\nYou know like it's not helping not help out of your job and\nI turned her yeah when I was not being president and I turned to her

you both made the time\nTo talk with me to wrap up the week of news and I'm so glad to be playing the song with I'm playing for you both uh right now it is a new well old but new prince\nSong is called Seventeen Days\nJust another day you know\nHe like I'm already ready for the weekend just listening for\nRight that was no\nVoice a little\nWhile ago you said this is from an album of old prince demos that was released late last month the album is called piano and the microphone Nineteen eighty three and it's these nine and released prints demos from way back then\nAnd so the thing about this is that like these aren't like finished versions of these songs who's with the demos a scratch tracks just prints at the piano playing the songs to show his band and his team how you want to do the songs with the full band later and they're just really interesting moment in this\nAnd later and there's just really interesting moment and Nissan you here were prints starts to beat box to basically show the drummer how he wants to Trump's this out [noise]\nIt's just amazing and so but what's so weird about this that like because these are demos there are big questions as to whether or not want to just released right also famously fought streaming services like YouTube and spot of five so the fact that you can hear these songs on those platforms\nIt's weird I feel guilty hearing this stuff but I also love it yeah I mean I think that that's one of those those things it's sort of like your journalists a instinct is like yes we want to see this\nPeople must know but what he wanted people to know exactly\nI'm good\n\nAnyway Alina and Chris er here with me to look back on the week of news and culture and everything else first we're going to start by having each of my gas and me to describe our week of news and only three words ... you had been\nCovering the opening of the Supreme Court term this week you've seen the current justices back on the bench you go first\nI mean we were in this a strange position again of violence starting out as Supreme Court term with only eight justices and uh the thing was that within the court like it was a very different world\nBasis act a you know that no I'm not a big [laughter] yeah\nAnd on Tuesday when Amazon came out with this announcement I talked to Senator Sanders and his line was I got to give credit where credit's due and Amazon and Jeff Bezos made the right call it's a good decision so it's\nYes PR is definitely part of it and another really huge element to all of this is that the economy\nIs presenting an extremely tight labor market there are more job openings than workers and Amazon is heading into this season um holidays are coming up they're going to be fighting for these workers they that they need but also Walmart needs and\nBest Buy needs and all these other retailers need and you know having a Fifteen dollar minimum wage in this this bump in um coverage of that I'm sure it can't\nHurt up some truck workers while I could talk about Amazon all day as you know when\nThey\nStarted to sign for break up when we come back I'm going to talk with two high school students in Texas and their friends nominated them to be on the ... ah but they're both young women in this\nAh but they're both young women and the set up a bit of a firestorm and later my conversation with film

been a minute from NPR the show where we catch up on the week that was here were to get this week Chris guiding her legal editor at buzzfeed news and Alina Selyukh business correspondent for NPR a I have a question for you both\nBe honest do either of you remember your home coming from high school\nWell I've only been to one because I was an exchange student so I remember it extremely vividly but it was also confusing because I had never known that such an event existed it was\nVery strange uh-huh Chris I think I went [laughter] I was I was in a closeted\nGay boy in Youngstown, Ohio um I went with a girl and I know I went to like home coming in ... but they were not at the notable a life moments that\nThey are for some others I'm bringing up homecoming because it's a subject this week of our long distance call [noise]\nThere's there's you know long distance is a segment where we call up someone somewhere in the world and talk with them about\nSo this week I talked with two students from Austin high school in my home state of Texas are their names are Sicilia McBride and story ... ... I asked them about their home common story or the your average teenagers in the high school band facilities plays ...\nUh the your average teenagers in the high school band Sicilia plays ... stories in the color guard so where are you both now\nOur coach hiding in a corner on your band [laughter]\nSo fun fact I also was in marching band when I was in high school I Am from Texas\nI'm just about an hour south of you guys know where did you go I went to a jets in high school for two years into Clemens high school and shirts for too you know I was a saxophone player I was a drum major so I'm having fond\nFond font thoughts of my days hiding in the corner while we\nActually played jets and at a competition on Saturday\nReally small world small world yeah [laughter] the Syrian story there are a couple and their friends nominated them to be on the homecoming court\nHe just wants I just want the opportunity to win together or we didn't have to work together but I mean we didn't even have the chance at least originally we did it\nTo do you want it to run on the homecoming court as a keen but at the school administration told her that only boys can be genes and only girls can be queens\nTo go to and stories said that this made it impossible for a gay couple to actually win together they push back in the school actually changed the rules that same day they decided to have no gender titles in the homecoming contest no ... no queens everyone on homecoming court\nWould just be known as quote royals but that didn't make facilities in story happy\nI mean it's definitely a step forward it another way of avoiding acknowledging a same sex couples story how do you feel about this\nThey think they were over compensating rather than just reading and that well it shouldn't have been at a gym there they should have just made it so you were\nJust your ... and that well it shouldn't have been ... jump there they should have just made it so you are voting for equal regardless of gender ... whether or not they were now since the king\nOr queen or anything between and it was up to that it wasn't up to that school and we're going to take out come on circuit takeout ... is one couple wants to run together\nA spokesperson for the school told us quote we can say that we believe the resolution is an appropriate one often independent school district is committed to creating a safe supportive environment for all students and staff including those who identify as algae be teach you plus since the change the sodium story had been dealing with the fallout\nOther students support them but I don't like the outcome\nThere pretty much the same way as we are when they say that they don't think that this court did what they should have done they don't like the new policy it isn't what home coming is supposed to\nBe about um outside of Austin order hearing about it a common ... they're not very positive\nWhat's been the worst kind of comments\nThat are mostly basically saying that we're that we're that we're ... we're asking for special treatment and that this is exactly what they would have expected to electing a same sex couple is not a real and how come after the house\nPeople really think there's going to ruin homecoming\nMobile ended up taking away the whole homecoming tradition\nGotcha is they're going to be other stuff that you all go through throughout this year are you a senior year right yeah that will have to I mean like there's probably going to be\nOther gender roles for other senior year traditions as well my kids are gonna be a situation when it comes to prom king and queen what happens next Hi\nYes actually that's one of the teachers that has\nIn what happens next uh\nYes actually that's one of the teachers that have been talking about the whole issue that you write off and land jumps you like and I can't wait until we get the prom I\nUsed to be running for prom king and queen ... actually turned out\nMy goodness so there may be more drama I had before the years done [laughter] please [noise]\nSo these two young women says soda and stories they've been dealing with this fall out some students support than others don't like the outcome the votes actually aren't done yet that's going to happen next week but this story really made\nMe think like Austin, Texas is a pretty progressive city not just for Texas but for the country\nAnd so you have the school administration that is trying to in some way be an ally to these young women but even they can't figure out what the right language is what the right term should be I think\nWe're in this period where defining and letting gender roles be more fluid can be confusing for some people\nI I just celebrated my forte first birthday and one of the things that I've learned is like that means that I'm getting older and\nI'm not going to necessarily understand how a younger group of people is looking at things and I mean we could have been having the same conversation Twenty years ago and somebody saying like\nThey're trying to be supportive why aren't they okay with just being known as friends why why why do we need to talk about the fact that they're a gay couple and\nTo talk about the fact that they're a gay couple and that they're together like that's like talking about their sex lives there\nNPR's Alina Selyukh a business correspondent for NPR

improv comedian who you may have seen before I'd\nBaron holds his best known for his role on the Mindy project he plays the weird and lovable nurse Morgan Tucker's uh I also started in HBO's east bound and down and back in the day he was on ... TV show which I left\nSo this new movie the ... it is a political satirical thriller in which a very contentious Thanksgiving dinner with a politically divided family\nUh takes a really return and suddenly becomes a life or death\nUh takes a really weird turn and suddenly becomes a life or death situation\nTiffany Haddish plays the wife of barren holds his character and he tells us all about what it's like to work with Tiffany Haddish onset I can I talked last week the morning after the oath premiered at the LA film festival I got to go to the premier it was a blast\nI talked with Ike at at NPR West in Culver City California enjoy [noise]\nSo I was there as a monster movie nice to see you and your element I met you I get out of my head down and I have my wife I mean it was like\nWe got to be with us she did go to visit which I'm brushing gotten just like to you [laughter]\nI'm like I'll pass on my regard hey man listen uh people asked George Clooney if he's friends with Brad Pitt no it's just the way to go I just thought she was a sweetheart\nI'm you were dressed up working the red carpet do you like to kind of stuff I'm going to be that\nAm not a big fancy dresser type of guy but it's part of of you know part of the deal and it is it is like fun than my parents come in town off you know like a parrot makeup done how a lot of makeup done and us\nWhen we ... we go uh you know it's it's it's fun to go and you always see some fans are and stuff so it it is fun and exhilarating but it also it was fun to kind of come home at the end of the night and you could talk about it and stuff\nWas this one different because it was your first time directing the movie definitely I'm always just kind of you know an actor fryer usually so when you go which you know you're proud of the movie you're not proud of the movie but it's just a small part of it and\nYou can either take as much credit or have kind of you know no accountability and you just kind of show up for the party and stuff\nOr have kind of you know no accountability and you just kind of show up for the party and stuff but for this one because it is\nThis movie is so kind of a personal to me it's something I'm working on for for almost a year or ... yeah this is this I'm going to give it all yeah yeah I could tell they were working I was working with him I was talking to everyone you got to got any kind of man so let's describe this film for our listeners without\n... so if you can imagine a politically charged America that is incredibly divided and imagine that um but I but there's there's a there's a presidential administration that's that's obsessed with loyalty\nAnd they have a introduce state it's not compulsory but it's a highly suggested um loyalty oath [laughter]\nSo ah the deadline to sign it is the uh Friday after Thanksgiving Black Friday everyone's favorite holiday [laughter] yeah and so the whole movie takes place during that week of Thanksgiving and and uh my character Chris uh\nIs very liberal and very upset about what's going on and very into consumed by the twenty four hour news cycle\nAnd his wife is Tiffany Haddish [noise] uh the characters ... she's played by Tiffany Haddish I don't I Would also kind of like middle aged half to go to premiere for girls trip exactly that would be kinda cool yeah and she's kind of you know\nTrying to keep the family together and just trying to do her best to keep going forward and we have everyone come to the house mom dad brother ... brother conservative brother a slightly left of center sister kind of the whole family's all over the map and\nThe first kind of half of the movie is really all about you know trying your best to not talk about politics at the holiday table yes let's leave it there let's leave it there yeah did your family Thanksgiving since ...\nLet's leave it there let's leave it there yeah did your family Thanksgiving in fire this at all it actually did a it was read the Thanksgiving right after the twenty sixteen election how hot one it was a hot one that people didn't know what to say they were all shell shock yeah\nAnd that for dinner the three of us kind of gotten this argument and there was a little bit of wine involved\nBut you know what struck me about the argument was we were all on the same side we all voted for the same person rather enthusiastically ... I think my brother has kind of position he was a little more of a Bernie Sanders guy and\nI think his position was you know will burn it could have won this [noise] and you know my mom lives in in South central Ohio and she was saying well they forgot about the mid west they gave up the mid west which is ridiculous and I was kind of like well it's ... fault and this\nAnd it just struck me that if we're also aligned and ... and we're fighting what's going on to their tables around the country and and so I I knew that that arena would be like a really fun area for us to explore and I knew it can be funny and potentially explosive yeah\nWhat I Love about the movie and you miss 'em that it it it it makes us all think about how and when and how much we should talk about politics\nI covered the last election in my ... M O throughout was like people to talk about it more because of this stuff shapes the nation and we put the hard stuff to the side are only preach to the choir here to talk about more but now\nI'm usually like everyone just shut a thing I was like\nI was the guy for a good year and a half that sit down at dinner with some friends first day on TALK about can you believe that this is insane and I did that thing where I was like I don't understand how people are not talking about is that what is bigger what's a bigger news story and you're in my lifetime\nTalking about is that what is bigger what's the bigger news story in your in my lifetime that what's happening now there's not one minute so I I was getting frustrated that people's frustration with me talking about it and what I I recently\nI recently started trying to find that balance a little bit and like if you are just if you are just on Twitter all day and you're just you're just raise your blood pressure raises your blood pressure and I think you know when I wrote the movie I was like I Want to put myself in the head of Chris my character who really has obsessive and in these consumed by the cycle\nSo I had to CNN Fox News or MSNBC on twenty four really and I was reading it and it makes you crazy too [laughter]\nIt is a a slightly romantic story but I'm ... right after we first meet them um I really wanted to show the wear and tear that that she was going through with him um because that was very\nVery much based off of my wife I really yeah so well\nMy wife who is it is you know politically active and she goes to the marches and has very little ... to NPR I'm Steve Inskeep her litter she does not in the area [laughter] I'm a I'm there was one morning where it was like six twenty five in the morning and\nI uh she was in bed next to me and she was breastfeeding her her newborn and I was reading some articles that was you know like it's not helping not help out of your job and I turned her yeah that was happening presidents and I turned to her I said just like you know morose Leah America's lost\nHis a dude six twenty five AM I'm breastfeeding that I have an animal ... let me alone this is the most basic uh you\nLet me alone this is the most base a use of nature here\nOr a but but um yeah I ...

Massachusetts okay I okay I grew up in Massachusetts I identify as a New Yorker and in fact I Know both the candies for that and ...\nI Know both the candy is for that and ... there are ... and so as Massachusetts yeah basically you know they let me you know the ... well I don't know if it was a ... or something but there was one that had Idaho have a nasty light as the favorite can\n\nMaddie light\nAll right let's talk now about another thing that I Love besides Halloween candy or movies yes\nWas difficulty romantic comedies yeah I Want to run you through a few of the films that I watched over this summer a there was one movie in which to overworked assistance set their bosses up on each other\nAgain and we need to be miserable people\nThere was another movie I watched this summer where a teenage girls private love letters from mysteriously mailed to all of her crushes I think it's really cool that you think I have called inspectors in my eyes it's got\nThe letter ... then there was the\nOther one where the bride ... left at the altar so then she went on our honeymoon with her estranged father\nGot credibly drunk that night and I blacked out because\nThat's what's coming grammar hunting though the funding when all these movies are that these were all rom coms on Netflix you heard clips there from set it up to all the boys I've loved\nAnd like father have you ever watch any of those movies two or three okay which to I watched um televised I Love before of course so good and set it up yes let an awful lot lovely\nFeel retro about that\nFeel retro that unless you all I feel like\nIt stokes a particular part of my heart same same\nSo these movies along with a bunch of other rom com releases on Netflix all summer we're part of this big push by Netflix to get some scribe has to watch from any comedies on the streaming service they even had a name for this big push they called it the summer of love nice uh and last week they put the data out some of the data out and it turns out that\nTens of millions of people watch these movies across the world this summer some eighty million people yes so I wanted to know more about this and Netflix in the summer of love so I called up someone who's been covering the summer of a lot of very closely\nHer name is ... when I met she writes for the onions Avi club she'd been closely following the summer of love so we talked all about\nHey Glenn how are you good how are you doing I'm good thank you for your time oh my gosh thanks so much for having me super excited yet I have been kind of digging out\nFor several days now upon discovering that without my knowledge Netflix quietly made me fall in love with rom coms this summer and now you didn't even now [noise]\nUm they called it the summer of love what exactly is it\nUh yeah some of that was like a menu of rom com movie is that Netflix kind of unfurled at the beginning of the summer a that as it turns out it's not flex reported recently for the third quarter report eighty million viewers watch and it's not even\nNumber of views that viewers so if you're like me and you watch them like four or five times a piece you can even multiply that number\nEight million people watching these wrong\nHe is you can even multiply that number\nEight eight million people watching these rom coms [laughter] my big question and first question about all of this was like what led Netflix no or think\nThat rom coms would work for them you know we've seen the movie studios and like the box office not really take the rom coms for many years now it's hard to find them in theaters so knowing that trend line what made Netflix they will this might work for us\nI think they just spied on completely underserved market\nYou know if you look at the summer box office the top ten movies are all sequels and genre\nAnd and comic blow across shoots\nYeah you know it's all like Mission Impossible ... infinity war so if you want to see things blowing up at the multiplex you know you're living in the golden era but if you want\nLike just to have a nice love story at the movies except for crazy Rich Asians the summer you were kind of out of luck so for Netflix it's kind of a combination of factors that they did they not only are churning out these rom coms are also\nTagging a women creative forces women writers women directors some of them you know this is the first movie they directed or they've directed like TV episodes before they're adapting way novels they're finding creative forces that really have been under used\nAnd it's worked out really well for them yeah why have the\nBig movie studios at the movies in theaters why they left rom coms\nLarge I think they're uh they're not the safe bet that they once were like if you're going to you're going to put like ... million dollars and infinity war but you're going to get more business\nPut like ... million dollars and infinity war but you're going to get more ... dollars back\nChannel with rom coms there was a a golden era you know when Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts you could just basically put Graham with anybody like I said it was on dribble up next why not mhm but then\nYou have something like Reese Witherspoon invincible on and for Christmases and it tanked yeah and these are superstars you're paying them a lot of money and then you're not getting your money back\nAnd it's also for the movie goer you know if I'm going to get a sitter and talk my husband than to go on to see a movie that's you know romance themes like it's going to have to be a kind of special event where for Netflix you know it's free\nI'm at home there's really no risk for me to like watch set it up and if I don't like it I'm just going to go watch Gilmore Girls reruns again it's not a big deal\nBut then you end up liking set it up and like if you're like me I've watched it three times and then Netflix is going to send me more possibilities for that rom coms on her and I think that's how it all exploded\nYeah you know I think the thing with a rom com it's perfect for me a single person to watch at home alone because the last thing I Want to do is spend twenty dollars and see a lovely couple ended up together river on screen and then I got to go home alone [laughter]\nOh yeah if you can do that with a Ben and Jerry's and a frozen pizza I mean that's not a Thursday night you've got that going out to yeah\nI'm should we expect movie studios big movie studios are putting movies in theaters to react to this Netflix news and say oh we should start making rom coms again like those Netflix's summer of love and success lead to more rom coms in actual movie theaters\nThis lead to more rom coms in actual movie theaters\nUm that's an interesting question I I Do wonder about that because it'd be crazy Rich Asians did so well because we just want a you know a lovely\nMovie like that to see you later and in the story that I wrote another thing that was really prevalent we had a ton of commenters\nAnd because the question is like well why did eighty million people watch this like what is the big question I mean other than like markets or whatever people are just like more depressed we're [laughter] we're stressed out we want escapism we want you know we want like just an easy fun movie maybe we don't even want to see things one up anymore I Know that's hard to even like\n[noise] and from the John us and James all night foundation helping NPR advanced journalistic excellence in the digital age\n[noise]\nYou're listening to it spin emitted from NPR I'm Sam Sanders and wanting to our listeners this portion of the show contains descriptions of sexual abuse of minors probably not good for kids\nWe've discussed the me too movement a lot on the show me too and politics me too and how we would be two in journalism and NPR's newsroom even now we're going to talk about me too and sports and the dozens of stories you've been hearing for months\nSports and the dozens of stories we've been hearing for months about young elite athletes being abused by their coaches the doctors the mentors people they should be able to trust\nTheir reality and causing a great deal of physical mental and emotional pain in every field he he took advantage of ... and our dreams you\nThat's Olympics gold medalists alley Raisman\nShe was speaking at the trial of Larry Nassar he was convicted of sexually assaulting numerous young women under his care\nAs a former sports doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State university ... Nassar was recently sentenced to up to a hundred and Seventy five years in prison in the wake of Nassar's trial top Olympic officials have been forced out most recently Mary Bono resigned as the interim head of USA Gymnastics and\nAfter a lot of criticism she held that job for less than a week today you'll hear from an elite athlete who came forward with her own experience of sexual abuse in another ... former speed skater ... barrel she was sexually abused by another skater when she was just a teenager\nSo he helps drive my teammate and I to and from practice which both of our families really appreciate it\nAnd so and he would only pick me up every day and we'd frequently go to the rink and skate but you know sometimes we in other places but even if we did go to the rink and scale than there was molest station that happened before and after I mean in the parking lots of high school parking lot\nFriday was Fifteen Years old and training to be an Olympic speed skater in New York state when thirty three year old a limping medalist Andy Gable entered her life he was a skating God he quickly became brightest\nEntered her life he was a skating God he quickly became brought his mentor and helped her family out\nAs I said he used to drive my friend and I home from practice in the summer and he'd always drop her off first\nThan I mean I can picture clear as day back out of her driveway go down the street stops I take a right and you go to my house and it was like that every time and then one time at that same stops on he took a left and he went to the um a few streets over and there was a dead end\nWhich in hindsight it's interesting that he knew that there was a dead end there was a dead end he pulled the car over took office he ... he turned to me and he said can I guess you would have had a minimum I\nSaid nothing I just sat there [noise] um I\nWill sit here and honestly say I did not say no and an open door to not run away\nBut I was frozen yeah I mean people say there's fight or flight but there's free\nAnd that's what happened and I remember after that when we put our seatbelts on and turn the car around I remember just being like a fog or a I mean now now we have an especially I was like W. A. T. S. [laughter] yeah you know and run shock probably ... percent\nAnd only ... how would I tell anyone who would believe me what proof have\nWhy would anyone believes that he would do you know I mean just um and it wasn't violent in what we think of as traditional violence so he wasn't a stranger it wasn't a windowless fan huh\nSo he wasn't a stranger it wasn't a window as fan ... you know all that that we pretend to make these people will be so yeah that I mean honestly God that is a day my life changed\nHe would keep doing this in in the ... the the contact\nBecome more intense but yeah so so people will say you know like what is what do I mean when I say molested so to\nAnswer that awkward question on any I never had sex\nAnd the traditional um definition of sex but basically the legal terms is digital penetration um and he would put my hand on himself when he was wrecked um [noise] and you are touched and follow me and I was Fifteen and he was thirty three\nWhile Andy is taken advantage of you do see also like getting close to your family at the same time\nI'm very much so so ah he [noise] he had um a growing issue was skating and so he saw my father for his doctor for that and\nMy mom he came over to the house a couple of times and I took piano lessons from my mom oh my goodness yeah\nSo how are you in your house for example wasn't from your mother you knew what he was doing to she did not know wow so how did that feel\nI don't even know I mean\nI think it it was such a time of confusion and I\nConfusion and I was so dedicated to wanting to skate that I didn't have any other currency you know I didn't have any\nAnything to barter I didn't have money I didn't have 'em anything the only thing\nThat he wanted for me was my ... slot body I'm and I'm about it was it so confusing because\nLike I said he wasn't violence with me\nAnd she took care of my skates which is very very very time consuming\nAmir blades they're not flat so there's a slight rock to them nothing like hockey skates but there is something they're not straight they're bent to go left and the offset and so as especially as a kid like myself gets better and better and better I mean the improvement\nCurve is is pretty deep as a kid and so I'm\nAs you're getting better the all of those metrics have to change and for the Nineteen Ninety eight Olympic trials sort of a winter club had a lot of athletes competing I mean we sent more people to the Olympic trials than the national training programs sent to the Olympic trials\nSo our coach you also was volunteer had a full time job\nAnd a family um he and he took care of my blades and I mean our coach Andy and other top skaters are higher priority so he helped me out and a lot of ways my mother said if you want to go to a skating find a ride to the rank\nAnd Andy was my ride [noise] do do you think\nAnd Andy was my ride [noise]\nDo do you think she ever thought that he was your boyfriend did you think at Fifteen that he was like something approaching a boyfriend\nI definitely did because\nI didn't know what else that could be yeah um because he was kind to me in and gave me things um you know bought me things about me gifts brought me out to dinner I mean some things that seems silly and trivial to someone like just stop for a second\nI\nI didn't have a driver's license yeah I couldn't go anywhere\nI'm I\nMowing lawns in the summer\nThat's how I had enough money to offset my skating my parents put up a lot of money and I had to contribute [laughter]\nIt's not inappropriate for kids to kiss and fool around and experiment when they're Fifteen with other Fifteen year old kids you're right but\nSo that's what was so confusing about at all also took was part of the reason it took me so long to come forward and talk about it because\nFor so long it it was and it still is it's gray two things one so again I was in the tenth grade and that was when we had homecoming dance and I wanted to go with actually my date lived down the street from Andy one block away\nAnd um he said that I could quote go he let me go I'm so long as as soon as I came home I called him I couldn't go down after party I can go to anything I had to come directly home and so I told the group of friends\nDirectly home and so I told the group of friends I was going with than my day and ever and I said I'm you know I have practice in the morning so I'm just after the dancing going to go home and I was like oh that's cool yeah we figured that it fine but it was because he was controlling yeah when I told my parents mom we pick me up you know the station ... station wagon\nA role in my school parking lots pick me up and brought me home and no one thought anything of it and I have one of those\nMemories in my brain of being in my bedroom\nHad twin beds in my bedroom and this yellow\nBedside table between the two of them in this phone was there and I remember being kind of under the covers and no one could hear me picking up the phone dialing his phone number and being like I Am home\n[noise] [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "It's Been a Minute", "city": "Reno", "day": "28", "locations": [["California", 34.68743,

been a minute from NPR the show where we catch up on the week that was\nSam Sanders here with two gas at NPR West Karen Grigsby Bates correspondent for NPR's Code switch team hey Karen hey Sam and Kelly McEvers host of NPR's embedded podcast hello Hi quick question for both of you before we get back to the news um have either have you ever been to Nebraska for fun\nKind of where I'm I drove the length of the state and um I remember it being the parts of the time with two very beautiful killing you can see I already grew up in the cornfields and the flat areas so um\nNo [laughter] so I bring this um because the state of Nebraska is out with a new ad campaign to boost tourism to Nebraska but their whole sticking point is that the state is boring and that's why you should come when I ask you this\nI mean and that's why you should come\nWhen I asked it this year way yeah you know to argue worn out by the chaos that you see it right now that have come to Nebraska guide US law literally and ... and their\nSlogan in one ad is lucky for you there's nothing to do here\nI think that's genius [laughter] I think they should tell people you know take a take a drive through the ... you know yeah they should be like the Internet turns off as soon as you could ask as we ain't got no ... no amount of it you know social media like coming them Yeah John\n... runs Nebraska's tourism commission and he talked to NPR on Thursday unexplained with this campaign is all about\nNebraska is a place where on his perspective and life simple pleasures help you realize what matters most\nYou know I never had any desire to go to Nebraska now I'm going\n[laughter] I'll do it in ... somebody's front porch [laughter] I Want to vet that person first [laughter] ... yeah that I I don't care about the conversation [laughter] tied yeah\nAll right in other wacky news I Want us to talk about a story in academia and the strange fight happening in that world over the last year or so\nThese really crazy studies have started to show up in some peer reviewed journals one was a study about rape culture at Portland dog parks among dogs another study argued that professional bodybuilding is bigoted because it doesn't include a category for quote fat bodybuilding\nThan another study replaced anti Semitic phrases in Hitler's mine comes with feminist buzzwords yeah so all these studies were part of a big hoax fake studies placed in real ...\nStudies are part of a big hoax fake studies placed in real journals to show that a certain type of scholarship is corrupting academic research these talks to his colleague grievance studies they associated with fields that are focused on identity like gender studies are clear studies are critical race theory\nI had to get to the bottom of this so I called up one of the three ... hello Jens Lindsey\nHello he's a mathematician my backgrounds in what's called ... which sounds nobody's [laughter] sounds hard it's it's basically solving puzzles\nAnd I had a lot of questions for him but first I had to understand what he means by the phrase grievance studies\nGrieving studies is this is a little bit of a complicated terms because people think we're talking about particular fields or subjects and that's not correct grievance studies is something it up a method that is an approach to studying certain things\nTo be really really Christ was it the actual definition would be the definition for what is formerly known as critical constructive as ... which is this idea that\nSociety is built out of power dynamics that are regulated in language\nAnd so the studies come from a position of not just say social marginalization or pressuring or search for equality but rather one of actual grievance where they believe that the system is rigged against them and they're frustrated with that\nSo James and two colleagues of his Helen plug grows and Peter ... and they got seven out of twenty of these hoax studies published now we should note here all of these hoaxes or self described liberals and James says all of this reveal something wrong with left wing academia\nWe care about how these topics are covered and were sick and tired of looking at this political circus that\nAbout how these topics are covered and were sick and tired of looking at this political circus that's dominating our political landscape right now okay we figure we feel like the left has ... has ... and we're on the left we need to clean up the left and we hope the rights gonna do it too\nYeah and just to narrow down on that when you say these topics and things like gender studies square studies ray studies that kind of area yes\nExactly a gender studies the study of race gender sexuality um anything to do with identity really needs to be done right and needs to be done carefully and he's been rigorously\nAnd it needs to not leave a vacuum into which um say the right wing pundits can can fill the space and and gained traction gotcha\nSo I just want to make sure that I'm understanding this and want to kind of make it digestible I hear you saying that some Wayne is in the fields of gender studies ... studies ray studies have gone too far and that you wanted these hoax studies to prove that\nYeah ... in a sense what we wanted to prove was that they are relying upon broken methodologies that allow them to launder ideas through the scholarly process so they can start with some opinion or even a prejudice and push it through the scholarly process because there seem to be flaws and how that materials being evaluated by the peer review system\nAnd then it comes out looking like knowledge on the other side\nGotcha so then what did you want these hoaxes to accomplish it do you want to diminish these fields of study do you want certain scholars to go away do you want certain journals to go away what did you want to tangibly happened as a result of these studies\nThe scholarship on these these topics which is incredibly important be done better I'd like to see rigorous work done where we're criticism that comes from the outside and outside and says hey you know\nA rigorous work done where where criticism that comes from the outside and outside and says hey you know this methodology doesn't work or this\nBlatantly disagrees with with what we know about biology I Would like to see it to where these fields which do this camp reply oh you're just speaking from a sexist or racist perspective whenever you try to challenge her ideas yeah so I'm looking for reform not destruction how many hours a week where are you working on this\nI personally put in between Thanksgiving and when it came public in October of this year I personally put in about Ninety hours a week probably on average or you're not working out doing this and if so how are you making money [laughter]\nFor the first half of the project I kept my day job and it became increasingly difficult to keep up with both and the stress was enormous and it was very difficult uh over the course of the study we actually had a number of anonymous donors reach out to us how they find you\nUm well we aren't completely disconnected from the world and Peter and I had done a previous hoax attempt called the conceptual peanuts was a social construct\nAnd I'll ... various people had been aware of this they've asked to be to remain anonymous obviously in today's political climate and the the nature of how controversial stuff can be ... if it matters more money came from left donors then right donors now that what is it or something like well\nWe figured that there would be a lot of pushback and there's actually been a lot more encouragement you kind of see some scholars are pushing back against it and saying that we were mean which that's irrelevant even if we're not but even if we were but it wouldn't mean anything they're saying we're tools of the right which is also false and\nYou are listening to it's been a minute with Sam Sanders on K you in our

advance journalistic excellence in the digital age\n[noise]\nListening to it's been a minute from NPR I'm Sam Sanders we're going to have a conversation now about a movie I cannot stop talking about it's an HBO documentary called the ... the sentence is about Cindy shape among\nIsn't it the sentence is about Cindy shame a mom who had three kids husband home a pretty normal life\nBut it all changed one morning when the feds came knocking they arrested Cindy for something she was involved in years before an ex boyfriends have been a drug dealer and because she knew what he was doing and didn't report it she was committing a crime\nMandatory minimum sentencing laws for certain drug offenses meant that Cindy was sentenced to Fifteen Years in prison this movie is about Cindy struggle to get out answer struggle to keep being a mother to her three young daughters while she was in prison and the whole movie is directed by some these brother Rudy vile death\nHe actually began filming the day Cindy went to prison\nAnd found a life of my daughters um I was given a sentence or Fifteen Years in two thousand and eight and my daughters were for two and six weeks old and Rudy starts to film their lives and it it films what actually happens to families that are left behind on these um\nLong sentences and what happens what truly happens to families\nYeah and and these long sentences like there's a name for this kind of sentence the mandatory minimums we should explain briefly what the idea of these minimums is and how some folks say it has hurt families like yours\nI mean they're all you know products of this war on drugs that started in the late seventies early eighties where the sentences which would have been posed based on weights and based on different criteria when you're facing a drug sense especially on the federal level\nAnd I'm a lotta people refer to what happened to my sister as the girlfriend problem yeah which is basically you know she was knowledgeable about what was happening\nBasically you know she was knowledgeable about what was happening in you know the household she was living in but she didn't go to the police and you know ... she was sentences if she were the person actually buying and selling the drug to\nWhat exactly had your boyfriend you on your ex boyfriend been doing lay out the case for us\nWell um he had he was a drug dealer and he had started selling drugs in when after we started our relationship and he was actually murdered and that is when the federal government came across everything that he was doing\nAnd they initially indicted me in two thousand and two and dismiss my case why they dismiss it they you know the feds picked up they drop dead state picked it up state dropped it and I got a letter from my attorney saying that my case had been dismissed\nUm it was really trying time at that time 'cause the birds you know it was quite a whirlwind with the murder and then be in charge initially and then you know I moved out with my life and\nAbout my life back up put my pieces back together and then only to have them come back later and\nTake me away six years later and and so what did they actually convict you up I Know it was some kind of conspiracy charges like what was the the the formal sentence\nI was actually given um for felonies or we'll charge 'em with possession within tend to distribute a cocaine crack marijuana and also conspiracy I was charged with all of his current\nWhen they came to you years after your ex boyfriend had died years after you moved on to start a new life with a new husband children of your own [noise]\nWhen they said we're going to lock you up did you think that any sentence would be fair or do you think this and then you to prison at all was wrong\nKnow I I've gotten asked this question quite a bit and it's hard for me to say 'cause it's\nYou know I I've gotten asked this question quite a bit and it's hard for me to say because it's me out of you know I don't want to go to prison you know I understand that you know people make a choice and you know I I knew what he was doing so yes I I I think that some sentence would have been fair you know on some level\nBut you have to also understand the prosecutor asked for eighty nine years for me oh my goodness I\nI was given a mandatory minimum the judgment as low as he could go his hands were tied that was the lowest yeah that was the lowest while ago he could go no lower because of mandatory minimum laws um\nI just feel you know hey maybe I'd never I never even had a speeding ticket you know so I kind of like two years three years maybe and maybe you know probation for ten years I have no problem you know checking and doing what I have to do and you know following the letter of the law and\nSo not to interrupt but I think like the whole the whole thing with the sentence with her getting Fifteen Years is that it is such an arbitrary number you know what I mean I think that as sensing goes we should\nYou know allow judges to do what we have an trusted them to do take in the factors of the case taken history of the case taking the the situation of the individual and decide what can I hand down that it's going to be fair\nYou know there is this moment in the movie that just\nBroke my heart I'm Cindy your dad ... he can't afford to go out to see you in prison but he wants to make sure you have enough money to use the phone to call your girls and two years at one point collecting scrap metal to do that I Want to play some tape here [noise] are you having a real leader does\nDo that I Want to play some of that tape here\nFor having a real clean needles regularly with extra\nEarly got enough here for sensing another forty dollars for the ... you know that that's what I Try to wherever they just don't have enough money for those are never missed a week before\nShe could have one I Can't afford to go up there all the way right now fear you know but I Would rather have the money centers chicken or chicken your chocolate chips every ... every week or something like\nBut I Do miss are a lot but I I don't know what else [noise]\nYou know hearing that scene back and watching it in the theater I thought of my own dad and if it if he were ever that tender and speaking about his love for me\nI don't think you would want a camera did you have any moment where you said Cindy don't put the family out there like that\nI never have I guess I never thought that no nobody should see this what if anything I'm proud of my father and the man that he is and how loving his towards ... absolutely and\nWho wouldn't want to share that what a good man he is what a good dad he is of course I wouldn't want to share his love for me to the world it was beautiful\nYou're listening to it's been a minute for NPR I'm Sam Sanders we're talking about a new HBO documentary called the sentence it's about a woman who was sentenced to Fifteen Years in prison because of mandatory minimum drug sentencing laws this film was actually inspire politicians from both sides of the aisle to try to change those mandatory minimums\nThis seems like an issue that might transcend either party you have people in Congress Republicans and Democrats who will agree that there are too many Americans in prison\nWho will agree that there are too many Americans in prison and that some of these sentences strictly for non violent offenders\nAre too long there is agreement there you've got folks running the gamut from Rand Paul to comment Harris right why has there been no movement on this issue knowing that there's a pretty good consensus right there and everyone thinking this is the thing that needs to change\nSo let me tell you that so two days after we permitted at Sundance\nI was contacted by a senator a Republican senator from Utah Senator Mike Lee he said thank you for making the so one of the dollars that seemed Sundance and he said I Believe in this I Believe in this issue and I believe in sentence reform so with Senator Mike Lee\nSenator Cory Booker a Democrat from New Jersey together in a bipartisan effort brought the film to Capitol Hill\nTo show to staffers to show the legislation to show to the house to say this is how we need to approach this it can no longer be me versus you it's an us thing and so it's an apolitical film that makes it more political and\nCindy one of the most striking features of the film was watching your children grow up onscreen\nKnowing that I was seen more of their growing up then you could what was it like for you I mean you got to talk to them on the phone as much as you could but you didn't see them\nNo I didn't um\nDevastating as a mother to not be able to watch your children grow you know to not be able to learn their expressions and they're you know mannerisms and their likes and dislikes and other little things that every mother", "year": "2018", "show_name": "It's Been a Minute", "city": "Reno", "day":
