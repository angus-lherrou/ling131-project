freakonomics radio the third installment in the series we're calling the hidden side of sports in the first episode we looked at how sports have always mirrored society from our historical penchant for war colonizing two or more recent obsession with pushing the limits of human achievement\nIn episode two we looked at the economics of a single NFL franchise San Francisco forty niners and how they have begun to recover from a debilitating losing streak\nI mean when you lose a game a lot it always happens when you lose to a ton happens usually trees like Armageddon [noise] I'm trying not\nIn today's episode becoming an athlete\nTime to step back and try to understand how\nThe time to step back and try to understand how these people rose to such heightened scientific is the process how predictable\nWill look at a number of factors including of course raw talent my parents are both superstar athletes will look at will determination I did a bunch of push ups and sit ups that night until I was I'm throwing up\nAnd the mental aspect of this most physical pursuits well I think the mind is is a big of a separate or um for professional athletes as any physical tools\nWill hear

freakonomics radio to show that explores the inside of every ... here's your house even [noise]\nWhen you see an elite performer in any field sports store music or surgery whatever it's natural to ask yourself the question how they get sick\nAnd it's natural to ask yourself the question how they get so that how much of that ability where they born how much is attributable to hard work can practice this is a debate that's been going on probably forever nature versus nurture raw talent versus what's called deliberate practice\nWe've had that debate on this program most recently in episode called how to become a great at just about anything\nToo often this debate ends up obscuring what strikes me as a pretty obvious that the ... great at anything you need both talent in practice lots of each but\nEven that fact seems pretty narrow don't you think because athletic success like any success and leave Bernie failure it's what you might call multi factorial\n[noise] a lot of input from a lot of variables imagine you've got to athletes with identical talent levels in identical training methods\nYou really want to make a big bet that their athletic careers also ended up identical as much as we might want to turn the pursuit of success in to science into a recipe real life is more nuanced than that also interesting so I mean [noise]\nJay Z\nSold drugs [noise] grow up in a Marcy projects to a single mother\nThat's Dominique Fox worth who played six seasons and the NFL\nNow he is a multi multi millionaire married to be on say the most amazing talent we have today so why don't we set it up so that all young men must sell drugs\nSet it up so that all\nYoung men must sell drugs when their kids and um and have only their mother and grow up in a Marcy projects in Brooklyn New York I mean\nHe had a great talent and to be honest like there's probably a a great deal of luck like\nHe happened to not be there when one of his friends got arrested and his friend in snitch on them like that is like a lot of luck\nAnd that to me see and I think the same thing is true for me like I can go through the course of my life and look at all the things that happened that were just happenstance that led me to these positions and I'm not going to say that it's a model that\nShould be that should be followed understand that there are occasional outliers but trying to build around that seems crazy\nSo okay we're not going to arrive at some perfect model for turning an ordinary person into a world class athlete but\nWe'll do our best to describe some of the inputs that seemed to be strong contributors let's start with physical ability it may not surprise you to learn that a lot of elite athletes exhibited pretty high baseline level of talent from an early age\n... to share a for instance a three time major league baseball all star yes you know ... and\nMost kids grow up being you know if you're an elite athlete you're going to be the best get on your team\nPlayed every sport as a kid was baseball your best sport in the ... always while yes ah and I actually enjoy playing basketball more uh I play backyard football I played soccer tennis and uh but I I was always good at baseball so I knew baseball was going to be um you know a sport for my future\nAthletic talent is considered one of ...\nYou know a sport for my future athletic talent is considered one of the more heritable traits passed from parent to child in super freakonomics one of the books I wrote with the economist Steve limit we performed a rough calculations showing that if a major league baseball player has a son\nThat boy is about a hundred times more likely than a random boy also make the majors\nSo it may not surprise you that a lot of the athletes we've been interviewing for the series came from athletic families here's Kerry Welsh Jennings who's won three Olympic gold medals and be trouble\nOh man well my ... my life has literally been family and sports like from day one I think from birth and my parents are both superstar the athletes they both come from very athletic families\nMy parents are both athletic\nAnd that's the alpine skier McHale is shifting who's won two Olympic gold medals\nMy mom is extremely athletic and even now she's had knee surgery than hands surgeries and neck surgeries and everything but she's still such an incredible athlete\nWell I mean my dad kind of did every sport when he was growing up\nAnd the gold medal gymnasts Shawn Johnson\nHe was a hockey player he wrestled he did BMX he a race NATO acts I mean everything\nJust how powerful is the sports gene David Epstein is a science journalist and author of a book called the sports gene in it he tells the story of a man named Donald Thomas Donald or is about six\nTo I'm leaving a ... guy\nThomas played basketball at small college in Missouri but he was far from an elite player and the ...\nA small college in Missouri but he was far from an elite player in the college program was far from ... one day in the gym he was bragging about how high you could jump\nAnd the best jumper on the track team a guy named Carlos overheard him and said you know you're talking all that trash um you wouldn't even clear bar a six foot six and a real competition and Donald says yes yes I Would\nAbout point four percent of kids so about one in two hundred and fifty kids will make it to one of those top ten schools so it's a it's a hard hard goal to do it\nAnd I can't say I've thought about the University of things you you could do but I thought about sports and uh and I stumbled on to something that was pretty surprising to me so the answer I think is you want your kid to be a fence or\nThe guy that you might say that sounds crazy like this college fencing even exist and\nAnd the answer is there turned out to be exactly forty six schools that have fencing but the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked schools in the country nine of those ten\nHave a fencing the the only exception being my own university University of Chicago and each fencing team has quite a few slots to fill there's three different blades says eBay there's Sabre and the soil and there's male female fancy and\nGiven that relatively few kids in the U.S are serious you Spencers so it's something like six or seven percent of the kids you ever tried to be sensors ended up being college fences I'm not saying they get scholarships but that ...\nEnd up being college ... about seeing they get scholarships but that they're likely to be admitted to college based on their fencing\nHow much does limit thing fencing increases your chances from that point four percent base find\nSo fencing seems to raise that number holding everything else constant something like Fifteen fold\nWe should say here that college admissions being what they are fencing doesn't necessarily increase your chances all that much your grades would soon to be very very good to get into those top schools that said as an admission sweetener how does ... think fencing compares to other sports\nMy God if you want to go to an Ivy League school\nForget about soccer and basketball and football there's something like three hundred thousand kids playing high school soccer and presumably any of those kids would love to be taught soccer players but that the chance of having soccer be your vehicle to get to college as opposed to fencing\nTurns out to be about Seventy five or eighty times harder so how many of your kids have you turned in defense or is it\nExactly one and uh so far so good uh I I couldn't say I really turned him into a fence or uh he he strangely enough gravitated towards fencing when he was about nine years old and he fences at a really good club in Chicago and I don't know his grades aren't that good\nSo she knows when I Know as everyone else knows if he's going to go to an Ivy League school it's going to be because of fencing [noise]\nComing up on freakonomics radio the story of an athlete who did go to an Ivy League school but then when it's time to go\nYou have an athlete who did go to an Ivy League

might need some luck\nI mean you you can't get hurt you can't have the flu on the wrong day you have to find the right coach Wright city I was incredibly lucky to end up with my coaches\nSo how'd that happen it was kind of freak occurrence\nMy coach was Chinese born and raised Chinese um when he was three years old he was taken away from his family and raised to be an Olympic gymnast and he\nKind of had this crazy career that I Would say almost traumatized him\nHe he lost his childhood he looked kind of lost his family and so when he was Twenty one years old he actually left the China came to the United states open to a gym in West Des Moines Iowa law\nThe United states open to a gym in West Des Moines Iowa of all places and had this dream this American Dream to raise an Olympian or Olympians that were also children and how to balance in life and were\nYou know fun loving and had a true childhood Johnson had started her training at different gym and I loved it it was awesome but child my coach that took me to um backs opened up a gym about five minutes from my parents' house\nAnd my parents ended up switching they had to save gas money and I was really really blessed to fall under his his guidance and his coaching I mean I I was a very very fortunate child's within the gymnastics community to have\nVery loving very very protective people around me and he I mean given today's society I can thankfully and\nSay that he he can't be safe and I am from grateful for that\nShawn Johnson is good luck created good opportunities which she worked hard to parlay into an Olympic gold medal but what about the young athletes who don't get the right opportunities whether through bad luck\nWar through something much more concrete like lack of money over the past decade youth sports economy has doubled more than Fifteen billion dollars a year\nAnd a lot of youth sports involved some sort of pay to play model\nPay to play something but just it just scares me because it's become so much of a business of itself a less about\nTrue true true development\nBrandon McCarthy and he's been a pitcher in major league baseball for Thirteen seasons it's attorney\nHe's been a pitcher in major league baseball for Thirteen seasons [noise]\nIt's a tournament in California this week as the next week and you go to Nevada after that it's Texas and I don't understand how two working parents could ever afford to put their kids through that and then take the time to travel with them\n... you know the theme of economics last like ten or Fifteen Years has been income inequality and connected to that the rich getting richer it sounds like what you're saying with youth sports is that's being near that all the way down the line yes\nI Would think so I mean there's two players on your team and one player I'm at the age Thirteen level can make all the tournaments in the summer and one can only make to the tournaments well how much playing time as the player who whose family can't afford for him to go on those trips and then the coach doesn't favor hem and play them\nI think this that trickle down effect from there and there's less access to the top coaching lessons equipment you name it over time it's starting to bear itself out as some income inequality just creates better baseball players and worst baseball players\nOr in one or the instance a huge drop in baseball players\nIn Nineteen eighty one there was Eighteen point seven percent black African American players in the major leagues as of two thousand Eighteen seven point eight percent so the question is why the decline\nDavid Canton is a history professor and director of the Africana studies program at Connecticut College\nThe huge drop of black players in baseball he argues has a number of historical causes including the relative rise of black football and basketball players but he puts most of the blame on deeper structural issues\nSo I look at these factors the industrialization mass incarceration and suburbanization so\nMass incarceration as suburbanization so at the industrialization lack of tax base we notice no funds to what construct and maintain ball feels\nSo you see the rapid decline of the physical space in the Bronx in Chicago and these other uh urban areas which leads to a lack of participation\nThe opportunities that again is Dominic Fox worth who over did his push ups and sit ups at age eight in order to make the NFL\nAnd then in college I wanted to be a ... computer science major at um University of Maryland and my academic advisor was like Mm though that that core slows gonna make it very difficult for you to make it to our practices their labs and blah blah blah blah so I was like not not going to do that so instead\nYou did was an American studies yeah and that American studies when journalism ... which just shows how easy would I Do is that you could do it and another major while playing\nFootball [laughter] no I um I enjoy those and it was it was good but it wasn't what I wanted to do and in the summers when when people were getting internships or whatever I was working out and getting ready for football and I\nSay I want to say once I got to the league and I got drafted in I was in the third round so that's it's money it's good money but it's not life changing money doesn't make up for all the things that you have given up through the course of your life\n\nYou shouldn't feel too sorry for Fox or he played long enough to enter free agency his final NFL contract paid him about twenty seven million dollars but now out of football for a few years he still feeling the after effects\nOf his single minded\nSo like my my whole life since I was a kid I had a very clear goal and I work towards that goal and I made lots of decisions that would give me close to that goal but give me further away from other important and interesting things including friends and including family and\nAnd then I Will say All right I'm done playing so\nBe in the state of transition\nDone playing so I Will be in the state of transition his\nTransition included getting an MBA from Harvard and working at the NBA players union he's now doing some writing and sports casting I mean I think\nIt's a feeling of loneliness honestly which\nAnd it's not like I have three kids and my wife and I'm not like alone obviously and I love them and I have fun with them and but throughout my life I have been almost ... focused on a goal which\nBeing focused on that goal like gave me purpose and I'm sure I'm going to butcher the nature the quote but it's something to the effect of\nA when a man has a why he can bear almost anyhow and like\nI was I didn't I don't drink now I never drank in my life I never smoke we like I\nWas single focus on doing everything every decision I made with like All right I'm going to get closer to go and I I ... the people I was close with in high school like those are my friends any more people I was close with in

box worse than mark to share a and Lauren Murphy\nBut what about the athletes who make the sacrifices but don't make the big time\nJust look at the numbers there are only about Seventeen hundred players in the NFL major league baseball you're within nine hundred the NBA just about five hundred in baseball roughly Ninety percent of the players drafted by major league clubs don't ever make it to the majors\nOne of those Ninety percent was just an Humphries\nYou get a phone call so how's it feel to be the next member of the Houston Astros and you just get you get exposed to a dream come true so I ended up signing\nShe started playing minor league baseball at Eighteen which meant skipping college although he did\nAt Eighteen which meant skipping college although he did start taking some courses later on in two thousand nine he retired at age twenty seven without ever making the majors he enrolled at Columbia University and took a sociology class with a professor named Sudhir Venkatesh\nSo I was sitting there in his classroom I started thinking about all the issues are that I've seen an independent baseball and affiliated baseball\nGuys living check to check struggling with Louis go back to school family life issues at home and I thought if I could use some of the things that we were learning in class talked to some of these guys and find out whether the stories and and things that I was seeing and hearing was reflected in the numbers\nWe followed a sample of the draft class of two thousand and one and so that's about you know it's ten years and that is Sudhir Venkatesh and so we thought that would help us understand what happens to these folks\nI think one of the the the most curious things that we find is how much ten years matter so if you take two people who grow up in the same circumstances let's say one played baseball in one didn't\nThe person who plays baseball is making about forty percent less on average ten years after they enter the game and the person who decides not to play baseball and who just wanted a regular career\nAll right so what kind of background is typical for these players are tracking the average player\nLooks like an upper middle class kid who comes out of college or comes out of high school um and when you follow in upper middle class kid for about seven to ten years they're probably gonna make higher than the median average income they're probably going to live in a neighborhood that's relatively safe they are going to have a career now\nRelatively safe they're going to have a career now when you take the counterpart among the pool that was drafted that median kid that kid looks like he's making about twenty to twenty four thousand dollars a year\nWhich is not a lot of money um he's working probably five to seven months playing baseball and then struggling to find part time work in the off season might be coaching might be doing some training might be working on a construction site might be working in fast food\nWhen you're twenty five playing an independent ball making less than two thousand dollars a month\nLiving off your parents because you can't financially sustain yourself like that\nAt some point you have to say look I got with no degree I had less than an associates degree at that point so at some point you tell yourself I Can't do this to myself I Can't do this to my parents and I can't continue when I Know there's ... untapped potential to do other things [laughter]\nKnowing when to quit anything is hard especially if it means abandoning a lifelong dream\nQuitting an athletic dream\nIs especially hard because baked into the east coast that sport is the idea that you should never quit never give up never backed down\nI think about it if you've

S. is the biggest complaints is that China for instance doesn't honor intellectual property that\nRather than being bought or license the properties copied so that would essentially be a tariff on the imported version then their their government subsidized their airline industries or their agricultural industries are oil and gas and sugar\nDo you the WTO have any ability to direct totally request or command that these are terrorists not by name but in essence be eliminated\nHappens all the time industries like protection\nThey want to be supported by the government is they want to get help and they are now seen this um a prize in what we call\nBehind the border protection a and that happens in the form of a technical barriers it happens in the form of a insufficient an enforcement of certain rules like you mentioned intellectual property and that's much more difficult to assess because the Arabs you can measure\nThe Arabs you include only a spreadsheet and you'll prepare for it to pay that additional cost a behind the board there\nYou're a spreadsheet and you'll prepare for it to pay that additional cost a behind the board of their marriage or you don't know when they come you know what form they would take so it's it's stuff we have a committees are hearing the W. job will discuss exactly that\nDo you have any sense if you had to estimate the size of those ... what they would be compared to the official tariff rates\nAnd not really a also because some of those a perfectly legal you would see some countries are a put it in place technical barriers or technical standards that are more demanding than ah what other countries apply and that could be for the protection of the consumer\nOr it could be for preventive measures and those things are difficult to measure\nBut they can be very significant definitely uh in several situations they just stopped trade altogether so that's ah whatever and infinite ... at the border only measured and [noise]\nThe WTO says the average tariff rate among its members fell by Fifteen Percent between the organizations founding in Nineteen Ninety five and two thousand Thirteen [noise]\nThere are however many ... Harris rules are less stringent for developing countries for instance furthermore trade deals negotiated in good faith by one country's administration can be deemed by a leader administration to be unfair or just an palatable\nNAFTA the U.S Canada Mexico free trade treaty was signed a year before the WTO came into existence President Trump was not a fan of NAFTA\nI have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever may [noise]\nI'm curious how that makes you feel as a director general of\nThe WTO do you feel excluded do you try to get involved in those discussions and make sure they fall within the um the proper parameters of WTO behavior\n[laughter] to be Frank with you I don't have to try very hard they reach out for me very quickly sometimes I Try to discourage or some courses of action\nBut I also have to understand the political sensitivities in in many of these uh players we have um I'm happy to say uh conversations which are\nVery open and very Frank and um of course it can share with you and the listeners or the content of those conversations but um\nTo end the listeners or the content of those conversations but are they are very very Frank and ah we explore\nAll kinds of options are before us I tell them about the importance of the system and not to compromise the system and I would say that pretty much everybody I talked to a ... tells me that the system must be preserved even strengthen [noise]\nBut it's not easy under these circumstances to be you know to the line when others are and\nComing up after the break with the head of the WTO on our show of course we're going to ask him to make some predictions about trade and the economy my crystal ball doesn't allow me to go that far\nOh well but don't worry Roberto as of eight has plenty more to say we'll hear it after the break\nFreakonomics radio is supported by target presenting future at heart and new podcast that explores the work of change makers across the country and highlights projects in cities like Miami Washington DC and New York city future at heart available on apple pie cats or wherever podcaster found\nFreakonomics radio is supported by progressive insurance offering snapshot a device designed to reward safe drivers learn or at progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that's progressive\nGood afternoon it's great to have you along Chris Jordan here and we are listening to freakonomics radio right here on K. U. at our\nStick around until one for it's been a minute with Sam Sanders and join host Bob Carol this evening from six to eight as he hosts the music of America [noise] this week on the music of

London that the music of America with Bob Carol tonight from six to eight pm on K U when our [noise]\nWe get support from Les for my del at American wealth management providing sophisticated investment management and customized financial planning securities offered through MS housing company\nMember ... as I ... the information that three three to seven thousand [noise]\n\nThis is freakonomics radio here's your host Stephen ...\nRoberto Acevedo director general of the world Trade Organization was appointed to the post into thousands Thirteen when the trade waters were considerably less choppy than they are today [noise]\nSo you're from Brazil and you've studied electrical engineering before becoming a diplomat I'd like to just very quickly here had those three factors Brazilian engineering\nAnd being a career diplomat how they inform your role as director general of the WTO Brazilian um\nWell the good thing about being a Brazilian is that it gives me a very diverse prospective Brazil has a is a big economy a it's a big country with several ethnicities a very diverse cultural backgrounds\nAnd it has aspects of a a developed nation a very sophisticated industry but also has important aspects of of developing country very social challenges and that\nImportant uh aspects of of developing country very social challenges and that gives me this different perspective engineer\nI was always good with numbers and I think it was natural for me to become an engineer and it was\nUntil I met my wife ah and ah she decided to get into the diplomatic career\nAnd I'm at that point in time I had to decide you know ... what would I Do an engineer married to a diplomatic was going to be pretty challenging especially when she was posted abroad so I thought you know what let's let's\nWork for the family so I took the um\nThe exams and I passed or the exams and I joined the diplomatic career I think that was a lobster in its own rights\nCan you give me a quick example of an engineering like solution to a trade or economic problem\nSo and I'm In a meeting or something like that I Try to understand the basic motivations in and then figure out a way to make 'em those motivations work together\nAnd that's something I think that engineers do to try to get very complex situation some problems [noise] try to reduce them to derail a mental a conservative parts and or figure out a way to make them work\nPersonal chemistry is very important as well even between negotiators are I Know some people think that\nEverything you need to know you learn in kindergarten and I think that's quite accurate but uh I I found out that forever learning how to re ... relate to people how to take into account as diverse personalities cultures objectives\nSo as long as the world still has um independent nations and it seems that will be the case\nStill has um independent nations and it seems that will be the case for at least another few decades that we're not becoming one big global nation it strikes me that there's an inherent friction around trade 'em in which\nEvery country has to strike a balance between protectionism and globalism and so I'm curious whether you agree or disagree with this notion and however you answer what's to be done about that\nDistinction I'm that exists or even today are with regard to trade it always existed countries that do trade and that have ah a cooperative\nRelationship with the other partners they essentially gain from that\nBut it is also a reality that when you trade some sectors in the domestic economy or will lose many gain a mini are better off with a with a trading relationship but that some news in the sense that they're not competitive enough\nSometimes the factories clothes or in particular sector and are you cannot ignore that\nThink what you see today is something different from this very traditional very a historic attention\nToday we are seeing a transformation of the economic structure of the global economy Web producing things differently we're producing things fester we don't require 'em as much human input as we did before\nAnd this is increasing now clearly even for the government send for politicians it is easier to blame you know the foreign for these problems which are happening inside their own economies it's easier to blame the the imports are for the loss of jobs when they are\nIt's easier to blame the the imports are for the loss of jobs when they are they have a role of course Madame minor in this structural change and I think if we don't realize that if we don't try to find a solution for this will be hurting much more than the help it\nOkay so you've just described I Would argue beautifully and succinctly a big problem that of course a lot of economists and some others have described but you're right that's not the political rhetoric\nSo it's easy to think of what the wrong medicine how involved is the WTO in trying to discover and administer the right medicine\nI think the number two is already at least trying to help governments and public opinion to understand the situation and reached the right diagnosis if we get the wrong diagnosis who get definitely the wrong medicine the important thing to understand is that whatever medicine we choose it's not going to work overnight\nThere is no quick fix for this this is a this is essentially something akin to the industrial revolution so there will be a need to rethink the whole educational system or in countries\nHow to support the displaced are people are those who lost their jobs but cannot find a job somewhere else in the economy how are you will help them\nFind and other economic activity that will work for them and to help them support their family and the state of course I and I I understand that people don't want this I myself have very strong reservations against a a big state\nBut the state at least his to think about this and think about the mechanisms that will allow a U.S to to handle these are displaced a masters of workers\n[noise] you've said that if you want the truth and trade you have to get into the numbers which at political discussion\nThat if you want the truth and trade you have to get into the numbers which a political discussion almost inevitably doesn't keep talk about that for a moment and maybe give a a particular example where the political discussion on trade is just wrong or shallower only partially true and what needs to be done to address that\nOr yeah probably I didn't realize one of the whole and yes [laughter] there's actually even like thirty more\nBe that one university economist has the ear of so many governments and institutions\nFor a clue let's get back to\nFor a clue let's get back to why months of Cato found such inspiration in Carl Marx\nOne thing that's fascinating about Martin says that he's known as a critic of capitalism but actually when you read capital of Mali one two and three you end up really admiring and appreciating the dynamic aspect of capitalism which is technological change we shouldn't forget that futile ism was five hundred years of inertia\nOne of the defining features of capitalism is in fact the way the innovation has really broken down all sorts of law that is constantly changing how industries operate how production distribution and consumption work and marks really talks about that\nQuite curious that one of the you know most famous critics of capitalism actually described it and the most dynamic\nOf always and that's what got me interested in economics of technological change\nBut it's not just technological change interests much cut out she has a relatively radical stance on the value that's created by technological change\nWhat do I mean by radical stance consider the titles of her books the first was called the entrepreneurial state [noise] those two words entrepreneurial and state typically are not used to gather\nMust have got his latest book is called the value of everything making taking in the global economy when it comes to the relationship between government and economic growth Martha ... who knows how to talk to an artist goes it goes like this\nMy God the government put a basket case group of bureaucrats they don't know what they're doing\nBut she sees it differently you know what would be without a GPS\nPublicly financed what would Google be with\nWhat would ... be without a GPS\nPublicly financed what would Google be without the Internet publicly financed [noise]\n... was born in Rome but grew up in Princeton New Jersey where her father took a job as a research physicist at the university and she studied history and international relations at Tufts and got her PHD in economics\nAt the new school for social research in New York and now she lives with her family in London and in an interview with the Financial Times I'm lunch with the F T um where you go and have lunch and a glass of wine\nOr do you said well they're expensive that's the one I saw that the glass of wine you ordered costs forty pounds\nI made an error they made an error you well I didn't try this is how they treat you know they treat you they trick you I don't know if it's because I was a woman and they didn't show me the price you know to the gentleman or if it's what that does but there is no prices I was so involved in the conversation I just pointed to the first one I saw and it turned out to be the most expensive wine that\nAnyone who read that article that call me a\nSoviet ... social [laughter] right\nSo to someone who says you know free markets are almost always good and governments are almost always bad to someone who says that you say what\nFirst is what do you mean by the free market and it's curious if you read Adam Smith\nA you know a one of the first economists back in the late Seventeen hundreds he actually meant by the word free market not free from the state but free from rent seeking free from those activities that extract value so when I say to those who say that you know\nThose activities that extract value so what I say to those who say that you know we need less state\nI'm uh in order to be more innovative more dynamic I say well let's look at one of the most innovative parts of the U.S economy which is Silicon Valley did that come from the free market or from an active the visible hand or the state\nMy point is actually the state was involved in almost everything a in Silicon valley not to exclude the role of the private sector of course we all know the very important ah companies in that area but\nThe role that public actress played was really across the whole innovation chain\nSo you're talking about agencies like dark but NASA and the national institutes of health and so on yes\nExactly I'm Talking about both agencies that do basic research like the national Science Foundation but also a agencies more downstream doing applied research\nLike a DARPA little sister organization in more recent times called art they eat the national institutes of health which continued to spend more than thirty billion dollars a year and the most radical\nUncertain high risk a research\nAnd here's some evidence of the government funding that Mexico is talking about DARPA or the defense advanced research Projects Agency\nCreated during the Cold War to keep American technology ahead of the Soviet\nIs over the years produced several kinds of missiles and airplanes as well as the first computer mouse miniature GPS receivers each de displays and the digital personal assistant ARPA e or the advanced research Projects Agency for energy founded under George W Bush\nSearch Projects Agency for energy found that under George W Bush has funded a variety of energy projects including battery storage tech\nThe department of energy starting in Nineteen Seventy eight invested more than a hundred and thirty million dollars studying the extraction techniques that have come to be known as fracking\nAnd the national institutes of health has helped fund the vast majority of all new drugs approved\nBy the FDA\nThese public institutions have absolutely co created value is quite extraordinary that we've become very used to these kind of much more passive words to describe the state you start having to change the ...\nAh that one uses so instead of saying the public sector deem risks the private sector is actually about sharing risks instead of talking about just facilitating and enabling business it's really about taking on the lead investor role as an investor first resort\nOne of the central arguments you make is that government institutions and closet government institutions are involved in the investment are involved in the risk and yet you argue barely share in the return how big of a problem is that\nIt's a huge problem and it comes back probably talk about things I often remind people I'm In Plato [laughter] a sad story tellers ruled the world so these stories that we tell\nAbout who creates value has in fact created the stories that are that justify the extraction of of value so let me give you an example which I think brings home\nThe U.S government after the crisis decided to have a proper fiscal stimulus program of close to eight hundred billion dollars\nThe school stimulus program of close to eight hundred billion dollars and\nPart of that agenda was really also to direct that says go stimulus towards the green economy so you might remember that Obama finance some companies like a cylinder through the U.S department of energy through a guaranteed loans that was for about five hundred million and that company went bust\nTheir new questions about a cornerstone of stimulus won five hundred and thirty five million dollar loan to a company called cylinder and make solar energy panels\nWhy does the taxpayers have to be the one footing the bill to try to shift some power solar power works people said my God the\nGovernment would a basket case group of bureaucrats they don't know what they're doing they shouldn't be picking winners they should just really do this kind of facilitating rolls of you know construct some roads education infrastructure and then get out of the way on\nWhich first of all completely misses the point that actually the U.S government in terms of energy has been the lead finance or\nOf areas like solar and wind alongside other governments but also nuclear fracking itself came out of a\nA U.S government financing early on but more concretely at the same time that it was financing cylinder and also finance Tesla for a very similar amount of money so that Tesla esque car got a four hundred and sixty five million guaranteed loan\nAnd when I say guaranteed I'm Talking about guaranteed by the U.S taxpayer so when cylinder Owen by the taxpayers we're pretty angry that they had to pick up the bill but why did the taxpayers not know that they had also finance Tesla would not have changed the narrative and the perception\nWould it not have changed the narrative in the perception of what the bureaucrats in Washington were doing they actually had a portfolio like any venture capitalists which you know takes on risk and so\nTo speak to any a venture capitalist they will tell you that for every success there's many failures however if you really want to be a venture capitalist you have to construct your portfolio in such a way that you also get some of the upside from the winds precisely to cover that downside\nAnd the u._s. government didn't do that so not only how they failed on the marketing side they had it actually communicated to us citizens of all the successful us investments which include everything on your iPhone or smartphone from the Internet GPS touch screen display series all government finance\nBut in this particular case people didn't know that Iran must come sell had received you know financing protests law anyone must by the way has received a total of five billion dollars a billion let's nine zero\nFive billion dollars has been spread across must three companies test for space X and solar city Martha ... says it taxpayers should be getting a much better return for investments like\nWhat the US government actually did with tests that was the opposite of what they should do they said thinking they were quite a wise if you fail to pay back the loan we get three million shares in your company\nYou have to ask yourself you know why all these Goldman Sachs guys who were in fact that Obama's government didn't actually come through and they were needed because they should've said the opposite if you do pay back alone we get three million shares", "show_name": "Freakonomics Radio", "year": "2018", "city":

were talking to the journalist Franklin for about his latest book world without mind the existential threat to the big tech\nMy argument is against the big technology companies which really are raping

America foundation\nThat's since become relevant just because they fired a ... for his critic of Google from the foundation which is noteworthy because the foundation has received a fair amount of money from Google chairman Eric Schmidt\nRight so how much fun as it for you to be publishing a new book an already distancing yourself from the foundation underwriting of it\nIt it actually does it feel good because you America has been supportive of me over time and I'd rather not seem like a jerk and just about them when they've been so nice to me but this does feel like we reflective of a much bigger issue who was the critic who was fired\nHis name is Barry Lynn and he ran something called the open markets program there I'm very active opponent of monopoly in a very Frist critic of ah of Google\nWe used to have an affiliation with the New America foundation where we were kicked out of North America\nThis week on freakonomics radio we tell the rest of that messy story at\nNo point did Google or any ... tell me to fire Barry land\nAnd we look at how corporations use philanthropy to shape the public debate and how that can go terribly wrong\n[noise]\nGuess freakonomics radio show that explores the inside of everything [noise] here's your house even now [noise]\n[noise]\nBarry Lynn started out as journalists I worked in Venezuela and in Peru as a foreign correspondent and then after that I rent a magazine called global business magazine we should say it was a pro business magazine\nWe were a magazine that aimed at the people who ran businesses so we had a real inside look at how global positioning actually works at the institutional level\nThat inside look led to lend crossing over to the other side he came to believe that corporations are too powerful and that their power to concentrated this was a theme he pursued in a couple of books and since two thousand two with the New America foundation his project came to be known as the open markets Institute\nWe got the work going and we did it uh with increasing effect over the last seven years to the point where in twenty sixteen we had a number of folks on the hill is starting to understand that indeed America has a monopoly problem and the first person who sort of really reached out and said\nI Want to actually sort of help shine a light on this problem was a Senator Warren and are the result was a speech that she gave on Capitol Hill\nSenator Elizabeth Warren speech was part of a conference organized by the open markets Institute it was called America's monopoly problem today in America competition is dying\nWas probably the most important speech about concentration in the United states\nEach about concentration in the United states about the monopoly problem since\nSeries of speeches that FDR gave in the Nineteen thirties\nGoogle apple and Amazon provide platforms that lots of companies depend on for survival but Google apple and Amazon also in many cases compete with a small companies so that platform can become a tool to snuff out competition\nAnd she said you know this is it's not just an issue that affects us as consumers it also affects our democracy because it's this concentration of power that leaves two concentrations of wealth and concentrations of wealth lead to concentrations of control over government and other institutions of authority\nThis line of criticism would seem to be pretty much in sync with the mission of not only the open market Institute but also its parent organization the New America foundation\nIn my own scholarship I've written about monopolies and risks of consolidation and data ownership\nThat's Anne Marie slaughter the former State Department official in Princeton professor who's now president and CEO of New America\nWhat convinced me to\nLeave Princeton and and become head of New America which was a big move 'cause I had a a wonderful position at at Princeton\nOr was this idea that we really could be a place that hosted fundamental debates about our future and the digital age\nBut as Barry Lynn tells the story New America didn't share his enthusiasm for the conference he put together where Senator Warren spoke well a few\nFor the conference he put together where Senator Warren spoke\nWell a few people in my organization New America were not happy with the way we're framing the conference and the fact that we were focusing some of our attention on the platform monopolies and especially on Google\nWhat was wrong with focusing on Google in a conference about monopoly after all they do own some Ninety percent of the global search market\nOr I guess the the questions was um\nWas our work a new American problematic for Google Google ... uh Eric Schmidt who is the now the chair of the board at Google was also for a long time on the New America board and then for a period of time served as chair of our board\nEric Schmidt was the chairman of Google and its renamed parent company alphabet for several years he stepped down in early two thousand Eighteen after our interview with Barry Lynn\nFor years Smith was also CEO of Google he's also given New America a lot of money both personally and through his family foundation so did Google itself\nBetween Schmidt and Google New America had received roughly twenty million dollars since its founding in Nineteen Ninety nine\nSo there was a relationship between our two organizations and this is a relationship that goes back to the very early days at New America and actually had never seemed to result in any kind of problems at New America up to this point\nBut now it seems there was a problem we're Schmidt and or Google leaning on New America as Lynn's critique of the company grew more intense a year after the New America conference where Senator Warren spoke against Google's domination European antitrust regulators hit Google with a ...\nAgainst Google's domination European antitrust regulators hit Google with a huge fine to point seven billion dollars for allegedly tilting search results in its own favor\nNot long after that in June of two thousand Seventeen Barry Lynn posted a statement on the New America website it congratulated European regulators forgiving Google such a good spanking and urged American regulators do the same\nYeah we released this statement in support of the decision in Europe and that was on June twenty seventh and on June twenty ninth I was told that my entire team had to leave and we had two months to leave\nOne natural conclusion to draw was at Google had stepped in and asked New America to do something about Barry Lynn indeed that's how it was portrayed in New York Times they're headline read Google critic ousted from think tank funded by the tech giant\nAnd at that point I you know ask for this decision to reconsider known and if it could not be reconsidered I ask for more time and I was told that neither of those was possible\nThe writer Franklin for who happens to sit on the board of Barry Lynn's open markets Institute told us simpler version of events he made it clear that lens statement about the European regulators decision\nThis was something that was a bit too far for Google and New America was very generous in supporting me and they never did anything to interfere with my own work but I was fairly are outraged by their treatment\nOf very and I can't resign from New America because I'm not affiliated with I'm not taking any money from them now but I'm extremely disappointed\nAny money from them now but I'm extremely disappointed\nBut Anne Marie slaughter offered a substantially different portrayal first of all she says no\nFunder at New America has ever influenced New America content in any way and\nThis New America has a set of principles on our website that makes very clear that the no funding can affect the integrity of our research or and or or or shape the research in any way we we do not pay to play\nUh we we take funding uh and we do our work and those two things are are separate\nBut the timing of lens firing certainly gave the appearance that Google indoor Eric Schmidt had asked to slaughter and or the New America foundation to get rid of Barry Lynn and his open markets Institute and slaughter found yourself on the defense\nAt no point did Google or any funder only to fire Barry Lynn and no point in Google or any fund or try to influence the work of anybody here and if any fighter every didn't tell me that\nWas the Stanford political scientist Robert ... we also heard from Anne Marie slaughter Barry Lynn and Franklin for

for what Americans called the British Open the oldest and arguably most\nWhich is so difficult it's often called ... ... also hosted the open back in Nineteen Ninety nine\nThe golf course was so hard that it inevitably it was going to give us some bizarre conclusion\nThat Randall sampling he played on the PGA Tour for Fifteen Years now he's an analyst for the golf channel there was going to be a train wreck at some point and yet on the tournaments final day on the final hole stood a man who tamed Savage course\nThe gold thing goes with the weather this way with this will be interesting to see what he does not\nThis man John band developed with one holds a play called the three stroke lead\nHe would've been the first Frenchman in over a hundred years to have won the open championship and there was a sense infringement don't win majors Frenchmen paint beautiful paintings and they write books about democracy and revenge they don't win the open championship\nStanding on the final tea with the three stroke lead if you're a professional golfer you will not lose that tournament\nHow ludicrous would that be imagine a professional chef she's about to make an omelet\nGoes to crack an egg on the side of the bowl but instead she says how misses the bowl entirely smashes the egg all over her face that's ludicrous it would be to lose a golf tournament standing on the last the with the three shots lead\nIt would require a grotesque combination of decisions and actions there's a word for this and that is such a horrific where some people don't even like to say it loud\nLoud we're not one of those people yeah there's lots of different ways people can joke and it doesn't have to be you know the Olympic Games that can be when you're parallel parking and people around you are watching rate\n[noise]\nIf we're going to talk about choking we probably need to bring in some psychologists\nI'm ... and I'm a professor of psychology at Florida State university here in Tallahassee, Florida\nAnders Ericson pioneer of the deliberate practice movement and the ten thousand hours idea that's been studying expert performers for years\nBallet dancers gymnast and all sorts of athletes we've looked at chess experts surgeons doctors teachers musicians taxi drivers recreational activities like golf and even there is some research on on scientists\nDefined choking for me as you see it\nOr choking to me is is actually somebody who cramps up an an and in some ways becomes unable to in a really act appropriately in the situation or or acts and a very decreased performance\nI've defined choking as the worst performance than you'd expect from an individual given that there is a high pressure stakes associated with the situation and that's the on by luck I'm a cognitive scientist and I am president of Barnard College at Columbia University\nBefore coming to Bernard by luck ran the human performance lab at the University of Chicago She also wrote a book called joke\nSo I'm curious to know if you can sort of\n[noise] so I'm curious to know if you can sort of rank the different domains that people engaging regularly and we're we're most likely to choke\nI really think that any situation where there's expectations for success can cause choking and it doesn't have to be you know the Olympic Games that can be when you're parallel parking and people around you are watching right or if you're in an elevator and\nYou're trying to figure out whether you're going to say something to the person next [laughter] you know we talk about these ethics moments of choking but it's a desire to perform at our best and situations in which were evaluated happening constantly\nGive me a little bit on\nThe characteristics of those who are more and less prone to choke what about high IQ versus low IQ\nIn my research and in others we've uh shown perhaps counter intuitively that individuals who have the most ability to focus the most working memory the most fluid intelligence or actually more prone to perform poorly under stress and the idea is that\nIf you normally devote lots of cognitive resources to what you're doing and being in a pressure filled situation robs you of those resources you can't perform as well\nYou've just described all the reasons why I'm not very good at playing golf under pressure [laughter]\nAnd then let me just ask you one more kind of summary about surroundings um talk about choking in a what you might call a friendly environment versus a hostile environment\nThere's research showing that when you have um friendly faces in front of you people who are supportive although that could feed\nThe research into why there's such a strong home field advantage in most sports those possible explanation is that referees are subconsciously influenced by the home crowd and may make one or two key calls in home teams favor the research also showed that on balance athletes\nThemselves do not perform better in front of the home crowd and in fact we see on ... tells us that friendly\nFaces may actually create pressure filled situations have to wonder if some dimensions they might perform even worse\nMy mind the research interests are behavioral economics ... mix\nThat's Alex ... he's an economist at the University of St gallon in Switzerland\nHe recently coauthored a paper called choking under pressure in front of a supportive audience evidence from professional biathlon that is the sport combining cross country skiing with precision rifle shooting\n... analyzed the performance of more than four hundred by athletes male and female over Fifteen Years of competition including world championships and the Olympics have they do at home versus abroad\nLet's look first at the skiing portion so we find that at home by it led the ski foster home about two seconds foster okay maybe all those home cheers do spur of the athletes to ski faster about the shooting\nBoth men and women miss more shorts when competing in their home country compared to competing abroad\nListening to freakonomics radio on K U when our public radio\nAnd you can support the work we do by donating your old vehicle to K.

under pressure they consider a variety of thought processes that may be subtle and hard to measure economists look at joking but differently\nSaid that you would have paid me a million dollar if I give the best interview of the week\n... is an economist at the University of California San Diego oh that\nWould have made me very nervous that would have made me put more effort into this\nWhen we look at the incentives in comics we think about two ways in which it's going to affect us the\nFirst is that you felt pay you more you put more effort into task and the second assumption is that more effort will lead to better performance and that's not necessarily true and that's the part of choking might be that\nI can push you so much to to try so hard to do will actually backfire you'll eat perform worse\nCan easy coauthored one of the foundational economics papers on choking\nCan easy coauthored one of the foundational economics papers on choking it's called large states and big mistakes he and his colleagues ran experiments in a variety of places including India\nThe reason we wanted to go to India is that over there are money can go a long way so we went to some villages in India in which the daily wage was so low that we could offered them up to six months' salary in our experiment if they'd they'd perfectly well\nEach participant completed a series of tasks somewhere creative\nSo dead ... creative one was for example to back pieces of metal into into books in an efficient way\nSome tasks we're cognitive\nAnd memory game in which I Would read up numbers you listen to me and then at some point do say stop and then you'll have to recall the last three numbers that I mentioned and some tasks were athletic throwing a dark like ... balls so balls or on a target and and things like that\nThe payout for successful completion of the task was variable in some cases you get ten cents and others a dollar and others ten dollars\nAnd ten daughter was about what they made in the months over there I open to to agree with me to six months of pays a lot of money that would make you work much harder rides and the question was are you going to be better actually when you were Carter\nAs can easy noted earlier it's a standard assumption in labor economics the higher pay leads to more effort and the more effort leads to better performance or at least higher productivity what happened in this case when the stakes were raised all the way to ten dollars\nSo the findings were striking you see reduction in success\nThe findings were striking you see reduction in success rates across the board all six games that we played resulted in lower success rate when the incentives were really high\nFor the three digit memory game roughly forty percent of the participants succeeded under low incentives under high incentives the success rate which is twenty percent\nTo the dark ballgame the success rate under low incentives was ten percent and runs seven percent under high incentives\nFor the metal packing game under low incentives twenty five percent of the participants succeeded under high incentives nobody's succeeded or put another way at least twenty five percent of them choked\nActually were a bit surprised by this experiment because we included tasks in which we expected that effort will it will increase performance\nBut if you think about it you can see why the researchers maybe shouldn't have been so surprised in these experiments increased effort isn't simply a matter of putting in more time the way you might with an assignment at work or project at school\nIt was trying to execute the same task with and without pressure so can easy and his colleagues wanted to learn more about what sort of tasks make us succumb to pressure\nThey ran some more experiments at MIT using students as their research subjects some experiments involved simple manual tasks like punching alternating keyboard keys as fast as possible\nIt's really something that you know if you do it for long enough it's boring so he felt pay you more you'll try may be harder and we believed it more effort will actually increase your performance other tasks we're more cognitive like adding numbers and ... when you think about coming to staff could probably reach your ultimate\nLike adding numbers and ... when you think about\nComes to stuff could probably richer ultimately behavior to your best and very fast and now I find really really making it high incentives you might actually started being you know distracted\nOnce again there were low and high incentive versions of each task since a dollar doesn't go far in Massachusetts as it doesn't India the rewards here we're up to thirty dollars for the low incentive experiments and up to three hundred dollars for the high\nSo what we found is that for the keep pressing task when you increase the incentives from up to thirty dollars up to three hundred dollars they sweet for about a forty percent succeeding to eighty percent succeeding\nOn the other end when you have to add up numbers the more cognitive one we see a sharp decrease from sixty five percent to forty percent so when you actually have to put some cognitive effort into this getting day the incentive to be ridiculously high could actually be a bad idea\n[noise] this would seem to be pretty good evidence that when activities involves some thinking\nWe're more susceptible to choke or probably heard from a lot of people over the years coach and teachers and counselors of all sorts you are capable of doing some amazing things if you can only get your brain out of the way [noise]\nBut that's obviously harder than it sounds so\nHow can you do that how can you prepare yourself to not crumble under the very circumstances that matter most [noise]\nHow do we get people to focus on aspects of their performance that are going to be beneficial for success especially in those situations that are most\nOfficial for success especially in those situations that are most problematic\nSee on ... again going back to her Gulf experiments so we investigated whether going quicker for example um might help eliminate poor performance under pressure or I'm having one key swing thought that encapsulates your entire stroke\nMight be better um and we showed that some of that was successful and it leads to the opposite idea that um if you really want to mess your buddy up on on the back now you can just say hey that was a great shot what were you doing with your elbow\n[laughter] All right great said so you're helping us make people took more but [laughter] what else\nCan you tell us about in this domain at least I'm learning to joke with\nWe also showed that getting used to this type of hyper attention to detail that sometimes comes with performance can be helpful so\nReally inoculate in yourself against the high pressure situations you see this with students who practice taking time pass a\nUC this with military pilots and firefighters and people who practice under some of the types of conditions are going to perform under and you even see this if you walk by a college football stadium friday afternoon the music blaring getting the players used to what it's going to feel like to be in that big stadium um\nAnd this is true in really big important situations but it's it's also true in those little things we do every day so if you're going to give a toast at a wedding I'm practicing doing it well people are watching you um and if no one is willing to watch you videotape yourself anything that gets you used to that\nWilling to watch you videotape yourself anything that gets you used to the kinds of all eyes on you\nOkay so put yourself in realistic and stressful practice situations with him rethinking how you're feeling so we know that when people remind themselves that um that sweaty palms and beating heart aren't assign they're going to fail but a sign that they're awake and ready to go\nAnd their body is something important nutrients to their mind that can be really effective\nNow is that a charade or is that real I mean [laughter] if my palms are sweaty isn't that an indication that I Am anxious and that\nIf I just tell myself well it's not really anxiety it's really my body sending nutrients I mean is that a a self lie that I'd profit from or is that realistically you know a counter truth\nFirst of all I Will just say that I'm I I liked placebo effects and [laughter] you know I have no problem with that but I think it's a real truth because you know if your heart was impeding to some extent you'd be dead right um and those sweaty palms can be an indication that you're alert an aroused and ready to go and

Dan doctor off but don't worry if you haven't heard of doctor off he's not quite a household name\nBut his fingerprints are all over the biggest city in the United states grew up in Michigan became a New Yorker quite reluctantly it just wasn't his kind of place but\nHe settled in in his wife started raising their family here he worked in investment banking and private equity seemingly just another money harvester from the provinces who finds the urban bridges too good to pass up this went on for years\nAnd along the way I came up with this crazy idea that New York to host the Olympics and uh\nNew York hot to host the Olympics and the eventual you that that idea became a bit of a movement or it drew the attention of Mike Bloomberg with the time was just an ordinary billionaire and uh\nI don't think was even seriously thinking about running for mayor but he joined our board gave some money\nMichael Bloomberg wasn't seriously thinking about running for mayor much less being there\nWhich as you may know also describes the arc of our current president Donald Trump's run for president apparently started out as a means of enlarging the Trump brand Bloomberg's run for mayor of New York city was apparently his way enlarging Bloomberg LP the financial information company that made him rich\nBut voters well looters are funny animals Bloomberg while short on charm at a certain appeal smart self made fiercely pragmatic\nAnd he spoke his mind often to the detriment of the people he was speaking about it was the opposite of a career politician and then the twin towers were obliterated in the September eleventh terrorist attack\nLess than two months later Mike Bloomberg was elected New York's one hundred and eighth mayor\nNow Bloomberg a political neophyte facing a recovery of unknown dimensions invited some other neophyte to help\nAnd when he unexpectedly one right after nine eleven ah he asked me to join him in city hall and so I became deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding\nDan doctor off did that job for six years\nHe then asked me to go run his company which I did for seven years Bloomberg LP\nWas finally done being mayor into

for president you considered some other things too but then to the surprise of many he went back to Bloomberg LP\nAnd when he decided he wanted to come back to the company I laughed and all you know ... a tremendous relationship with him but decided I just didn't wanna go back to being his deputy mayor anymore and formed a company with Google a called sidewalk labs\nAnd that's where a doctor off can be found today a CEO of sidewalk labs whose mission is\nOur mission is really to use technology to redefine urban life and the twenty first century and we want to do it by literally building or a city or a district of a city and we have chosen Toronto to do that\nOkay let's back up to before the un doctor off was known quite [noise]\nSo you were for many years obsessed with the idea of bringing the Olympics the summer Olympics to New York city and Utah soiled first in obscurity for a while spending a lot of your own money\nA recruiting a lot of people to your cause you you got some leverage over time you got in the Bloomberg administration you were first reluctant to take that job because he thought it would curtail your limping activity but Mike Bloomberg persuade you that it actually would give you leverage\nOr you've got delayed you wanted to be two thousand they had got pushed to two thousand twelve Olympics\nUm you pursue do you pursue you pursued you traveled the world did everything you could\nFinally you were a New York was voted the U.S a city in the bed\nAnd then um ultimately lost out in the in the Iowa seeing the international Olympic ...\nThen I'm ultimately lost out in the in the Iowa seeing the international Olympic Committee\nSounds pretty nutty doesn't it\nYou know I don't mean to be dismissive of the Olympics themselves but was the Olympic bid on some level\nKind of a a stalking horse to rebuild New York city whether the Olympics came here or not and is it possible that New York perhaps benefited more from the bid for the Olympics and all the infrastructure and related benefits that have produced then they would have benefited from actually hosting it\n[noise] I wouldn't describe it as a stalking horse I Would just say that that was always part of a strategy that it was sort of the off ramp from the strategy that\nYou know the Olympics could be the catalyst to getting things done that people have been talking about for generations but never were able to muster the political will or financial resources to actually do and you could look at successful examples in the past\nAs to how they use the deadlines at the bidding for the Olympics were more likely hosting the Olympics\nCreated sort of an imperative in a city of Tokyo in Nineteen sixty four built the subway system around it\nYou know Barcelona in Nineteen Ninety two did an amazing job of recovering from being a stepchild of dread under Franco for decades and revitalizing the city\nYou're leaving out that the counter examples like Athens but I mean it's not quite a science of what kind of regional will benefit from\nIt all depends on the planning and it depends on the economic resources and other things but I convinced myself\nThat we're in New York was in its development cycle having that kind of catalyst could be a really important thing and we use the deadline of the Olympic decision to get massive reads\nKind of the Olympic decision to get massive reads owning done in time et cetera et cetera\nNow the second question you asked was or we better off having now one and there I think the answer is no because I think we could have used another seven years of deadlines to get more stuff done for\n... subway today if we constantly well right now\nI think that might have had a real impact right we could have argued look all these people are coming I think it could have been a deadline to getting for example congestion pricing done but at the end of the day you know much of what we wanted to do as part of the Olympic plan and that was re developing the waterfront\nYou know in Brooklyn or queens or the whole west side of Manhattan or the high line or regeneration in Coney Island in Harlem and flushing\nAreas that had been largely ignored for a long period of time got a big boost from the fact that we bid for the Olympics\nI Love you to give me Dan in just a minute or two what you would consider the best accomplishments of the Bloomberg administration\nToday one of his projects at the moment is a new cultural center on the west side of Manhattan called the shed of which Dr off chairman and president\nBush said I'm just curious about the the why ... why\nDid New York city need another arts complex you I understand are not exactly a performing arts fiend at least\nWell the origin of it actually dates back to when we re planned the west side of Manhattan which we did and in two separate parts one part of it was in West Chelsea in the core of it was to save the high line\nThe second part was to a bill what's called Hudson Yards which is this area on the far west side of Manhattan and uh we decided at the intersection of the high line in Hudson Yards we want\nWe decided at the intersection of the high line in Hudson Yards we wanted to have a cultural institution we set to standards for one it should be unlike anything else in New York which is hard 'cause there's twelve hundred cultural institutions in New York\nAnd secondly that it should play a role in keeping New York on the leading edge culturally in the world\nAnd so we eventually had an insight about the role of technology and the role that it's playing and reshaping the cultural ecosystem\nThat led us to conclude that what New York needed was a completely different kind of institution one that would be the most flexible but pro grammatically a and physically\nRight so this is a building that kind of can be recon figure like a transformer something yes\nIt's exactly right it's like a transformer it's really remarkable the building literally moves a and it will open up a in March twenty ninth is what we're targeting two thousand Nineteen and it may be one of the largest cultural start ups of all time\nAnd the c._e._o. of telling him to Alex boots or ran for many years in Manchester international festival which again is unusual in that it takes place or took place at least all over the city not in set theaters\nFrom what I can gather the shed seems to be a sort of um you know professionalized gorilla operation in a way right it's got a lot of the experimental is some of the experimental arts movement with kind of the the juice and leverage of a big city like New York\nA great way of saying you know another way of expressing his cultural festival every day because there's multiple spaces that can be recon figured that can accommodate virtually any cultural discipline I mean look at our basic view whether it's with respect to culture whether it's with you\nOur basic view whether it's with respect to culture or whether it's with respect to city building is\nNobody smart enough to predict the future so you cannot plan\nTo the detail or even sort of the gross level what's gonna happen in the future instead what you can do is create the infrastructure that might be physical it might be digital might be some ground rules et cetera\nThat enable people to project their own ideas and innovations onto it as taste technologies trends began to change I think that is a very different notion of the cultural institution as well as city building\nI find it and I mean zero disrespect by this but I find it interesting that of all the things that attracts people to New York city these days outsiders visitors\nThe high line is among the most popular it was proposed to be turned into this you know public park and strolling area and you are not a big supporter of it not that you are so hard against it\nBut it's just a striking reminder illustration I guess to me and\nYou and your folks around you who are obviously doing the central infrastructure planning you couldn't have possibly predicted that something like that and his humble as the high line for God's sake and it's an abandoned freight line would turn into this thing that has so much appeal and I'm just curious what kind of lesson that taught\nWhen I came into city hall um the high line was really one court decision away from being torn down and the Giuliani administration which had proceeded us was really intent on ripping it down because the landowners who own land under the high line really\nDown a because the landowners who owned land under the high line really were really pressuring the Giuliani administration to get rid of it\nAnd you know there were some of us in the administration and immediately saw what the two young guys who would basically kept it alive saw which is that this could be a beautiful park and amenity I\nWill confess I didn't see that right away um but the key point is is that you know you seize opportunities as you see them and as they evolve and if you're flexible enough to do that then ultimately you can create something that might be amazing\nI mean the the paradox and that is flexibility is not a hallmark of government isn't\nWell generally is not because government is really hard um and just getting anything done and often takes extraordinary effort\nOr but it should be a on some level a hallmark of government at the same time you have to have a sense for what you want to do and so you have to\nCombine sort of this openness with a determination to get things done or else nothing ever happens you know one of the principles that we always operated with is that look we're competitive entity in New York and whether we were competing with\nLondon or Los Angeles or Jersey City to be honest you know we can't make policy that puts us at a competitive disadvantage\nLet me ask you about that competition between whether it's far away cities are are near a city you in the Bloomberg administration made it a point to change policy and stop throwing a lot of money at firms are institutions that\nStop throwing a lot of money at firms are institutions that threatened to leave the using that kind of standard financial incentive\nBut I'm curious what effect that zero sum competition has on each area because you know in some dimensions I'd imagine the competition is healthy right on the other hand firms and institutions can end do game the system\nAnd basically skim a bunch of taxpayer money for their own purposes so what's the best way to balance that and still incentivized firms in institutions to be where they can do the most good\nOur view was that financial incentives or to lure companies or more importantly keep them was almost always a fool's errand we did a lot of work when we first came in the economy was just on its back\nAnd we were facing enormous budget deficits so the easy temptation would have been to bribe companies to stay or bribe companies to calm ah we met with CEOs of companies all over the country and all over the world in addition to in New York we analyze their cost structures\nIn great detail and eventually what we concluded was companies are going to do what's in their economic interest over the long run and that providing these sorts of incentives was like giving a crack\nBut the crack was ultimately going to affect the dealer more than the user\nAnd so it just didn't make a lot of sense and so we just stopped instead the way we'd compete was based on our natural strengths which we thought we could enhance and our number one natural strength was that New York um had been a haven\nNumber one natural strength was that New York um had been a haven for papal from all over the world you know it was sort of the optimistic sense that produced this incredible energy I'm that attracted companies to New York and we ought to build off of that\nMost places have some sort of competitive advantage but they got to be honest about what it was and so that for us was really what the strategy became [noise]\nYeah you got to be true to yourself um that's one of the things that I consistently preached to leaders in cities around the country and around the world\nYou know cities are like people um or maybe like companies they have personalities they have strengths and weaknesses\nYou know you know how hard it is to change your own personality it's hard to change the city's personality but that doesn't mean you can't you know structure around your strengths and structure around your weaknesses\nRural rural\nCity unlike people reading companies\nCan be as we noted earlier difficult to retrofit not just physically all those buildings that transportation and energy infrastructure but also psychic clean culturally economically which is why doctors concluded you would be really interesting to start the city from scratch two dozen Fifteen\nHe teamed up with Google to create a company called sidewalk labs\nAnd our mission is to really help to redefine urban life or in the twenty first century combining cutting edge innovation with great urban planning and the way we want to do that is by demonstrating to the world what that can be\nAnd the way we want to do that is by demonstrating to the world what that can be in a specific place\nAnd so we have chosen Toronto uh for a variety of great reasons give me a few great reasons well uh one is they have a remarkable piece of land on their waterfront the second is that\nGas companies are far bigger richer\nThe gas companies are far bigger richer and arguably more dominant than tech companies in the past\nGoogle for instance has Ninety percent of global search engine market share Facebook has more than ... billion monthly active users Amazon has an estimated Ninety five million prime members in the U.S that something like Seventy five percent\nAll American households it's estimated almost fifty percent of all online spending goes to Amazon this kind of scale creates a lot of concern we've examined this concern in previous episodes like\nWho runs the Internet and use the Internet being ruined we're seeing the birth of new center of power real power\nWe depend on these technologies that have been in many ways wonderful and fascinating but they're making significant decisions you know laterally there's also the question of whether the mission of these firms is as socially beneficial\nAs many people believed they were in the early days the Internet there's old is really smart\nEngineers there the brightest computer scientists and all they're thinking about is how do I keep someone on Facebook for ten more minutes was the exact combination of things that will keep them stay on the site as long as possible\nSo that we can show them as much advertisement as possible\n[noise] so here's a question if you are one of those huge dominance super wealthy for what would you do to ensure that the good times steak [noise]\nProbably spend a lot of money lobbying politicians which yes they do it's been a huge ramping up lately and lobbying by ... [noise] but\nThey do there's been a huge ramping up lately and lobbying like tech for [noise] but you may also do something a bit subtler\nStory today begins with a journalist\nI'm Franklin for a writer with the Atlantic\nYou are one of three brothers who write books are talking about that for just a minute and the family that produced all of you\nRight so I have two brothers Johnathan he's written a good number of novels including everything is illuminated and I got a younger brother named Josh who is a science writer who wrote a book called moon walking\nWith Weinstein and it's actually\nIncredibly uncomfortable for us to talk about growing up in a family of other writers just because ah I'm sure it in some ways we benefit from the novelty act of being three brotherly writers but then we all of course want to be known for her own accomplishments right but uh you know\nOur parents didn't do anything they didn't force us to play violin or four hours a day and or or sit down and study the great chest masters [laughter] we watched a lot of he man an Addams family reruns on television when we were growing up\nBut one of the things that they did was they gave us a credit card which they said we weren't allowed to stand essentially on anything except in the event of an incredible emergency and there was one exception to this which is that they said that we could basically spend the credit card that will let the bookshop\nAnd so they basically guided us to one thing\nYour first job in journalism was slate one of the very first mainstream online publications would just start by Microsoft and so there was a huge enthusiasm certainly among the chattering classes\nThere was a certain amount of utopian isn't associated\nClasses there was a certain amount of utopian isn't associated with the emergence of the Internet this idea that we were going to tie the world together\nI Love search engines I Love the fact that I can access every\nBook in human history in and out of a second I Love that I can get things delivered to my door incredibly quickly and these things arguably make life much better\nAnd maybe in arguably make life much better so these technologies were incredible Amazon is an incredible company the Kindle is an incredible invention the pad and yeah and the iPhone were incredible innovations and so I think we were right to marvel at them so after\nRating for sleep for a while you moved on to the New Republic or as you call it the intellectual Oregon for hard nosed liberalism you ultimately became editor they're not once but twice\nSo the New Republic with this little magazine that always had outsized influence in politics and culture it was an incredibly elitist Oregon and managed to persist over a hundred years well never really turning a profit and so as\nWe entered the Internet age that became a more and more difficult thing to continue to do and so we ended up shifting from one ownership group to the next and\nI got so exhausted trying to find an owner and kind of sick of that I ended up\nResigning his editor but then a couple of years after I resigned the magazine got bought by a guy called Chris Hughes who'd been mark soccer birds roommate at Harvard and co founder of Facebook and he bought the magazine and to me it just seems like almost too good to be true\nTo me it just seems like almost too good to be true or that you had this guy who understood social media\nWho had incredible number of resources and seemed devoted to this little magazine that I was also devoted to and so I came back and I edited the magazine and Christian I Try to remake it\nAnd their relationship in the beginning seemed like it was unbelievably good\nYeah we became really good friends and it was exhilarating we felt like we were trying to save something that was imperiled in the world and that maybe we can help provide some sort of dignified solution to the rest of journalism which was grappling with a lot of the same issues that we were grappling with\nBut there was a moment when things just took this turn which was that Chris\nDecided that he'd always talked about wanting to make a profit with the New Republic and he suddenly decided that he didn't want to lose at least not lose a whole lot of money with it and so we had to turn around our financial position incredibly quickly and so\nHe insisted that we start chasing cliques in two thousand Thirteen Fisher is way to get clicks was to post a clip from last night's Daily Show with John Stewart and you slap a headline on it and he may be ready to a couple of sentences about it and everybody would click on it\nAnd you got caught up in at least monitoring the numbers right\nYes I did um look data is crack cocaine and if you're the guy who had a hard time getting a date in high school to suddenly find yourself producing things that are extremely popular you become obsessed with replicating that popularity in ... in some ways everybody in the magazine wanted to be seen\nYou know in some ways everybody in the magazine wanted to be successful on Facebook we wanted to master social media and this new environment but we didn't want that new environment to dictate how we did our jobs\nAll right so we should say that you ended up getting will you ended up quitting as you were about to be fired from the New Republic\n[laughter] yeah so um you know I I took the brave decision to resign what I learned that there was some guy who already had my job and was offering other people jobs at the New Republic it's\nFunny you're describing what was happening to you at the New Republic but it sounds as though you're also perhaps describing\nYour view of what happened at places like Google and Facebook over time where you may begin with a certain set of motivations but as those motivations lead you to this overwhelming commercial success you're so seduced by the magnitude of that success that you can't help but want to replicate it over and over again\nThat's completely right I felt like it in retrospect I realized that I was just living this compressed version of recent history\n[noise] the reason the history of the Internet at least over the years Franklin for his view of the Internet it shifted the same guy who used to think this\nThere was a certain amount of your tokenism associated with the emergence of the Internet and this I Love search engines and this the technologies were incredible and Amazon is an incredible company has now come\nTo think this Amazon thinks of itself as the everything store and it's gotten itself in a pretty much every conceivable business it owns whole foods\nEvery conceivable business it owns whole foods it powers the cloud or it has this data for the CIA and so on and so on and there's really nothing that it doesn't try to squeeze into its empire he also thinks this as Facebook\nShapes the way that we consume news as Google shapes the way that we interact with information and there's Amazon has shaped the way that we interact with books\nThe dominance that these companies exert ends up trickling through the cultural intellectual ecosystem and with Amazon my concern is that the book business has become utterly dependent on them that they hold one of the future of monopoly is in the world\nActually it's not quite true my name is ... that I teach at Princeton one course she teaches the economics of Internet the existence of a monopoly of a single so I mean any product space unless it's a government granted monopoly is\nRare in the digital economy so even though Amazon has\nFor instance at least Seventy percent of ebook sales that doesn't make it a monopoly technically no because that leaves thirty percent for some others had to firms\nWhen describing firms like Amazon Google and Facebook bought prefers the term ...\nYes there is a difference being not suggest that it's simply a large from where is a monopoly suggest that
