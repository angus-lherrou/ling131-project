R. A. W. L. which is another kind of fishing we throw it a wide net and see what comes in and so that further kind of pollutes our understanding of the origins of this term but\nFortunately this one has been fairly well research I find some new things every time I looked into it because new things digitized\nResearch I find some new things every time I looked into it because new things to digitize

words\nKatrina calling from Williamsburg, Virginia Hi Katrina welcome\nHave a way with words where they say is Katrina calling from Williamsburg, Virginia\nKatrina welcome what can we do for you\nI Am calling to find out if you are saying that fed to describe something that was previously spoken about its proper for instance if I told you I was like at a farmer's market to buy vegetables I could send you a picture of the vegetables with the caption fad vegetables so\nThat makes sense yeah mhm said ... you said on his way to refer to like you said something that was spoken about in the past is this a construction that you're likely to use\nWell I'm kinda new to social media and I see it everywhere like my sister post stuff are often stopped or heard about things that we\nYou know pictures or something that we've spoken about before and she'll say that about ... but I don't want to do it and sound crazy so I was just calling to find out can I use it or is it just something that like occurring right now\nWell it's certainly a legitimate usage as the usage of said to me ... the aforementioned thing or the uh for said the thing goes back about seven hundred years in English loud and really really really old I'm not really aware of it being used um\nUh in terms of of something casual like that so\nYeah it's usually more formally definitely will see legal documents particularly when there's a\nDiscourse or discussion where somebody was mentioned in a previous part of the doctor the legal document mhm the other part of it is I could see somebody doing it ironically and certainly the Internet or bones and people doing things ironically they wouldn't otherwise to\nRight yeah that was my sense of it I mean are are you trying to be funny when you do it or you\nDon't know it's kind of just like a way to describe like instead of saying these are the vegetables I told you about earlier you could just say\nScribes like instead of saying it or the vegetables I told you about earlier you could just say that basketball so I didn't know if my property is it that way\nI like it it sounds ironic yeah it sounds like there is a tone mismatch is what it is and that's a a little bit of comedy that we often turned to language where in an informal situation we use formal speech and we all kind of get a little I don't know a hormone jolt or something because we've added to the match it it makes sense but the match isn't\nYou're listening to the way with words they show that language and how we use it I might the by net and I'm grandparent and we're joined by John Jeanette ... guy John\nHi grant Hi Martha yellow high you know I'm In Alice in wonderland Lewis Carroll introduced this or rather weird unanswerable question that's a classic rental housing or even like a writing desk\nNow do either of you know in an answer to that if you've heard it's would prefer before I'm sure All right but I Do no good answer except I'm ones like the other only done one of their basic English words the both English words simulate one said poll wrote on both\nOver a Carol and Carol himself said both can produce a few notes though there are very flat\nYeah so but in any case there it was meant to be a sort of a nonsense question in any case I have another question for you\nHow was a popular song like a butterfly net\nIt's catchy yes it's actually very good\nSo the following question to follow the same pattern one thing's describe bubble by an adjective that ends and why the other can be too but in a different way\nOkay All right I think you've got it you know they're both catch e now this one's kind of classic how was scotch tape like a walking cane they're both ... they're both sticky yes how was the four seasons hotel\nKatie they're both sticky yes how was the four seasons hotel like a grade school teacher\n... last year it was very good I was an old fashioned car like a mean old man\nOf cranky\n[laughter] I'm so glad you guys getting right into the

S. O. L. A. S. T. A. L. G. I. N. E. refers to a form of psychic or existential distressed that's caused by environmental change or a change to uplift\nIt'll change or a change to a place that you know well and have taken comfort and it was coined by Australian philosopher Glenn Albrecht in two thousand three is is like ... but it also combines the words solace and desolate\nAnd the idea is that um say your your town was destroyed by wildfire or um or your your home in Appalachia was destroyed by a strip mining mhm or you you see an environmental situation that's getting worse and worse and maybe the Arctic\nMelting or something like that ...\nIs the term that more and more people in the field of a philosophy and the psychology or using\nSo it's the loss of something that you want sought solace and yes exactly and so the the feeling that you get on these things start to disappear\nYeah particularly in your environment and I guess it could be like um you know you go back to your own neighborhood and the buildings are gone\nRight now right what's an empty lot better now and other Starbucks yeah sell us down to eight seven seven nine to nine nine six seven three oh you have a way with words\nHello this is Monica I'm calling from Tallahassee, Florida I monitor will come to the show and I had to be here [laughter] I'm so recently I was reading bedtime\nStories for my kids and you\nKnow we check out a lot of books from the library and I I make an effort to check out books that represent a lot of different cultures 'cause I Want to expose them to a lot of different kinds of people and um you know I I was reading this book called fluffy and Fox [noise]\nI'm thinking about how does one read in dialect that does not your own dialect [noise] um [noise]\nSaturday and Sunday November fourth [noise]\nAt pioneer center to get a bill\nYou're listening to a way with words the show about language and how we use it I'm grandparents in March the Barnett\nBorn in London in Seventeen Seventy two Luke Howard was a shy chemist who was also really fascinated by weather and particularly by clouds he wants to organize how we understand and observed as ever changing formations up in this tiny wanted to do it in a way that was scientific\nAnd Eighteen oh three he's self published a pamphlet that he called on the modifications of clouds et cetera in it he proposed the classification system for clouds and he drew on his school boy Latin\nFor clouds in he drew on his school boy Latin and came up with the main categories which were serious strata and cumulus now serious comes from the Latin for hair or temporal strategist comes from the Latin for layer and cumulus is like a pile you know like accumulate\nAnd this new way of looking at clouds in these new names in this whole new language for talking about something that everybody had always seen but never really classify that way it hit a nerve in the popular imagination and look Howard became this reluctant scientific celebrity\nIs not quite sure was championed by some of the greatest minds of his time especially the influential German poet gr to gr to win so far as to write poems based on those names\nAnd some people criticized Howard for using Latin rather than everyday spoken English and gr to wrote a passionate response or on Howard's behalf\nAnd he argued that those Latin cloud name should be accepted in all languages they should not be translated because in that way the first intention of the inventor and founder of them is destroyed and he even went on to send Howard gushing fan mail which is kind of hard to imagine today\nThe story of all of this is told by historian Richard hamblin in the book the invention of clouds how an amateur meteorologist\nForged the language of the skies and in fact if you go to his home in London there's a historical marker that says Luke Howard name or of clouds lived and died here are all of them may not have clouds little we all remember when we come up with a word we won the claim recognition\nRemember when we come up with a word we won the claim recognition that knowledge right going to be part of history right and he got that ... is your fan yeah I Know I met any of my ... eyes with heart the letters to Howard [laughter]\nYeah forget the house [laughter] I\nNever knew that story I just I just thought some scientists came up with yeah these names but we still use them today yeah absolutely\nAnd they're not intact and other languages right they are modified to fit the different languages that they\n... actually I don't know that there is a pretty clear system of classification of clouds and I don't know it's always I like how it\nPlugs into in the development of meteorology as a as a science where we started to realize that some of those old solves about the red sky or when I had a little bit of truth and we could look at the sky to see what was going to happen a little later with\nOur weather exactly trace this guy with a painters fresh the wins around using little rushed talking about serious clown yeah\nAnd what I also love about this is that\nIt was a way of using language to impose order on something that didn't seem to have any order it seems that Luke Howard was was someone who who saw differences in clouds and saw patterns and indeed um began meteorology that way\nOften thought that if there were another species on this planet had the same kind of active intelligence as humans that they might actually call us a word that means the class of fires\nBecause that is so much of what humans do we sort organized we classify and if you were to think about our primary behavior a lot of it has to do with all the things that we say things that we ...\nA lot of it has to do is that the things that we say the things that we produce how we organize ourselves in our community so it's about setting these boundaries and think this is a box and all those things of this type go in that box I\nHate to classify as you say really likes and then of course the language is key to that rain ... making sense of the world we love language and if you come across the patches the talks about language in a way that you really enjoy we want to know and we want to share it with our other listeners centered along\nEmails words at ... dot org and you can link to it on Twitter ...

Shelley the poet all these people were inspired by this whole idea of classifying a clouds and Percy ... Shelley wrote a poem called the cloud and it's long so I'm not going to read the whole thing but I'm getting read the first ah stanza which will give you a taste of it\nI bring fresh showers for the third ... flowers\nFrom the seas and streams I barely light shade for the leaves when late and their new day dreams\nFrom my wings are shaking the abuse that wake in the sweet buds everyone when rocked to rest on their mothers breast and she dances about the sun\nI we owns the ... of the lashing hail and white and the green planes under and then again I dissolve it didn't rain and laugh as I pass in thunder\nAnd it's so beautiful and rhythmic and so much imagery and and should be a poem that's taught when you're talking about personification in English class it's really a lovely upon that goes on and on and that's prejudice Shelley and the ... at the clouds the clouds\nAnd that's pretty sheepishly and oppose colds and the clouds the clouds thinks Martha those beautiful colas eight

seven three email words that we would radio dot org hello you're on the way with words\nAt my name is ... and I'm from Indianapolis, Indiana\nWelcome to the show how can we help you\nThe phrase that my grandmother used to use a she grew up in North Carolina and she would say crazy as a Betsy bug\nCrazy isn't bad see bugs [laughter] and how crazy that\nThing because it was never like if someone made her laugh she wouldn't say oh you know some people say oh you're so crazy or something like that she would never use it in that way it was if somebody was doing something that she thought was stupid\nOh man she was saying that part of it as crazy as a busy bugs [laughter]\n\nAnd I I haven't heard it much um I spent some time and when I was a child in North Carolina I heard it there but as far as north I've not heard even from people who've come from the same region\nUh-huh and have you heard the term ... get all\nNow and I have no idea I Know I should I should look that up more but I have no idea what a Pepsi [laughter]\nWell we can tell what a bad seed bug is it's um it's a kind of beetle it also goes by the name patent leather beetle which kind of gives you an idea it's it's kinda bad as big as your thumb and and black and shiny sometimes called the horned beetle\nBut it's also called abet sea bug or best bug or a messy bug\nAnd um you see the phrase crazy is Betsy bug or\nThe phrase crazy is Betsy bug or different variations of that uh throughout the south and nobody really knows why a ... might be considered crazy except it does make an interesting sand is kind of like a you know when you disturb it it makes it kind of\nReally like a little like I had when you when it gets annoyed with you\nKnow like\nThat kind of a you know kind of a ... you know they're pretty sizable and I'm In the beautiful black patent leather looking thing\nI guess that's why it's crazy because other bugs don't talk to you [laughter]\nYeah you don't really see them swarming I'd only seen them you know just wandering around kinda [laughter] well maybe maybe you're right I read a sting [laughter]\nSo that's where there were there for a ... and that's why I wanted that that's why I said it wasn't when she knew there was quite the opposite when she was just wonderful\nI say I'm going to be I was really bloody recall ... spoke with us today thank you so much I'm so happy lives spoken with both of you okay we're going to work and I keep listening as well thanks who I thought I was only hello you have a way with words\nHello this is Joe from Wilson, Wyoming\nJoe said welcome to the show how can we help you\nI have a question about from par or under par when it's used as a Gulf term on her part or as a desirable thing\nFor states that you want to find yourself in that in almost every other endeavor that I can think of being under par or is not something you want to find yourself being\nRight right right All right\nYou want to find yourself being [laughter] right right right All right so we can explain this there are two different scales here two different measuring scales\nAnd so what you need to remember is that each\nSport has its own way of considering something a really great score are really good score for example if you got to sixty nine in golf that's usually pretty good if you got a sixteen in basketball people that are not a very good game you get a sixty nine of baseball people were like forget\nYour [laughter] to having to learn city rather [laughter] to go to a store [laughter] All right\nSo we're talking about different measuring the scales for each part of life not just sports and golf has to really interesting thing where they start with an agreed upon number said say sixty nine and you go a little bit above are a little bit below but that number is considered standard are par the number that up professional\nProbably could reach on this course ... given sufficient time and expertise and and some experience on that course so so golf is a scale that's low to high and some with low being better and so many other things most of the rest of the things in life\nAre the scale is high to low was hiding better and so it's just that court so we're still talking about part of being standard average or this\nThis police that we're going to compare ourselves against it just it it's golf you need a low score and everything else almost you need a high score oh that's interesting the sub par that we use in everyday life actually doesn't come from golf it's just golf borrowed its power from regular English and the regular ... to standard usage of par\nWe're ... the number that you're going to try to beat and go above them so it's a path\nJoseph thank you for your call we really appreciate it\nThank you Bye bye already have a language has its ... butts\nBut I already have a\nLanguage has its core sports oh it's just an extra thing worse\nSeems to go one more beyond ordinary in making a language its own for each individual sport right and adding to our language and then and then it's like when your back yard yeah turn it the feedback loop continues to back into the mainstream language\nWe should say that part comes from the Latin for equal and I thought you know you're on a par with somebody you're equal with him ... eight seven seven Ninety nine nine six seven three\n\nSmith from rancho pallas Verde California wrote to us with a family word uh her daughter pips you enjoy jazz recordings she especially loved the singer elephant Gerald\nProud sponsor of all things Reno\nEspecially tell you when our\nYou're listening to way with words the show about language and how we use it I'm grant beret and Martha Burnett\nThe last time you really listen to silence I've been thinking about that ever since reading a passage from a book by Paul Goodman called speaking in language here's what he has to say about silence\nNot speaking in speaking are both human ways of being in the world and there are kinds in grades the beach\nThere's the dumb silence of slumber or apathy this sober silence that goes with the solemn animals face the fragile silence of awareness past hearing the soul went to merge new thoughts the active silence of alert perception ready to say this this\nThe musical silence that accompanies absorbed activity\nThe silence of listening to another speak catching the drift in helping him be clear\nThe noisy silence of resentment and self recrimination loud and sub vocal speech but cell and to say it\nBaffled silence\nThe silence of peaceful accord with other person's or communion\nPeaceful accord with other person's or communion with the cosmos and I was struck by that passage I just keep thinking about it because it really lays out lots of different kinds of silence mhm and when do we ever get to hear silence to begin with\nTrue silence not less noise right in the silent right I don't think we do\nOne of the things that I have read about in the last couple of years is the parts of speech that our silence\nWhere we think of language is being but talking part of the language is also the part where we stopped talking it's also the part where we leave a space for ourselves or for others to pick up the thread or to continue the conversation that silence is just as important as the assurances\nMhm yeah when I Do improv it's you know one has a compulsion to keep talking but sometimes the most powerful moments are when you're completely quiet\nThat compulsion to keep talking is deal cop and journalists tricked right where you sit quiet for just a minute [laughter] hurt or the interviewee is going to feel like they have to fill it\nIn the rain and things that they shouldn't have said right the term for that in art is horror vacuum yeah I've a fear of of the vacuum you don't have\nTo say that I appreciate Simon so I'm a guy who wears earplugs when I work and when I sleep I like quite a lot I mean a lot of ... but I'm also a guy who on his podcast player app\nSets it to take the violence was guess split it can fit more and somebody listening [laughter] you actually speed up the ... I don't anymore I used to do that because uh it's you have to give it a hundred percent of your attention when it's really fun\nBecause uh it's you have to give it a hundred percent of your attention when it's a really fast right there I used to but now it's not a sign of which helps quite a bit you can take\nFor every ten hours I listen I can take out about an hour of science depending on the podcast will you take out an automatic playing as quickly it automatically removed the silence and people pause or there's a break between segments or that sort of thing\nOh man I guess it depends on the topic what podcast you're listening\nThoughtful podcast become friends can mimic unfortunately So Paul Goodman silence and his book speaking of language fats assignments that I really want those are the moments that I really appreciate how\nRear they are have is going to say even in a church which we think of as being assignment place there's still some of the air conditioning and the cars outside and the kids in Bible study right or even at a funeral or someplace like that there's music playing in the hallway and quite whispered conversations there's no real silence\nMhm yeah I guess that's what meditation is all about to write is leading to stop the flow through your mind\nWe'd love your thoughts on science is a part of communication and language he seven seven nine to nine nine six seven three emails words it we were radio dot\nOrg hello you have a way with words Hi Hi this is a will calling from Lexington\nKentucky and I had a question about I'm washing machines and dishwashers\nYeah sure we'll get the repair guys out and we'll get that sorted\n[laughter] ah actually is a bit of a more of an nomenclature question so before we moved into the the new house that we have here we did not have one of the automatic dish washing machine we were just doing things by hand\nSo I was calling it the washing machine for a while a week apparently is reserved for the call was washing machine\nSo I was just curious are two things one why does the clothes washing machine ... the official\nMachine so I was just curious are two things one why does the clothes washing machine get the official moniker of washing machine whereas the dishwasher has this specific to it and why can't you call the washing machine the clothes washing machine\n[laughter] right because it's\nIt's usually uses a washer the washing machine and very rarely do you throw in the word closer laundry when you're talking about the device I think we can sort some of the south for you All right\nMore importantly to settle a bit of a disagreeing I may have had with my uh girlfriend here is it appropriate to call the clothes washing machine or is that\nNot allowed oh [laughter] are you both from Kentucky\nI Know we're both from Ohio originally we've been in Kentucky about two months now so we haven't quite picked up the way they speak here but we both move around quite a bit a guy that some time in Los Angeles she spent some time in Japan of all places\nOh let's let's set that second part aside for now more than I Do like to interfere with marriages as much as we can [laughter] for sure what kind of a linguistics at first the first thing you've got to understand\nIs that the machine\nThe dish washing machine replaced people who are already known as dishwashers so we called the ... just washing machine the dishwasher because the people who used to the job are also known as dishwashers there's a clear like very long separation between the people dishwasher and the machine dishwasher\nAnd actually you can see this happened with the word computer we have this device on her desk now called the computer the people who used to do that kind of really complicated math\nWere also noticed computers so this happens again and again an English where the machine that takes over the human job thing gets to human name so that's part of the reason why interesting yeah it's part of the reason why the dishwashers called the dishwasher the other thing is that in washing machine that word washing referring to the task\nWashing machine that word washing referring to the task of cleaning clothes are doing the laundry is centuries old uh centuries older than any other kind of\nHow stupid is Alexa ... form of any word related to washing like we have long needed to launder are close and we have called them the washing or the laundry for very long time so Washington mean washing clothes\nHas been ensconced in specialized does the word linguist might use specialized this one particular kind of washing since the fourteen hundreds\nSo right now because of washing when you say I'm On a Jew the washing most people probably would assume that you were in the U.S anyway would seem that you were talking about the laundry in the u._k. they might actually think that you met the dishes which is really into\nThis thing and I think the other thing that's going on here too is that dishwashers weren't part of the everyday household and right in this country into all of that fifty right now and that washing machines are a little or will the word torture meaning machine dishwasher dates to the Eighteen sixties right right but I mean in in somebody's home right\nEveryday use of it yeah you had industrial dishwashers radicals dishwashers right so it really or some kind of an order of events here which kind of use became more common sooner than the other ones that kind of\nTakes the mantle as the definitive meaning for that word and you find that again and again in English where\nSomething kind of wins out and so for example in the U. S. football one out as the meaning for American football and in the world football one out meaning soccer and just they become the defended it means a football although there have for centuries been many uh\nThey become the defendant ... football although there have for centuries been many other kinds of football but if you say football people in their mind to think of the one specific more common kind of ... or you are form or\nSo have we preserved peace in your household I guess that's the bigger [laughter] here\n[laughter] I think so but um are you able to call it a cold water or is that those were done\nWell yeah you can but why I'm going to just to be their customers married or a small degree and\nI think the one who loves the laundry and presses the button you know to call it whatever they\nSaid well you're doing the laundry you wherever you want them all she used to watch all the whatever she wants\n[laughter] I'm just fine a tick you and thanks for your call\nAll right thank you Bye bye bye\nGood clean fun on this show eight seven seven Ninety nine nine six seven three\nThe conversation we had about the use of the term gypsy and have a lot of people find that offensive right to the Roma people\nWe talked about the gypsy robot which is a tradition on Broadway where um it's among musicals when I'm On opening night uh they'll select the person in the chorus who's been in the most Broadway courses and they get their special road that's passed around\nFrom theater to theater and actor to act and it's called the gypsy rose yes well it was called the gypsy

U. way with words Hi who's this\nThis is Barbara Murray and I'm calling from Curtis by the sea California\nWell hello Barbara and talk to you Hi Barbara what's up high speed to talk to you guys to what can we do for you well um I have a question\nAbout a phrase that my mom always used and I never heard anyone else use it and it got to be kind of a family Joe so now when we use that we use it like in a in a joking kind of way because we thought it was such a silly phrase\nSo she would always say whenever she thought we were going someplace like I grew up in northern California in the bay area so like when we had to go over to San Francisco\nAnd she knew it was going to be crowded and she would be like oh I really don't want to go it's going to be a mob Steve and so that was her favorite she would always call things that she didn't even know for sure but anything she thought was going to be crowded she called it a mob scene and\nMy kids picked it up and it just became a family dog so now when we talk about going anywhere were like oh God should we go it's going to be a mob\nSee why why not just because it's employed so often\nTo me it always sounded like I didn't know where she got the phrase I never heard anyone else say it and it like it sounds vaguely sinister but the way she said it didn't really sounds scary but I always pictured like the scene in the old Frankenstein\nUgly sinister but the way she said it didn't really sound scary but I always picture like the scene in the old Frankenstein movie where the the crowd is storming the castle with flaming\nTorches [laughter] it's her when she said mob scene so I just you know I wanted to know what was the real origin of the phrase due to other people use this did she make it up\nOh no it's been around for quite a while since since at least ah the late Eighteen hundreds mob scene and it referred to kind of the kind of seen that you're talking about just it comes from the world\nOf theater and a whole bunch of people coming on stage you know they're big climactic crowd scenes yeah yeah ground only\nSomehow that that worked mob makes it sound more horrible or bigger\n... has developed nuances over the centuries since it first really popped into the English language depending on the context so sometimes mob behind you to be on medically implies violence or danger yeah\nYeah which which it was not in her case it was just me and she wasn't I Would not say that she wasn't any scientific sense agoraphobia she just didn't like to go any place that was crowded ... even though she constantly had to and so she would just always use that phrase and like I said now with the family joke\nI Love the word mob too because it comes from the Latin mobile a bogus which means the or the changeable\nCommon people the FAA fickle common people the the mobile okay like mobile it's related to mobile and move and the ... is like vulgar or\n... owners in common or ... yeah exactly so mostly yeah so the mobile a\nWas was the uh the common people to the crowd that would seem\nWas was the uh the common people to the crowd that would uh seeing ... one day in crucify him last\nAm odd isn't necessarily bad it's just a whole lot of people\nAnd disorganized ... will you never called soldiers on parade a mob because they're in right Lincoln rose right\nRight they're very organized whereas the ... just a bunch of people milling around right wing maybe part of like my mother didn't like was just a whole ton of disorganized the fall\nRight yeah I'm picturing all the extras in a in a movie scene or on your age you know saying peas and cares peas and carrots or whatever it is that they need to simulate crowd noise steamboats on ... [laughter] well that's\nGreat I just you know as I said I have really never heard anyone else use it and I didn't know she had made it up or if it was the real thing and I just I Love that it's become a joke thing it's really one of those eye rolling thing\nNow only yeah although I think she would be happy to know or carry it on for her\nAnd now I'm going to think of her whenever I hear that term\nGet well my mom with a great person a great by a bar but thank you for your call we really appreciate it okay you have a great day Bye bye bye\nWe've talked about this on the show before how words that are now ordinary were once condemned is horrible I'm yeah I'm ... one of those words so his earliest Seventeen ten Jonathan Swift and other people described the word mob as terrible it was a shortened form of Latin phrase\nAnd he said it's the result of a natural tendency towards relapsing into barbaric the which delights in ... syllables this criticism of shortening words which is perfectly ordinary way to make new words ... three hundred years old\nA long tradition a natural tendency towards relapsing and the ... but it's not human condition [laughter]\nParity but it's not human condition [laughter]\nIf he had pearls he would have been clutching them right [laughter] eight seven seven Ninety nine nine six seven three\n[noise] [noise] [noise] I'm not\nGiving up on something then you throw in the towel All right yeah it's an expression that comes from boxing I think just throwing a sponge to yeah that's\nWhat I was gonna say I can check out this find your check in the ... is an earlier term that also comes from boxing that means the same thing I'm going to check up the sponge\nSo you're no longer going to wipe out the blood on the matter what happens when a brown ... no longer going to participate in writing journalistic endeavor you're done check up the sponge done ski still going to do something good in the ...

I'm from Idaho and damn I had a question about the Basque language okay um I have a brother in law who bask in there I I had been kinda drug into the whole Basque culture around Idaho in Idaho has a very large ask\nCommunity mhm and so um I find it pretty fascinating that language is\nI'm considered quite ancient uh is not related to any of the countries around I'm ah in Spain and France So\nI Wonder what your cake was on it\nThat's the best nutshell description I've heard of bask in a while [laughter] much it it's what's known as a language ice\nAnd I've heard of bask in a while [laughter] pretty much it it's what's known as a language isolates do you notice expression\nYes I I look at yeah gotcha\nSo language ice lose one that does not connected directly to the languages around it and it is believed that bask predates\nThe Indo European languages that is that was a language spoken before the people who brought all the Indo European languages into Europe before they arrived and or a little bit about its history because there are few ah inscriptions on gravesites um a lot of the place names give us clues to it\nBut the strong evidence is that it is not directly connected to any of the romance languages although it didn't borrow from Latin it's not connected to any of the Germanic languages other than maybe few words that have traveled from the genetic languages into French and then in tobacco and things like that and so it's it's it's a very interesting thing it is about\nSouthern by about seven hundred thousand people give or take although almost all the speakers bilingual and there are numerous dialects of it I think there are four major dialects of Basque\nAnd uh it's just a very interesting curiosity this remnants of another time and I'm not much is known about it and where it comes from other words it's heavily studied because it's so interesting then and so unconnected to the languages around it\nClung to shelter at all I heard that the people were somehow click with the ... lady there well sure you know I Wish\nAre some people who've tried to propose that theory but it doesn't withstand scrutiny\nSome people have looked at genetic similarities between certain bodies of people um and things I found something they would again generally it falls apart there are superficial similarities between all languages in the world\nFalls apart there are superficial similarities between all languages in the world and what you need is a consistent similarity across multiple\nFeatures of the language for example where you would expect the verbs if one verb is similar between languages we expect many of the verbs to be similar between languages if there's one word for say a relationship term like ... father or mother rooted expect many other relationship terms to be the same and it's just not the case so\nI Believe the evidence is because there is no connection to well there is no connection to the Celtic languages um it's not related to corn issue it's not related to the other languages spoken in France that aren't French and and so forth\nOut yeah it is a very interesting very interesting late for him and the people themselves I think they're very interesting what they are or and what isn't there a time when I'm On the hill ever was ruling when Spain had our people from speaking back\nYeah that's a really common story across cultures it's not just the Spain but even in France some of their regional languages were stumped out by this French need for to establish a nation state with a French identity that was built upon the language and centered upon French just a common language so dialing spoken and Brittany are all but gone\nUm it's unfortunate but I'm having the United states as well in Canada and Australia and the China it just happens pretty much anywhere where nations he's it's identities being firmly attached to one language they almost always put in a program of stopping out the other languages\nFast food is really good and you have your relatives treated you to any\nOh yes they they have my sister has become quite the ask cooks really Boise has what they call at ... o'clock and they have a cultural ... but there are many bars and restaurants\nWhat they call a vast lock and they have a cultural issue but there are many bars and restaurants in the Boise area that are preserving the heritage foods
