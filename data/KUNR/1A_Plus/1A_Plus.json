their hearts I don't care who you are I don't care what race you are a part of what creed you follow who you voted for and twenty sixteen I Will find you\nAnd I will love you there's absolutely nothing you can do to stop me\nCharlie ... let's get back to Thomas comments on Facebook Tommy rights\nWhen speeches free and in the open people get pushed back when it is driven underground it has given legitimacy and leads to action one of the sites that has made news lately is this social network called gab dot com which I don't think a lot of people had heard of before this incident what what can you tell us about gab\nAnd the kind of online footprint that Robert powers had there so a gab dot com\nIs a sort of a basically a Twitter cologne um and it is was created under the premise of a maximalist free speech beliefs so the idea was a lot of you know racist begets [laughter] we're getting kicked off of Twitter for for violating put her as community standards are\nAnd gab was sort of a a another refuge for them a place where you could say anything because we believe in the you know ... the absolute power of of free speech but when it ended up happening with gab is at it it became a cesspool it became a place where only the sort of worst people would go to express ideas that\nAre that we're really not tolerated elsewhere because they were hateful because they were ...\nReally not tolerated elsewhere because they were hateful because they were angry I became it it has become a a place where white nationalism\nA and an extreme a bigotry homophobia whatever ah has has been embraced and and uh and this was a place where the the Pittsburgh shooter I'm not going to say his name\nWas maybe not radicalized necessarily but but certainly able to express and have an audience for a lot of his\nA truly hateful views it was the last place where he\nPosted before the shooting 'em and it seems that it was it was sort of a\nA a an unproductive vent for a lot of that hatred I'm an after after um after it was clear that the shooter had been an active a participant on gab there was a lot of push back a lot of people who are coming in realizing this for the first time\nA note noticed that uh that at this place is a dark\nPlace to incubate a lot of awful ideas gab responded saying a words are not bullets in social media posts a have a body count at zero sort of saying that you know this free speech is different from from action and I started when they did they actually say words are not bullets\nAnyone who says that should go read the declaration of independence\nWell you know what's interesting about this and this is something that happens a lot of free speech communities on line that they don't really believe necessarily in free speech but just in being able to say anything outrageous I is that it actually shows that that that the owners of gab\nDevalue speech to a degree if they believe that it has no consequences and then there's sort of this you know\nHas no consequences and then there's sort of this you know this odd warped understanding of why protected so hard if it means nothing um and and I think that that is something that that a lot of people\nDon't quite grapple with especially on the Internet rabbi Jacobs I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like Gavin job is not the only place where this kind of speech proliferate on line it is worth noting since our program one a as named after the first amendment a quick First Amendment lesson\nHate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments\nIncitement to violence tends to be the line whereby speech becomes\nCurtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given a new kind of speed and virulence that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened in Pittsburgh all the more worrisome to folks\nLike you short well first of all it's not news that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death and life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more true I've seen how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to speak with such hate speech so it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever\nSpeech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want [noise] I also just wanted to say something about the ... that one of the to respond to one of the Facebook comments that you read\nThere has been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and it's true of course that their corners of the left where there is anti Semitism it's true that there's anger but we've seen nothing like\nThe white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right against Jews against people of color against algae B. T. Q. people against immigrants refugees et cetera\nAnd what's crucial is that that is being\nThat that hatred is being supported and embolden from the very top from the president of the United states that the white nationalists see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides\nAnd that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we have somebody\nOn the left who is in charge we have somebody on the right who's the president of the United states and who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist racist anti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign ad before the election in which he\nHighlighted George Soros Janet Yellen and Lloyd Blankfein and suggested that they were a part of some large conspiracy\nThat that they were part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power in the United states ... trap it taps into very old anti Semitic ... yeah\nI I I'm Sorry where am I but I Do want to get a little deeper into that a lot of thought a lot of our listeners have been chime in on that and endure I'd love to to get your thoughts at that on that I mean the president did address this during a speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday he began his speech by talking about the shooting\nToday with one unified voice we condemn the historic evil of anti Semitism\nAnd every other form of evil and unfortunately evil comes in many forms and we come together as one American people\nPart of the president's opening of his speech to the future farmers of America in Indianapolis over the weekend but contrast that with what the president tweeted this morning he wrote quote\nThere is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people\nMust stop the open an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony\nFake news must end unquote gotten a number of comments from some of you about the president's potential role in all of this Susan is in Silver Spring Maryland right outside D.C Susan Rice\nSusan as in Silver Spring Maryland right outside D.C Susan writes I look forward to the day when we once again have a president who understands and always considers but his or her statements have far reaching consequences Indira I'd well this was of course incredibly\nDisturbing to have the president once again demonizing the press and calling us enemies of the people\nSupport for NPR comes from this

writes\nI Know this sounds weird but I actually feel some hope after the massacre it was obvious that the bigoted crude and hateful language from prominent people would end in tears we were told it was just trumping Trump telling it like it is he could be as prejudiced and root as he liked it was his right under the first amendment it wasn't his fault people looked on him as a role model\nNow that everyone sees the consequences we can all mobilize against hate speech and hate crimes and frankly it's about time [noise]\nAsia W tweets hate speech is free speech if we're going to live in a free society that's how it has to be but legally acceptable behavior isn't necessarily morally or socially acceptable behavior we can fight back against hate speech with our own words\nAre votes and our money ace in Chapel Hill North Carolina writes real\nIn Chapel Hill North Carolina writes real\nMedia has to start calling out outlets like Fox News for their lives and propaganda that enables hate speech to be propagated\nNPR and other rational sources have to call out the president's lies and distortions there needs to be a consistent strong resistance to the hateful devices speech that is anti American\nJournalists need to be less accommodating end quote unquote fair to all opinions and stop repeating without strong criticism of the president's ignorant rants if not you who make America kind again\nLet's get back to the phones and again thanks to those of you who have been patient with us on the phones we know that screening has been tough today but we've had to screen very hard with some of the people who felt like sharing their comments on our air we won't hear from those folks but we will hear from David who's here in Washington DC Hey David what's on your mind\nI'm well thanks so much for having the show I um I guess I'm speaking as someone who is a religious the Jewish and also very much scientific I think there's a strong feeling among a lot of us that there has been a a much lower acceptance on the left of people who have a strong religious views\nAnd a close next to the state of Israel I mean I teach at a a small just ... here in the city and or in the in the suburbs and a lot of us didn't do feel uncomfortable with House bill that um\nYou know they express a strong and here instead of Israel or especially religious views that aren't\nUm you know but I mean about hot button social issues but as their religious views that they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up and and how you are how the school deals with it\nBut I mean we're a Jewish religious school so you know for us you know what we mean there are students who are you know are not particularly strongly support of Israel\nThe religious school so you know for us you know what we\nMean there are students who are you know are not particularly strongly supportive Israel in one way or the other but um when our students leave the school you know they often find their campuses unfriendly they find professors especially a friendly\nIf they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh so I mean while it's true I mean I don't think it's reasonable to say that you're seeing a lot of violence in the left and that that's true\nI think you are seeing and I think our students feel a certain intolerance 'em when they go to college um and it's you know I don't know we we tell\nWe do tell kids it probably should need need to shut up you know and I don't know if they show up that you know you can't argue with every\nJust kind of how you're going to have to learn to live with that she kind of pick your battles I think that's a hard thing\nYou have to pick their battles I I mean I I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advised to do that and not the\nNon federal everything will David I'm going to be can be very hard to even let me put that to thank you for sharing that let me put that to rabbi Jill Jacobs rubber what do you make of Davis common\nThank you David I wanted to respond both to you and to Stephanie who are speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I wanted to say Seventy first of all I'm really sorry that your son is going through that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course a high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nAnd for both of you I Want to be very clear that there certainly is anti Semitism and all laughed and very often it expresses itself\nAs as attacks on Israel on Israel's right to exist now that's different from saying that criticism of Israel's policy is is anti Semitic which it's not even criticize any countries policies but often that criticism of Israel crosses a line into anti Semitism\nAnd as an organization that is pro Israel\nAs an organization that is pro Israel and also critical of many of Israel's governmental policy is we are all the time speaking out against the places on the left where\nWhere that criticism crosses the line and we have to be really clear about where those places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post that tries to lay out some of the places in which criticism of Israel is not criticism of a country and its policies but rather crosses over into\nStraight up anti Semitism and unfortunately we have seen incidents around the world in which there are people who carry out\nWho carry a violent acts and say that they are motivated by hatred of Israel but the targets are actually Jews who are shopping in a grocery store in a jewelry store in a synagogue\nAnd at the same time in the United states right now again saying that we have to call out that anti Semitism the left what's different about the anti Semitism and other hatred a race racism and homophobia and seeing a phobia and the right is that it's being supported by the government\nIt would be different if we had a situation in which there was hatred on the left hatred on the right and somebody at the top who is trying to restore who's ... who is criticizing\nAny kind of hatred and who is trying to restore civil discourse to the U. S. but instead we have somebody at the very top who is encouraging the hatred on the right\nRiling up his people\nAnd we get to a few more of your comments as we continue our conversation we are too many of your calls as we can as well just briefly ran on our Facebook page I Am emotionally exhausted\nPage I Am emotionally exhausted I was in my own synagogue on Saturday when I heard the news I was looking forward to going to synagogue to escape the news of the week now there is no escape and no sanctuary but as our ancient rabbis teachers the world is a narrow bridge and the main thing to remember is not to be afraid\nLynn wrote on our Facebook page yesterday's interfaith service in Pittsburgh filled me with hope\nVarious religious leaders offered support strings and loved to a community crushed by its loss if anything is going to change we citizens must make it happen last night's fellowship help to bind our wounds and set us on the path for making our town better Indira would you react to that I feel like part of what\nWorked [laughter] I hate to say in Pittsburgh favor but one of the things I think health in this whole process as you described scroll hill\nIf it's the kind of community that had these ties long before this happened so that people who needed to come together already had so in crisis struck they just they just rolled out and they knew how to lock arms with one another\nRight I mean scroll hill is a very ... this is one factor is a very educated community\nUm it's right next to CMU Carnegie Mellon university and pet and a lot of the people who live and scroll hill are um you know doctors lawyers professors teachers accountants dentists\nIt's an educated community a tolerant community and Pittsburgh overall is also um you know politically a liberal community and it voted something like between Seventy and eighty percent for Hillary Clinton and this last election even though Pennsylvania\nUm went for Donald Trump so the community as Pittsburgh overall and the mayor I'm Bill ... has been\nThe U.S Pittsburgh overall and the mayor I'm Bill to do do has been you know talking about tolerance for a long time and that is the history of the city so that's why I Would say yes it did help in Pittsburgh favor but\nYou know all of the negative rhetoric that we have coming um we were talking about the end an enemy of the people line earlier that the president tweeted this morning\nI'm we now know that a bomb was apparently headed for CNN was just intercepted today in Atlanta just four months ago and attack or killed five reporters and Annapolis news from the capital Gazette\nSo you know I Do think we have to worry about drawing the line um I mean meaning there is a line between hateful rhetoric and I'm hateful actions because of group polarization that happened\nJust attack on a windy or just mentioned CNN is reporting that a suspicious package that was addressed to CNN was intercepted in a post office in Atlanta the investigation I don't think has at least you'll did any public information in terms of what was in the package whether it was similar to the ones\nThat were sent last week but that story is just kind of breaking as of this morning let's get to a few more of your calls and comments including one\nFrom Pittsburgh where Lee is on the line highly what's on your mind\nOr Joshua how you doing today\nSure what what's on your mind about how ... how are your neighbors do an after all this\nMe too movement has revolutionized how America talks about sexual harassment how much is it changing the laws to protect victims and punish harasser\nFrom WAMC you an NPR in Washington this is one egg [noise]\nEither I'm Joshua Johnson to build one a we begin with an update from Pittsburgh after this weekend's deadly synagogue shooting\nThe anti Semitic attack raises troubling questions for the whole country but how was the city holding up then we conclude or a special series the state were him with a look at Mt harassment laws some states are tougher penalties on offenders others are making it easier to protect victims or harder to file of them\nWill answer your questions about how me too is affecting your state government and we'd love to hear from you\nAbout how me too is affecting us the government and we'd love to hear from you email one A.

breaking story best to keep an eye out on NPR dot org for the very latest or on your NPR member station [noise]\nHow do we prevent accused of sexual predators like Harvey Weinstein team from silencing the people they abuse\nAmong other things some states are passing new laws that prohibit certain kinds of confidentiality agreements Zelda Perkins was an assistant to the Hollywood mobile and she says some of the current laws protect criminals\nPerkins left Weinstein's company Miramax back in Nineteen Ninety eight after a colleague revealed that Weinstein had tried to rape her last year Perkins broke her confidentiality agreement after about Twenty years of keeping her co worker secret here she is in an interview with the BBC\nThan that no disclosure agreements have the patience\nYou see I understand that non disclosure agreement had the ... and ...\nAnd but it's Winnie it's winning legislation is changed around how things are claimants and ... you cannot have an equal document that attack at criminal\nMany state lawmakers agree with ms Perkins this year in the wake up to meet you in time's up movements Tennessee Vermont in Washington state among others passed laws banning certain kinds of confidentiality agreements other states including Maryland and California passed laws that expands sexual harassment protections to workers like freelancers\nIt's another example of states taking action while Congress makes promises and remains deadlocked\nToday will discuss these new state laws and what impact they could have workers and employees it's the final part of our special series this state where in where we've been focusing on the bills and initiatives that are trending in state capitals\nJoining us here in Studio to discuss it is Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law center\nThe organization administers the time's up legal Defense Fund which assists with sexual harassment cases Emily welcome back to what I thanks for having me joining us from the University of Oregon is Elizabeth tip it an associate professor at Oregon law school she's also a former employment lawyer Elizabeth welcome\nThanks for having me and Suzanne whole team is the program director of the employment labor and retirement program at the national conference of state legislatures in Denver Suzanne thanks for making time for us yes thanks ... we'd also love to make time for you particularly if you've had experience with sexual harassment\nTime for you particularly if you've had experience with sexual harassment sexual abuse and felt like the law did or did not protect you if the law did not protect you in your state what went wrong or perhaps what did the laws in your state do write\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a ads W. A. M. U. dot for Emily Martin before we get into the state laws let's talk about the federal sexual harassment laws who do they cover and who don't recover so when you look\nAt workplace sexual harassment laws um title seven as the federal law that says that you can't discriminate based on sex and that includes harassing people on the basis of sex\nBut title seven only covers you if your employer has at least Fifteen employees so if you work for a very small employer federal law doesn't protect you against sexual harassment\nAnd title sudden also only covers employees so that means if you're an independent contractor if you're a freelancer maybe if you're a volunteer or an unpaid intern that you aren't protected by our federal sexual harassment law\nSuit in hold seeing the number of states including Vermont and New York in Delaware have expanded sexual harassment protections to apply to lure workers tell us a little bit about more tell us a little bit more about which states are expanding protections and who they're covering\nYeah definitely so we've seen at least twenty states introduce legislation in twenty Eighteen on workplace sexual harassment and the majority of the states or have introduced legislation as it relates to lending or prohibiting nondisclosure agreements or ending forced arbitration agreement so\nWe've seen states are so far enact legislation on that area and\nWe've seen states are so far enact legislation on that area including Arizona Maryland New York Tennessee California and he mentioned Vermont and Washington and other states are also looking addict standing training requirements\nUm so how many hours must uh employees are employers um require training and so we've seen legislation on that passed in um California is just one example of that\nElizabeth tipping I'd love to hear from you about some workers like freelancers and contractors who may or may not be protected by these laws we heard from an ear is already who told NPR she was sexually harassed on two separate occasions when she was a contract worker once while singing in a band and once while working as a tutor\nShe says she could not report the incidents to a chart and as a contract worker she had no employer to sue\nI thought about it and I was like I don't want to post that on my social media it can change your reputation I really wish I could ever protect myself in both situation there just I feel like I Would have had a sense of agency and and what it felt in control of my life\nFor us we're tipping how common is this for freelancers and need a situation\nI Do think it's really important to extend protections for independent contractors and that's because employers have no incentive to provide a remedy an internal fix for contractors if they're not even covered by the laws at all\nSo even basic protections uh like your caller referenced like being able to use the employers hotline being able to use the employers complaints system the employer is not going to be interested in extending those the contractors unless they're covered by the ...\nBe interested in extending those the contractors unless they're covered by the laws\nWere speaking to Elizabeth typically associate professor at the University of Oregon school of law Susan whole team program director for employment labor and retirement at the national conference of state legislatures and Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law center Emily I'd love you to react to a comment that came in from Charlotte\nCharlotte emailed I Am a Florida based graduate student at Boston University\nThis year ... required all students all staff and all faculty to complete a sexual assault training course\nI had no idea how many legal terms are associated with such a difficult subject it's complicated without this require training I Would never have known about my rights as a Floridian much less where to look\nEmily this is rather complicated although some states including Delaware Illinois California have\nPassed laws expanding sexual harassment training and the education requirements for for some employers\nIs true we have seen this year and generally seen a lot of policymaker energy in the states around the issue of workplace harassment which is exciting that they've been in creative [noise]\nUm well to bear thinking about how do we really solve this problem and one of the things that lawmakers have focused on is\nRequiring training or expanding training requirements again under federal law there is no requirement per se that employers train employees on sexual harassment a lot of employers do but it's not because federal law makes them do it\nNow we don't know as much as we wish we did about what sorts of training are really affected what sorts of training\nSorts of training are really affected what sorts of training really make a difference in changing behavior\nSo one of the things that I Hope comes from this long\nOverdue attention to workplace harassment is some attention to learning more about what kinds of training can really make change in a workplace\nYeah I I Do want to put that to you professor to but also in terms of what you think makes the biggest difference I mean there's a certain kinds of training or the other new kinds of state laws that you think would be the most effective in reducing harassment\nWell when you think about me to as a sign of a broken system you want to attack all of the aspects of the system so\nPart of it might be that our laws in general do not really hold employers accountable when there is harassment in the workplace that it's relatively easy especially under federal law for employers to get out of them\nAnd a lot of states have really low caps on damages so if you through your employer the maximum amount of money that you can get from them you know in some states might be fifty thousand dollars that's not much of a deterrent for employers who are trying to decide how much to invest in their systems to address harassment\nWith reception on Tuesday the thirtieth at seven pm that's the potential is workshop [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes

against sexual harassment was Emily Martin of the national Women's Law center\nFor harassment was Emily Martin of the national Women's Law center Suzanne whole scene of the national conference of state legislatures\nAnd University of Oregon law school assistant professor associate professor Elizabeth tip it's we woke up some more of your questions and thoughts as well especially if the laws in your state that deal with sexual harassment sexual abuse worked for you or failed you we'd love to hear your story or even just your questions about the way these laws work\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a day or email won a\nA W. A. M. U. dot org Emily Martin I Love to get your reactions to what we heard from California state senator ... Jackson sounds like count California is trying to do quite a bit to improve the way that we prevent and prosecute sexual harassment what do you think I agree that California's\nBeen a real leader in the space those with the laws that um we just heard about that were passed last last session as well as if you love the unfortunately we're vetoed by the governor that would have expanded the statute of limitations for bringing a workplace sexual harassment claim\nYou know in under federal law it's often as short as a hundred and eighty days from the date of the harassment when you have to bring a claim and given that we're talking about\nI'm Talking about activity that really leaves people traumatized that is not enough time often for people to figure out what they need to do how they want to do it to find their attorney to find out how they can take action\nSo you know we joined the national Law Center joined with more than two hundred and fifty other organizations this week calling for twenty states by twenty twenty to pass comprehensive sexual harassed\nTwenty to pass comprehensive sexual harassment protections and California I think it's really a beacon for other states and thinking about how can they strengthen their laws and meaningful way spending states Emily that you're targeting in particular\nWell I think that one of the things that we've seen this past year is that it's not just progressive states for example Tennessee a past new prohibitions on employers requiring employees to sign non disclosure agreement that the condition of coming to work that would ah\nKeep employees from talking about sexual harassment when it happened and\nSo we're really thinking broadly that this is a nationwide problem that requires a nationwide solution\nSuzanne ... your thoughts on what we heard from state senator Jackson\nYeah I think that's a great example of a legislators I'm really trying to grapple with how to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace and and I'm introduced a lot of different types of legislation to get out that I think we've seen a lot of creative um pieces of legislation in other states one thing that\nI did want to mention is Illinois has a really interesting piece of legislation where they created a sexual harassment hotline which is the first time that we've seen that across the states and that provides legal assistance as well as as a way to report sexual harassment of workplace in private and public sector\nBefore we keep going I Would note that quite a few of you have commented to us today about state laws that are aimed at statute of limitations laws we did an entire hour not too long ago discussing just that very topic\nYou can find the conversation on statute of limitations on line at the one a dot org sets the words are the number one the letter a dot org Susan let me stick with you\nThe letter a dot org Susan let me stick with you we mentioned nondisclosure in confidentiality agreements you mentioned the state of Tennessee\nCalifornia, Maryland and other states have also banned certain kinds of those agreements and and in a number of states those laws passed unanimously owners are saying if we could dig into the line of where nondisclosure agreements come into play I mean they're not\nInherently illegal they can have a purpose\nIn contracts I work in news a lot of people who work in journalism have certain kinds of contracts about disclosing privileged information been is run on our Facebook page\nThere is a place for legitimate nondisclosure agreements however it is a disservice to our communities when they're used to hide illegal behavior I Would be comfortable with laws that allowed anyone to speak with law enforcement in such cases regardless of the existence of this agreement Suzanne\nYes well that's interesting and I will say that states are not all states in their legislation specify these contracts as nondisclosure agreements and sometimes they just called them contracts um or other types of agreements most of the legislation that we've seen\nUs specifically says nondisclosure as it relates to sexual harassment in the workplace so it wouldn't necessarily band nondisclosure in great agreements and all but just as they relate to this specifically to sexual harassment in the workplace\nProfessor typically ... before we move on to too much for there can you just define that term force what exactly is a non disclosure agreement what exactly do they do well\nThere's actually two types there's the type that you mentioned that people find that to start over there and play meant that says keep our information confidential and another type the ...\n... says keep our information confidential and there was another types of people signed usually after they're already involved in a lawsuit or they have hired a lawyer\nAnd those are to settle the person's legal claims and those are the ones I think that had become most problematic because in those cases it's clear that some sort of bad conduct has occurred or is disputed and in those cases both parties might agree that they're not going to talk about the facts on her line the case\nFor someone who stick with you for a minute I I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of the line for confidentiality agreements or help for hurtful in terms of dealing with sexual harassment I understand that you would have said that they may not be enforceable because they may be some there maybe some contradictions\nWith federal law but I Would gather that sometimes they can be in the best interest of the person who's been sexually harassed where do you see the line\nWell\nThe contracts that you sign at the start of your job I think it's helpful to have a law that makes clear that those can't cover sexual harassment or other forms of harassment or discrimination because essentially forces the employer to disclose in a contract\nThat keep our business information confidential but if you experience unlawful conduct you're allowed to talk about that though the contracts and away educate the employees about their rights\nIt's a lot more complicated though if you're talking about settling a lawsuit because in that case many times the person who's represented by a lawyer and I've heard plaintiff lawyers say that they like these provisions 'cause it's move the path or the settlement\nAnd I think that's kind of hard about this is the people who maybe have the most interests and learning this information aren't at a table future effect and potential victims of harassment they don't have a say and whether the victim and the employer decided to keep the information secret\nVictim and the employer decided to keep the information secret let's get to some of your comments and questions Alex tweeted earlier this year in the army I got sexually harassed by another soldier\nLuckily we have to go through sharp training every year we all like to make fun of it we make fun of it to the point where when I actually had to use it I knew exactly what to do\nStuff on emailed my girlfriend works for a college in upstate New York while in Chicago for a word conference a resident of Illinois sexually assaulted her despite my encouragement she is terrified of coming forward for fear of retribution do laws across state lines especially in Illinois and New York\nComplicate the legalities that would otherwise helped bring perpetrators to justice Emily Martin what would you say the stuff on\nWell that's a great question if you're talking about state law protections that go above and beyond set our ally yes there can be complicated questions that arise if a person is usually employed and Wednesday but the harassing or assaults and behavior was in another\nBut it's important to remember that we're talking about state law stay in the ways in which states are going above and beyond federal protection and there are core federal protection they should be strengthened in various ways that their core federal protections against workplace sexual harassment against sexual harassment in schools and so that is a baseline that covers\nEverybody with the important exemptions that we've talked about but no matter you know what's it called they live in\nA suit and I'd love to get your take on one of the states that did not pass at least one of its proposed bills on sexual harassment and that was in Louisiana it had to do with settlements of sexual harassment cases Louisiana State House bill five seven eight would have stopped employers from forcing\nFive seven eight would have stopped employers from forcing workers to settle sexual harassment disputes through arbitration state representative Raymond cruise voted against the bill among other things the rep said it would open up litigation for everything\nRight now we're considered one of the most ... states and the nation's one source I just looked up said we're number six six out of fifty on worst states for litigation matter of fact if you divide of the country into five four regions\nThe south has one hundred and eighty six cases like that oh ten thousand people the next closest section has\nFifteen one tenth less than one tenth the ratio of these kinds of cases going to court I encourage you to do what we can to help stop sexual harassment early", "year": "2018",

President Trump sent troops to the U.S Mexico border during the spring defense secretary James Mattis has authorized deploying eight hundred more troops\nTo the southern border give us a sense of what role these troops might be expected to play there and how that might factor into this whole saga regarding the the care of him\n[noise] well it it really is as car ruined was pointing out apply of thoughts to play into the political debate here in the United states about these migrants making their way to the to the United states and the whole notion of securing the border is also is is a strange one on this because\nI mean if you look at who these migrants are and what they're escaping from they are tired they're hungry\nThey're escaping from they are tired they're hungry they're escaping or countries like Honduras and El Salvador Guatemala where they are escaping violence they are extremely poor they they as they are walking up a north towards the United states\nOn their agenda and their hopes and dreams quite clearly is to try and seek asylum in the United states why because they think that they could have better lives\nIn the United states they think that that children would have better lives in really there is no greater testament to American soft power that you have you know essentially all around the world people who want to vote with their feet and come to the the the United states and settle and have children and have better lives than simply\nAnd and so the troops are part of this larger\nA Trump and and and I guess Republican rhetoric\nThat play into the the idea that some migrants who are coming are coming I'm a you know as sources of great danger when in ... in fact a you know if you look at the pictures of who they are and how they're coming in they are anything but and I also do want to point out a career and mentioned that President Trump\nAdmitted to the ... a A R mentioned that uh these migrants are Middle Eastern well for one there's actually no evidence that points to the fact that they could be Middle East and perhaps more importantly\nHe was using um Middle Eastern as a slur of\nSorts which which which we believe we should we should just clarify vice president Mike Pence said that there it's possible that mixed in with these thousands of migrants who were from Central America there may be a few dozen who\nFrom Central America there may be a few dozen who were Middle Eastern and might have you know ... ... ferry\nIs aims for the country ... and that's exactly right thank you for the car for vacation that but the the point I was getting too was that the use of the of of a Middle East and that's just the um ... is extremely dangerous because it it it it then tries to create the the impression that being Middle East and\nI'm means you're dangerous so that you're a terrorist and and and that too is is is a dangerous loaded way of looking at as Carlin was pointing out again a movement that happens very often a you know migrants from from those parts of the world often try to make their way to the United states\nAnd the reason why this has become a bigger thing right now the numbering in the thousands is because it has been politicized here in the United states\nGoldfarb I Wonder if we should be careful with the language we use to describe this large group of people a number of you have comments to us about that with these this terminology including the use of the word migrants\nMaria writes I Am Honduran I was born and raised in Honduras I came to the U.S to study and now I live and work here this quote unquote caravan is a cry for help cry of desperation from my people who will risk their lives to escape the extreme poverty and violence that I Know Israel\nThey are indeed refugees seeking refuge please don't blame them\nBlamed the corruption that has rotted the Honduran government\nAnd dug into Anthony tweet they are not migrants they are asylum seekers words matter now Michael Merriam Webster is my go choo\nMatter now Michael Merriam Webster is my goats do in terms of use the English language\nMiriam Webster defines a migrant as one who migrate such as a person who moves regularly in order to find work especially in harvesting crops a refugee is one that fleas\nEspecially a person who flees to a foreign country or power to escape danger or persecution what do you make of the words that we're using to describe this\nYou know just it was as you've been talking about this I ... I suddenly had Woody Guthrie's old song\nAbout about a group of migrants being sent back to Mexico in the Nineteen thirties and their plane crashed\nAnd they were cold deportees it's a beautiful song you you didn't look it up and ... ... listeners should strict YouTube after the show and and give it a listen there are many versions of it\nYeah you you know look I and I do think that in this case there there is a distinction you know we have a human wave coming out of sub Saharan Africa and the horn of Africa towards Europe and it's had a destabilizing effect on politics or as well\nAnd and I I Would identify most of these folks as as being migrants as opposed to people who come from countries which\nVery much as a result of American policy not just in the Nineteen eighties but you know going back\n\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the Alfred P Sloan Foundation bridging science technology and the art spices\nFrom the Alfred P Sloan Foundation bridging science technology and the arts by supporting exhibitions such as programmed to the Whitney Museum in New York City on view through April fourteenth more at Sloan dot org\nFrom the joy foundation committed to advancing racial equity and economic mobility for the next generation and the great lakes region learn more at Joyce F.

future topics will share some of your stories Monday when we wrap up our series the state we're in on one day\nBack now to our discussion with current emerging of the Washington Post Ravi ... of foreign policy magazine\nAnd Michael Goldfarb with the first rough draft of history the host and creator of that podcast let me come to you though I Wonder what you think of the overall message of Tim Cook speech the c._e._o. of apple we heard him refer to the data industrial complex which has been a phrase that's been quoted fairly often in the days since he spoke kind of\nHarkening back to that idea of the military industrial complex the prison industrial complex what did you make of of cooks remarks\nThought these were really strong words and coming from a taxi or perhaps the strongest we've seen so far now ... what he didn't stay in that speech was he didn't mention Google he didn't mention Facebook\nAnd that's bad because I mean while he doesn't want to go that far but\nBut also because apple is a business is quite different from Google and Facebook apple doesn't it's not in the\nThe uh the ad tracking business the way Facebook and Google both are but I think what all of these companies know collectively is that whether they like it or not regulation of some for some form is is on its way it's coming and so\nAt some level of the other they have all endorsed uh GDP are which is Europe's data protection bill\nAnd I think they're beginning to imagine that some\nAnd bill and I think they're beginning to imagine that some version of that will at some stage be implemented in the United states and the only question that is is what kind of language will be in that what it will then tail\nAnd and and and I think what cook has tried to do in the speech again very strong words in his visit to Europe is to try and come out ahead of it knowing that this is going to happen anyway to try and appear to be one of the uh the tech support has a of a potential data privacy laws and the unite the\nWe should be clear also GDP are as the general data protection regulation it's there's a new area law that protects the privacy of data privacy of individuals within the EU or even the export of their personal data outside the you if you've noticed re in the last few months\nThat a lot of the Web sites you go to have had these pop up saying hey we use cookies on this website we maybe try your information click here to accept\nThat was those websites complying with GDP are that's why they all had to begin putting those pop ups on those sites another story about privacy that caught our attention the British newspaper the telegraph\nPublished an investigation on Tuesday into a wealthy businessman who was accused by multiple employees of racist and sexist miss treatment the story had the headline the British me to scandal which cannot be revealed\nThat's because the accused was granted an injunction against the newspaper to prevent it from publishing his name but then this happened at Britain's house of lords of ... do you see on the parliamentary privileged\nHappened at Britain's house of lords\nI feel it's my juicy under parliamentary privileged to name for the reading of the individual in question given that the media have been subject to an injunction preventing publication of the full details of his story which is clearly in the public interest\nThat was the voice of lord Hain or Baron Hain of nice in the British house of lords using British parliamentary privileged to name the billionaire at the center of this story Michael Goldfarb what's behind this what makes this\nSuch a big deal it sounds like it's kind of an example of clear example of the very significant differences between free speech laws in the u._k. and in the U.S\nWell that's certainly part of a job in in this particular case I'm having a parliamentary privileges is pretty\nUnique tool you can say things in parliament that you can't say outside and and not suffer and any libel actions and Peter hand was a working he'd been approached by some of the women who had spoken to the Daily Telegraph\nThere's this guy a Phillip Green is you know a fairly typical contemporary entrepreneur yet he was a night to by Tony Blair for services to retail is set up\nA series of of um clothing shops over over the decades and made himself very very wealthy indeed and um apparently he was just the kind of boss you would expect he was a bully and he was\nSexually harassed people and\nLike Harvey Weinstein when when he settled up there were no disclosure clauses inserted into the settlements and the difference of course is that in\nInto the settlements and the difference of course is that in the U.S New York times and the New Yorker can report that Harvey Weinstein is this and that and you know the details we can't get because of these nondisclosure agreements ... you know his name and here in Britain it's something else\nYou know moving to go to Michael good no no because I could go on about this guy forever and I will [laughter]\nWe appreciate that doing it on\nI was just going to say it's it's an interesting case really because of the way that the British laws are structured to say to have that that this this question which is the greater good here right because this is a\n... that the me too movement it's already been a question of can you know the the little guy or the little girl in this instance you know stand up against a big powerful wealthy usually male I'm In player who's pulling things a ... foot doing things that they shouldn't be doing but because of power and\nI'm In Flint is able to get away with it it it kind of the perfect I'm ... and ... it's kind of the perfect at ... I guess to see what is\nWhat society kind of value is protecting more is it the reputation of the accused in this way where India is can be applied newspapers that were never a party to them or is it getting this out in the public space and so there's like an extra level in the u._k.\nOf determining you know how much of a national or international conversation I guess at this point all of this is going to be in terms of does one wrong done effect you know an entire society and and how should I be sorted out\nRight now here in the U.S we are understandably focused on the mid term elections will Brazilians are focused on a presidential election they have to the polls on Sunday to choose between two radically different candidates in the second round of voting for ...\nCandidates in the second round of voting Fernando ... on the left ... is on the right in ... the lead in most polls many expect him to win the election joining us now from Sao paolo is Sarah ... who is Brazil correspondents for the economist Sara welcome to want to\nThank for having me\nRemind us about ... he's been pretty controversial explain to us why\nWell Booker has been a congressman for her a couple of decades now and has really become a film or blacks or any particular\nLegislation that got her and more for he's at a pastry ... comment and a woman and a minorities and ... and go and and ... even when they\nBurn a provocative recognize when they go a lot of people compare him to come by its own otherwise known as ... ... acres so\nI'm ... ... ... ... ... and I think an outsider or get on and then I got around to pretend to be going into a kind of hoping a so called up and put the country back on TALK\nShows that why he's so popular I mean you know the Brazil has had a number of issues that kind

U. dot org glad to hear from some of you across the state of Florida\nAbout what you're looking for from the next governor\nLarry tweeted I Hope it when he wins mayor Gillum will remember the poorest counties in my former home of the northwest Florida panhandle\nThey may be the reddish to parts of Florida but represents a real opportunity for a Democratic Party reaching out to the working class\nPresent a real opportunity for a Democratic Party reaching out to the working class citizens of our state\nLarry that is a such an important point and I have to tell you having just helped to lead my community through the impacts of hurricane Michael er we had Ninety percent of our power knocked out thousands of trees come down roads that were blocked\nA within a week uh we had Ninety nine and a half percent of people with their power restored roads cleared\nAnd a sense of normalcy returned to my community and the first thing we did was dispatch a our utility workers or to the western panhandle just west of us\nAre to begin that recovery effort for our neighbors are the Gulf Coast region will return we will return stronger than ever but the next governor will help to preside over that restoration\nUh when when we are hit with natural disasters we come together as Floridians ah whether or not that that politically that that is a community that will be for me\nIs of no consequence there Floridians\nAnd there were a part of a of our state they is often been forgotten forgotten coast would not be forgotten under a governor Gillum not only are we going to see that community restored we're also going to work with them to help to define an economic future for that region that again makes them the pride of the state of Florida\nWe had one more voice to our conversation let me follow up with you on that a little bit one of the conversations that constantly comes up whether it was after Hurricane Harvey last year after hurricane Michael this year Hurricane Florence earlier\nIs about the future of these coastal communities you know parts of Florida like Mexico beach in basically the whole Florida coastline all the way around the state or in areas\nWhole Florida coastline all the way around the state or in areas that are very much at risk for rising water levels ... Gulf levels ocean levels as climate change progress is and it becomes increasingly difficult matter as to whether or not people are allowed to live\nRight next to the shore I mean you saw the satellite or the the drone pictures\nOf homes that were built up to the two thousand one building code and homes that weren't the whole world were standing and homes and weren't were were were to fix basic that's where I felt as governor that that's got to be a tough decision kind of considering whether or not the state of Florida at a certain point\nHas to tell people we know you love the ocean we know you love the Gulf but it is not safe to live here\nYou know it's it's such a fair point an and and and and and in fact speaking about building codes or we may have to revisit a building codes again and light of the fact that we're seeing stronger in and and more increase storms I'm particularly up the Gulf where the Gulf waters are so warm\nBut then if then if you tell people where they can't live that affects the property tax base that affects the economy I mean what less\nThan right now we have the insurer a last resort in this state have undercover homes\nI'm Better nice and luxurious and yes you know ocean front properties but private insurance companies are refusing to write policies there and so that puts the entire state at risk for having to ensure a homes that are being built in areas that are increasingly becoming\nUm a a threatened by rising sea levels so so what I Would say is is that we are deserving of a real statewide conversation likely county by county around how it is\nWhy conversation likely county by county around how it is that we are going to be building more resilient communities that in the face of sea level rise in climate change that it doesn't make sense and some of these areas that we allow for property to be built\nAnd to be built and frankly in an ... way when we know that they are going to be susceptible to being wiped out\nUh with these increased storm of events and with sea level rise I I Can't I Can't tell you that there's a panacea ... I Can't I Can't tell you in this moment what exact part of the state we would be having to begin this conversation I think is going to be a state wide conversation and it's one that we're gonna have to lean into with county and local governments\nI Want to reiterate by the way we did invite the Republican candidate for Florida governor on defenses to take part in this discussion or a future discussion we have not yet heard back from his campaign but the invitation stands we would certainly love to have him on the program\nWhich I had one more voice of the discussion now to the questioning now joining us from W ELL are in public radio in Miami is Luis Hernandez who's the host of its daily talk show son dial Luis welcome to want to a\nA Joshua thank you so much I appreciate it and mayor again thank you I appreciate the opportunity I Do want to note that ah thirty one of sixty seven counties in Florida have started early voting and the counties are most of the counties here in the W well around listening area including Palm Beach Florida in Miami Dade county's have begun early voting\nI'm Mr Mayor it looks as though Republicans are going to hold the Florida House and Senate so how do you plan to get any of your ideas through if you're posing parties in control of the two chambers\nWell one ah Luis good to hear your voice again a I'm a to um\nGood to hear your voice again a I'm a to 'em and we're well aware and thankful for you remind you of the early voting we actually has some of our supporters who overnight it\nLast night watching the debate and where the first in line to vote down in Miami for early voting but to your question one I Am not joined the conclusion that Republicans will hold the Senate um I think they will likely be in position to to hold the house but I think Democrats will get some gains\nThat being said we will have a divided government um um I Would say this I think we've got to look too aware of the areas where we might be able to find some cooperation\nI'm I mentioned earlier that I thought criminal justice reform was one area where we might be able to bring Democrats and Republicans together to help or get a salvage solution that might lead to a saving money\nAnd modernizing or a system that is in desperate need of update 'em and I will tell you I'm a I'm willing and prepared to work with or what might be a speaker holy ... Oliva\nI'm here and I spent some time together or for two years or making our way through\n'em and Aspen Institute fellowship where we got to know each other pretty well now I don't take that to mean that I'm going to convince them to believe in everything I Believe or vice versa but I definitely think that we begin from a place where we don't think of each other as you know our enemies if you will\nUm were sent there to do the bidding to do the job of of of the people of the state and it's my hope to find areas where we can work together maybe on affordable housing\nOr maybe on dealing with health care in some ways can I convinced them that it makes sense to pull down that six billion dollars I'm for health care which is for the state of Florida one of the most ...\nUm for health care which is for the state of Florida one of the most exploding parts of our budget\nUm so I'm I'm not beyond working with the other party I also don't draw the conclusion that you have to be the same party in order to work together you probably recall that there were a number of sessions where governor Rick Scott couldn't get his budget through and he shared the same party or with the speaker of the house and with the with the Senate president so\nThere there there may be some benefit in my opinion to negotiating into them negotiating with me and trying to ah find solutions I Know Floridians are tired of us getting nothing done they want their government to work for them and they're not interested in our part isn't you know squabbles they want to make sure that we can produce\nAnd and you mentioned a couple of different things or one I wanted to approach you on is the criminal justice issue you know been public about the fact that your family had run ins with the law on both Miami Dade County and when you went to Gainesville\nUh one of your brothers was arrested on drug trafficking charges you mean criminal justice reform one of the critical points of your campaign for governor yeah how did your family's experience with the law at a young age inform these proposals for updating the state's criminal justice system\nI mean so first I mean a a shape it shaped it a lot I think if if you recall from my opening video when I introduced myself I talked to a bit about\nYou know watching my mother you know two years well up in our face when uh you know the the ... come by the house and say you know your son's in trouble again right um that that's a difficult thing for any child to have to see and experience and I remember deciding at a very early age that I never wanted to see\nThat expression on my mom's face because of something\nSee that expression on my mom's face because of something that I did\nUm and so I Am the first to my seven siblings to graduate from high school and as the fit the seven kids and the first to graduate from college when my brother got home after doing his time um I watched him want to be a better father for his daughter and a better partner or to his girlfriend and then to his wife [noise]\nUm and he went and apply for a job to job at the job and got told no after no after no\nAnd it really did shake my belief that listen how can we say we want people to pull themselves up by the bootstraps to redeem themselves to re introduce themselves into society when we then create all of these barriers that keep them from being able to do just that\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from progressive insurance offering a way to buy a home insurance with their home quote explorer tool custom

double you all are in public radio and Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum Louis I Know our time is short but let me let you get another question for the mayor\nYou know definitely a mayor I I did want to ask you about the issue of race because it's been a pervasive throughout this campaign uh but you already know this lord is one of the most diverse populations in the country or the latest census data says that ... sixteen percent of the population is black twenty five percent\nHispanic or Latino how's your campaign connecting with black and brown voters to get them galvanized to take part in this midterm election [noise]\nI mean I think we are doing 'em all the right things to try to communicate across frankly all communities um\nI've been in red areas blue areas purple area I was in ... I think Trump one button thirty points Flagler about the same much we've been to the villain\nPoints Flagler about the same much we've been to the villages are but we are here you know I I Will be at the University of South Florida where I Am today I'm with students um uh just did a roundtable with a Puerto Rican leadership in Orlando a hosted in event\nUm um buddy quest for getting them I'm a a little while ago and was in Little Haiti and did a video because I couldn't make it down there a ... doll\nEr which went really well so we're we're communicating across constituencies and just to give you an example of I think how waited impacting us\nIs that in the primary election we saw a hundred and fifty thousand bow to turn out to vote who either one we're voting for the first time or two we had not voted in the previous three elections a hundred and fifty thousand\nOr the last two races for governor Democrats lost by less than Seventy thousand votes\nUm it's my plan to double that number in this general election of unlikely voters and many of those voters will be younger voters of color are more women are more poor voters and I think we're going to perform very very well but the reason why I'd been going to diverse parts of our state\nIs because we got to stop treating the race for governor as if it's the electoral college you don't win one area and lose another when one county and lose another the one who wins is the one who gets one more vote and that one vote may come through from anywhere throughout the length and the breath of this day so I'm prepared to go there\nWe're going to win because we're going to give voters a reason to turn out and vote for something and not just against\nAre so many things I Would love to ask you mayor Guillen so many great policy questions we've gotten from our listeners perhaps we'll have a chance to talk to you again but one more a matter of policy I'd like to ask you\nTo you again but one more matter of policy I'd like to ask you about before we let you go and that has to do with a gun policy in the state of Florida ... two questions from two of our listeners by email Jim emailed\nMayor Gillum given that at least the house will be in Republican hands what can be done to reduce the impact of Florida's Stand your ground law it seems unlikely you would be able to repeal it\nAnd then Ryan emailed what do you plan to do to better enforce current gun control laws before trying to pass new legislation ...\nYeah well first I'm a I think we have to work hard I'm at the repeal the stand your ground it is an unnecessary law and the state of Florida we already had castle doctrine which allows for individual to protect themselves and their businesses against intruders 'em up onto their property\nRight I'm Sorry I I I hate to interrupt I think we should probably be cleared the difference between we're talking about just by way of contacts the castle doctrine you're referring to\nBasically is that kind of your home is your castle idea that says you have the right to use deadly force to defend yourself at home weren't worth stand your ground carries it farther and says you have the right to use deadly force and they feel threatened in any where you have a window right to be just\nAnywhere yeah and again that's that's vigilante gives them a that's the wow wow west and the city streets of you're able to make a decision\nOr about whether or not you consider somebody to be a threat I'm Out of your own imagination or in the recesses of of of your own mind and I think that that is dangerous castle doctrine already production your home there's already common last self defense which means and places where you are in public square and you result\nIs where you are in public square and you result to having to defend yourself with deadly force there's already case law\nOn the books where you've been able and you've seen cases where people are able to successfully argued the case that it made sense to be able to use deadly force but to not take that to a different ditched dream and to provide under the cover and the color of the law people being able to sniff out innocent life based based off of their perception of threat\nTo me is is is it is a stretch too far\nUm as it relates to what we can do obviously on that\nI I Want to make the case and I want to use regular voices of Floridians to make the case\nOr to our lawmakers around the absence of common sense when it comes to these kinds of laws and to help them understand how families like mine and like others who are raising black children\nAnd black and brown children feel particularly I'm a under siege by laws like these take the case of Trayvon Martin and the trace of Martin the case of marquee smug locked in a and there are many others and quite frankly talk to prosecutors who are saying and are seeing\nA criminals on both sides who are using stand your ground\nAs a way to take out there you know they're they're gang enemies because they both have weapons so it has also been extended to giving cover for for legitimate illegal practices in our communities and prosecutors are left to do nothing about it because folks are able to ... stand your ground as a ...\nPoint before we let you go with regards to enforcing current gun laws before trying to pass new ones what would you say the ...\nI Would say one yes we must enforce a current laws\nSo I Would say one yes we must enforce a current laws but we also got to do things like\nEnsure that if you want to carry the power of God at your waist but you ought to have a background check\nTo do things like a convicted a domestic violence abuses should not get access to weapons where they can sniff out the lives of their loved ones closing the gun show loophole these are extreme these aren't radical I was too by the n._r._a. in Tallahassee because we refused to repeal an ordinance that our city was simply said you can't shoot guns in city parks\nYou can't shoot guns in parts for our kids play and our and our families picnic\nAnd that was considered to be too extreme we've lost the common sense of balance here we're not talking about in the front of the second amendment was simply talking about how do we keep our kids safe in school how do we reduce the level of of ongoing everyday gun violence that pervades our neighborhoods\nAnd we got to rip resource them decency here and unfortunately they enter re runs roughshod over the state of Florida right now we got to put some decency back into it\nAndrew Gillum the mayor of Tallahassee, Florida running for governor as a Democrat mayor Gillum we really appreciate you making some extra time for so thanks very much thank you for the opportunity good luck everybody and go vote to liberty

trends in laws on unions involving the public sector workforce like teachers firefighters and government employees they make up one of the most heavily unionized sectors of America's workforce\nBack in June the Supreme Court passed a ruling that could make it harder for unions to secure a labor contracts through a process known as collective bargaining the ruling affects more than twenty states and the consensus is it that\nAffects more than twenty states and the consensus is that the decision will hurt unions financially and could lead to a further decline in membership ahead of that ruling some blue states took steps to protect organized labor\nWhat impact will all of this have on the labor movement and what impact does it having on election season\nJoining us here in Studio to discuss it is Scott Greenberger executive editor of state line a journalism project of the Pew Charitable trusts Scott welcome back to ... thanks very much for having me we also welcome your questions and thoughts about what's happening in your state with regard to unions we would love to hear from you whether you are a union worker or organizer\nWhether you are an employer whether you're in the private sector of public sector\nShare what you know about how your state lawmakers are dealing with unions email us one a at\nW. A. M. U. dot org comments on our Facebook page or tweet us at one a Scott let's get some definitions out of the way first of all when we say collective bargaining what are we referring to\n[noise] uh when we say collective bargaining or what we're talking about our negotiations between uh employers and a group of employees are on salaries benefits working conditions and the like and typically employees are represented by unions\nKind of basic wages and working conditions exactly now a number of states have a right to work laws on the books that are called right to work states what exactly do we mean by right to work\nSo a right to works a states and there are about to I think twenty seven twenty eight of them now uh they prohibit labor unions and employers from requiring workers to pay union dues as a condition of employment ah and of course a union dues are it's\nOf employment uh and of course a union dues are extremely important because that enables the unions to not only um conduct the negotiations during collective bargaining but also a to engage in other activities um including a political activities\nSo if you are at a job at a a union covered workplace typical you know what I mean in a non right to work state you get that job and you join the company and they say hey walking with his job were covered by union here's your initiation fee you need to pay\nIn a right to work state you can get the job and say no thanks I'm not eager to pay for this but I look forward to starting work that's right\nHow old this union membership look in the U.S right now are we talking mostly about public sector workers like teachers more private sector workers like hotel workers some of whom are on strike right now what's the overall picture\nSo this picture has changed dramatically in the last several decades it used to be in this country that most ah when we talked about unions we were talking about private sector unions\nDetails on line that you you F.

A. M. U. dot org\nSyria there was one more thing I didn't want to ask you before\nWe had to let you go we heard from a number of listeners about their thoughts on being in unions not every teacher is satisfied with the union that they're in granted I Can't think of any union that makes all of its members happy but we did hear from John in San Diego who left this voice mail in our inbox\nI'm a member of a teacher's union and while I Do appreciate all the things that union negotiations or us on our behalf like salary health insurance\nAll that kind of stuff um I Do feel like that sometimes the unions can prevent it higher level Caesar accountability that would ultimately lead to higher salaries more competition within the profession I feel that sometimes wants teachers achieved\nTenure that's negotiated underneath of the union contracts\nThat were unable to continue to drive competition and the teaching market and ultimately compare ourselves to other business areas where competition drives salary growth\nJohn thanks very much for getting in touch with Sarah I'm Wondering what you think of John's commented does have a point to unions allow workers to sometimes rest on their laurels\nWell and I'd like to make a couple of comments about that first off I've not always been happy with everything that night and has done the one thing that I really realized especially this past spring is that the Iranian\nNot always been happy with everything that my union has done but one thing that I really realized especially this past spring is that the union is the numbers\nThe union is not just your union leaders union movements are driven by members and members need to demand\nAnd you know what they want to see the union do also I Would say I think there's some misunderstanding about you know teacher hiring practices and firing practices um it's actually not\nThat difficult to fire a teacher but what unions has done is made it clear that you can't just fire a person for no reason you do have to give them due process you have to observe then you have to evaluate them you can't just say well we don't really like what you said so we're going to let you go or you know and\nPart of the reason that so important is because\nTeachers that have been around for a lot longer receive higher pay and if we did not have that due process in place you would see a lot of teachers let go simply because they make higher salaries and you know counties can save money by not keeping those teachers around\nBefore I let you go through I Know that your goal is to get into West Virginia house of delegates in trying to work with your dog it's about improving\nPolicies for teachers what about West Virginians do you think the residents of your speed or really motivated to see the kinds of changes you're trying to bring about I mean if they were motivated than I Wonder if it would have taken the strike to make things happen in West Virginia\nI think that they are motivated and I do believe that that is why the strike was so successful we could not have done what we did without the support of our communities and I think that our communities realize you know it was portrayed in the media as if the strike was just about pay or just about healthcare it's not about that\nNot just about that it's about improving conditions for students for teachers for families and for working people in general um I have seen with my own eyes legislators repeatedly putting the interests of outside corporate interests\n... with my own eyes legislators repeatedly cutting interest that outside corporate interests over their own people in this state and that is what I Want to stop\nSarah Duncan a candidate for the west Virginia House of delegates also a visual arts teacher Sarah we appreciate Jamaican time forest thanks very much\nThank you let's I had a few more voices to the conversation now but first let me read a few of your comments bill in Cleveland emailed I don't think workers should be forced to join a union but I also don't think that those who choose not to join should receive the benefits of the union's efforts\nNon union members should go it alone and individually negotiate their pay and benefits with their employer you can't have it both ways\nLuke tweeted how we govern unions seems to be the wrong question if working conditions were good or fair equitable enough unions would be a necessary so maybe ask how do we govern employers\nScott I think we should be clear with regard to bill from Cleveland ... comment about non union members going it alone and individually to go shooting just to be clear for people who've never been part of a union\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but a union contract is a floor not a ceiling it's the basic wages and working conditions workers can negotiate for more if they want\nBut a union contract kind of sets the minimum the basis for all the workers working conditions right\nI Believe that's the case I mean there's a lot of variation from state to state and workplace or to work place when it comes to um union rules and and the sort of um uh uh differences that you were talking about\nI Know someone that we should put that question too I think is an expert on down in ... and she's joining us NYC in New York Randi Weingarten is the president of the American federation of teachers which is the second largest\nWeingarten is the president of the American federation of teachers which is the second largest teachers' union in the U.S Randy welcome to one day\nHey Joshua and that Sarah and Sarah is one of these awesome members and I she's running in and Barry ... district and I hope she makes that one of the three hundred teachers is running\nI Do want to talk to you a little bit more about that in a moment I should also union contract I actually I don't usually contract so I said also introduced Vincent ... he's a senior fellow at the Mackinac Center for public policy and senior policy adviser at the state policy network and he joins us from Michigan Radio Vincent welcome\n[noise] hey thank you for having me on principle if I was gives me Randy before we continue could I just put that question to you in terms of members going it alone just for the sake of clarity a collective bargaining agreement is a floor it's not a ceiling you could negotiate for more but the point of a CPA is to save views or at least the minimum working conditions and wages right\nWell um it's in in some in some industries it's a floor now the ceiling\nIt depends on what the clause is about ... flu city um and the beginning clauses of a union contract\nSometimes it's for everyone and sometimes it's a floor and sometimes it covers all of the conditions of um of employment including pay okay so it it it it changes from place to place it's not monolithic\nOkay good that's that's that's a good con ... a context for folks maybe who never been in a union to know that it can be that they're they're mileage me very Vincent you you have said that the oral arguments in the gym is case that Supreme Court case we mentioned earlier led to the teachers strike this spring house so well that's right but\nFirst strike this spring house so\nWell that's right but before we get to that let's just go back to find exactly what right to work isn't exactly what Janice brought to public employees across the country All right to work all Janice means is that a union can get a worker fired for not paying them it doesn't affect collective bargaining in any other way\nUnions workers can still negotiate with employers over wages hours working conditions\nAnything they could before right to work for ...\nSake you negotiate for after it\nExcept for the ability to say you're ... you must pay us or you're fired\nAnd going back to that contract is a a floor and not a sale like uh the vast majority of collective bargaining agreements especially those are the public sector\nHave seniority built to enter the only way to get a raise is by logging another your other job hey I'm andme all ready to go ahead and finish off um so I I I actually agree with Bill um you know workers should have the ability to negotiate individually if they want to the Mackinac center has model legislation it's called the workers choice\nThat allows public employees to fully opt out of union representation represent themselves and negotiate a better contract if they can\nIf union worker and if you know as workers don't pay unions to negotiate for them how can that not have an impact I mean you have to pay the staff that negotiates where you're writing\nA the problem is that they are forced to accept that representation whether they want it or not\nDon't know I hear you on that I I I hear you on that piece I just want to make sure we're clear on the argument you're making if the staff to go shoot your contract he's paid and there are workers who choose not to pay into that staff how could that not have an impact I mean you got to pay these people right well at the staff is doing good job I mean I work\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from fidelity investments taking a

A. M. uses station they care about and so they choose to give and so the barometer we have\nOf whether we're doing what people want is their willingness to become members to become sustaining members to give to write us or whales to donate their cars to be you know cashed out to to support the station\nIt feels like a similar argument with folks and right to work states where they say if unions are doing what they are members want them to do\nIf unions are doing what they are members want them to do you have to compel them to pay their dues they will pay gladly because they'll know what they're getting from the union be tempted on their own it's absolutely essential what's wrong with that argument\nSo Joshua it's frankly the arguments and the point that Janice case has ... has decided that you know everything is completely voluntary the argument used to be this\nThat if you are creating a staff and I'm an entity that is a bargaining contracts and representing all of everyone\nThan it shouldn't just be the people with the loudest voices\nThey get the attention it should be everyone who gets the attention and that just like in terms of taxes to the United states of America or to\n'em or or bar association fees or student loans see or student organization fees\nThat when you have an obligation to serve all that all pay a fair share and that was the argument that actually had a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in the boot case\nAbout forty five years ago and six successive Supreme Court rulings that affirmed it abuse which leads to a gym is overturned exactly so but look Janice\nThat Alito Sam Alito judge of the Supreme Court has wanted this case has asked for this case for years most people thought it was it a a logically base because the issue was really on the outside that that the the case that the Mackinac center I Wish they were being more honest about it that the Mackinac center\nThe ... center I Wish they were being more honest about it that the Mackinac center that Donald Trump that others made was that you know the Democratic party used unions as their foot soldiers so let's defund unions that had really nothing to do with other kinds of things and therefore they want us to define does however the cases done\nAnd what has happened since\nIs that members have stuck with unions and and and and and Vincent said something else which I think was\nOr Scott there which I think I just want to raise which is that the Mackinac center actually violated all sorts of school board policy and all sorts of norms and laws by the day after the genocide case sending an email on school email to ... to virtually every single teacher in ten states\nIf we we if we had done that\nPeople would be slapping around rightfully what we do is we actually organize I'm outside of school and what we've tried to do is basically say to to the states just give us some time so we can introduce people to the union\nLet me give a drink and the chance to respond and then we'll keep moving by the way it is worth knowing that the Mackinac center did file a friend of the court brief in the uh Janice versus Ashby case but go ahead Vin let me give you a chance to respond\nWell hey thank you and you know there's groups across the country that are communicating with public employees to tell them about their rights mackinaw has their my pay my said dot com website I'm In Ohio to go back to your previous caller there's the workers choose dot org website\nAnd these efforts are needed because unions like Randy's are trying to trap public employees into paying them or trying to limit the time that they can\nPoison to paying them or trying to limit the time that they can exercise their rights under jazz um in some cases in credibly confusing time periods or in some cases only about a week also that\nUm states like New York New Jersey California give unions the ability to essentially have captive audience meetings or make their sales pitch to a public employees while at the same time forbidding anybody else from talking to that our employees and this is during the work\nThat way clerk clerk or what you mean by a captive audience ... what what exactly are you referring to [noise] um well recent\nLegislation passed in several states gives unions the ability to do what they call a orientation sessions with a with new employees so basically think it's time share presentation on steroids where the union can come and\nSay this is why you have to join put a dues check off for a more a membership form in front of them say you have to you know here's why you really shouldn't side up\nAnd there is no one else saying well wait a minute you know you actually have the right not to so that's why you're seeing all these efforts these educational efforts around the country saying no to know your rights\nAnd by the way if there is a artificial time period to limit\nWhen you can exercise your rights I'm this is what it is and shares help navigating that often confusing process and that process that's may confusing on purpose to keep public employees trapped\nI Want to move on from his lead to to see if we can move on and and go a little bit further forward in terms of what the future legislative landscape for this may be I Will say that I have done union covered worked in the state of California before and I never went through

I'm not denying climate change but it could very well go back you know we're talking about all that ... they say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just had with Michael says that they say I mean they say that and the ... what about scientists and say it's worse than ever\nClearly climate change it's tough to discuss despite overwhelming scientific evidence of its existence\nOr maybe because of that evidence I mean think about it if someone tried to hit you over their head with a bunch of facts and figures Supreme Lee confident that they are right and you are wrong\nHow would you feel or if someone flat out refused to hear you out despite the facts being really clear and just dug in their heels to avoid feeling like they lost an argument\nDoug in their heels to avoid feeling like they lost an argument would that be like\nWe want to elevate this debate to change the way we talk about climate change and we want to hear from you where do you stand on the issue and what is it been like discussing it with people whose views are different from yours what's worked and what has not\nJoining us from K. U. L. W. public radio in Seattle is Sarah ... a research associate at the University of Washington she holds a PHD in ecology from UC Davis she also founded the row in Institute a group that empowers leaders to tackle climate change Sarah welcome to want to say\nThanks for having me joining us from NPR in New York is Paul Bledsoe a lecturer at American University's Center for environmental policy American owns W. A. M. U. the station that produces won a\nHe's also a former climate advisor to the Clinton White house and a strategic advisor at the progressive Policy Institute poll welcome\nThanks structural Sarah I Wonder if we should just framed a discussion very clearly first of all this is a conversation that's for skeptics and believers alike right this is bigger than just is climate change ... this kind of feels to me like the human aspect\nOf working our way through this issue right\nYeah I definitely this is something that impacts all of the political decision making aspects of our public life right now how we're integrating science and how were you how we're essentially distorting science across this partisan divide that Israeli characterizing this political moment in our nation right now\nNow we heard from President Trump and that sixty minutes interview just a few minutes ago on that note John left us this note in our inbox\nSonny highs around sixty five degrees sunshine Thursday Friday and Saturday with hides in the upper sixties for the elbow area\nWho\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the doors do charitable foundation whos clinical scientists development towards support promising early career physician scientists and their research efforts to improve human health\nFrom the George ... foundation working to make Cleveland and northeast Ohio more globally competitive livable sustainable and just more information available at gun foundation dot org and from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nIs one a I'm Joshua Johnson we're discussing climate change and what we discuss when we discuss climate change with Sarah my re founder of the ruined Institute and Paul Bledsoe a promissory a lecture at American University Center for environmental policy\nWherever you are on the spectrum of belief with regards to climate change what kind of conversations\nAre you having with people in your life about climate change have you been able to win any one over have you had any arguments that just went sideways tell us what this conversation it's been like for you comments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U.\nDot org we know that for quite a few if you're discussing climate change can be difficult\nSome of you been giving us your suggestions for what has worked for you or what might work Melissa writes for my Bible friends I remind them that we are called to be good stewards of the earth nothing the environmentalist or suggesting would cause harm\nNothing the environmentalist or suggesting would cause harm from my fiscally conservative friends I talk about the economics green power is more profitable and this is the future economy more jobs better jobs saving the earth for their grandchildren is way down on the list\nWe also heard from some of you who are dealing with the difficulties of discussing climate change Caitlin left this note in our inbox\nGroucho go that route actually than I Am and I'm saying and I'm very interested in protecting the environment and teaching others about\nClimate change\nI Want to know ways in which I can better explain myself to others are\nJust regular people who might not have the education that I had about climate change because from where I'm standing it plainly ... what's going on and it just seems like we really need to come together and actually make a change or there's going to be a really bad and\nCaitlin thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with his poll I Wonder how you would respond to Caitlyn particularly because I think sometimes if I may just add to your comment the terminology often gets in trouble I mean some people use the phrase climate change some people say extreme weather as some people say global warming and\nJust beginning to get on the same page can be one of the core problems of talking about all this it's a great point we\nTo recognize that the good news is we have the solutions to address this problem the technical solutions the energy solutions with a policy solutions what we lack our political will and consensus around action we know that we have to pay the global emissions by twenty twenty and go to\nKnow that we have to ... global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have the technologies renewable carbon capture\nA electric vehicles and many others to make that happen if we make a real push but it is going to take a huge push likely made during the Cold War I Wish the country would come together over this expression of American leadership\nLeading the world again to safety I think that's possible but when one party in the United states it's a nice factual information over twenty year period then elects a president who almost campaigned on it it becomes very difficult to engage with that and I think voters\nMay reflect that in this midterm election\nGeorge tweeted as an environmental health scientist I focus on telling people\nAbout the immediate and local clean air health benefits that will go to people in locations taking action to address climate change pollution and reducing fossil fuel burning irrespective of opinions on climate\nKatie emailed my family has vacation in Mexico beach in Florida for twenty plus years and we have many friends and loved ones from Panama City who have lost everything meaning in hurricane Michael\nMy father is it this believer of climate change and it's been very upset about losing a place we love so much he won't consider that just maybe there is a greater thing at play here what is it going to take for this to change how do we those who are convinced that is happening changed the way we talk about it and rather than shutting down the conversation\nNurture it Sarah how would you respond to Katie\nGosh that's really\nHow would you respond to Katie gosh that's a really really great question and I can feel that the pain that she's in the last that her family is\nStruggling with to describe and\nYou know this is this is the peace around recognizing how difficult this information is like I got exposed to the science of climate change when I started graduate school and it took me\nLike six years to integrate the scale of difficulty of that information and it it people can get exposed to the science of climate change and it ... they can be in such a vulnerable place that is actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues\nSo the the way that we unpack this I think\nIs through um through relationship and trust and empathy um because as we interact as individuals and we come to terms with the scale of the change and the crisis you can have a lot of really base all emotion and fear anger um [noise]\nI anxiety all of these pieces that are we all ... away from those very challenging emotions and often when we feel those emotions we shouldn't into our part is in corners\nWhere we think we know the way the world is and we we become ever more entrenched in our existing world view and that's why being honest that yeah this is a really difficult conversation and that's exactly why we're having this conversation is one of the ways to start\nSarah if I could just dig in a little deeper on that I Wonder if this idea of being empathetic and being a little\nGive this idea of being empathetic and being a little compassionate might also speak to the conversations with folks who feel very fatalistic I mean it's hard not to read the latest report from the un climate change by which we discussed last week on this program and not feel like well we're all going to die anyway\nWhy bother run up your credit because they're not going to be around to collect you know what I'm saying like it just feels like an intractable problem and I wonder if maybe a little empathy for folks who feel that way would go a long way\nWell I Want to so yeah I got it and I I Want to remind remind us that as we sit\nWith the privilege of western lifestyles and we look at the science that we've invested public money into you know remembering that we're living a science fiction fantasy right now and we can look to human history and see that there are many other cultures around us\nAnd specifically in the U. S. Native American and indigenous Native American people\nWho have already experienced the kind of cultural eradication that we are looking at down the line and ... the the consequences from climate change we can look at the stories of human tenacity and how people struggle and survive\nThrough massive massive shift we know these stories and we can inform our strength and our resilience our courage by looking at the stories of for example the water protectors and the people who are standing at the front lines right now saying the earth is precious we only have one planet and we're all going to show up and\nI'm informed that the you know the public's eye of the necessity of staying in this place\nThat ... you know the public's eye of the necessity of staying in this place and and staying vigilant\nI Would just go go ahead go ahead ... but oh I Would just add that\nFatal ism is a reasonable reaction if you don't know the full range of solutions\nThat there's a lot of good news here\nTwo years ago we eliminated one of them six main greenhouse gases it will no longer exist on earth Twenty years from now with the golly agreement to phase out HFCs\nTurns out there three or four other super pollutants like methane and black carbon if we can reduce these quickly about three times the current rate\nWe can limit near term warming and prevent run away climate change we need education about the fact that we can take hold of the climate crisis and actually solve it exactly to combat that fade listen which is a serious problem and I I really do feel empathy for people who are overwhelmed by it\nAnd Paul just to dig into a little further what our HFCs\nAgencies are hydro floor carbons are manmade gas that ironically are used in refrigeration oh in air conditioners\nAnd they're growing incredibly quickly because we phased out an earlier set\nOf CFCs chlorofluorocarbons to fix the ozone hole by the way it's worth noting that that happened under Ronald Reagan a Republican so also noting that the acid rain problem was solved under George W Bush a Republican Republicans have historically\nA Republican Republicans have historically taken very responsible positions on environmental problems but they've gone off the rails lately and we need to help them help them back\nTopic ... and ... happening tomorrow six PM ... under the rose brewing details Nevada

would love your help with tomorrow's program about being Native American\nMassachusetts democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren recently announced that a DNA test has confirmed what she said all along but she is indeed of tribal heritage the test was the clock back to President Trump who mocked her for claiming that heritage and refer to her as Pocahontas\nCritics including some tribal leaders said direct ancestry matters more than DNA testing in this regard\nIt's just one of many issues that may have Native American voters talking head of the midterms ...\nIf you are Native American what has claiming\nThe midterms if you are Native American what has claiming your heritage meant to you what tribe or are you part of and how does that factor into your life\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a now if you're not Native American then share what your heritage means to you especially if it's something you learned about a little later in life what did you discover and how did it change you\nTell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a or you can leave us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Sarah my ... and Paul blood so let's get in a few more of your questions and comments before we move on Noel tweeted I teach clients to think of anxiety kind of like sugar a little gives you energy to get going and too much shuts down and drains you\nNeed to keep it at that middle area I guess\nLet's get back to Arlene's question on our website and and Paul I wonder if you could respond to her a lean rights\nSo if you change people's minds what then I see a lot of people who believe in climate change to do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives\nThere still driving around in gas guzzling SUVs owning their ... mentioned houses with the thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not ours\nNo doubt personal action is important not least so that you're not hypocritical when you advocate policy and political action but let's be clear that it will take large policy ...\nThat it will take large policy action to reduce emissions in the United states and globally to make the United states once again a global leader and cutting emissions to solve this problem we have the biggest thing you can do personally\nFor climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and vote in people who will and I don't mean trust Democrat and Republican because within those parties there are a few Republicans who acknowledge like uh the congressman from some South Florida um but\nThere are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not strong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is an imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote\nI think one of the kind of saving grace of the er at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with U.S policy issues but\nJust being able to have the conversation in a useful successful way I think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so by the by way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few comment objections to the basic argument around climate change and sort of role play how one might respond to those\nFor example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would have happened ... years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond\nTo that well I mean that things are happening right now so [laughter] they have it in that um that that those protections\nThere is evidence that um that those protections are coming through I mean all of the pieces of projections that we have seen around temperature and carbon\nConcentration I mean we are able to do a very good job at projecting a the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal\nThat I I guess the issues not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winter\nRight and and so like [noise]\nYes and there is ... so there's complexity and how the regional climate and the season out of different places are influenced\nBy the day that the on the Arctic weather system basically a collapsing and how and how that changes North American climate and so we do see these complexities and why\nAnd people get confused right because they're like well wait a second this is a massive storm but this is the fundamental distinction between weather and climate\nClimate ... we can measure climate for the last you know ... million years right and the the the climate for our planet has been awful lesions between ... glacial states\nAbrupt warming into into glacial followed by slow cooling into glacial states so that pacing of glacial enter glacial warming that cold too warm structure that was fundamentally paste by the changing geometric relationship between the earth and the sons\nOf Sarah backup dancers along on the changing geometric relationship between glacial into glacial stay last me it's so cool it's amazing what it's confusing like like bring it to nurse from it okay so in the last ... million years the the plants\nNurse for me okay so in the last million years that the planet's climate has been moving between glacial states where there's an eye on top of North American\nAnd you're Asian continent sea level is lower on it's a colder climate on and then in injure glacial state so we are in an inter glacial right now okay and that changed that cold too warm shift\nThis on this piecing this um oscillation its ... it's like a heartbeat of earth's climate and that heartbeat from cold to warm cold too warm that heartbeat with paste\nBy the ... and ... of the geometric in earth orbit and earth tilt as it moves around the sun\nSo I only make sure I'm following you this yeah heartbeat this earth heartbeat but to be on hold too warm cold too warm\nIt's almost like the earth is having cardiac arrest the heartbeat as off and the pattern is not what it's been for a million years and we can trace it to us is that kind of what you're saying that's exactly right I like ... okay that makes a little full pattern\nThat's been ... that's been happening for the last million years we uh we have fundamentally disturbed that pattern\nI yeah I was saying well we're on a super high cholesterol sugar fossil fuel diet has gotten or a blood pressure through the roof\nAnd um the climate system can't take that forever that will go out of control that's a perfect that's a perfect image that makes perfect sense one more thing I wanted to get to Paul and then we got to let you go shortly but\nFor folks who questioned the provenance of the science who the scientists are that came up during the sixty minutes interview who say I just don't trust the people where this data's coming from how do I know that they don't have a political agenda what would you say\nData's coming from how do I know that they don't have a political agenda what would you say to someone with that concern to try to work\nThrough that I I I understand that you can distress individual scientists but there is not a conspiracy of\nTens and hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world to create a problem actually I find it quite the opposite in many cases their understanding the nature of the problem because they don't want to seem alarmist the truth is that the problem is here now an imminent\nAnd that that's just the factual information on the ground we have already warmed up a degree and a half Fahrenheit we're on our way to well past three or even four Fahrenheit\nAnd it could spin out of control and that that's just the factual information I I I think we went with very few people actually denied about ten percent Fifteen Percent of the U. S. public actually denied climate science would I think we have to do is galvanized the Seventy five eighty percent who broadly accepted into action\nPublished so former climate advisor for the Clinton White house process or your lecture at American University Center for environmental policy and a strategic advisor at the progressive Policy Institute Paul thanks very much for talking to us thank you Josh\nAnd Sarah my re PHD research associate at the University of Washington and founder of the ...

Native American voters thinking about for the midterms\nMuch more than what's happening with Senator Elizabeth Warren and President Trump their ongoing feud over Warren claiming to have tribal ancestry the senator has addressed her heritage in the past including at this year's National Congress of American Indians\nI get why some people think there's hate to be made here\nYou won't find my family members on any rules in I'm not enrolled in a tried and I want to make something clear\nI respect that distinction I understand that tribal membership is determined by tried and only by tribes my mother's family was part Native American and my daddy's parents were bitterly opposed to their relationship\nNow in the scheme of things does it matter if Senator Warren really is a verifiable tribal heritage clearly it does to her especially after the president referred to her as Pocahontas and said he would give a million dollars to the charity of her choice if she could prove or ancestry\nThat apparently led the senator to take a DNA test who's results she says prove that she is Cherokee\nThat drew criticism from tribal leaders like the Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck Hoskins junior who spoke on MORNING edition\nUm and then we're now at the point where she's taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know\nAnd then we're now at the point where she's taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know a great deal about so that's what the concern is is that we're a sovereign nation we have a very specific\nAh means by which you are a Cherokee citizen that's true of all Indian nations and for a senator in this context of this ongoing back and forth political a fight or to talk about DNA I really undermines tribal interest frankly\nOn top of that the test did nothing to stop the presidents insults he tweeted quote\nPocahontas the bad version sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren is getting slammed she took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be one one thousand twenty fourth\nFar less than the average American now

in our inbox\nHi Sheila this is Carol elaborately ah I found out about oh four or five years ago that we had a lot of documentation from my mother to uh that we were part of the Choctaw tribe in Oklahoma we applied to be a member of the ... tribe we were accepted\nAnd it's been a real joy to be a member 'cause we um\nWe can vote now we get all kinds of information from them what they're doing with the tried just amazing\nCarol thanks very much for getting in touch with us more ... can you give us a sense of of what the process is for becoming an acknowledged tribal citizen understanding that every tribe has the right to set its own process and they can be be quite different but\nTribe has the right to set its own process and they can be be quite different but broadly speaking what what does it take\nYou usually a tribe has an enrollment committee of some kind that actually goes through and sets out the process required proving family connections to Simon said are looking for I'm basically I'm a history of involvement with the tribe that goes back um ah through time\nI mean one of the I think really important ideas and this is that I'm a tribal community is one that's been around\nIn many cases for tens of thousands of years and so this idea of a long arc and being part of that is I think really important one of the things I Love to think about as a shoney's once hunted bastard on\nHunted mastodon\nHunted vested I think about that long arc\nYeah yes it's a I Can't imagine Simon the benefit of just kind of knowing\nThat you're part of a community that goes back\nMillennia you talked about appropriation by whites of tribal culture\nAre there other kinds of benefits that you find when did their intrinsic or extra benefits\nOf being an acknowledge member of a tribe that are worth protecting that are worth keeping their proper places I mean Carol talks about being able to vote in the tribe and also just knowing what the tribe is doing what are the kind of benefits are there to being an acknowledge citizen of a truck\nWell I think what you kind of hit it right there with that that word protection I think that's for us it is we are it isn't coming upon us to protect our ... our our children are native languages are traditions are land\nThe water and the problem I see what these people that are doing these DNA test is booming biotechnology

and they can modify it they take our language and they can modify it they take our spirituality and modify it and they make money\nThey make money off of something that they just either learn they are or it's been a part of the family lore or they speak with some ... mugging titled meant\nLike they've lived the life of a native like somebody's ever called them an engine or a our word the name of the Washington football team and that's where it becomes problematic and we have to check these allies at the door even if it's Elizabeth Warren\nI should know by the way it was almost exactly a year ago today that we did a discussion about these DNA testing kits the ones that say find out your ancestry and learn what your family's from we did a program today's October Seventeen we did it on October Eighteenth of last year called ... where do we come from where we spoke to a geneticist\nAre named Adam Rutherford who's gone into some of the latest research about what DNA can and cannot

North Dakota voter disenfranchisement please focus on this\nProgressive she must have known why we both Kerry living 'cause we're going there next because over the past few days there's been this story about Senator Warren but Kerry we wanted to invite you on specifically to talk about what you were in progress has brought up there's a lot of focus on what's happening in North Dakota what is going on there\nWell North Dakota\nHas a voter identification law that has been stayed by the courts until now last week the Supreme Court\nDecided to essentially let it go into effect for the November election so what that means is new voter id requirements are going into force a month before the election\nAs you may know North Dakota is home to a very critical Senate race the race between us and our Heidi Heitkamp who's one of the most endangered Democrats and the Senate and us wrapped Kevin Cramer her Republican challenger\nPolls have Kramer ahead in twenty twelve setting the high camp one her race by fewer than three thousand votes with a very strong support from Native American voters she had\nA very strong support from three counties in North Dakota that that are majority Native American and so this voter id law\nCould potentially fall heavily upon Native Americans courts had stayed it because they said that the north Native Americans in North Dakota we're less likely to have the types of ID that were required the types of supplemental documentation that was required to get the idea and the first place\nAnd what kinds of ID are we talking about like what does the law requires\nThe central issue here is that the law requires an ID that carries a residential streets\nThe law requires an ID that carries a residential street address that's an issue because on many reservations that most people don't have that they have PO box is they have mailing address it and those addresses are no longer sufficient\nSo if you have ID but it carries a mailing address like a post office box you can no longer use it to vote in North Dakota and this election you could in the primary when this law was said by the court but that idea used in the primary is no longer good for the general\nElection a lot of these voter ID laws that have come up in the last few years have been justified by their supporters as an effort to root out voter fraud has that been the argument among the supporters of North Dakota as well\nAnd that's essentially correct It's been\nUm talked about as a measure to prevent voter fraud and also\nBecause the the state has argued that a mailing address\nDoesn't necessarily locate a voter in the correct precinct if you have a local race on the ballot someone could use a mailing address and and even at ... vote in the wrong local district in the wrong local race so it's it's also a voter die Lucian argument that that inappropriately cast valid and the wrong precinct would this would\nDilute the ones that were correctly cast if you're a mailing address the somewhere different than where you actually reside\nWould love to hear from some of you if you live in areas where this kind of voter id law affects you particularly if you are part of a tribal population there reservation maybe you live in an area where folks predominantly have fuel boxes as their primary mailing address rather than a physical street residential address\nWhat are you seeing and how is this affecting you whether you are in North Dakota or elsewhere love to hear from your your North Dakota but email is one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nToyota but email is one a X. W. A. M. U. dot org tweet us at one eight or comment on our Facebook page Jerry what did you hear from people in North Dakota about how this law is affecting them is this on people's radar is is kind of more of a a smaller as\nI say it is and also you have to put a link against the larger contact\nOr you'd see it as it is a big issue where does this ...\nOh I think it's really on people's radar absolutely an issue and I also think there's some context around it when I was reporting from North Dakota from the Standing Rock reservation which is in North and South Dakota but the north Dakota part is affected by this\nUm ... you know really one of the things that I was interested in one of the reasons I went there even before the Supreme Court ruling is because voter turnout there is the lowest in the state it\nWas the lowest in the state before this and that's because\nThere are challenges that people their face and getting to the polls so I I think you have this law now becoming a new complication for this election that has the potential to drive turnout even lower and you have people reacting to that their their excuse me their tribal governments and nonprofits\nLearned more at S.

without signaling you spit up behind me so I signaled and change lanes officer tried to laugh in your face as he asked for your license in registration\nLaugh in your face as he asked for your license and registration is that your man he asked you he needs to show some identification to\nYour hands came up to staring well and you pointed at the officers face move away from my car you said that as much how he is Fifteen Years old he does not have identification I mean I have your badge number please\nI hated how it sounded when you didn't use contractions the officer as both of us to step out of the car we will not get out of his car you said louder this time\nWe have done nothing wrong my fist were bald up and I was engine toward the driver's side window you slapped me across much that's what the back of your hand and told me to be quiet and unconscious surface right as another officer pulled up the first officer who is now laughing walk back to the second officers car\nYou eventually showed a second officer you license and your University of Maryland id\nOfficer looked at the id flipped it over and told us to have a good night never give them a chance to take a shot you finally said after we walked in the apartment and lock the door they will take it they will take it they will take it I wondered why you said it three times and why you never told me to shoot back\nMississippi Marilyn it doesn't matter where the where you are they will shoot your black but out of the sky every chance they get if you have a heart attack dodging bullets they hide their guns and say you kill yourself\nI hear you I told you and try to make you laugh why don't you just said don't instead of does not or doesn't and they instead of their though if I did not know correct English is more likely that officer might have shot us you said\nIt's more likely that officer might have shot us you said we wouldn't I told you that fool got matter because you were speaking correct English you looked at me like you were thinking you might actually be right key but in the long run correct English will save a black man more than it will hurt you will correct English they view though\nI Do not need saving you said I'm not the one who was an endangered species I'm not either I told you I'm an endangered species would a lot of gas in my stomach I'll be right back that cop gave me in a bubble guts you laughed and laughed and laughed until you didn't\nWhile I was in my room changing you told me to write about what I learned from the experience with the police I wasn't sure what the right because I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky\nIt seem like just driving or walking into a house or doing your job or cutting a grapefruit was all it took to get shot out of the sky\nAnd the biggest problem was police weren't the only people doing the shooting they were just the only people allowed to walk around and threaten us with guns in prison if they didn't like our style of flying I loved our style of fly\nOther eggs or for heavy bike here say leave and there is a lot\nGoing on to the eggs are but I think one of the census from the last paragraph struck me where you write I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky right is that kind of the crux of it yeah\nI mean that's the crux of a lot of uh the relationship our talk about in this book with my mother um I'm also talking about a situation where we went to had to go to a new ...\nAbout a situation where we went to had to go to a new school in eighth grade was the first time I've gone to school with white kids\nAnd a few my best friends from a previous school were there and one of my best best friends um took out a butter knife before school started and started trying to cut his grapefruit the same way he did every morning when we were at a school in Jackson and long story short you know the teacher uh eventually told them put the knife away treated the knife as if it was a gun\nOr we both got kicked out of school that day and we got what to buy our mothers grandmothers and in that situation I learned that sometimes in off in a mock communities um it was black mothers primarily who had to discipline their children for the failures of their teachers\nAnd so I my mother would always say you know you have to fly right you know don't give them a chance but I'm saying as a Fifteen year old I said I'm not sure what not giving them a chance to look like\nEating a grapefruit got us in trouble just now you didn't do anything we got in trouble later I Would take a library book out to the library without checking it out\nThat got in trouble so I just wasn't sure\nAbout this this a theory my mom had the you know you conduct them you can dodge them if you just anticipate every move and again anticipation is crucial but what happens to home life when you spend your entire life outside of the home anticipating white supremacy and white power doing un that's the question I'm trying to asking this section and also in the entire book\nWhat did happen with your home life particularly with with you and your mom as you were trying to grapple with these things that she was telling you or the way of the world and you were trying to understand them how did that affect your relationship with her yeah one one way I think\nA lot of just traditionally American things happen I started to be resentful\nJust traditionally American things happen I started to be resentful that my mother was telling me things some things that were raised some things that were wrong um she started to be a a a lot more active in trying to police to me as my body group um and I started to have lots and lots of run ins with cops are starting to get kicked out of school more [noise]\nUm but and we could talk about those things sorted we could talk about police we could talk about white people but we we couldn't talk about with things like sexual violence so we couldn't talk about with like domestic abuse she was in an abusive relationship I saw that relationship I reacted to that relationship I tried to fight and protect different relationship\nBut I Would never talk to her about that fight in our protection she saw me and relationships that were like difficult for me where I was being bad to myself where I was mistreated people emotionally we didn't know how to talk about any of it so while we're doing really good sort of talking about how we survive outside of the house\nThe particular kinds of violence as they were happening in my house were completely silent we never knew how to talk about it and it's so you know it took me until I was like forty to forty one years old to have the guts to actually write into some of what was happening in our house and try to connect that to what was happening outside of our house I Want to\nTalk more about your literary style but I did want to point out one other aspect of the anecdotes you just read\nWhere the officer looked at you and said who is that is that your man there's also this through line about people presuming that black boys are older than they are it was a factor in the shooting of to me or rice the young man who was shot dead in Cleveland, Ohio back in November of twenty

for the midterms\nMuch more than what's happening with Senator Elizabeth Warren and President Trump their ongoing feud over Warren claiming to have tribal ancestry the senator has addressed her heritage in the past including at this year's National Congress of American Indians\nGet why some people think there's hate to be made here you won't find my family members on any rules and I'm not enrolled in a tried and I want to make something clear\nI respect that distinction I understand that tribal membership is determined by tribes and only by tribes but my mother's family was\nOnly by trying my mother's family was part Native American and my daddy's parents were bitterly opposed to their relationship\nNow in the scheme of things doesn't matter if Senator Warren really is a verifiable tribal heritage clearly it does to her especially after the president referred to her as Pocahontas and said he would give a million dollars to the charity of her choice if she could prove or ancestry\nThat apparently led to senator to take a DNA test who's results she says prove that she is Cherokee\nThat drew criticism from tribal leaders like the Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck Hoskins junior who spoke on MORNING edition\nUm and then we are now at the point where she has taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know a great deal about so that's what the concern is is that we're a sovereign nation we have a very specific\nMeans by which you are a turkey citizen that's true of all Indian nations and for senator in this context of this ongoing back and forth political a fight or to talk about DNA are really undermines tribal interest frankly\nOn top of that the test did nothing to stop the presidents insults he tweeted quote\nPocahontas the bad version sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren is getting slammed she took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be one one thousand twenty fourth\nFar less than the average American now Cherokee Nation denies her quote DNA test is useless even they don't want her\nPhoney and quote\nWhat is the story actually means for Native Americans

Smith a Chicano writer and reporter CNN contributor and then a glut Lakota citizen\nMark ... editor of Indian country today and they showed ... Bennett citizen and Terry levine a senior reporter for the center for Public Integrity\nWe heard from quite a few of you who shared your stories about exploring your tribal ancestry about what that means to you in the context of your life here's one voice mail that was left in our inbox\nJoshua this is Carol Everly a I found out about oh four or five years ago that we had a lot\nBox Hi Sheila this is Carol elaborately uh I found out about oh four or five years ago that we had a lot of documentation from my mother to us that we were part of the ... tribe in Oklahoma we applied to be a member of the ... tribe we were accepted\nAnd it's been a real joy to be a member 'cause we um we can vote now we get all kinds of information from them what they're doing with the tried just amazing\nCarol thanks very much for getting in touch with us mark ... can you give us a sense of of what the process is for becoming an acknowledged tribal citizen understanding that every tribe has the right to set its own process and they can be be quite different but broadly speaking what what does it take\nYou usually a tribe has an enrollment committee of some kind that actually goes through and sets out the process required proving family connections to Simon said are looking for I'm basically I'm a history of involvement with the tribe that goes back um ah through time\nI mean one of the I think really important ideas and this is that I'm a tribal community has one that's been around\nIn many cases for tens of thousands of years and so this idea of a long arc and being part of that is I think really important ... one of the things I Love to think about is a shoney's was hundred mastodon hunted mastodon hunted messed it I think about that long arc\nYes I I it's I Can't imagine Simon the benefit of just kind of knowing\nThat you're part of a community that goes back\nMillennia you talked about appropriation by whites of tribal culture are there other kinds of benefits that you find whether their intrinsic or extra benefits of being an acknowledge member of a tribe that are worth protecting that are worth keeping in there\nTry that are worth protecting that are worth keeping in their proper places I mean Carol talks about being able to vote in the tribe and also just knowing what the tribe is doing what are the kind of benefits are there to being and acknowledge citizen of a truck\nWell I think what you kind of hit it right there with that that word protection I think that's for us it is we are it is incumbent upon us to protect our our our children are native languages are traditions are land the water\nAnd the problem I see what these people that are doing these DNA tests is booming biotechnology business where people want to know if they're native\nYou know they they the problem is some of them take our culture and they can modify it\nThey take our language and they can modify it they take our spirituality and modify it and they make money\nThey make money off of something that they just either learn they are or it's been a part of their family lore or they speak with some smog in title meant\nLike they've lived the life of a native like somebody's ever called them an engine or a our word the name of the Washington football team and that's where it becomes problematic and we have to check these allies at the door even if it's Elizabeth Warren\nI should know by the way it was almost exactly a year ago today that we did a discussion about these DNA testing kids the ones that say find out your ancestry and learn what your family's from we did a program today's October seventeenth we did it on October Eighteenth\nOf last year called ... where do we come from we spoke to a geneticist are named Adam Rutherford who's gone into some of the latest research about what DNA can and cannot tell us about ourselves and what you actually need to know if you were going to do one of these ...\nAnd what you actually need to know if you were going to do one of these home DNA test you'll find that conversation with Adam referred on our website the one a dot org that's the word the the number one daughter a dot org Brittany tweeted I Am a ... ... or mohawk\nAnd I'm frustrated with people claiming native as a race and doing nothing to help native issues or thinking that they're uninformed opinion on native issues is helpful\nYou a progressive tweeted what we're not talking about now is North Dakota voter disenfranchisement please focus on this\nProgressive she must have known why we both Kerry living because we're going there next because over the past few days there's been this story about Senator Warren but Kerry we wanted to invite you on specifically to talk about what you ate progress has brought up there's a lot of focus on what's happening in North Dakota what is going on there\nWell\nNorth Dakota has\nA voter identification law that has been stayed by the courts until now last week the Supreme Court decided to essentially let it go into effect for the November election so what that means is new voter id requirements are going into force a month before the election\nAs you may know North Dakota is home to a very critical Senate race the race between us and our Heidi Heitkamp who is one of the most endangered Democrats and the Senate and us wrapped Kevin Cramer her Republican challenger\nPause have Kramer ahead in twenty twelve setting the high camp one her race by fewer than three thousand votes with a very strong support from Native American voters she had\nA very strong support from three counties in North Dakota\nShe had a very strong support from three counties in North Dakota that that are majority Native American and so this voter id law\nCould potentially fall heavily upon Native Americans courts had stayed it because they said that that north Native Americans in North Dakota we're less likely to have the types of ID that were required the types of supplemental documentation that was required to get the idea and the first place\nSo what kinds of ID are we talking about like what does the law requires\nThe central issue here is that the law requires an ID that carries a residential street address that's an issue because on many reservations that most people don't have that they have PO box is they have mailing address it and those addresses are no longer sufficient\nSo if you have ID but it carries a mailing address like a post office box you can no longer use it to vote in North Dakota and this election you could in the primary when this law was said by the court but that I Do you use in the primary is no longer good for the general\nElection a lot of these voter ID laws that have come up in the last few years have been justified by her supporters\nAs an effort to root out voter fraud has been the argument among the supporters of North Dakota as well\nAnd that's essentially correct It's been\nUm talked about is a measure to prevent voter fraud and also\nBecause the the state has argued that a mailing address\nDoesn't necessarily locate a voter in the correct precinct if you have a local race on the ballot someone could use a mailing address and and even it'd vertically vote in the wrong local district in the wrong local race so it's it's also a vote or die Lucian argument that that inappropriately cast a ballot and the wrong precinct would this would\nDilute the ones that were correctly cast if your mailing address the somewhere different than where you actually\nDirectly cast if you're a mailing address the somewhere different than where you actually reside would\nLove to hear from some of you if you live in areas where this kind of voter id law affects you particularly if you are part of a tribal population there reservation maybe you live in an area where folks predominantly have fuel boxes as their primary mailing address rather than a physical street residential address\nWhat are you seeing and how is this affecting you whether you are in North Dakota or elsewhere love to hear from you if you're in North Dakota but email is one a at W. A. M. U. dot org tweet us at one eight or comment on our Facebook page\nCary what did you hear from people in North Dakota about how this law as affecting them is this on people's radar is is kind of more of a a smaller issue I'd say it is and also you have to put it against the larger contact I'm Sorry you see it as it is a is a big issue or does this ... oh I think\nIt's really on people's radar absolutely an issue and I also think there's some context around it when I was reporting from North Dakota from the Standing Rock reservation which is in North and South Dakota but the north Dakota part is affected by this\nUm ... you know really one of the things that I was interested in one of the reasons I went there even before the Supreme Court ruling is because voter turnout there is the lowest in the state\n... it was the lowest in the state before this and that's because there are challenges that people their face and getting to the polls so I I think you have this law now becoming a new complication for this election that has the potential to drive turnout even lower and you have people reacting to that their their\nExcuse me their tribal governments and nonprofits that are taking steps\nTo try and help people get residential address as if they need them assigned trying to make sure that they can obtain id\nLooking to mobilize voters and five\nThey can obtain id and looking to mobilize voters and find ways to get them to the polls whether those efforts will be successful given a short time frame I I don't think that's clear yet but I think you absolutely have a reaction to this sense that it's meant to suppress\nWhen I'm a guy support for NPR comes from this\nAnd my\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the Annenberg Foundation committed to supporting educating and engaging communities in the United states and globally for more than twenty five years learn more at Annenberg Foundation dot org\nFrom Americans for the arts committed to transforming America's communities through the arts and arts education supporting the nonprofit arts industry which employs four point six million people nationwide learn more at Americans for the arts dot org\nAnd from the any Casey foundation\nTomorrow we'll continue our conversation about the mid term elections with a national look at major races and issues we booked a great panel but we could use your help to focus the discussion what are your main questions and your main concerns about the midterms candidates polls voter turnout controversies or anything else\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a which we talk about tomorrow when we talk about the midterms on a national level it's eight five five to three six one two one two\nYou can also send us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop you can download the app that's V.

this year's midterms I mean you know Nancy Pelosi's named still comes up quite a bit on the campaign trail she's a of an obvious kind of a hot button for many Republican voters but\nIt is that working in terms of making people show up or is it just turning people off you\nKnow a lot of people might be an are frustrated with politics in the country but we're seeing the opposite effect of it not keeping people home or or voting for some third party coalition in fact it's people strapping on the T shirts and going as hard as they can\nI Do in their political corners I mean the fact is midterms are usually about activist they're usually about\nThe hardest core a people within the party but in fact we're seeing the potential for a surge this year in turnout I spoke to Michael McDonald who's a professor at the University of Florida who's really\nOne of the preeminent turnout experts in the country maintains a turnout database he expects there to be a turnout of about forty five fifty percent of eligible voters this year that doesn't sound like a lot but it would be the highest level for mid term since the mid Nineteen sixties\nAnd that is really spurred on by all of this high interest or seeing high turnout in primaries in in special elections\nAnd you know frankly you've seen Democrats really fired up to vote against this president and we've seen that according to a Pew sixty percent of people say the president is a factor in their vote and that's higher than it's ever been\nA wonder Juana Summers what your take is on that in terms of the the potential playbook for Democrats first of all let's\nThe the potential playbook for Democrats first of all ... context and focus on the house for example how many feet with the Democrats need to flip the house\nShirts that Democrats would need twenty three seats in order to take control of the house of representatives and right now most public pull in when we look across the landscape suggests that\nThey're doing they're making good efforts and things are looking good for them right now one thing that I've noticed as I've been talking to folks who work on the Democratic side of the aisle who are professional political folks is they're spending a lot of money to make sure that their voter turnout and particularly looking at the types of voters infrequent voters who say\nMay show up in a presidential election year but are more likely to stay home\nAnd I'm an off year or mid term here and there was a reason for that\nTypically when we look at the electorate that shows up for mid term elections it's typically older whiter and more Republican tell things that you see Democrats spending a lot of money and a lot of time on the ground trying to turn out younger voters those millennials voters of color or Latinos African Americans and Asians who are more likely to vote for Democrats are also more likely to stay home and ...\nIs there a certain benchmark wanna for what Democrats would consider for lack of a better word a blowout slide you use the goal just to get a fifty percent plus one or is there a larger like a stretch gold at the Democratic party's aiming for\nWhat I'm hearing from most people including Ben ray Lujan congressmen who chairs the Democratic democratic congressional campaign committee is they don't think this is going to be a blowout year they feel confident and their chances of taking back the house\nOf turning the house blew but I don't think most people most members of Congress were involved in this would say that there's going to be a huge blue wave crashing over a pick up of some ten seats or something\nA huge blue wave crashing over a pack of some ten seats or something like that they're focused on delivering that twenty three out turning the house bill and the message I keep hearing from them as they want to do that as a a balance of power right now Republicans control every branch of government and they want to restore balance of power to this administration\nYou know this idea of a blue way was the focus of an email from Marty who wrote I'm all about the blue wave but I'm afraid that between voter disenfranchisement lingering gerrymandering and possible foreign interference we're about to be pumped again\nDominican let me ask you about some of the polling what are some of the main trends in national polls right now in terms of how the Democrats and Republicans might do\nWell when we look at our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist polling Democrats have had an advantage on what's known as the congressional ballot who would you prefer to be a to run Congress ... the Democrat in your district or the Republican the ... in your district\nYou know we've had an advantage for Democrats anywhere from seven to twelve points over from the summer until now\nOr other polling other public falling a shown it to be double digits that's about the range that Democrats feel like they would be able to take the at least that was twenty three seats in the house and I look at some other factors to just look at the landscape and the playing field and when I was gamed out or how many seats would be up for grabs this year\nI found that there are ... seats that were a competitive to potentially competitive despite all the talk of Kavanaugh you know that confirmation battle in ... Republicans and it certainly did\nOnly six of those seats are democratic held seats Seventy four seats are of the potentially competitive to competitive lands\nSeventy four seats are of the potentially competitive to competitive landscape are held by Republicans no matter what you look at that and you know if the Democrats win half of those that's the house\n[noise] glad to hear from some of you with regards to your concerns about the midterms including about the nature of polling in general are doing the God love you to respond to this comment from a listener who left a note in our inbox\nI'm Alan from Ashville North Carolina and I'm frustrated with the elections with not having enough holes in down ballot races even even U.S House by state house and stuff because\nIf it's a close election I Want to vote Democrat at least at the federal and state level but if it's a Jew in that I Want to follow a third party greener libertarian\nOr write my own name so I Need to know if the raiders coach or not if it's a if it's true it if my vote might be the deciding vote and I need all I Need some polls July to divide and it it actually changes my boat the poll change my vote\nEllen thanks for your comment Dominican that cracks me up or if he wants to run for office he should run for office if he wants to a vote third party because that's his conscience than he should do so\nI get a pragmatic approach though and I think a lot of you know establishment Democrats would argue that they wish there were a lot more voters like him who voted in Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania for the Democrat instead of voting for the third party candidate now when it comes to polls look\nThere is a huge problem in this country when it comes to a polling generally and then when you go and drill down into the state level or district level or state house level my goodness\nThe response rate that people are getting from polling is lower and lower and lower every year in other words you make a phone call does somebody wish to participate\nAnd lower and lower every year in other words you make a phone call does somebody wish to participate in that that just continues to decrease\nIt takes a lot of money to conduct a good pole and to get a sizable enough sample that the results are representative and it's really tough and I would just say go based on the issues and vote your conscience\nYeah quite a lot of you express real concern with the very nature of polling Peter wrote on our Facebook page\nPlease discuss the obsession the media NPR included has with the horse race method of election coverage is an irresponsible journalism to report on poles when such reporting could affect turnout our elections are not sporting events\nAnd Michael wrote on our Facebook page unit which still trust polls remember how that turned out in twenty sixteen\n[noise] yeah I mean I you know look I mean this is the this is a tried and true a criticism um you know we can get into the science of polling and whatnot and I would disagree that were obsessed quote unquote with polling we do use it to pepper our coverage and to give us a sense of\nAh what the snap shots are within districts in fact I'm far more interested in trends in polls rather than poll to pull horse race I think that's a not a good way to look at the polling ah I think that uh again overall trends and you know issues and questions\nOf giving you a sense of a kind of a temperature read of people is way more useful\nShould note earlier this year back in February we did a whole hour on the nature of political polling Dominican was part of the panel you can listen to that program which we called can we trust polls on our website just search for it on line at the one a dot org that's the word ... the number one letter a dot\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized wealth management advice and banking and capital markets expertise along with a legacy of putting clients financial wellbeing first learned more at Raymond James dot com\nAnd from the science themes foundation since ninth\nAnd from the science Sims foundation since Nineteen eighty five supporting advances in science education and the arts towards a better more just society more information is available at size Sims foundation dot org\nBack now to our conversation with Juana Summers of the Associated Press Katie Sanders of politifact and NPR's the medical months and are all still time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about the mid term elections email us one a at W.

P. R. dot org let's get to some of your comments about the midterms Laurie emailed I Am a lifelong Democrat and I can tell you what frustrates me and has for years\nThe complete inability of the Dems to get a message and stick to it I've gone to my local Democrat Party website and the front page does not see what they are for does not tell me what they care about one summers you've been following the Democrats in the run up\nTo the midterms how common is Laurie complaint and how well are Democrats doing an answering it\nI think the lord is pointing to is actually really comment and I think Democrats are trying to figure out how it affects that and number of the conversations I had I recently wrote an article about looks at how Democrats are trying to um make sure they have record mid term turnout and they said that when they're talking about her as are sending out mailers are going and knocking people's doors in these ...\nTalking to voters are sending out mailers are going and knocking the people's doors in these battleground states and districts are trying to make sure\nThat they're telling their voters that they have a message that they are running on rather than just having these conversations are about just running against President Trump\nMay say um I was talking to some groups that did some field testing recently among Latino voters and they said ... and when they did this field testing\nThey were saying people were turned off is that if they got a ... a mailer from their local democratic candidate had President Trump's face on it they'd be super turned off right they throw that away they wouldn't even engage or see who the candidate was so I think they're really trying to tweak that match and you talk about what they can do for them what's at stake but that's\nThat's why you hear Democrats nationally talking about how this is the most important election of our lifetimes why you hear about healthcare message I think has Dominican noted being such a huge share of the advertising that you're seeing from pro democratic groups it's because they do realize that they need a message for their voters to coalesce around otherwise they're not going to turn out\nTo medical I Wonder if we can follow up on the scene was one more voice mail from a listener on the east coast here's what judge John left in our inbox\nIssued John ... Syracuse New York so often on the shows people for the Republicans the Democrats or Republicans the Democrats the Republicans would\nInstead of doing that they should be focusing on specific policies namely the Democrats that stand for such a threat to\nThe Republicans to them for such and such it helped educate listeners because you don't gain anything by just going Democrats Republicans Democrats Republicans\nJohn thanks very much for calling and sharing your thoughts with us no medical for me I don't know how you hear this but for me as a journalist I feel uncomfortable saying the Democrats who stand for ... I feel more comfortable saying the Democrats who say they stand for\nI feel more comfortable saying the Democrats who say they stand for X or the Democrats who have done ... to me journalistically that's more reliable but I Do take John's point that it just feels a little bit too broad\nBrush yeah I mean we have to always be aware of trying to get into some of the issues and where\nAre the party stand on these things and what they've been pushing I think that that's been part of\nThe pushback and why you've seen so much interest from Democrats obviously in this election because they've seen so much of what\nPresident Obama did or regulations that were put in place that have been rolled back for example a by the environmental protection agency a and a whole host of other things including an immigration policy that Democrats are firmly against\nAnd it's also what you saw a as a rise of the Tea Party in twenty ten where they didn't trust a lot of their government officials including a lot of Republicans in how they essentially took over the Republican Party with that message of uh taxed enough already and being really in opposition to\nA President Obama's health care act so the parties sand for a very very different things and we're seeing that play out and going to come to a head and in this in this midterm\nKatie I Wonder if you can respond to a listener who left a note on our website the one eight dot org listener writes with the upcoming midterm elections and Michelle Obama's advised to go high when opponents go low what is the effectiveness of negative campaigns are the negative campaign ads coming from a particular party or group Cady\nOh I think everyone's guilty and I don't think any party as a as Israeli going going high all the time right and I think that's because it's effective and it really sticks with people as much as people\nGoing going high all the time right and I think that's because it's effective and it really sticks with people as much as people like to say that they dislike negative advertising and I think actually do a it is memorable\nAnd it's certainly a bill that impression that people are going to remember and that's why we see so much of it and that's why we have jobs here ... years [laughter] it's funny to do\nYou you will never be unemployed not ever\nThe medical literature on some of the diversity of the candidates this time around quite a few record numbers of women running a record numbers of el ... out L G G cue candidates running some of whom spoke to Ari Shapiro on all things considered earlier\nGive us a sense of what that means for the midterms and whether many of these candidates are considered to send a strong chance of winning\nWell look you're correct that there are a lot of people um who are\nA ... of diverse backgrounds I mean women are the biggest bloc of this that are really driving the midterms you think a lot of Native American candidates or you know just to New Hampshire there Chris Pappas who is\nA an openly gay man or he would be the first gay representative from the state of New Hampshire if he wins in a new in the first congressional district there in New Hampshire the Democrat now\nBut when again we look at the power of the midterms women they has been fired up since the day President Trump\nWas elected and when we talk about when the when I'm a democratic women there have been two hundred and thirty five women\nWho have been nominated for ah for Congress for their party's nomination a hundred and eighty three of those a hundred and eighty three have been democratic women\nJust if you were to take the number of democratic women who are running ... that would be bigger than the record previously of all women combined who're nominees and that was a hundred and sixty seven so I'm Sorry\nCombined who're nominees and that was a hundred and sixty seven\nSo I'm Sorry you just just to clarify the numbers are basically saying that three out of four women in this in this go round a democratic woman who'd be nominated\nAbsolutely that's absolutely right and the the wave of democratic women the year of the woman quote unquote round to ah after Nineteen Ninety two after the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill areas have been driven by democratic women and we've seen them be very fired up in poll after poll\nAnd you know they are going to lead the march to the polls for Democrats and if they win the house it's going to be largely because of women\nWanted there are some races where you know women are making a very historic a historic showing I mean the Arizona Senate races going on right now between here and send them at the Democrat and more with Sally the Republican you know Arizona is going to have a female senator in that seat\nI Wonder how much you see this as a bipartisan trend we heard the numbers from Dominican oh but do we get the sense\nThat both parties both major parties are trying to be part of this trend trying to embrace this trend\nSure so I think that the energy and when we talk about female candidates a certainly more on the side of Democrats than Republicans I think that's frustrated and number of Republican women I spoke to two women who founded the group Republican women for progress recently and they told me that they were really concerned that their party doesn't have an apparatus to cultivate\nYoung promising Republican conservative went in\nFrom the local those local level seats all the labs had nothing that really reflects say what you see on the left on the Democratic side from emily's list a group that cultivate and backs a pro abortion rights when female candidates so there there is some concern certainly among Republicans and my colleagues that he actually\nSo there there's some concern certainly among Republicans and my colleagues that he actually asked\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell about that the question came in the back and forth about the Senate Judiciary committee and the lack of Republican women on that panel during the hearings around Dr ... Ford and justice Brett now justice Brett Kavanaugh and he's on them are like and why there were no women there Mitch McConnell said you know\nThat's something he doesn't like it something he wants to see more of but I still haven't heard Republicans\nForthrightly at least to me answer if this is such a problem if you want to see more women in the Senate on your side if you want to see more women moving up in the house and we should note that there is a woman and Republican leadership and Cathy McMorris Rodgers but where does lemon come from because\nAs we know running for office is very expensive it's very tough it's very tactical if you don't have help and you don't have an apparatus those people are never going to show up\nSpeaking of women Republican leadership to medical I I'm not sure if you've seen anybody running or campaigning talking about Senator Susan Collins of Maine and her decision to allow the Brett Kavanaugh confirmations for that long expedition she gave in the Senate floor that made a lot of people rather upset with her final decision I\nN.

A. M. U. dot org before we keep going and introduce our next guests I just want to kind of add a yes any meant what then deal you just said\nThere is no shame and getting a career that doesn't require a college degree none\nAnd we did a show last year called how to earn six figures without a four year degree about how to get into some of the skilled trades\nThat requires some training or an apprenticeship but that don't require a four year bachelor's degree one of our guests are Nicholas when illegals Wyman who was the c._e._o. of the Institute for workplace skills and innovation wrote a book called the job you\nAnd he put a question to answer on our website about what an apprenticeship is how does an apprenticeship work when should you consider taking one where do you go to find what you'll find all this information on our site program called how to earn six figures without a four year degree\nOn line at the one at a dot for that's the word ... the number one the letter a dot org\nBefore we bring in our next two guests Russ one more thing about the job market here you mentioned\nThat New Hampshire has an aging population affordable housing is a challenge New Hampshire is one of many states has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic how does all of this show up in in the job market is it just an aging job market or or does it manifest in other ways and that\nWell I think the main thing that is that what she right now is sort of the lagging wage growth in the state than it is kind of a deterrent to bringing\nGrowth in the state than it is kind of a deterrent to bringing more people into the labor force attracting more people to the state our wage growth has been around two two and a half percent a year it's sort of lagging this prosperous economy that we hear so much about\nI think one of the quips that I recall a woman said yeah we have a great job market in New Hampshire I should know I have three jobs and I need three jobs go yet by\nSo I think that that's a that's sort of the main stumbling block right now we're beginning to see a little bit of labor force growth as I said we've added sixty five thousand jobs in this state since the down turn kind of reversed course and start becoming an improvement but we've only added Seventeen thousand workers\nSo that they're in lies the crunch glad to get to some more of your comments about what you're experiencing where you\nLive with work especially in skilled trades\nSean emailed I work in the steel mill and union and management had been complaining about the lack of quality candidates were even taking mc Donald's employees if they will come in a big issue is drug testing half our potential can't potential candidates don't come in for an interview after hearing that we randomly drug test\nJulian tweeted a zillion jobs are no consequences if they don't pay a living wage all the jobs I see what ... my education and pay a third of what is manageable\nBut try to zoom out a little bit more and talk about what's happening not only here in New Hampshire but also nationwide joining us from our home base in Washington is Ryan none policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution Ryan welcome to want to thank you for having me on\nAlso here with this is Christine car the executive director for the New Hampshire career and technical educators associates\nYou'd have director for the New Hampshire career and technical educators association Christine welcome thank you\nRyan can you give us the big national snapshot of what's happening across the country right now in terms of the labor market we know what the national picture is we've talked about New Hampshire are most states doing OK really struggling what does it look like on a more granular level\nSure what I think that it's important to start from a long term perspective to understand where we are now ah and I think it can be summarized with the idea that the labor market is not always linking workers with economic opportunity I start by saying that productivity growth overall has been unusually low since the mid to thousands\nWage growth has also been quite weak\nOr and then there's also tremendous variation in wage levels across the country it's not always easy for workers to access jobs in those high wage places are at the Hamilton Project we've released a paper recently that describes how over the last forty years\nGeographic mobility has plummeted in those geographic imbalances those wage differences I just mentioned have tended to persist over time and the struggling areas in this country are not generally catching up with the prosperous places\nWe asked members of our one a tax club for their input one person wrote it wrote us at age Seventy one I was shocked to be hired I Am a retired attorney working as a state employee Ryan do we officially qualify now is being in a a labor shortage capital L capital as labor shortage\nI actually have a different perspective on this or that and there's an example I like the kind of illustrates my thinking about labor shortages or if you go into a store and you offered to pay less than the posted price for something and the store refuses to do that or we don't say there is ...\nPrice for something and the store refuses to do that or we don't say there's a shortage\nI think the same logic applies to the labor market fit in recent years we just aren't seeing broad signs of extreme labor scarcity in the national data or that scarcity should produce rapidly rising wages as employers compete for workers\nAnd we just haven't observe that you know overall real wage growth after we adjust for inflation remains very weak\nAnd there's little evidence of earnings and brought industry groups out pacing other industries by big margins are for example a wage growth in construction and manufacturing has not so different than for the overall economy\nAnd I'd also say that wages are growing at roughly similar rates across regions they're going a bit faster in New England in the Pacific states but ah but not tremendous gaps and and then I'll just end by saying that that's all to say that\nThey were not seeing this at the broad national level but there could certainly be particular occupations in particular places that are characterized by labor scarcity and that have seen some pretty rapid wage growth I just don't think that's probably true of us labor market\nWe heard from quite a lot of you about just the nature of wages as an impediment to filling these jobs Ronald posted on our Facebook page as someone who worked for many years in construction mostly trim carpentry I can say wages in the field aren't enough to attract and keep people willing to do the work\nWas shell emailed it's wages not supply\nAnd Christine car I Wonder if you might respond to this tweet from Fran who wrote New Hampshire eliminated the state minimum wage a few years ago so even though all surrounding states have raised there's we're at the national minimum wage thousands travel to Massachusetts daily or the pay is much better Christine in terms of what you're dealing with\nIt's the we were the pay is much better Christine in terms of what you're dealing with trying to get jobs matched up with workers how much does the state's minimum wage factor into structurally\nHer [noise] well I and I don't have any empirical data on why so many uh employees are working in math and traveling there that I Know when I Lived there that they reported over half a million or can eaters everyday into the city and out um and many of those are coming from New Hampshire\nSo you know wages is one aspect of it but there for sure is an actual shortage of people and my feeling is we've got to really just focus on how they can get the people that we have and to the jobs that are out there\nWhat do you see the roots about shortages Christine was there a point at which you begin to notice more viscerally that the job market and the labor pool were significantly mismatched\n... ah you know I I feel like you know my point of view is I'm going to sort of a wider industry perspective in in the sense that I worked in technology for the last ten years and\nComing to New Hampshire and looking at each of these high demand um occupation such as automotive construction manufacturing there just seems to be shortages across every single single sector whether it's in manufacturing or in high tech\nLet's get to a few more of your comments particularly about\nThe nature of will be described as an aging workforce Christian in Wisconsin emailed to all the companies out there whining that they can't hire enough people stop discriminating against older workers and older is in quotes we're not old and we have so much experience plus we don't always want a huge salary\nJan in Manchester New Hampshire emailed I Know several educated and qualified older women who lost their jobs here in Manchester\nFight older women who lost their jobs here in Manchester they've been out of work for at least six months I've overheard conversations at my local local supermarket from older employees losing hours to sixteen year olds ages them is a big problem ... how do you see this is the impact of\nOf older workers especially in in high tech careers especially in like Silicon Valley\nIt's becoming worrisome at this point where if you're old we just decided we don't want you\nYeah I think that's that here in New Hampshire it's kind of like a to a degree that's less of a problem than it may be in Silicon valley for example because if you don't\nIt runs through October twenty first details at Reno little theater dot org\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from capital one

our next guest particularly with regards to training skilled workers Chris writes\nAs a current plant manager of a manufacturing facility and for manufacturing HR director slash production manager for over Fifteen Years in both metal and plastics I Am calling BS\nManufacturing in the U. S. has completely abdicated any responsibility for training new employees since the eighties\nThey want experienced people at relatively low wages right off the street if you want lower wages to remain competitive you must develop an inhouse training program that brings lower wage entry level employees up to speed over time\nWe also heard from some of you in some pockets where employers are increasing wages here's one listener who left a voicemail in our inbox\nThis is bill I live in North Carolina and I work in the logistics and warehouse and supply chain industry and we've had a a pretty good expansion of our business over the last six months\nAnd we are really struggling with two items one is employed turnover where there are chasing higher wages and a new facility is a new employers and secondly trying to hire the right people are as a result of that we've had to probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and\nSecondly trying to hire the right people are as a result of that we've had to probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and Fifteen or twenty percent\nFrom what we did last year so we're struggling with both turnover and securing the right employees so having unemployment down as low as two to two and a half percent is definitely impacting logistics and warehousing\nIt's easy to see how Bill thanks very much for sharing your story with us\nAnother one of our listeners tweeted I hold a four year degree strangely enough in journalism but transitioned into a trade jobs shortly following college because the pay was three times what a starting job in my field would be I Know makes six figures yearly and work in the rural community I grew up in\nI Will withhold my thoughts on your abandoning your journalism degree good for you glad you found something that works for you but\nThis listener has an interesting point because to stem their brain drain some cities and counties and states are offering to pay workers to move there there's a city in Nebraska that'll match signing bonuses for newcomers\nTo the tune of five thousand dollars Vermont passed a law to pay people ten thousand dollars to move to Vermont and work remotely\nAnd accounting northeast of Detroit is offering to take a chunk out of your student debt\nThat plan was the idea of Randy ... the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair county and he joins us now to discuss it Randy welcome to weigh\nThings Joshua so this is called the come home award tell us what to come home award is how does that work\nAnd come home award program that we launched in ... and early twenties sixteen is really turning traditional scholarship and smiles on their head um there are too many flaws and traditional scholarship to talk about and going down but at its core what we're doing is changing the scholarship business model and instead of investing heavily in it\nIn traditional scholarships of talk about and going down but at its core what we're doing is changing the scholarship business model\nAnd instead of investing heavily in Seventeen or Eighteen year old who may or may not complete college or maybe not be right for college we've flip it around and we said we will pay you significantly a pot of completion of some kind of degree but only if you return to our region to live and work and it's really on home home reward\nPaying off of that so this is for people who are who are from saint Clair counting to come back home to St Clair county\nYeah we have a very strong preference for those with family ties I mean to to help protect our investments we want people to know what it's like to live in a small town America or we want to keep them here and so we feel that if they have some family connection here there's probably a better bet they'll stay\nTell me about Sinclair county pay me a picture of what's it like\nSo small town America or its waterfront community along the shores of Lake Huron in St Clair river\nUm our largest town of port Huron has a population of about thirty thousand people we do not have a four year University in our region we did not have a fortune five hundred company in our region a thirty percent of our workforce leaves our county and heads down to metro Detroit to to be employed\nBut they love the small town life or the family friendly environment amenities are were small town America Josh\nI was just going to ask you about Detroit you're about an hour outside of Detroit is that right\nYeah and you were talking about something earlier Josh I Want to mention you know Detroit has become a talent magnet which is great for Detroit um but the health of America and the health of Michigan I think is better judged\nOn the economic held the regions like port Huron are Marquette or Muskegon, Michigan right it gives you a better barometer of what is our our true how\nHow did the recession do to do in St Clair county where people they're pretty hard\nYeah I Would say it hit here earlier than than hit the country and much more severely um the ironic part that we tell people and that's really one of the things that led to this come on the program was once we really hit rock bottom our stakeholders whether it was philanthropies government business\nThat led to this come on program was once we really hit rock bottom our stakeholders whether it was philanthropies government business\nAnd the other sector we realized that we all had to get together and play a piece in economic growth and prosperity we all had something to bring to the table but more importantly we we reached a point where we stopped waiting for someone from Washington or someone from Lansing to come in and save us with a plan\nIt had to be an organic planned that drove our prosperity\nWe're speaking to Randy Myers the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair talented in St Clair accounting Michigan also still speaking to Russ T. Bo the president of applied economic research and Ryan non policy director of Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies\nAt the Brookings Institution still time to get in some more of your questions and thoughts about\nThe labor shortage won a at W. A. M. U. dot org tweet us ... when a or comments on our Facebook page where you can watch our video streams so Randy told me how the come home award work suppose I'm from saint Clair county and I moved to Chicago\nFor work and now I'm considering coming back how does that work\nYeah Chicago's a great example Chicago Austin's south um as long as you do not have primary residence here so let let's say your parents still live in this region maybe completed college six years ago\nAnd you're still living in Chicago but you met someone you met a party the medicine every other you're you're weighing the option of staying in Chicago which is a great place to live or you want to come back home settled down start a family spend more time doing what you want to do as long as you don't already live back in our region\nOr you're eligible for Fifteen thousand dollar award if you're selected we give the recipients a hundred and twenty days to establish a permanent residency or they have to find a job that they don't already have won several already have jobs lined up\nAnd then we stretch those payments out over two or three years as a carrot to keep you here in uh\nAnd then we stretch those payments out over two or three years as a carrot to keep you here and it's really a simple back on scholarship we pay the loan holder directly which in every case for us has been the federal government\nSo I Do so you you pay it out a little bit overtime so by over time by the time to two years or up\nSinclair county voted this program to come home award will have put in Fifteen thousand dollars towards one's Dan I'm guessing it's like would that be three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars like every six months or so and it adds up to Fifteen thousand over time\nThat's exactly it Josh when the goal you know I'm is to really give young people actually can be in their twenties or thirties or forties\nI'm the chance to go two or three years without making that nationally I Know you see data that says the average college student has thirty thousand dollars in debt I don't know where they're getting that data Josh because out of the fifty plus applications we received our average editor eighty thousand dollars\n... that that's a crippling amount of debt that's preventing people from living the American dream\nI can relate to that I'd finally paid off my private student loans I had to settle them it was [noise]\nOh God it was it was the most awful form of financial slavery I can possibly imagine and definitely like that's a whole other our where I Will I Will rebel you with my tearful story of dealing with Sally Mae before I I Know rusty but wants to jump in but before he does Randy I just want to\nAsk you about some of the perception issues that we discussed with regards to New Hampshire\nThere's this ... there is evidence that young people are moving to bigger cities in in large numbers you've talked a lot about this feels kind of small town America New Hampshire specifically conquered for sure definitely feels like small town America\nDo you think there's this misperception about smaller communities that young people\nThis misperception about smaller communities that young people are getting I haven't seen the TV show\nThat kind of glorified young people in a small town since dawson's creek I mean you don't see it much any more to do you think people are just getting the wrong idea about living and working in smaller parts of the country that we're all just kind of dazzled by the big city\nYou know that that's a great point I was when I speak around the country about this program in this effort uptown attraction there is a complete misperception that young people don't want to move to a small town America I'm One of the biggest impacts of this programming is dispelling that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Reno", "day": "18", "locations": [["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Washington", 38.89511,
