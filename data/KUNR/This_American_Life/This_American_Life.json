haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer of this American Life Jonathan gold's teen and the premise of the show is that each episode\nPeople come to Jonathan was something in their life that they want to fix they want to deal with they want to make right with another person usually it's something I've been living with for a long time and they're uncomfortable with\nAnd Jonathan plays the kind of bumbling detective Colombo figure but one who actually is kind of bubbling an awkward but he gets the people to sit down and talk and has things out many of the episodes are really funny uh the one that we have today is a more serious one\nI mean here's Johnny book staying\nIn two thousand and eight ... received a letter for jury duty\nYou know lots of people would say oh this is such a boring thing on the way I Hope it don't get jury duty but I was more curious and interested in like the process and you know I like to watch

would that would have been nice to know [noise]\nI could have changed\nThey could have let them live [noise]\nAfter the article was published something else happened something spend never expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness Shia driven may and if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and\nKnowing knowing that there's that forgiveness it felt so weird like it it wasn't something I can completely understand\nFor its fan it didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message ... how do you mean well I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as that are like ... it just floored me\nReply with something as powerful as a a ... it just floored me I I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Maryland back\nI did begin to apply but I didn't I\nDidn't have the courage to [noise] finishers and\nThe sort of you know there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] I feel like it really read things a\nFew months after spend receive Maryland's email and execution date was that the state would put post story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen but then something unexpected happened Glen and due to the cherry\nThe parents who the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied to cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically due to the cherry presents a statement which reads in part we do not want\nPaul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son\nThey are innocent of his deeds based on this testimony with only five days to spare\nPaul stories execution was postponed when news of the stay of execution reached fan\nIt felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email but he didn't it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise] not do English\nApologize for not [noise] they're not doing what I should have done to begin with for not following my good for not trying\nShame leads to a nurse or as even the most casual reader of the fundamentals of physics will tell you entered object will remain and our until it has acted upon by an external force in other words it takes a little nudge\nAnd who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter\nI Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue it reads and I hope I'm not being too forward\nI ask Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger about a week later I received a note back via email thank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes\nI have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply she also forward to her original email to spin the once you send two years ago the one he can't stop thinking about\nWhen I read it I'm expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead\nIt's just six short sentences which Maryland Thanks for the article and says she shared it with her son cartoons breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark I understand that span\nConsumed by guilt would read so much into so little but would I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place\nRepresents a joke I I\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get ... [noise]\n... ah some of the stuff I don't know some cookies\nI saw some of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah okay\n... lives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us meet in the hotel suite

somebody to come pick you up you know Paul Marilyn should get up she'll go do it\nSo since the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person every day she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and wearing endlessly about safety in prison for friends have fallen away the thing that's hardest though is that the people who remain\nThe people closest to her you know look upon her son she says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off is worthless and unreliable and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family member was our policy is the cause of all of this and that was a very hard for me it's like they wanted everything to be okay but that's my chow\nAnd I love him and I'm not gonna ever stop fighting for him\nFighting for him men working with her son's lawyers to changes sentenced to life in prison\nPaul's appeals more exhausting\nPaul's appeals more exhausting\nIt took up all over time and energy which affected the hospitality job she worked at for over Thirty years\nIt became extremely hard for me to concentrate at work and I felt like it costs me my job\nAfter losing her job barreling then lost her house she was forced to move in with her younger son\nSo it's kind of like you know at my age where I thought that I'd be getting ready to retire I'm starting over\nSo that's a hard thing\nOn um [noise] I'm\nTen years after the trial and

Maryland and I have been talking for about an hour and a half\nAnd I had been talking for about an hour and a half when the front desk or\nI think probably more than ... than sit in as the ... and

Ohio there's I just recorded on the condition that we not say their name on the air\nIt eight people on this team only two teachers volunteered for the rest are a guidance counselor to custodians the three administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team pollock watch them doing this we used to so I'm explain how this works exactly\nSo the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations of the school [noise] I saw the run a bunch of droughts\nAnd then all of them the goal was to render their safe get the guys out of the safe and then get to where the shooter\nSafe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter is as soon as possible and they time each drill okay we're going to pay for this is what a one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks\nThough did fire during these drills so the first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble\nGetting into the same smell you had to put your finger on the sensor as of\nAnd a little tricky might\nOh well there's a sheriff's deputy he's playing the shoe [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John he's a principal for grade six to twelve\nAnd he's running from his office starts by the cafeteria he's got a gun Israel bullet proof vest he's holding a walkie talkie very focused area where the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds one of these shootings another kid getting killed nothing nothing this way\nOkay my\nAunt Mary awareness and the elementary when [noise]\nI'm enjoying the building also has middle school and high school right so the principles running down the hallway and he's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's like this happens automatically when the school goes into lockdown\nThe heat and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys\nSome are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right one ... he's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\n\nYou know here we go we go [noise] door opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there [noise] so that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything just timing the response and it wasn't great\nWasn't attorney compared to the first yeah\nOh yeah it was it was the governor the doors\n\nWe said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option too though\nI I talked to John the principal about this yeah um for a long time he agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even though he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he says he's not a gun guy didn't grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have its own police force so if a shooter got in the building they could be waiting a long time for helped\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right thing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you were you worried because you realize that you're on your own and and\nI wanted to learn\nSo I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and out of hand\nSo I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and how to handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know first time you should have done that's pretty scary it was scary to me [noise]\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd would exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target tells close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision this as a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close to you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot that target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss [noise]\nBecause if I miss [noise]\nThere's a possibility of somebody else getting hurt [noise]\nAll right and I can't let that happen\nI Can't let it be me who hurts\nUs doing it in my school\nOf course he might have to she wanted a student and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise] I I wouldn't have believed but these\nThings don't stop happening\nThey just continue to happen\nAll\nThe shootings do just continue to happen\nToday and I personally have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare for like the staff at the school [noise]\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others\nTo plan for disaster school administrators and others will get previous shootings it looks a pass to display the future [noise]\nKnowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nLike one of our show today where people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put in measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to have people who have invented something that actually seems to work and help\nThe b._b._c. Chicago this American Life America ...\nFrom\n\nEdwin ... will never be\nPretty school they're trying to figure out the best ways to prepare for gunmen there is an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida\nJust a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained their students are new procedures they should follow in that exact situation just came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nI don't think they could have been more from Harry than where I knew what to give me what to do even sell even when we still had\nCasualties for the I'm going to return to their families\nThe training they received save lives that day or didn't it such an open question when our producers Robin ... went to a park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well they did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nTraining and how well it did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane warnings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher and that news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive\nOnce she and other teachers have been trained they ran their students are all the new drills those school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures this is what we do for ...\nEvery period for every ... this is what a code black is this is what we do it for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they knew so if they were apps and a silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nSchool colors silver burgundy their on an alternating schedule [noise]\nBoy says her kids to the drill seriously\nOn a scale of one to ten I Would say we were totally prepared like a ten\nTold every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in our classrooms\nThe school told every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in our classroom doors of paper\nAnd leave the paper up all year just in case if there were one it would make it harder for an active shooter to see in\nThat the lesson from previous shootings get out of sight\nBefore Columbine very few schools did active shooter drills now nearly Twenty years later most of them do actually curse teaches calling area Douglas she's level headed pragmatic like a person who spent years working in busy restaurant kitchens not living are cool what she did\nActually remembers being trained with the other teachers on the new procedures last year it started with them listening to nine one one audio from Sandy Hook\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building um ... yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total body is in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in\nYes it was [laughter] yes it was and\nHappened there were terrified people running and I just I\nThere were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that [noise] I\nActually wasn't only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how much you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct\nFor some teachers that wasn't a choice at all\n\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder\nShe kinda Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway the group is small enough to fit in a supply of closet someone told them to leave their backpacks out of sight\nAnd she'd been taught and moved there in the closet it was hot and dark except students face as led by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um\nMy friend Stacy who is on the third for the freshman building she ... she's on the tax to us that says there is a shooter there was a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my my friend Ferris says drill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet thank God and I didn't hear from her for a while\nIn our one by\nHeard noises in the hallway um we've got really quiet um I had to have a flashlight part of my phone on so that we can kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement and around and then somebody not comforting or not\nI could hear movement in the room and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is a police anyone in here\nAnd then there was like kind of like a pause and and they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time they set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door they didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the hands all and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they have their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started you know giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] once they told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy hold her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yells to you know Scott below to close the door and grabs the handle with two hands in polls that closed\nUm [noise] so her door was open up to the\nTo the moment he started it like shooting bullets down the hallway\nStacy is the teacher who's our most grade is she survived [noise] Scott Beagle in the room next is Stacey\nShe survived\nScott Beagle in the room next to this day seized at the same things stay seated\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in his doorway\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually have been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a\nPlay about for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class now I Move us all to a closet [noise] but they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives in mass shootings\nI really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help\nDid more kids survive because of it what might have worked better Cheryl Johnson researches what effective in these drills at Xavier University and it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters\nAlice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas\nEarly about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas like paper over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms\nAlso code ran all the codes their colors and meanings consumes I talked to said no to this too I'm a big advocate for not using codes at all\nI if I could read your takes a split second for your brain to go pay code red meat fad means active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I say there's a gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked rebounding yet [noise] but the idea that this is all you do [noise] that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways to respond to a shooting [noise] sometimes you stay in your room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter\nIn an open space with more exits like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort you fight basically trust your ability to make a decision [noise]\nI told her about actually occurs how sheets the doorway grabbing a dozens of scared student [noise] remember it was a break from her school's protocol Cheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed to actually did the right thing pulling and kids the problem with\nThis and unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly\nHappened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gun me being in a different building yes one thing that was part of the training of Douglas was barricade in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against her classroom door but most and actually didn't do it\nWe're up against your classroom door but most of them actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would've been way harder to pull those kids into her room from the hallway\nShut the on barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school when I\nWhen I asked her what the journalists for she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about this one shooting the red like Indian reservation shooting and how that one\nClassroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting hide because they practiced it\nAnd how and investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all\nThey'd have been better off without it\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills at school\nTo traumatizing for kids we don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nI don't agree with no drills at all\nI Want my daughter to know everything [noise]\nAllowed her to know about barricade [noise]\nAnd I want to know about running and fighting back\nI Want her to know about active shooters because the thing to reckon with\nAll want her to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nOne more thing I'd say to my daughter's school ...\nOh one more thing I'd say to my daughter's school John's point about don't say codes\nI don't want someone to come over an intercom into my daughter code red I Want someone to say listen I was a person with a gun in our school of course I never want someone to say that at all\n[noise]\nIf you're in Douglas their new Gates's new fences new cameras Jim back searches key card entry for staff\nGodzilla trauma kits in every room Fifteen campus monitors compared to five last year three school resource officers instead of one and they already did a code red trail\nHe tell Sandy he wants to shoot him to stop you want to take action somehow\nAnd then tried suddenly switches gears and starts filling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know the violence is going on in this world [noise] taking drugs is not going to change that because the strip where he joins drug stores are still able to hit\nAnd he plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year says are actually gun owners to damage luggage shock on people leaving the second amendment but they're also advocates for universal background checks and tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition NFL threes like bump stocks I personally by\nHowever Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support\nBut it's impossible for grieving parents to avoid the politics around guns there is a whole movement a conspiracy theorists who believe that the U.S government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Philips has ran into him face to face at a gun control of that he accused them of inventing their entire\nIs ran into him face to face and a gun control of that he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and other than I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shouting match was about to start until Sandy's stopped and broke it up I reached out to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNoticed truth ... troll families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting is can get dangerous after the Philips his son gave interviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get\nThe FBI involved the man who was threatening him ended up in jail so hoaxes or one of the things that Philips is born parents about they tell families to brace themselves oh\nMm Mm Mm Mm Mm\nAfter watching Lonnie and Danny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with her daughter shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time she got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at the multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started\nJesse's prime called Sandy from the theater\nThe minute I picked up the phone there was screaming just\n[noise] Arnold screaming in the background\n[noise] horrible screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting and I like what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been\nAt a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but she's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been hit twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I tried\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was so loud it was so horrific and something I've never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse was one of twelve people killed that night another Seventy people\nWere injured and then five months later there was another mass shooting\nOr twenty first graders and six educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the thoughts as\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents they're\nSandy so they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes\nBecause they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died [noise]\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown than he says they felt\nUncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence you know it's like walking into a funeral or people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband\nCame into a funeral or people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and I saw their faces and he said that's what we look like five months ago\nWhich is that look like [noise] um\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been trying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like\nTheir bodies are moving that they're not really there\nI realized that's when I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality\nLooking back Sandy sad that was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw but the filled suicide there was also a strong and instant sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from well they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech\nIn Tucson these parents have lost kids suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe\nTo Philips has now had parents that they can lean on to this is the moments that launched the Philips as to what's become their life work they could see the need their new experts on what to do when your child dies in the mass shooting\nThe only experts are the people it's happened to that help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids go to to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on what they want you to get back to normal\nDue to move on what they want you to get back to normal light moment brothers should face it you're not the same as you were shouldn't you know let me explain jumped into your right I'm not the same person I never will be they should as we're obsessed with it well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it [noise]\nThe Philips is in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away\nWe believe are closest to disappear which makes us informal support groups even more crucial\nWhat's that support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son in the shooting in Parkland on a cutting edge door at\nAnd let them at their house there is something was Nick he was the captain of Parkland swim team who's about to go to the University in Indianapolis honest when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid\nWho collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops Mitt said they just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together\nThe day of the shooting Mitch an ... phone calls and tax all day from people who said they'd heard Nicolas okay one person said they heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting another set of police officer with giving him a\nRide home and then a nurse at a local hospital said she thought patient who mash next description but by that evening the door at still hadn't heard directly from Nick [noise] they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area is that in the ballroom with other parents and waited\nTime the phone rang he jumped in and gets Nick calling from somebody else's phone um\nHe jumped in and gets Nick calling from somebody else's phone um [noise] the media was calling you do you have any comments can we help you find your son and I was just like [noise]\nAnd I'm at two o'clock in the morning we see this FBI car

that they're going to say like we we couldn't even find your son and you know and that whole thought that he was somewhere else and I'm taking keep I'm thinking maybe you walked home and and then you
