I don't always have to\nFull or the lyrics meanings I can walk away and come up something completely different but you know if they have to say that they want to show in the video and then I have to take that into consideration\nOkay now can eat as much to me somehow either from page to final put up like what are your technique\nSo you know they gave me the fall I go back I could listen to a song and meeting yesterday snatch is of pictures in my head like I Do see like still frames and I just have to read those things together\nAnd sometimes it takes me a long time I got to you know please don't when I'm brushing my team got a point when I'm cooking when I'm speaking from why\nBecause the thing I'm trying to the way from is thinking about the idea is never watch for me I don't think about the idea and then she\nWould come to me in ways and you know when I'm seeking and that's why we have looked at when I'm speaking with a pen I just get up and I write it all down but then I'm going to forget as soon as I get up and I tried to make it as a visual as possible in words\nI Try to make it as a visual as possible in words and then I signed up to them and a hundred percent of the hundred the article I Love that idea\n[laughter] really a hundred percent I I don't know I didn't I didn't believe I I I Do have to say that's that's what it is I Am very choosy and thinking about it and you know\nAnd then of course I think at some point to the level of trust that has come in in in my career based on\nPresident of course it gets to a point I was like OK me say this is what we need to do I trust that this is what we need to do I because I'm equate deposit I'm the business press in\nSecond to last me quit to Boston but we're not pitching while cutting an idea very passionate about it I can see I can taste it I can feel it I Do everything from but when you look the dress you're going to win the props usually the entire\nVision is once you just have to show up in your boxes\n[laughter] you know let me let me I'm ... I'm\n... talks about repeat to listening so this film over and over again she's brushing my teeth when she's drinking wine what about you how do you come to to get that vision for that so\nYeah I really relate to that I've definitely listen to some ... many times where I can listen to them anymore [laughter] oh [laughter]\nAnd and I also find that sometimes you do just need to exhaust the listening process until you just can't ... it ... you know you almost like gas yeah you don't even Hitler acts anymore you just feel it [noise]\nIt's good to just sit with that you know if you count the problem is sometimes you get a track and I like to get as a treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday\nSometimes you get a truck and I like when you get the treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday you know so that's kind of tricky and I think for me personally I don't know if it's because I might be in like a slightly bigger market will maybe I'm just not as popular with director Comey but\nYou know occasionally I Do get out of that come to me directly\nBut more often than not I am actually pitching against other directors [noise]\nSo that's a little trickier because sometimes an artist cannot talk to study directors or twenty directors have many hours\nI recently pitched on the cot is a ... and Jay Z and I knew that there was some big guns in the ... pitching on that project and I knew I was lucky to be invited you know but I knew that I definitely wouldn't be able to get on the phone with them because in a busy schedule I'm not sure they had time to talk to Cuba so [laughter]\nSo I just had to come up with an idea and like what's the best you know I didn't quite nail at that time but that's the part of being a director is that there is a little bit of a risk involved you have to say I haven't had a hundred percent success rate for sure\nBut maybe it's being a director and pitching on American artist and you ... it can potentially be more competitive out that because I Know there's a lot of directors out there\nIs the biggest skill you if you're fishing for me on the energy the margin [laughter] that's a that's a larger scale I mean the odds you need to walk him of course with some amazing art is but then I think I'm lucky by the time to come to me that kind of meet up their mind but then again it's not genes look beyond\nYou listening to the conversation my guess will to what we need music video direct his ... and Kenny ... from Nigeria so you've been operating at a level where many of the odyssey worked with a huge big names and know exactly what they want\nTo think can be specific examples where you have to navigate\nSpecific examples where you have to navigate accommodating to holding on to create a vision and under him you said you had a hundred percent success rate but they must have been certain points for somebody one can be a little bit differently so it just it does make you\nYou got to understand initially in the beginning it wasn't this way because I mean I have to put myself in a specially being a woman in the industry and competing with of course jumps going to lead because it is a male dominated field and then at the end it cross all starting off\nOn television so I was the printing person that now want it to to be the girl with the camera so it was an obstacle that I needed to jump over to change people's minds and the only way I could do that only weapon I had was every time you get the opportunity\nYou have to knock it out the park the first ever project that I did one official project and I did music video was a music video for an award ceremony\nAt I was one of the house\nAnd they had a a song that was going to be the theme song on and they had a lot of the big names pitching for it\nAnd I'm like you know I Do not like you know I'm a direct analogy but yeah I mean this is what we want you to start when you come out of state and things like that and I mean I'm not just from\nOne thing I had one day I had a dream about the concept to try to be a visual as possible and I sent it to the guy that you know who's running the show\nAnd he called me like it was like actually love this treatment and bite off your and like that's the I call that one and I need to make a decision on to them I said you know what how 'bout you do this\nHow about you don't pay me\nGave me that's what I Need to execute this project and you get a better job because of course you're going to have to pay these big name just give me what I Need to execute them\nGet a better job because of course you're gonna have to pay these big name just give me what I Need to execute this project so at that point that caught that chalk eventually to position myself I wasn't heritage that I knocked it out the part I might not have gotten a lot more boosted tuition but that is the only project I've ever had to pitch for it\nBut then once I was able to deliver it wasn't always like a business card to you know a lot of people call me the New England but I'm a girl so [laughter] because it's just the music video and like I Want that person and and that's just how it's been\nOkay can we talk about how much you're charging [laughter] I'm very expensive very kinds of honey you're not going to be holding Jesse fan you don't have to give me the exact figure to give me a sense of how much you're charging a fence it depends on the project\nThat things I charge denied that things are charging dollar a dip ... their partners like I'll give you figured that projects do that I Do for\nNothing at all that what has lead me the most money when you came to me my budget was a little bit too much for them I really love the project I wanted to be parts of it I thought it was something that I needed to be involved in\nAnd that particular project might not have\nLightened my pocket at that point in time when I was probably made me the most money down the line because people have seen that and gone I needed to work in this project\nRight for them with their figures are going to be given to me I mean you can get\n... now I mean I can you give me a sense of how much she or challenging and it's funny because actually my family has not increased [laughter]\nBecause they're the rule of thumb that older actors get temp set of budget is what would be typical budget I mean can you give me an example of the budget are we to reevaluate pan hundred thousand us donors are we talking about ten thousand US dollars\nI'm Out of hand hundred thousand us donors are we talking about ten thousand US dollars\nIt can be that it can be either um let's say a low budget project is around ten thousand oh and that means that direct to get a thousand dollars but that would be like a month what\nSorry you would get more working at a supermarket [laughter] because it's a matter of hours you put into a project where you drop everything and literally just do that you're not making much per hour but if you're working on a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand dollar project you can you end up with a little bit of caution you pocket\nWhen you see the dynamics tempest and what does that mean I tend to sign of the total budget so who gets the budget well normally the\nBudget comes from the label\nCan in your experience how a male and female all its history to different the pie they record labels\nWell in my experience and is obviously general conversation and doesn't apply to everybody of what we thought it really depends on the artist and like how much they already have to bring to the table\nBut if it's somebody who has to be young and like a little bit lost and not really shore and that super talented and have an amazing voice and maybe the songwriting needs a little bit of collaboration with all the riders so it it it you know that's when the label get really involved and I've noticed that it definitely happens a lot more women than men\nInformation at Nevada fund dot org ...\nThere is eighty eight point seven in Ninety One point seven KU when our Reno and Ninety One point five K. and see the outcome\n[noise]\nIt's six o'clock in

agency owns have reached the area where officials believe the plane had crashed into those waters off the coast of cut out long ah which is not too far away from Indonesia's capital city Jakarta where the plane originally took off from\nWhat to be such an rescue agency which is responsible for these sorts of operations\nIn Indonesia what they've been able to say is currently they believe they found debris from the aircraft as well as possessions that they believe belonged to those on board but at this point they still haven't found any survivors they both are sent helicopters to scour the seas\nIn the nearby areas to look for any people\nAnd charisma I understand that the crew had asked to return to base shortly before the crash are the rescue officials or any officials in Indonesia reading anything into this as to the cause of the crash well China\nWhat they do say that they can confound the cause of the crash until they find the flight data recording of obviously that's also

the airplane\nBut he also added that from the flight data that he analyzed the plane looked like it was in trouble from the very beginning he said that it had struggled to find some sort of\nLevel balance from the point that it took off now\nThose reports that you were talking about the pilot had\nAsked to turn around soon after takeoff\nThat's being reported in the local media we don't have any official confirmation of that yet all officials have said though\nIs that they will continue to look for that flight data recorder which hopefully will reveal more information about why this happened encouragement give us an idea what do we know about lying air and their safety records\nWell lion air is Indonesia's biggest budget and line it's the airline that you would typically take to travel from one part of the archipelago\nTo the other it has hundreds of flights every single day but it also has had a very patchy safety record I think it would be fair to say I was in Indonesia a few years ago covering the crash of ally an air flight\nWhich crashed in Bali luckily for everybody on board miraculously in fact there were no casualties from that particular incident but\nThe safety record of this airline has certainly been spotty to say the least over the last several years however aviation analyst have also said to me that lion has taken safety most seriously over the last few

partially a vote for ... above anything else they vote of rejection towards the workers' party and he was the candidate stepped in body the most and in the most efficient manner does rejection towards the workers' party\nThere are also many concerns that some people have for example he expressed admiration for the dictatorship his comments against the L. D. V. T. Q. community and he made racist comments about slave descendants what is his presidency going to mean with all of these comments and concerns that people have\nOkay I think that all those concerns are valid these world polling remarks\nProbably from an individual who never thought that he wanted to reach where he did a I Believe that the Brazilian institutions and the president political environment is strong enough to avoid and to prevent that ideas like this\nAre transformed into public policy and I'll do these remarks are are terrible\nI Believe that hardly they can represent anything practical in terms of a presidency because of the strengths of their president legislative and judiciary system\n[noise] now those who voted for him but his vote against the workers' party justify that a single really want a better economy from Brazil and he's our best option for that well\nHe gained a lot of strength and supports particularly with the president market when he chose

it by those tourists and some which\nFlights over the sea from other countries I spoke to ... vice presidents at the Seychelles who's at the conference with the announcement was made this morning\nLast year we generally think Seventy two thousand tons of waste and setting percent don't this is plastic waste so you will appreciate the manager of the problem we consume plastic but we do

as harming the environment is pushing tourists away something so many people depend on for their livelihoods\nBut they're not pushing tourists away but they have the potential pushing pushing tourists

Atlanta in the meantime I'm sue black looking at these elections are and talking about the workers parts of the opposition and Fernando ... did you think it seems like he's thrown away and opportunity here he he seems to be trailing so dramatically in the polls\nThat does seem like quite a difference between the two dozen to um [noise] I Wonder just how much ... when we get back on line I'd really love to hear their view\nIs just how much we can actually use social media we can use the different means of communication avatar fingertips now\nTo try to get two groups of individuals perhaps the whose minds can be changed so I mean we've seen\nTry to get two groups of individuals perhaps the whose minds can be changed\nSo I mean we've seen Trump for example using social media very very effectively is this a trick that in fact that's being missed by one side and being used more effectively by another if in fact they're seeing Trump is this the idol of somebody that that they can follow her\nSo I think tricks are probably being missed\nBut I suspect it you know I I again you know we we were talking earlier about the the caravan heading towards the U.S border this is this is another feeling of that\nBuilding an impending situation that says my goodness me we are as close as we can possibly get\nTo a fifty fifty situation where somebody is only just going to win and you know we seen this in in our own situations very recently in relation to Brexit in relation to Scottish independence this this closeness to a fifty fifty which is ... should avoid eating um\nConcept in terms of the way in which we interact as as a society\nWe're painting populism big alone a result we've done the comparison with Brexit ridden the comparison with President Trump a I gather you back with us now tell us about the role of social media really\nYes sure so especially I mean social media became this thing and the president election ah we're in the beginning like in the beginning of the every one would expect when we were a discussion about how social media would play the role because\nIn Brazil air time ah for political parties were so important in the last election\nThey were the one party is worth fighting for it to have a long about\nFive minutes ten minutes this wouldn't make a difference in in this election\nIt didn't make a difference at all the candidate that had a more airtime hell off they will just outlaw me on the traditional politician\n... I had no time on TV but had an army\nWild me was the traditional politician in ... I had no time\nOn TV but had an army working uh in social media in his right now a run in the first place and the thing now the polls and he uses it really well he has been using it since\nThe beginning of a lot when he decided to become a candidate he has been using it and he has like it's real time he's always like getting gauging support and get engaged in\nHis foot winters so he made it a really good use specially though what what top right now there's a\nBig discussion if what's up while I was responsible or at least a\nMe that I had an impact in this election uh in Brazil because what's up it's the biggest social meter right now that people use is all the time and then because of the friction system you don't know and who is sending what and what kind of hate speech that it's going through the through this\nBecause this was a spot for 'em and then so a resident or it's regulated a little bit more of a little bit like Facebook and Twitter\nBut what's up was a little bit out of the scope so from a so both on how to use it really well like from that in the elections in the states are both not to use social media ah\nTo [noise] to get to get the chicken engagement enough ah his supporters\nAlong a result in Brazil in Sao paolo a journalist from the old bride stone bridge group thank you very much here with the BBC will service [noise]\nSix minutes by the hour and ... joins us with the latest sports news it seems one football manages been trying to use a little psychology ahead of his team's trip to a size we're joined top of the English Premier League and the water [laughter]\nSide of a joint top of the English Premier League Andy what's happened\nWhat was surprising they don't share the same or any uh we're talking about ... a loophole that can happen up about three point lead over Manchester City\nAt the top of the title today with the way in a city that I play until Monday when they're at told them what about Chelsea and also by by tomorrow but it's labor pool it's time to count if said he didn't get that first winning the Premier League until last weekend and the ... to ... to nail bulldog who sounding rather defeat taste\nIt's virtually impossible for any team in the current game I think the from three is probably the best friends furry around the world really in a team we've all got to play to the top of the potential to give them a good game and hope that they have a bit of an off day I'm not sure he can do really\nWell packed guardian and others debates won't be in perfect condition when they all have to adapt to it when they got Manchester City so I play it spurs when deciding on Monday\nNights because the day before the NFL will be that the super bowl winners Philadelphia take on Jacksonville and um well who knows what condition the ... and ... is a spurs I'm now until the end of the year it's been announced that to building work at the new ground continues to overrun we've\nGot a match they called el classical this weekend when bumps to learn to play round Madrid and the Spanish leak tomorrow and as a big game isn't the in South African football today\nYes so the big teams in tents robbery Ninety thousand or will be watching it ... book Orlando Pirates against ties the chiefs additional part but he's a former striker with the chase\nWithout a doubt the biggest governments or Africa is one of those games that are both teams and the fans I look forward to because obviously there's a lot of pride\nTeams and the fans I look forward to because obviously there's a lot of pride at stake and the most of the times I'm coaches are quite cautious about the these games because sometimes the jobs on the line as far as the results are concerned\nI shall bottling kingly anticipating that ... what other sport can we look for today\nWell I'm a Mexican grown pre we can Lewis almost Ninety needs to top seven finished ... titled the race itself is on Sunday in practice yesterday that the pay such as were the two Red Bull College of ...\nAnd Daniel Ricardo I must patient pole or the longest came in World Series baseball history it's still going on up to six hours\nBoston Red Sox from the LA talk to the level to repay spend the fifteenth ending the been playing as I say I was six hours a Dodger Stadium\nThank you Andy ball well with the latest sports news you with the b._b._c.

Ashraf are our guests here on weekend\nLet's focus on this now because each day the political divide in America\nGets why it's a it's a fairly well worn phrase that now politicians pouring scorn on each other on a president repeating his dislike for the media not everyone would have filled the atmosphere would become so tense and so aggressive it it would inspire apostle bombing campaign\nThe suspect accused of sending fourteen devices to predominantly vocal critics of Donald Trump has now been arrested registered Republican an audience Trump supporter\nWhat the people choose doesn't Sharon eyes over their fellow citizens doesn't excessively concentrate power and that I think is the part that is being threatened by the rise of a populist politician like Donald Trump\nI'll hang on democracy is only a good thing when people vote in a way that you'd approval\nNo I think it's a good thing pointed is constrained by checks and balances and buy a rule of law you know people can make lots of choices but their choices cannot uh include for example the\nDepriving of minorities or you know unlike individuals of their uh equal rights than a liberal society so that's really I think the issue in front of us what\nLinked D.C between demanding dignity and identity politics\nWell I think that the basis of modern identity politics is this feeling that we all have\nThat we have this inner source of dignity that's not being adequately recognized\nAnd that's why we go into politics because we want political recognition that\nA dignity we want the society to acknowledge that we are the group that we belong to the religion of the nation the gender the ethnicity the race that people with those characteristics be recognized as equal and I think that's propelled a lot of\nPolitics in the world over the last couple of hundred years you recently got a voice mail from a supporter of Donald Trump didn't you know so did she was very angry at what I had written because I said the American constitution does not define who we the people are\nAh she said yes it does it says that it's the people that fought in the American revolution and their descendants and people that came later a including you are really trying to take that constitution in that country away from us I suspect that she doesn't literally mean that\nAnd in that country away from us I suspect that she doesn't literally mean\nThe descendants of people that fought in the American revolution I suspect it's something like you know we white Europeans are the real hundreds of this country and people that aren't that way are somehow you're not part of the national community and by the way she told me I should go back to Japan which I you know when I\nWas born in Chicago so it's not it's as if this is really an option for me\nNow that will be people all over the world and not just support as a populist leaders like victim oil banning hungry who you mentioned in your book and like the alternatives to Germany movement that you also mentioned that will be loads of people who who listen to you and think\nWhat Californians view you know what a liberal Californian view your day mate has passed you know the days when liberal elites democracies rude and got all the money you know it's all of a tough how'd you react to that\nYou know I I think one of the biggest issues is the fact that we actually live and de facto multi cultural societies and if one of those groups you know says that basically where they're going to we're going to be the dominant ones you're just setting up a situation of of perpetual conflict\nSo I think that there's actually a good reason to\nHave a liberal order meaning liberal in the sense of being open to people or you know that are different nationalities cultures of religions\nAnd integrating them into a common framework by which they can make democratic decisions collectively\n... and that's really what's at stake and what's being threatened I think by these people that are you say her you know not California and that that are rooted in one particular place or one particular ethnic group\nIs a clear majority of people in the\nOne particular place or one particular ethnic group\nIf a clear majority of people in the approaching midterm elections in November in in the U.S\nVote for Donald Trump or rather vote for the Republicans surely that democracy is black and Latino people in large numbers cast a vote for the Republicans if gay people vote for the Republicans that is democracy in action isn't it\nIt is to see an action or and I don't I think that what it's going to threaten is not democracy per se is going to threaten liberal democracy\nOr because I think that Donald Trump has been trying to avoid accountability by basically attacking any institution that gets in his way and at the moment that's\nRobert Mueller and his investigation over the connection to Russia it's the FBI it's um the Justice Department and\nI think that if he gets a a perceived mandate as a result of the way that people vote he's going to you know go after all of those in a way that he's a little bit frightened to right now and I think that's not good for American institutions because the institutions really\nAre built around the separation of judicial power and the independence of courts independence of prosecutors\nFrancis Fukuyama and the title of his book is identity they demand for dignity and the politics of resentment what's your take on identity politics suit black\nYes it's really interesting isn't it because it's the talk of bites democracy and I think it's in some ways ... democracy it's about saying we're not comfortable with the extremes\nBut like we've gotten middle ground that doesn't feel as if we've got to anything stable to stand on so I I think that balance between wanting to be able to have the freedom\nSo I I think that balance between wanting to be able to have the freedom but also wanting to be able to ensure that we've got a quality I are always going to be tensions that that work together and work against each other in the same in the same set a sentence [noise]\nSo identity politics is really saw shifting sons in terms of where we place ourselves within that spectrum and everything that has a spectrum becomes really interesting when you look at either end of this extreme\nPeople gravitate towards the middle where we find\nUnhappiness with it and therefore won't say effectively how the freedom to go back to the extremes which then become uncomfortable and we moved to the middle so the modernization that constant brightening motion effectively in politics is really interesting do you have political beliefs F cell\nBased on your identity I'm not sure I Do a show with my identity is that it's a multi faceted and so my political beliefs\nBut I think this issue here is is really I'm very profound and I think a front says okay albertson's ... started the debate which I Hope will be

wanted to Ninety correspondent James Robbins us went to Russia had breached the treaty\nIt's very clear that the United states and to allies in NATO to think that the have been serious violations of the treaty by Russia but equally the Russians think that aspect of the United states and NATO posture in Europe and the deployment of missiles in Europe\nHas in effect undermine the treaty in other ways so there's a balance of accusation if you like\nBut I think this is much more about rules and with uh the world should worry whenever a rule is dismantled more than anything else\nChinese intermediate range missile development is arguably the biggest threat for the U.S [noise] but do you think America can or will do anything to try to now negotiate a new treaty that perhaps including China\nThis is really interesting isn't it I mean the United states clearly believes that the constraint is on there as a result the IMF treaty because after all it can't break out some come from

greater threat and the threat posed by Russia Russia after all\nThey are far greater threat and the threat posed by Russia Russia after all is sitting on a declining economy talks the talk and there's

if Chinese growth continues to store it has done\nThen perhaps it could emerge as the biggest single strategic challenge and the United states doesn't want to feel as in any way constrain perhaps actually from beginning an arms race with China which is then ended or at least reduced in scale under threat\nBy separate arms negotiations with the Chinese but the United states wants to be strong position\nTo confront China and it feels that way the limited treaty the IMF treaty dealing overly bilaterally with Russia that it is constrained\nWe think less say as a result of this is Russia claims all all their any advantages to what America is doing\nI think it's very simplistic does look to me that we might be less safe off colonel scrapping the IMF treaty does feel like it doesn't it scrapping at least one speed limits on that particular\nIt doesn't it scrapping at least one speed limits on them particularly dangerous section of road is something you wouldn't necessarily want to

anyone was putting pressure on Saudi Arabia to stop its bombing campaign\nDoesn't appear to be the case I mean this has been a disastrous war for Saudi Arabia since it began when the Saudis originally announced their bombing campaign that was back in March of twenty Fifteen\nThey announced it was going to be a short sharp campaign to restore the internationally recognized government of president ... well that's turned out to be anything but true\nBy one estimate there have been airstrikes carried out by the Saudi led coalition in Yemen every Ninety minutes since then on the impact has been absolutely devastating in terms of the loss of civilian life in terms of the damage to infrastructure\nArms of the loss of civilian life in terms of the damage to infrastructure\nBut also I Would say in terms of the grave damage to Saudi Arabia's international reputation\nOn the longer the conflict has gone on the more instances have been identified by the un of civilian targets being has in coalition airstrikes hospitals weddings funerals schools we went to the scene of one of the most tragic counted the notorious\nRecent airstrikes in a place called die young and the province of data and the north which is a who's he stronghold\nAnd that was where forty two school boys were killed on a boss\nWe met some of the survivors we met their parents we went to the school we saw the empty desks we saw the new grave yard full of children's bodies the empty graves that are waiting for the remains of children that still have not been identified two months on\nOn there are many who are asking if this another Saturday airstrikes actually amount to a war crime so it's a deeply damaging inexpensive conflict for Saudi Arabia on his no indication that they have any exit strategy\nThey're all fourteen million people in Yemen facing found them in twenty Eighteen what did you see there\nHad an opportunity over a period of about two weeks to see the scale of the men's suffering in Yemen this was my fifth trip\nBut I hadn't been in Sana'a the capital in two years\nI did was really shocking to see how much things have deteriorated there has been a massive cholera epidemic the largest recorded in the world and not nutrition rights have soared there are four hundred thousand children in Yemen now who are severely acutely malnourished on during our trip\nWho are severely acutely malnourished on during our trip we met the un humanitarian coordinator for Yemen leaves ground day and she was very very\nBlunt on stark in her warning that up to fourteen million people could be suffering famine within a few months if there was no political solution and under certainly isn't one on the horizon\nCool so the aid agencies able to do with the momentum what do they think needs to happen though\nI mean one thing you hear from the aid agencies on from Yemen Egypt Druze and indeed Yemeni civilians the messages is really the same from everyone at the end the conflict what we need is the end to the conflict on the great fear is around the red sea port of data that's in the hands of the who the rebels there has been an offensive since about June\nBy the Saudi led coalition on on the various forces that support the government of Yemen the UN and da da da and seeds are desperately concerned that any attempt that results in fighting in the port would be catastrophic\nBecause her data really is the lifeline about eighty percent of Yemen's age food supplies few medicine it was coming in through her day to\nThe UN is managing to operate their other organizations like save the children and so on they need permission from the two sides it's not always easy to get their operations are controlled and limited but undoubtedly it is the operation of of the aid agencies that have

ooh contribute to the problem [noise] Seattle to stumps heat from leaving the planet one reason why the average temperature is higher than it used to be\nScientists in the U.S now say that some technology able to camp to compromise is ready to be deployed on a large scale right now\nSo is this a solution to climate change I asked our environment correspondent across the\nWith these techniques that they talked about here is that nobody's retry them yet because there's no real financial incentive to do them but on the basis of the calculations of these scientists and others have done they are talking about the fact that by the middle of the century we need to be removing about twenty billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year\nAnd that some of these techniques would get us about halfway there if they worked really well and everybody did as they were told and everybody did have some joined up thinking\nThey are optimistic about some of the newer technologies that are coming on there you know we're talking about planting trees and changing farming practices the brothers would be boring things the more ... into things where you've got these machines that looked like washing machines with friends in the ... of the year\nThey can do that right now they cost about six hundred dollars a ton of carbon that they are removed but the report's authors are actually saying well we don't know about them right now but we think about ten years time they can get down to about a hundred dollars a time if they do that\nThat's a very successful and we could beat this problem\nThe big problem with that is this what they philosophically called the moral hazard\nIf you have machines that can remove comments that Mr why bother reducing your use of fossil fuels and that's one of the big dangers that politicians and campaigners environmentalists really worry about because\nThe big dangers that politicians and campaigners environmental is really worry about because if people think there's gonna be a solution ten years down the track they'll keep flying they'll keep eating meat to keep driving cars they do all the things that are contributing to the problem right now\nTo the extent is common capture happening all ready and how can you make it more appealing\nYeah other lots of different things going on the moments every country in the world is planting trees pretty much people are trying to change the way that they do far station that the\nLength and the ... the trees grow or they changed you know when they have a massive kilometer you fire or something they plan pretty quickly the bigger more technical industrial challenge of poultry on big pieces of technology to coal fired stations\nThey're all they're in theory but very few in practice is literally a handful around the world and the big problem with that of course all these big bits of case cost lots of money and nobody really wants to put their hands in the park has to pay for all these things\nSo what's interesting about this report has come out and saying that actually you know there's lots of other things we can do blue carbon as it's called for one thing which is effectively mangrove swamps and marshlands near the sea if you can protect those ... source of our sing for common they soak up more common than anything else\nAnd you can do it for about twenty dollars a ton of carbon and that is really really cheap\nThe bigger problem of course the long term is we don't have enough of them you know the fight the number of coastal areas in the world is finite\nPeople want to build new coastal areas and you've got this thing called sea level rise happening as well which might wipe out some of the gains were making so\nThe big tech not really happening a lot of smaller think is happening and it's cheap and not just reporters things when you do more than two you\nIncentivize countries such as China countries such as India which have been industrialized in very very quickly and actually getting rid of some of the landscape that was\nAnd I think very very quickly and actually getting rid of some of the landscape that was doing carbon capture\nYeah both China and India are taking all these steps in terms of planting trees and doing other things that also obviously building lots of coal fired plants as well [noise]\nHow this works out no one really knows to be honest with you the hope and belief amongst richer countries is that if they develop better technology to capture carbon and sequester it then there'll be able to either share that technology but Indian China\nNothing really happened so far and there are a number of intellectual property questions about all the big challenges with China and India they remain on salt at this point\nAccra that's it from the well this week for now don't forget to join us at the same time next week for a look at what's happened in the next several days [noise]\nDistribution of the

I think clearly Diego this strategy of shifting the blame to others is not working any longer to the party\nFirst when the scandal when the cyclical a corruption scheme was discovered that the PTA react to the shift in the blame to the media to the judicial power as if they were parts of the conspiracy against the tea\nThen when a before that Wendy economy started going down they said that they shifted to blame to the external environment so a yearly this is just rhetoric is not working any longer just look up the pros I mean people are not buying the story and they won't let me let me\nTry food then let's talk about how crime and they will talk about how this election is being conducted holiday was affecting how Brazilians think about which way to fight\nHas become endemic in Brazil the read of homicides in Brazil or has reached record levels in the last years and now we have three homeless\nYears and now we have three homicides for one hundred thousand inhabitants what puts Brazil among the most violent countries in the world the nature of crime and Brazil has changed\nThere are strong organized crime linked to drug trafficking in Brazil and who are the sections of the population who are worst hit by this wave of criminality\nPoor people read and it's no wonder this year it is worth noting it is to put people who have areas the ... how we'll have more poor people have tended to vote more PT that say honey into hosted ... if you are right if you look at the north eastern part to Brazil\nWhen you take a huge metropolitan areas such as real\nWhich is emblematic of this endemic crime problem those poor people tend to vote to boso now too as a sort of knee jerk reaction to criminality based on the idea which in my view is wrong\nThat we need extrajudicial killings for instance the G with that problem\nSay Monica who that is one of the policy that food is passing on such and that kind of crime levels that such as just been describing now I think like a lot of people are seeing now is that that wasn't always the case that that you could make this connection but there's a clear connection between corruption\nAnd and the chaos of the public security system in Brazil\nI'm originally from Rio my home state is like the ground zero of corruption in Brazil\nAnd have you had the governor now former governor who is in prison\nAnd if you had the governor now former governor who is in prison and the skill of of corruption in something mind boggling\nDo you just got an a continual policy hoped to reassure voters that it can tackle crime effectively if it is linked to Brazil's\nEconomic suck instances and indeed the levels of corruption\nYes first I think we were talking to an international lawyers so it's very important to explain that security and Brazil is ... by each state's and by the federal government but having said that\nAs the previous commentators or talking and I agree with them organized crime in Brazil was seen through borders between stay there for one of the measures that a\n... is a United security service that we work around the whole of Brazil the other kinds of the gym was so narrow phrases policemen or people that use ... ways to kill\nMonica you don't ever defensible I think that a lot of it has to put him on that right and uh for example one thing that he complains that the ... nobody cares seems to care when police officers are cute and there is a real uh the ... by the police force that they're not being valued\nAnd that they're not being given the resources that they need\nBut that still doesn't justify that's not the same as ... today Joshua leaving home leg is don't really know what do you say what\nHe is sad is that between having a police officer cue than a criminal living in a situation of confrontation we just like how the point is here in the last ... such as to\nBrazilian police cannot be compared with the police in the U.S nor the Brazilian society can be compared with the Americans to say the level of violence and was\nThe American side of the level of violence and Brazil\nHas been extreme Brazil is a brute to countries let's make no mistake about that so I think it's completely an justifiable to praise extrajudicial killings ... has never been\nExplicit about that but the few words with the ... and this is dangerous enough I guess it's like a lessening the dogs out\nUnconscious of the time that Marie don't try to bring you in briefly to talk about if we made the conduct of this election campaign and the role of social media just give us a sense of how it's been used\nI just before talking on the social media I think the levels of violence in Brazil like stream hundred and Seventy five homicides the days over sixty two sixty three thousand last year having said that I Would say there is absolutely never any justification to use extrajudicial killings\nAlso consider widespread gun ownership I'm drawing a carrying around of guns will only escalate the situation not make it come up these sort of simplistic solutions\nAnd using a campaign for coming in to your question using a campaign based on fear fear of what might happen and might even you have HUD has happened to people you know is not the way to go around addressing what type of ... complex social issues\nBrazil is a country absolutely ridden with inequalities absolute ... I'm voiceless mess of parts of the population\nThat hold that thought plenty to think about that thank you very much top on also now so it's a moderate dumped to go to Monica who dominate ... such a faster and dig Scott donate we have to take a short break but just to remind you that is that what you think of the program or anything\nWe have to take a short break but just to remind you let us know what you think the program or any ideas for topics you'd like us to look into the real story at BBC don't care to UK is the email treat me I read that and if you enjoy the program as appalled cost you can subscribe to such will BBC the real story in your podcast up\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

difficult for the PC wet actually there was an anti globalization me not just in Brazil but only for the wild one which in which some many people all choosing perhaps to have a different view of the role of the state in that lives\nWe have two different very different projects are we face two very different projects in one side we have a few of those that are of himself as a liberal surrounded by mid century a\nOn the other side you have a dodge who has a kind of a developmental list approach to the economy where this stage ought to have\nA friend [noise] so what we have in Brazil now is is lawless state versus I states that will intervene in the economy to create jobs and to form and the economy more people have in jobs more people would spend money and ... the present and economy\nProblems that they don't start they don't know when to stop intervening right you have a development bank the largest development that has more\nMeaning right you have a development bank the largest development that has more credit than than the world bank\nAnd they compete with the banking system riding front that that's why you have a big family with I don't know they kept landing Americans who are the ... economy is very well established companies giving loans like very low interest rates\nMorning at around ... you say that a vote so narrow makes very clear comments actually not for example initially they talk about getting a second stokes about privatization of state owned enterprises and then of course both\nSo narrow immediately boats in and say oh yeah yeah yeah privatized fish and bought not\nMetro bras north generations or the electorate Ross Perot says almost on the brink of going for privatization is not going to be halted it's all very can dish and\nMaybe ... ... talk has been liberal but I feel the practice when not to be liberal it will be intervention okay because that's the way Brazil has developed let me just Brazil's development history\nLet's hold on to those two quite distinct views of which way the economy may go I wanted to come back to this idea of Brazil's relationship with its ministry 'cause I think that is part and parcel of this agenda that also has talks about traditional family values very tough on crime and so on\nThere is a memory of course of Brazil's minute she dictatorship which is still rule that when the repression that followed that there were hundreds of people would dissipate or killed many more were detained and tool shed\nAn amnesty law was passed in Nineteen Seventy nine which meant that when they public reckoning on trials about what had happened in those twenty also Yeh is an today the majority of Brazil's votes as the hundred and forty seven million of them\nThey didn't live through that but at the regime which came to an end in eighty five and you documentary the may ... tells the story of a dictatorship\nGene which came to an end to eighty five a new documentary the may ... tells the story of a dictatorship bureau women's presidents are powder Suzanne ... is a film director and she explain more about the tower\n... up his song and that's the logic that the fifteenth up out of that 'cause it's a thing that\nThe child was a prison during the Nineteen sixties and seventies where hundreds of women were held because they went against the dictatorship of fighting for democracy prominent women but former president Dilma Rousseff were imprisoned there will also university students\nSociologist historian doctors and they ended up that either because they believed in the struggle simply because they were handing\nOut leaflets against the dictatorship in university\nThe women arrived in this prison after they'd been held admitted trees detention\nWhere they've been tortured at least in the Taliban families knew where they were and they can visit the women\nAs fair as soon as I filled out the whole lot of colds those lovely little follows low more than ... fall\nIt just shocking how the old to cause a miniature dictatorship is being HUD and Brazil which isn't to fight against corruption a tool it's just militaristic took conservative to schools\nWhich is frightening the women who were imprisoned in the town an order of us have seen this before during the dictatorship ... talks about massive cars and eliminating people who don't share his views so it's very frightening people are worried that they'll end up back in prison during the impeachment of ...\nThose are not paid homage to well numbers and torture so people are ... at the possibility of having a dictatorship and Brazil again and then a poll fifty percent of the president population said they thought it was a possibility ...\nSays ignorance about what happened during the dictatorship the fifth\n... says ignorance about what happened during the dictatorship\nFifty a set of silence about what happened then people who survive that period didn't want to talk about it and I think this is how we could have another dictatorship people ignorant and think that during that period there was older progress but there wasn't and I think that people think this because of the silent\nFilm director Susanna lira Monica who does this one specific point I Want to pick up from from what she was on there I was saying that which feeds into Web Brazil is heading in democratic times it is that the specific point that giant ... when he voted to impeach Dilma Rousseff\nDedicated that vote to uh to ... that is an extraordinary things are unelected politician to do yeah\nI just want to see something I don't think that anybody who's voting for both a nod who's the stars because of the leadership regarding its record on on human rights\nAs growing up in Brazil I never I until I was a hit I was sixteen Seventeen years old I never thought that I never knew that I was living in a dictatorship right because my family and my father was a a a salesman and he was a he used to say a so they stuck with Peter Britannica\nAnd my mother was a housewife\nThe and from for many the time of of those years in which you have a a dictatorship war years of ah the link those years as economic boom and security\nAnd I think that when people know stalls you could they almost always took off of those things right we the reason why I didn't know that I was in theater she when I was growing up there because he had elections for governor I think for for mayors as well\nThere because he had elections for governor I think for for mayors as well and I saw as a kid there was ... Paul although they weren't all generals but there was a rotation power so and now a days ah support for democracy in Brazil has never been\nHigher in ... in in the ... the the democratization seeing him go do they do you then feel confident if these memories are up of faded up ... not very powerful there is support for democracy does Brazil have the institutions to maintain is democracy even if there is a leader who is quite close to them in a tree\nIs astonishing actually because I was born in eighty seven so Brazil was already a democratic country and yet polls show that presidents have never supported a democracy so much as they do now but also polls show that\nAround half of the presidents of shears a off a proximity to a possible dictatorship and Brazil um\nIf if you read the lead singer it's very clear that the dictatorship was no on is that there was a lot of corruption there and violence\nAnd do the violence has increased over the last few years but it the violence there was different as well as the kind of state violence where innocent people were killed dissent loss oppressor friendly\nBut does dark resume how does Brazil have the institutions to guard against a return to that kind of a way of life that kind of political life\nMean no absolutely sure if we if you take into consideration uh\nThe first day of the new president of the Supreme Court he he he he was talking about Nineteen sixty four as an advance rather than\nA military coup and that's worrying worrying also bedridden for some areas bringing a lot of people from the military to to to be beside him and governor Mitch if something similar to do my happens to both of these people will perhaps be able to to to claim\nThanks to both of these people will perhaps be able to to just like such a very briefly\nWell very briefly I have no doubt faults wherever that both for NATO has a on the Democratic instincts but I think a Brazilian institutions in society or strong enough to absorb the shock and protect democracy from deteriorating in the country\nSo I Want to look at one of the very specific thing that's important not just in Brazil but beyond the country's borders\nA nice is the face of the ... and the last four is a vital results in the battle against climate change and that she has been a crucible if fled the city that giant ... promise to bring progress which one imagines

indigenous lands making easy access or open large roads in the middle of\nThe forest for timber industry and soy farmers he wants to march the ministry of environment with the ministry agriculture but

World Service my guests today has become the world's leading public intellectuals because much of his attention on identity how we humans see ourselves and others through the complex prism of race gender religion class on nationality\nFor Kwame Anthony Appiah the drive to begin the printer such questions comes from a very personal place the is the child of a circle mixed marriage his father was a lawyer and will commit\nAll of a so called mixed marriage his father was a lawyer and will connect ... politician in pre independence gone to his mother was an English woman of Eris the classic stalk Kwame Anthony Appiah was a gifted student who went to Cambridge University and became a professor of philosophy on ...\n... New York University He is a gay man who's married to his partner of more than two decades\nSo his own life is a fascinating example of how complex on multi led a sense of self can be\nAnd yet the way we humans define ourselves and define others often tends to be focused on the vision we use race religion and the class to separate us from them increasingly in this young century the politics of identity seems to be fueling conflict and hate\nSo is there an end to this preoccupation with group on tribe\nWell Kwame Anthony Appiah joins me now welcome to talk for the beer\nYou have spent a great deal of your recent professional life thinking about identity and how each and every one of us labels ourselves so let's start with a simple question how do you label yourself\nA little bit on who I'm Talking to a taxi drivers are usually I explain that I'm half a gun at enough British by origin and that I live in the United states that's the that gives me three countries to talk about in terms of some sort of national origin\nTo you when you describe where you're from and and the sort of ... of your identity although signify as are you thinking that you're sending ... ...\nIdentity although ... are you thinking that you're sending signals to your into lucky to er about about who you are\nYes I think I'm sending signals I think that sort of as it were weak signals from a faraway planet or something because because they don't tell you as much as I think many people assume\nUh they they will so I I grew up and gone and my father was going to end\nBut that doesn't tell you very much about how interested I Am and gun or it doesn't tell you how much I Know about God as as I Am the death of that is and so on many people that would be more informative to know what their nationality is you know if it's at\nBut I end up pretty quickly in a conversation I think you move beyond the the stereotypes into into more detail and then it doesn't matter so much that it's not all that helpful\nWould it be too simplistic to say the ... in in all of your work on a race religion and creed as you put it on gender and all the different ways that we can\nIdentify ourselves into identify ourselves and others your conclusion is that frankly we roll so complex and so unique that almost any label we apply is in some way or rather misleading\nI think that's right if you take any bill the big labels that you know the race religion nationality I'm even class you know one of those there's so much diversity within them\nSo you know men are all ... men and not all the same man is very different from one another women are very different from one another or people in Britain ... different from one another people in London a different from one another in a million ways so that being told somebody to London and then actually give you a huge grip on or anything\nAre very important about them which doesn't mean that there are moments\nVery important about them which doesn't mean that there are no moments when ... isn't hugely important that people um there are Marilyn elections it's important to be if you're a London that when when the mayor is being elected if there were big as they have been in the past big terrorist attack in London that would bring them together they have a sense that Mm okay we're all facing this together\nThe current government uses nationalist and polarizing cultural messages\nAnd it does but the point you alluded to earlier you ultimately Arnold ... believe that the trajectory of the human condition is in a in that positive ... toward a more universe list a more\nHumane understanding compassionate humanity I guess how can you square that with what you see well uh\nI I guess because I'm looking at it over a longer horizon than just five or ten years old penalty as I'm thinking about how much things have improved in these respect\nOr in many ways over the last century I'll say for example think about the massive improvements in the condition of waiting thousand people in many many countries over the last century look at the massive\nReduction in a racial or discrimination in the law in the United states over the last hundred years look at the edge of the increasing coming together of Europe at the same moment of these\nIncreasing coming together of Europe at the same moment of these moments of nationalism and putting breaks it to one side which one has to do\nAnd you're a ... is way more unified in the United uh than it was in the in the nineteenth century so uh or even in the mid ... century so I think older they say if you look over long enough horizon you can see the general tendency is in the direction that I Would regard as up\nOne area where I can see that you would find solace would be in the way in which certainly in in the western world\nAh societies and cultures view a gender issues then particular sexuality I mean your your uh uh a known for very long time in out gay man you took advantage of America is changing laws so that you could Mario long term partner\nHow far can we go\nWith the notion that human beings are now free to choose their identities in ways that we never even thought of before not just in terms of of sexuality but even in terms of a basic gender where now there is a\nA very powerful movement to to change the way the binary way we see men and women are a lot of people who define themselves as ... binary there are others who are transgender ring and society slowly appeared to be moving\nTo to accept them in New ways where does this end well\nDon't think he ends the ... there are two things at the airport but where it doesn't that doesn't then with the disappearance of identity we are reforming our gender system but by not getting rid of gender altogether I can I can ... I Believe that I Belong all into the remote future we'll still have ... it'll be more complicated than the old simple binary\nWe'll still have ... it'll be more complicated than the old simple binary system but there will be men and women than some people in between\nEnters the question is where the self\nIdentity and because the interestingly I I'm I'm launching between different spheres but but I I'm mindful on how to do it so long ago we spoke to a woman cold ritual does though who\nIs a white parent age but identified them indeed became an activist on behalf of the black community and on and live to live for a black woman though when she was challenged about this because people realized eventually that she had two white parents it became a fascinating and difficult debate about who is to say\n... being black is and she said look I I've never identified as white I feel myself to be black so therefore\nTo that extent I'm black well I think she's a very good\nCase to think about because you ask what's the relationship between self ... and and another I think you have to think of these things as a matter of a negotiation you count simply declare the meaning of your own race all on their own race has a special category you need to\nIf you if you don't like where it's put you you need to persuade the well to change that is what trans people have done the trans people have done what Rachel ... didn't do which is they've\nCreated a movement to allow them\nTo be what they want to be an artist and they've asked us to change the system I have I'm happy to respond affirmatively to that request and change the system I don't think it has any harm to me to buy masculinity to adapt system in that way and even if it did a little bit of how do I basking in the I'd be happy because it's obviously very important to them\nI'd be happy because it's obviously very important to them a phrase will do they all had could have provided a could've made these arguments on the sly to people and began to thing and if you could have done this in the way it was a little bit more straightforward because what she was actually doing she knew involved\nConcealing something that other people thought was important that she didn't think it was important and that's an interesting fact about that but unfortunately a black in America doesn't belong to her and so the only way it can be changed\nIn the direction that she wants and I'm just I'm willing to listen to her arguments living it that way is if she makes the arguments creates the movement and she can't do that on her and she has to do with other people just to persuade other people\nIn this interview and indeed in some of your writings you'd have been very consistent saying it's not my job to fix the society is simply to understand and explain how societies work to my fellow citizens now I I Can't do that\nBut do you have ideas which you can share with me as as to how to overcome the lies that currently under paying our identity\nI think the most important thing for us to overcome and to the extent that getting rid of the lies helps I'm In favor of that is is the the moments when identities leads to

actually a shift in political position and that's the problem and the moment to reason they has that she knew Rico room on\nShift in position and that's a real problem and they used to and if there is no deal done by the time tonight that much we will leave with no deal which most commentators believes will be pretty catastrophic for the u._k. come to me a no grades either for the you twenty seven particularly for armed\nI ask a legal opinion of water border becomes on the twenty ninth about because of the moment we say there's no ... well actually the ... because you've got different currency on one side of the boat or the other you go different tax\nThe ... because you've got different currency on one side of the border the legal different tax systems the different social services systems there is a kind of a border when people say no border they made the wrong check points there aren't horrible business that I grew up with in the Nineteen eighties seeing the militarization of the border and\nIt is that legal concept of border which might help on the side tried to ... pounds of this this kind of double bind that you've described\nIs really tricky the the real problem what's what's going on here is um the physical infrastructure on the boat and that's the issue because the moment you have any form of physical infrastructure\nAnd by that means cameras all security post anything of that so the real concern as it becomes a target of terrorist interest\nThe problem with Brandon Lucas [noise] we we say that it's a it's a huge game for I'd I don't play but I've heard of it how is it a global and a big money generator you don't you don't make any money playing it do you make any money buying it to play it\nWell you don't have to ... to pay any money to play the game of dominoes again I think that's one of the reasons it's been so successful you know it's really accessible to lots of people if you want you can buy a thing called a season policy about maybe ten dollars and that gives you access to so cooler weapons and guns and outfits and that sort of thing\nUm but yeah it's not really a a money generating game in the sense we have to pay a subscription or anything like that but obviously lots of people have super into the game and willing to buy that season ... and that's how the company generates money\nAnd now if someone is in trouble tell us about the videos posted on line there and why the company at the games is suing that player Brandon Lucas\nSo yes a brand new cars is accused of making\n... is accused of making these hacks to the game and selling them\nAnd these are enabled players to cheat bicycling so he's maybe ... ... does is it makes it much easier to kid enemies 'cause you don't have to aim at them it does it for you automatically\nSo he's been sending these molds to the game online\nAnd for a upwards of two hundred pounds in some cases well again and people are buying those people are buying them yes because again it's a hugely popular game and and some people have got the money to access these kinds of things but overseas annoying for people who haven't got that kind of money because they want to play the game fair and square and these other people cheating\nAnd of course the the the issue that at the games I guess are having with it is that essentially we're talking about hacking into the software or a Fortnite\nThat's why they basically accusing these papers copyright infringement and they're saying you know you've taken a product you modified it against the wishes without permission or that you have ... essentially for the other players and on and it belongs to us you have no right to do that\nCan he be the only one that surely at the games should be targeting everyone who\nDoes slow this is in fact because his argument is that he's being singled out he believed at some fat he says they're not some notes of other people doing this you know why they picked on him\nUm and you know I think ... haven't been care about the only thing they would probably argue that they're trying to make an example of someone you know they they have to stop somewhere and perhaps that trying to demonstrate with this case that if if you do this this is what the consequences will\nBe and it's this tell us about the significance of this case is this the first in in in the industry\nI Know if it's not even a fuss for food night radio ... yeah they they had some people arrested I think and I'm a ... this was a different game actually paranoid festival grounds\nThis is a different game actually paranoid about two grounds and that it has to be arrested in China for hiking the game um yeah and an historic day it's been going on for years there's always been cheating games and like many things he gets in the video games journalist joining us life\nHas been shooting and all sorts of games um thank you Eli I understand that but now a twenty two minutes possibly know Canada has just become a the second country to fully legalize recreational marijuana consumption unsafe Europe why was pushed the protests began a few hours ago as midnight struck\nFirst Newfoundland and the eastern most of the country it's been moving across a great celebrations Chris O'Neal yeah each of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was that in the provincial capital St John as midnight struck so who was sending the first batch\nIt's a company called a calls canopy gross it's actually whiter a large multinational company and they set up shop in St John so they will be selling it you know over the counter here um there are\nAbout three locations here in in St john's area that you can walk in off the street by the candidate but for\nYou'll be ordering it on line it's controlled by the same corporation of government that control the sale of liquor\nAnd ah they brought in all the rules and regulations companies have to fly in order to be able to sell it legally there\nTwenty two locations off in a in the country right now that can separate story and the profit right now they can sell it and they will pay an\nOr the government for a\nWhile it is regulated by government largely a lot of private companies\nHave their eye on this already and we got in first that it's a big companies that already um\nHad already set down a\nWith down Bruce than other parts of the world\nPut down roots in other parts of the world\nAnd I was the time zones move and midnight goes across the country or are we expecting the same sort of policy atmosphere and scenes that you'll see the\nWhole I Would I Would say some things John is a rather small city about a couple of hundred thousand people and saying this excitement tonight is it's quite amazing\nThough I Would imagine across the country if you look at larger cities but millions of people some of them are Canadians wanted this for very long time and uh when Justin Trudeau ran to be prime minister of the country\nHe promised people he would take 'em\nOf of of the illegal trade of the drug traffickers and um and regulated in an attempt to to grow an industry and I guess a lot of people in the world right now we're looking at Canada to see what Canada is going to do because Arab way is the only other country in the world\nHas a federal law that legalize cannabis the United states has done so in in a number of states and some countries have done is within safe but Canada is really a leader\nLot of people will be looking at houses\nOn hold it will not be with that was from the hip hop\nFrom law enforcement to actually\nWhether there is even enough marijuana\nThe one thing we've been hearing that the last number of days that they expect that demand will be so great in the beginning that a lot of the flyers are probably going to run out even within the first few days\nRight is it because it's such a stampede or the basically the country's gonna be smoked empty do you think\nWell exactly that's what it will be but some people will have\nTo take it and bring it home or take it in and looked at it private because it's governed by the same rules as alcohol or smoking\nThat's Chris O'Neal you H in St Joe Newfoundland or she was reporting that was a a bright Julie cue behind a queuing up to the legal kind of his uh for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\nDoing up for their legal kind of as a for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\nNow it looks like the cash will start flowing into the massive ... three dam project in the Democratic Republic of Congo now that of fourteen billion dollar deal has been signed at Davis of our business desk is here with us now match is his third year old project finally going to get off the drawing board and actually make some money\nYes it certainly looks like at the anger three hydroelectric projects as being delayed many many times but now deal has been signed so last year the deal the government almost two competing consult here to join forces company that built the Three Gorges dam in China and Spanish Company called ACS and\nNow looks like a deal between those three ... pious as being pens\nAnd it's being money being delayed and has had the all sorts of needles I mean it's been a long time coming two years ago the world bank of froze the disbursement of Seventy three million dollars of aids cash that it was putting into a helpful technical assistance because it said\nThe country have taken the project in a different strategic direction than had been a great\nSo tell us about the significance of the scale of it how big it is\nIt's huge um I mean the idea for the ... just three is to complement the two existing power stations on the Congo river there about two hundred and sixty kilometers downstream from Kinshasa near the anger fools\nAbout those two power stations are pretty old no one was built in Nineteen Seventy two and one in Nineteen eighty two so this new project as well as the Jews are it's got six phases and we'll take moving\nIt's got six phases and we'll take more than ten years to complete compete it'll generate four thousand eight hundred megawatts of power now that's about the same amount of energy as three nuclear power stations China\nDoes the DR scene neater use that much\nWell I it doesn't but it means that the power supply in the deal she can be expanded way beyond the ten percent of the population who currently have reliable electricity supply\nWhich is of course great for economic growth and also be a boost for the country's ... province in the southeast this is where all the mining takes by some mining uses a great deal of energy\nAnd it also means for the deal is he can be a big power export to to the rest of Africa not just its neighbors but as far south of South Africa ah which has actually already signed an agreement to take power from the industry project\n[noise] huge prospects then for the RC match many thanks ... and ... of our business desk joining us live at

give in to a reality that I Believe would be bad for my children and I have four of them and in fact I warn them I say to them you have\nTaken for granted pace on this continent because it's there nothing is a given my biggest worry and I do trend that are within sometimes is that we went to squander what the European Union\nDid which was developed peace and prosperity on the continent of

trying to make that happen for a long period of time and you are and some rain Jesse\nProfessor Steve right well pioneers in the industry say these limitations could yet be fixed a new generation of batteries in the next year or two\nCould double latte flying time all the same some of those involved in driving the new tech like engineering botch upstart top vertigo Arab uh playing it safe for now using hybrid technology to power that runs\nWorking on both battery based solutions because we've got a lot of expertise with batteries but we're also very focused on hybrid electric solutions where you've got an on board generator and the reason for that is really to allow our customers who are the aircraft manufacturers\nTo not have to design for the batteries of now but rather design for the batteries that we may have ten or Twenty years from now\nAnd then use the hybrid system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be and what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely and reliably right now or as soon as possible and an upgrade the batteries as soon as the battery\nAnd then upgrade the batteries as soon as the battery technology is there\nDescribe who is in this game\nIt's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies and you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in the ... that can absolutely you're thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angles to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where you'll the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft\nSome of these start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they developed the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you\nFly across New York or London or Paris if you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus that's in Europe to worry about maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board\nThere is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now what I expect to see is you're going to see the piloted versions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric powered trains like the ones that vertigo is developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery technology has come into play and the diversity of aircraft types than\nTo play and the diversity of aircraft types than grows\nWe took about taxes I think that the tax is going to be picking me up from a and then my office and taking me to my home I mean that presumably isn't the first thing we're going to see with this kind of new model\nThat's correct you're not really talking about flying to and from your house you're more talking about flying let's say from London Heathrow to the city center or from JFK Airport in New York to Manhattan directly places where you have large amounts of traffic congestion\nAnd if you think is the most traffic chided cities in the world a lot of them are in the developing world on that you use it might have been also they have perhaps low regulations that that they are the most likely places to see this kind of technology says\nOh absolutely and we're seeing a lot of interest in cities like Delhi Mumbai Bangkok Sao paulo Mexico City and it's really interesting because all of us in this industry are actually watching the self Paulo market very carefully\nRight now today in Sao paulo there are hundreds of helicopters operating to and from hundreds of HeLa ports on top of the buildings around the city\nAnd so this type of transportation model isn't something that's theoretical it actually already exists in one city\nBusy business people five to ten times a year and we all find ourselves in the cities where\nOkay my flight was late getting in I really need to get to a meeting in the city center and at that point it's very easy decision to say I'm going to put this on my expense report I Need to get there are now on those few times a year when you really need to get somewhere it's really valuable to you to get up and over the traffic huh\nIt's really valuable to you to get up and over the traffic how soon\nAre we going to see this revolution you're describing so I think we're going to see the early services around twenty twenty five and all caviar by ... that saying that I think those are going to be the piloted aircraft it's perhaps more like a bus and less like a taxi\nOr going to see a few cities in the world where you're going to start to have service let's say from the major international airport\nTwo two or three of the major business centers around the city so that you've you've started to deliver this rap and transportation option\nAnd then it just starts to grow from there\n... botch of vertigo arrow hair on business day from the BBC\nThe really for the new tech will be when these flying drones but come on just a novelty play thing for rushed overpaid business

I'm\nAlso is investing millions of dollars in infrastructure in lobbying Steve tape it says there's a public relations effort underway to persuade ordinary citizens that this could be that future transport model as well\nMean they're doing a great job in galvanizing the industry employing everybody together to go after a common goal to get air taxi ride sharing on parity with owning a car which is well it's a brilliant goal and they've got a lot of technical hurdles to get there but brilliant but realistic\nUh you know people would argue with the realism but even if they're close you know there are still going to be people that have a meeting across town and there's gonna be no other way to get there and they'll spend the extra money too\nYou're gonna be no other way to get there and they'll spend the extra money to to make that meeting and so I think that there's a market there even if it's not on price parity with owning a car\nThere are technical hurdles not just safety but also noise and other things in simply finding places in big cities to land I guess but it's going to start in Europe and America what was going to start somewhere else from about ... the regulatory hurdles a less high\nYeah I think ... probably the number one city in my estimation is is Hong Kong right it's water water bound in super crowded and there's a lot of money there and uh it just a natural fit\nYeah a lot of islands to jump over about ... less dangerous for that reason because you're not going to crash onto onto a house if you did come down\nRight you over the water most of the time but you know if you look around the world a lot of a lot of the most popular city to live in our water bound so there's an application for this type of transportation\n... besides it's hyping top pilots flying taxis and a number of western cities Los Angeles Dallas new Paris\nAs soon as twenty twenty five but it's not actually unrealistic sheds you'll give them the technical and psychological obstacles we're gonna have to overcome a professor Steve right from the university the west of that list is the worry first time we have an accident which can be attributed to machine\nAs you can imagine people kind of release their mind to face\nAnd say we're getting very very carefully because one major accident and they could shut this down in an afternoon it's a real worry and that's

helicopter crash that that was coup I guess in say again we have problems in developing these these technologies but oddly enough this is\nOne area in which the technology actually solve the problem we've had in the past\nI think the the ... that will pay an easing in period we the public needs to get used to the idea to just in the same way that we had the the the person walking in front of the car waving a red flag whether that's\nWhether that is I ever actually happened that day that was the early days of ... and early days it makes it makes the vehicles exactly\nWe are a faithful law and we need to get used to ideas and so once it's seen to be Paul solve our everyday lives\nAnd this is what's possible with this new technology people will accept it how long will it be how long will it take to we get to some kind of drugs and drug have\nBought taxi I but I Would love to say I mean this is this is the question everybody asks me my particular hunch timescales is ten to Fifteen Years\nNow the thing is I'd love to be proved wrong in this case because I really will my flying or I really want by flying taxi\nBut the number of weeks we've got to end should jump through as well in order to make sure this equipment is demonstrably safe that will take time in the in the sense that we read and just now deciding which groups we do need to jump through\nOf aerospace engineering

of researchers at cutting university the made the discovery thanks for talking to us on a news day festival just had a little bit more what exactly is retired\nUh it's my pleasure thanks a ... a microscopic mineral that forms when the common minerals or con get squeezed by the crushing pressures during impact very rare and walk\nTo social impacts are we talking about here\nWell read I can form out a couple of different size impacts but the site we founded in Western Australia\nNear sharks they along the coast or is one of the big ones that put your dinner rare class and part of the controversy is people in the past it argued about it on\nOur discovery of read I pushes it in\nThe class and part of the controversy is people in the past it argued about its sides\nAre discovery of read I pushes it into a class that is an extinction class of that it doesn't mean that this impact caused an extinction but it's one of the big ones that's rare in earth history\nSo essentially a meteorite crushed to death and that is what you have a a beat up just Amish\nYeah here the uncertainty behind this and why it hasn't been discovered clearly before is this is an impact structure that's buried it happened about three hundred and sixty million years ago when sharks were roaming the seas and plants just started to colonize land\nAnd so during that time this large event occurred it would have generated towering tsunamis and other catastrophes over time it got buried and when we want to study at today we need other means to study it so our discovery was made by drill core collected nearly Twenty years ago\nWhile so it's a historical discovery in a sense\nWell think about this if the impact that hit Mexico sixty five million years ago it didn't occur the dinosaurs would still be roaming the earth mammals may not have ... we wouldn't be having this conversation assuredly and so we know the big impacts in cause dramatic changes\nOr to a to a or a than the things living on it\nThat impact is a hundred and eighty eighty kilometers in diameter and the one in Western Australia called would lay we think it's probably much greater than a hundred kilometers in diameter so it's the big one that killed the dinosaurs isn't even twice that size it's a big event\nFascinating soft of our income mostly thank you very much for talking to a nice day\nOut and about Ninety

universities was increasingly irrelevant\nWhen do you call in was head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy with students were with a mismatch between what they were learning in class and what we're seeing on the news\nWith a mismatch between what they were learning and close what we're seeing on the news it was supposed banks and then the whole financial system began crushing though\nWe're all watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students being very perplexed and what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on\nWe're not learning this in our classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economics tosses a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimensions at the crisis\nAnd Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because at Christmas people are thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well\nYour studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that you're not classes\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be two courses which has seemed to weigh a financial crisis was actually raging all around them brought home to many out of touch the profession has become windy calling is the most widely used university textbooks\nIn retrospect she admits these books must stumped subjects that we hugely important in terms of understanding the crush\nThings as basic as how finance works\nCan put my hand up I had spent a lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks\nWhich we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy so the the one published in two thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system and this was very typical\nOn banks all the financial system at least it was very typical of the way that curriculum excess taught in universities around the world\nAnd has that changed it has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches it in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think this is true or not just the opposite of many others\nAnd if you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics classrooms remember these are the people who graduate\nAnd going to steal the financial systems in which we all depend if they get bad advice you can wreck your economy\nThe growing frustration felt by students and their teachers around the world has given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one of these Wendy and many others are building a new free online curriculum known as cool this was a concern I feel passionate about\nAnd so I have to put my own hand up here I chair the core charity\nBut will it different curriculum be enough\nIn finance in so many other areas the person who pays the piper calls the tune bankers and politicians founded convenient to listen to those economists who argued for deregulation and who's morals allowed them to justify the housing bubble [noise]\nAnd that's a much easier economics professor at Stanford University in the U.S\nShe's frustrated by economists taking refuge in theory and saying what people want to hear well turning a blind eye to bind even criminal behavior by buying cars that can threaten financial stability\nIs definitely a problem it is very very shocking they remain really fantastic cut in the sense of how they explored the system\nSkiing there remain really fantastic cut in the sense of how they explored the system but in the end ignoring the biggest elephants in the room and all the flooding incentives and all the deception and fraud and all the excessive endangerment\nThat's an entirely unnecessary it's just taken is given it's just what they accept the system until she thinks is changed following the crisis\nWhat you hear is the more and out you know very shockingly you know stuff happens then you know we're doing our best and it's going to be sort of the big groups at crisis just wakes you up because you notice it and then he's like oh you know we really had terrible regulations before\nLet's fix it but then the fix is really not quiet ride but then you just kind of move on and say well I did my best can be prevented stuff happens\nIt's not much of a comfort to think of the economists could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joseph Stiglitz comes down to the continued reliance record numbers on the totally unrealistic notion that the market is always right\nHe dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nThey were blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers the blind believed that markets work well on their own unfettered markets will deliver for wellbeing for all citizens as been\nAt the center of you might say conservative economics sings Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood that wasn't true I think it'd be horrified at the abuse of his ideas he recognized\nIdeas he recognized that ah whenever businesses get together they conspire against the public interest to raise prices but somehow and the two hundred and some years after Adam Smith that conservatives I'd miss used his ideas\nEven more astounding was the fact that beginning in the Nineteen fifties sixties seventies and my own work or in the seventies and eighties advances in economics explained why markets often don't work the reason that this will hand often seemed invisible was it wasn't there\nThe notion of an invisible hand than supremacy of markets is based on the idea that if everyone buys and sells things in their self interest and threads freely without government intervention everyone will be better off\nJust Stiglitz won the Nobel Prize for economics by then to find some of the ways in which the key assumptions about perfect markets offload the presumption that everyone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple it's just that somebody knows something that somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation\nOthers didn't the fact is that the people who want to believe that markets were perfect close their eyes and in Dr needed their students\nThe markets basically worked perfectly\nWider economists expect humans to behave like rational calculating machines\nWhy do the corner must expect humans to behave like rational calculating machines despite all evidence to the country\nFor some this tendency indicates a key problem at the heart of economics which is to explain human behavior as if it were a science ... only works if you mentioned old humans are the same responding in the same way an old contributions to the economy can be counted\nJournalist Katrin muscles book who cooked on a smooth spinner argues the traditional economic theories and methods only makes sense if you mentioned humanity be self centered so unlike humans as almost a different species in fact some economists have given the species Elaine ... economic is\nHome economics ... doesn't have any feelings at least those feelings that not relevant to his economic decision making he's this sort of rational calculating brain that is always acting additive self interest and all of the set of characteristics or characteristics that we have been told to view as a male\nAnd even more obvious is sort of all the characteristics that economics guys to great lengths trying to exclude from these models like emotions family the faulty feelings compassion altruism\nAnd all of these things that we have been told that these are not economically relevant these not anything that we need to studying economics like send you the same things that we have been torched view as female\nI Know but the off to the Chrysler people were saying\nThis greed is good philosophy and this very narrow idea of what human beings are it's not good we need to bring these other values back in\nCan't solve our economic problems without the courage to the U.S helps with all that makes us human\nHe is the U.S held with all that makes that human and failed economic models and economic theory that is actually based on that\nI agree with Katrin but assuming that people are simply rational neglect key mentions of what makes us human that this was an important reason white Columbus fail to see the crisis coming\nThey

but to understand how to tackle road we'll problems more into this marriage is required\nThe financial crisis happened in my view not because the tools didn't exist in economics to understand what was
