what many other Brazilian evangelicals\nNow it's time to change both\nMany other Brazilian evangelicals\nNow it's time to change both so narrow is a is brink does new idea into Brazil community here in Framingham I Know when the boss on idol [noise]\nAt the entrance to a Brazilian bakery Brazilians are walking for behavior and loaded with opinions about the election it's coming towards Washington I put it this way\n... it's just because we need\nSomething extraordinary like something different right now to make a difference\nExtraordinary is indeed how many supporters describe boats and not\nOthers used the term extreme is for men who openly disparage gays and blacks and insulted women but when pressed for past remarks is presented to these both in our supporters some respond with a familiar refrain\nFake news is a ... it's just no\nTrue ... yeah I think it may lie about him that's all media they're just trying to not to get him elected which is not going\nBrazilians around the world can vote back home as long as they were born in Brazil regardless of immigration status where they live most Brazilians of Massachusetts confirm to relatively politically conservative areas in Brazil\nMinister us in the spiritual Santos and just as in those areas in Brazil are clear majority Brazilians here cast votes in the primary earlier this month for both so NARAL\nMr Bush Fernando is a typing on the big pocket of risk sentiment about corruption and also what we called cultural war\nMore similar to that day is a columnist for the newspaper for the oh in softball\nHe says both so no roads exploiting resentment over Brazilian government programs for the poor and that appeals to me\nExploiting resentment over Brazilian government programs for the poor that appeals to many Brazilian immigrants here in the U.S because they see themselves as self made\nMany immigrants working very hard to make a living\nThing that having a government that's very much in favor of the giving help to the the poor people in this kind of think it's a waste they would vote for a minimum government this kind of ideology is very widespread among received a new immigrants in the U.S [noise]\nThey are the ... of the poor in Brazil\nNuts Alisa Tracy is executive director of the Brazilian worker center in Boston where some of her clients phrase possible deportation by the Trump Administration but they still plan to vote for both so narrow who's been quoted as saying Haitian immigrants bring diseases to Brazil and but he wants them out of his country they\nDon't need that Trump he is the devil may and then they turn around and they say was ... when I say what's the difference between\nThe Trump and oh it's very different and I says well what about racism and discrimination and promoting violence I mean I don't understand why people are not able to see that the the two people are very similar and the message and the ideology\nTracy supports workers' party candidate for under what does it even though the former leader of a dodge party former president Lula da Silva is behind bars for corruption\nAnd not for corruption either but I'm also not full fascism and I'm very afraid of the outcome of this election\nTracing will crowd into a local high school with thousands of other Brazilians in the Boston area devote Sunday and she fears democracy itself is at stake\nYeah any I got taken my fish going all the way to put\nMe in Framingham W SRO radios\nThere's one on the political and let me in Framingham W SRO radio station announcers are mapping out live coverage from voting sites in eastern Massachusetts reference potato predicts Brazilians here and in Rhode Island will mark the day with celebrations when they're men also know tops the ticket\nThis guy in a way as ordinary guy for the world full of mark Boston\nVoter turnout is key in any election some places like Brazil have mandatory voting laws here in the U.S ahead of the midterms their concern in some states about efforts to suppress voting North Dakota for example that's where the stand and vote campaign comes in it seeks to encourage turnout and voter registration among Native Americans\nActor mark ... is part of the stand and vote campaign mark you were part of the protests and sit ins that went on in North Dakota against the Dakota access pipeline which has since been constructed what kind of you involved in that campaign\nThese water issues as they pertain to fossil fuel extraction was hoping that I already been working on for years many of the people that I worked with uh in in New York or native people and when Standing Rock was happening or I was invited to to come and stand if my native brothers and sisters to protect our water\nSo now you've given it a bit I'm Still working with with ah natives and getting out the vote I Know standing voting is campaign geared toward native populations in the U.S and in a a big part of it it has to do with the Supreme Court upholding this North Dakota vote voter id law what does that last say\n... basically says that ah unless you have a a street address on your id in North Dakota you aren't allowed to vote\nMost of the people who live on reservations\nDakota you aren't a lot of most of the people who live on reservations don't\nActually have a a a physical street address use PO box is\nSo now that the Supreme Court has upheld that law one can people on reservations in North Dakota do are coming up on midterms say\nYou know they can they can give them a general St ... a street address 'em through the uh the NATO council through the tribal council in each reservation\nI'm just curious if you're an actor and I I just wondered you call on different strengths their talents or in your activism than than in your acting career\nThis is a function at our artists have historically performs\nBring light to uh those issues that are that are in the dark and\nUm whether you're doing it on stage or with ideas play right you're doing it a movie with um with the struggles of human beings and storytelling or you're doing it directly indirect action um like standing at Standing Rock occupy\nWall Street or getting involved with a campaign or the fight against the war in Yemen\nUm these are part of the functions of being an artist and a something that I I put a lot of good faith in\nMark ... is an actor an activist he's involved with the stand and vote campaign an effort to get the vote out among Native Americans in North Dakota thank you so much mark thank you so have you talk to you [noise]\nThe day's top news stories are minute away you're with the world\n[noise]\nWays that seems to have gotten a bit last year you know as soon as being more reported on as you well you know this is just another son the Trump doesn't do what he's doing that he's reckless that he's\nAs you well you know this is just another son that Trump doesn't do what he's doing that he's reckless that he's endangering the security of everybody and hasn't generated nearly as much heat and save the letter bomb story which is\nThe reaction that Christopher described in Greece is exactly the same reaction that's happened here without saying that Trump has brought this on himself he's ratcheted up the tension\nUm that's generating a lot more passionate about what each than the thought that someone's a hack Donald Trump's I thought\nOh I Can't have a journalist from Germany ... from Greece in an interview without asking you both you know your two countries have had some tensions in recent years you know over a ... and that kind of thing I mean Howard Harry your country is getting along these days [laughter] [laughter]\nWell I I think\nIt's a love affair slowly slowly let's start from our prime minister Mr chipper us\nWho um was elected in two thousand and scream\nWith tens of thousands of people gathering in the center of other ones on the repeating off him his very famous China McDonalds America to go home he hate to an end at the beginning this kind of relation\nBetween ... onto the cheaper ah was always at the core of our attention as journalists how is he\nPossibly going to confront too when you first meet in the European Union I'm gradually we we love that ... quite special relationship between them and it was not a closer look there by any\nMeans but it was certainly a kind of a mother\nTowards the child is a she seems to kind of educate them in the way it listen let's talk peacefully come here come to this room to sit by ourselves sometimes alleged tool it we know that he respects\nHere come to this room to sit by ourselves sometimes alleged tool it we know that he respects are very very much the situation the relationship between the two countries I think is I'm\nQuite good Jefferson how does it feel in Berlin yeah\nI I Would pretty much agree with that I mean I think I'm Greece's lot smaller than Germany so it doesn't commands or tension here probably as much as we command there tend to live but I think the sense is that you know the Greeks has\nDone a pretty good job of trying to get their economic problems on to control they basically done what's the Germans have asked them and that they should be given a break and of course\nYou don't ... medical has much bigger problems with some other European leaders you know main competitor like Victor all bond in Hungary you know I'm a going out for a meal with the prime minister of Greece is probably a walk in the park\nIf I may just add another fact that I'm sure the address and lose about that as well we we lost from a German uh my my favorite football team or just lost one by an ... days ago and I'm going to have you been\nBoth [laughter] I tap awfully on that up our\nTeam cost eight million euros and by you they cost a hundred billion so that the rich\n[laughter] journalists Christos ... is in Athens Jefferson chase is the ... valley in Berlin I Want to thank you both for being with us today I'm happy to know\n\nOur next story is about a part of immigrant life in the U.S at sometimes goes unnoticed is the fact that immigrant workers are more educated than ever before\nThey're just as likely to hold a bachelor's degree as us citizens but often that education doesn't cross over which prevents people from continuing the careers they had back home are part of Ashley clique noticed this imbalance in the nurse\nEven the careers they had back home reporter Ashley clique noticed this imbalance in the nursing world where there is a labor shortage which she also found programs trying to bridge the gap\n... was working as a nurse in Haiti when the massive earthquake struck in twenty ten she rushed to care for women she delivers babies\nI took care of people with HIV to murder which they try to be taking care of their babies to\nDefine had found her calling but in twenty sixteen she moved to New York to be with her husband she left her country and her career behind because to be a nurse in the U.S you have to be certified here it makes sense but it also means that despite eight years as a nurse in Haiti the phones had to start over\nI couldn't not ... so I I started working I was on the phone as food\nHome health aide helping people with their meds food doctor says that's\nKind of so ... so not a anything we're not going to nursing\nFor defense to be a nurse again she needed to pass the certification exam called the ...\nMost nurses educated in the U. S. nail it on their first try that only forty percent of immigrant nurses educated abroad make it through the fence tried studying on around but the material and the language barrier overwhelmed her when she heard about a program at LaGuardia community college in New York\nTo help immigrant nurses like her prep for the past the programs tough six hours a day four days a week for eight months\nAre very murder number was ...\nA recent evening about Fifteen minutes from all over the world Haiti Nepal Honduras China sit with their ... books with paragraphs highlighted in pink and yellow tonight's lesson is on\nGrass highlighted in pink and yellow tonight's lesson is on kidney failure\nProbably should've though says why was it was a loss right\nNow is Dr phil ... moves through the answers while another instructor right that difficult words like Korea Team he towns and diluted along sheet of paper\nSome of the women are tired late many have families and other jobs tiny Amir as who works at the program says many of the students are like the Fonz under employed\nIf they are working there working minimum wage jobs where they have to sit on the sidelines and basically not use any of their skills and know how\nTo know how the U.S needs at least one million more nurses will be in demand over the next few years to care for aging Americans an immigrant nurses coming out of this class are doing really well I'm not big certification exam with a Seventy five percent pass rate ... motivated the fonts to stick with it\nIf people before you maybe they pass the exam they come from other countries they do a lot of suck Wi Fi they maybe you can do that too they not super not too old people [laughter]\nBut it's been hard for defense when she got into the test prep program her husband was stationed at an army base in Florida the phones knew she'd need to work weekends unsteady during the week and it she couldn't do that well also caring for her baby daughter so she sent her daughter to stay with her grandma in Haiti all she studied for the test\nI sacrifice my son really to be able to finish the room\nShe did finish the program and pass and collects exam she's a nurse in the U. S. but there's a hatch to work at a hospital in New York ...\nYes but there's a hedge to work at a hospital in New York the phones is required to have a bachelor's degree to the phones have four and a half years of college three years of nursing school and a year plus a midwife training but the U.S doesn't count the midwife part\nSo they not some sooner or my your studies together so they just one Souter my nursing school so I have to complete the again for my ... degree\nSo she signed up for college part time she should finish and about five years but at least with the nursing exam out of the way the Fonz had brought her daughter back from Haiti the family's altogether now\nAfter work when Saturday defenses husband makes a huge part of their daughter ride the bike up and down the hallway\nDefines of pretty tired [noise]\nShe finished along shifted Alice this lab and still has class her to do for a degree [noise] but she says she's thinking of five years from now when she will be working in a hospital as a nurse for the world actually\nThat story is part of our brain game series on immigrants and education for more stories just go to the world dot org slash brain game\n[noise]\nThere with the world and\nYou're listening to the world\n\nYou're listening to the world aren't KU when our public radio good evening I'm Michelle Rivera coming up tonight at ten will bring you as it happens Philadelphia's city council honored the flyers ... orange mascot\nBut how does greedy designer explain the allure of his lovable loser some creation to the rest of us\nAs it happened for more than thirty five years the CBC is popular current affairs program is explored the heart of a story whether it's happening in the streets of Belgrade the dock yards of Vancouver the boardrooms a bay street or the kitchen the parrot\nAs it happened from ten to eleven o'clock tonight", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "27", "locations": [["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["Brazil", -10.0, -55.0], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["Miami", 25.77427, -80.19366], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["Poland", 52.0, 20.0], ["Sri Lanka", 7.75, 80.75], ["Riyadh", 24.68773, 46.72185], ["turkey", 39.0, 35.0], ["Istanbul", 41.01384, 28.94966], ["Turkey", 39.0, 35.0], ["Saudi Arabia", 25.0, 45.0], ["Turkey", 39.0, 35.0], ["Riyadh", 24.68773, 46.72185], ["Ireland", 53.0, -8.0], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["United states", -14.60485, -57.65625], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Boston", 42.35843, -71.05977], ["Framingham Massachusetts", 42.27926, -71.41617], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Brazil", -10.0, -55.0], ["Framingham", 42.27926, -71.41617], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Brazil", -10.0, -55.0], ["Massachusetts", 42.36565, -71.10832], ["Brazil", -10.0, -55.0], ["Santos", -23.96083, -46.33361], ["Brazil", -10.0, -55.0], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Brazil", -10.0, -55.0], ["Boston", 42.35843, -71.05977], ["Brazil", -10.0, -55.0], ["Boston Massachusetts", 42.35843, -71.05977], ["Rhode Island", 41.82399, -71.41283], ["Boston", 42.35843, -71.05977], ["Brazil", -10.0, -55.0], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["North Dakota", 46.80833, -100.78374], ["North Dakota", 46.80833, -100.78374], ["Dakota", 46.80833, -100.78374], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Standing Rock", 38.17499, -109.95902], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["North Dakota", 46.80833, -100.78374], ["North Dakota", 46.80833, -100.78374], ["North Dakota", 46.80833, -100.78374], ["Standing Rock", 38.17499, -109.95902], ["Yemen", 15.5, 47.5], ["North Dakota", 46.80833, -100.78374], ["Greece", 39.0, 22.0], ["Germany", 51.5, 10.5], ["Greece", 39.0, 22.0], ["China", 35.0, 105.0], ["Berlin", 52.52437, 13.41053], ["Greece", 39.0, 22.0], ["Germany", 51.5, 10.5], ["Hungary", 47.0, 20.0], ["Greece", 39.0, 22.0], ["Athens", 37.98376, 23.72784], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Ashley", 18.0144, -77.34019], ["Haiti", 19.07582, -72.29616], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Haiti", 19.07582, -72.29616], ["the U.

killed during that time\nOh my gosh I mean it doesn't sound like something Brazil really wants to repeat so what do you think it is about that period that some people in Brazil are nostalgic for that seems to be resonating when ... talks about it\nWell I think the main issue is that Brazil never reckon with its military dictatorship past and the military controlled the process of transition from dictatorship to democracy\nIn Nineteen Seventy nine they passed this broad amnesty law that prevented anyone involved\nIn human rights violations working for the regime to be prosecuted for eternity so unlike Argentina or Chile Brazil never prosecuted and military ball in the dictatorship the military involved in the extrajudicial killings and the torture so\nBrazilians have developed this idea that it was a time without crime without economic problems and I think that both so now is trying to tap\nInto that when both so NATO started his political career for many years he was as fringe figure in Brazil in politics but given the current political crisis and economic crisis in Brazil you managed to become popular because he's a message\nOf law and order and return to what some people

talked about that\nHarassment basically in the hands of one particular person who is just resigned and was junior is to in the cutting government these women ready counting that how do we need to be

comedian and\nThat actually kind of you know the good old ... ... and a lot of difference of men and Sunday from wanting to come from India to admit industry it went on to the press and that is when

women and men who are extremely\nExonerated and they see that this is a moment of truth in India which has been voted for so long and it has been extremely brave of these women who have come forward media has also been supportive but\nThere's also mean is more criticism off some of the ... and some of the women coming forward and there is some kind of backlash some water that you know the name of

also tells us what feminist politics and due to social space\nSo I just want to ask you one more thing because there have been several incidents in recent years that have prompted national conversations over a sexual assault and abuse in India I think of a twenty twelve gang rape of geology saying uh she was given the name nearby there was a lot of media attention in India all over the globe\nBut then after the trial for the perpetrators international discussions\nIt kind of felt like that news quietly went away\nAnd then there'd be another attack but wouldn't get much attention just situated for us what's happening now and what feels kind of like a pattern up to now is this different\nIn twenty two has been the same as they happen and thousands of men and then came out in

Ninety six to observe presidential campaigns and I've never seen anything quite like that\nEverybody here and there is in their respective camp and it's almost impossible to find anybody who is sitting on the fancy they're all in one camp all the ... and have very very strongly held views about Donald Trump he is the story\nAnd I don't get a sense that Americans are very happy politically right now even those who are on either side I think this is science of disconnect and it upsets people it's the same story everywhere we go\nOn happiness that really seems to be on the painting a lot of what we see and said this quiet I think which is permeating American society right now even the people who very strong Trump supporters and we'll probably see themselves as being in the ascendency so that's a hard road that I think Americans are taking right now\nSo the big question you're trying to answer talking to American voters is what matters to you how varied have those answers been extremely I may pay\nSupport as as I say Trump is being somebody who's just shaking up the country in a way that has never been done before\nAnd they believe that he's achieving things and they'll site North Korea is an example of that the tariff wars with China and the other side of the coin it's division it's the shouting out it's the singling out of minority groups and individuals that people find\nSingling out of minority groups and individuals that people find very offensive and drives a lot of their intentions in this midterm election\nYou know I mean that trade weren't terrorists that's not necessarily a good thing for people in the middle of the country farmers for example are you finding what\nThat is a fascinating thing you know we were just in Breckenridge, Minnesota just a few days ago and we conducted little focus group that primarily amongst farmers and what they told us was that even though China's not buying their crops the down by about twenty five percent and returns\nThat were prepared to give Donald Trump a chance to sort out this war with the Chinese but then would speak to other ... that is well and good but ... now full and if we can solve this problem out really soon we got to have another habit snakes human not going to have anything to do with that\nSo it's interesting that sometimes their emotional attachment to a personal to cause can out why the hip pocket and as we call it in stride but usually motivates what people's biting intentions of going to be\n... have you ever seen that dynamic like that back in Australia it's very rare\nExcept in as strategy we do have something of a Trump phenomena and it usually comes with people who once calling the shots in a society where they feel they're being left out left behind\nAnd I will sometimes support candidates who don't represent their interests and that happened a few years ago when we had a woman called polling Hansen she's still around and she ran a particular one nation very populist and\nShe was upsetting Asians and Asian tourists to strike but people in tourists dependent electric was voting for her and say yeah sometimes people vote against their interests I read an article once said what took you\nPeople vote against their interests I read an article once and it said was ... Thanksgiving sometimes that it just happens to the question now I think that we're going to have to be asking in two years' time if we come back as well\nHas Trump delivered on the big things that he said he was going to because right now what we're saying is that people who might be sitting in the middle I'm more inclined to cite will give him a chance we're going to see how you guys and that's my main that the cycle blue why that is coming might just be more of a trickle\nHow much does an issue like immigration or what we're talking about earlier ... how much did the opinions you heard from Americans vary depending on the region well\nIt depended to a large extent actually in South Carolina you cannot get away from rice as an issue\nAnd people of color they were very very distressed they felt that that will being singled out by Donald Trump and in fact we buy two Seventy seven year old man African American who grew up in the eyes of segregation in South Carolina had refused admission in the lunch counters in restaurants and\nSort it as roars and he said he had never seen anything like Donald Trump in his lifetime he had never seen such of racism and he's view coming from a president does somebody in such high office he said it was much more subtle in the past and he felt it but he'd never felt this roar exposure\nThat's extraordinary [noise] Bruce you've been in the U.S before and as you know the mid term elections historically have low voter turnout what's it like in Australia or greater sense there that you have to take care of the civic responsibility of casting a vote\nWilling to strike have compulsory ... at stake in that responsibility out of our hands and\n... that's taken that responsibility out of our hands and tell us we'll be fond if we die hard but estranged taken for granted really that they have divided on election day and we have Ninety five percent turnout\nAnd then of course changes the nature of politics ... it means that the politicians are much more focused on the Santa Robin having to energize the base all the time\nIf you are have compulsory biting your politician industry you know that your traditional voters are going to come out and support you it's the people in the middle you have to convince and that means that extreme politics even though it sounds very divisible times\nStill is much more inclusive in the basic tenants that I'm the pain the major political parties for example\nAh you know we have a national hills game which would never be touched by either at the major parties I don't think the model I've taught it just is not an issue that I Know that if I were to the pot from that that would be the end of the prospects of winning an election\nDo you get the sense that Americans are more motivated to go to the polls this year\nMore motivated everywhere we go we're hearing reports from journalists and others that turnout is greater with early voting mental so registration that the Kevin uh issue has motivated and energized democratic voters particularly women\nSo on both sides with seeing this remarkable energizing I'd be very surprised if we can say ... me too I'm voting turnout and we're also getting at reports that in states like Georgia where there's been allegations of vote as a profession\nThat that is how to read this effect and that there's been a very high turnout before the election day by people who presumably are offended by what's happening there\nAnd one of the things that are being doing is talking to young people and asking them well what do you\nAnd one of the things that are being doing is talking to young people and asking them well what do you think about Donald Trump in the priority says he has and they basically say\nThat totally out of step with what we are worried about and the number one issue that we get back is climate change because this is the generation that's going to have to deal with these problems and the other is intergenerational debt but they really do worry about climate and climate change\nAnd you can understand why you know I wouldn't be around to see the worst effects of climate change but they will not think that will become a bigger and bigger issue as this generation starts to assert more and more power\nBruce Walker is an Australian political strategists he's been filming a documentary called a hard road travels and Trump's America we'll speak with him again after the midterms\nBy the way if you're a new U.S citizen are voting for the first time here in America we want to hear from you what does voting mean to you and how does it compare with voting in another country\nEmail us at this address my world at the world dot org again that's my world at the world dot O. R. G.\nWhen the news headlines are coming up next year with the world [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nOr you had troubles with the Obama administration your bosses and your tenure in Afghanistan was terminated where did the leadership there fail\nWell I mean part of it on my end\nThe reality is although President Obama had a different policy view than I did not hugely different I was you know very supportive of\nWhat he asked me to do but at a point an news story came out or a media story in Rolling Stone magazine that I didn't think was fair but at the same time I'm a commander in Afghanistan and it's not it's my job or not\nI'm a commander in Afghanistan and it's not it's my job not to let hot stories land on the desk of the commander in chief so that was my failure whether I disagreed with it or not\nGeneral McChrystal let's talk about current leadership you're retired now and we're seeing us troops play new rules this week we learned that the Pentagon and sending more than five thousand troops to the Mexican border of five thousand more than double the number of troops in Syria what does that decision tell us about our current leadership\nThe decision to send U.S forces to somewhere like the border is a symbol and in the minds of some Americans have probably says how we have an invasion coming a we have an emergency we have to protect the homeland\nAnd while that's not the case it creates that mental image and sending regular military forces down there since the idea that we're going to be decisive flipper really defending what we ought to do is put in drones out to get targeting Hindu airstrikes on the migrant convoy and just stop it\nBefore it gets close but of course that's absurd\nAnd that's immoral and that's not something that we're even thinking about doing but we shouldn't even send the idea that this is going to defend the walls of the Alamo however in some ways it is a crisis\nIt's a crisis because up close we're going to have the arrival of a number of people who want entry into the United states in many cases they have a pretty valid reasons for wanting to leave Honduras or Guatemala\nA lack of opportunity plus threats to them and so now we're going to be up close and personal with a moral issue so I think it's when we talk about putting military around we almost confused the issue because the route issue here is one of our immigration policy\nCause the route issue here is one of our immigration policy and in America's values and we've got to look in the mirror decide what our values are adjust our policy reflects those and it's got to be a compromise because not all Americans are going to agree\nSo how do you feel our country is being led laid off from me what is your take on the on the

activism has them and the four years since so\nCan you just described some of what she told you about what you went through all in ICE's captivity [noise]\nIt's very hard for her to describe because
