us\nAnd and be part of what we're building and we've missed the playoffs every year for five years so this is not what the brand was meant to be and that's what what\nAre fans deserve to be back to what they're used to in in terms of Lakers basketball having the best player has brought us back it's it's it's elevated the brand now we just need to do that on there\nI I don't necessarily expect you to answer this question but it kind of have to ask her view a little brown and ... and Magic Johnson drove for basketball and you know ... and the other best workers have you guys had the conversation on yourself about look this isn't going to be rebuilding\n[noise] um yeah you you know yes I mean magic has definitely has a plan as to what we're doing you know when when magic came in and took over basketball operations\nWhat I felt was and why I had to make the change from our existing general manager and my brother Jim who oversaw basketball\nWas that there was no identity of Laker basketball\nThey're really interesting because liquor basketball's like a brand name\nAnd and you can't establish anything when you're changing coaches every eight months\nAnything when you're changing coaches every eight months so we had three coaches and three years\nYou know and each one a great coach in themselves but you can't change your roster overnight and so the ... everything was not matched up right and we were struggling with no identity\nSo this goes to something which are marketplace all the time you were in uncertainty and and not only does regular business uncertainty so too does the sports business in sports teams and the woman running loose forced to write uncertainty was going\nIt was killing the brand and it was you know when my father passed away than commissioner David Stern called me and he said\nJeannie don't let the team fail like don't let go don't run into the ground who say oh yeah who looked like\nIt it would you break your dad's heart and so you know and it was difficult because I wasn't in charge of basketball my brother was and I asked him how long is it going to take you to\nGet the team on track and he gave himself a timeline which\nAs as time went on I realized it wasn't going to happen and that's why I had to make the change that I did but I you know I took that to heart and I wouldn't I wouldn't let this you know my dad had six kids and I think the Lakers were his favorite cat [laughter] and her son is the last\n... or would hear about your family right I mean Dr Bush or to your brother who worked with and then and then had to replace you talk a lot you talked about it in your book where we've talked about it in interviews about how this is a family business show those first couple of years when the commercial lead\nThe show's first couple of years when the commercial read culture and says don't blow it with a family business and then you have to file your brother what's that was\nIt was very very difficult um\nYou know my dad kinda set it up for us\nBut ultimately he gave me the authority and the power\nTo make any changes that I saw a necessary one of the key components of that decision making process was a conversation I had with Kobe Bryant he said what a player\nAn all star player who's you know a free agent is going to look at an organization and how it operates and making sure that there's somebody in charge who has authority to accomplish what the goals are\nMeaning you've got you've got to get the organization in the right position before anybody will consider\nInvesting his career in what you're doing right now nobody knows what you guys stand for\nSort of becomes a poke in your question about about and making the change from prior management and your brother you should wear the number of years the door to one\nThat was my first comment publicly was I apologized to Laker fans because perhaps I did wait too long um as you can hear the music that are only ... it's it's funny

Kevin Republican Washington Post our in our studios in New York City ... okay\nSo let me start with you uh and and ah in the process of asking this question I'm going to point out that we're going to be hearing from a Tracey Samuelson in about six minutes or so on some of the details of uh the GDP report as it deals with trade but a very quick pass on his GDP report it is a good number\nYeah the headline number is good there are some underlying parts of it that are a little bit troubling including the fact that business investment I had had slowed\nYou know there is this risk that the boost to a capital expenditure is was pretty front loaded this year as a result of the ... and we're seeing a slow down and so that is a little bit troubling but generally the headline number was good consumers seem happy\nNew and it occurs me actually just thinking back to how I open the show that I should have said there is that there are three fourths right economic growth the trade war and also the tax cuts because there was a tension there between the trade one of the tax cuts in the stimulus and the and the un stimulus if you will of what's going on\nLet's plan it down to two things uh one is higher interest rates which in the stimulus feeds into and stronger grass and right now\nFor a short period of time maybe we are at an economic sweet spot for the economy can still grow but inflation is still very moderate in fact both low the\nFed target rate of two percent in this latest GDP read and so\nTarget rate of two percent in this latest GDP read\nAnd so right now um things are looking good economically speaking in its good as Katherine side because the consumer is good I I hear some trepidation do in your voice mail\nYou know there's no such thing as a perfect the economy and part of the reason that markets were worried this week and we saw that in the stock market this week is there there were these three persisting concerns\nSlower global growth higher interest rates and ... concerns those are going to stay with us until they're resolved and so you'll see the push pull in the market between really strong fundamentals and I'm very worried outlook for ... investors ahead okay\nKatherine not to point out the president's ah economic inconsistencies but it bears amazing point them out well well uh [laughter]\nSo so here's the thing just on the street and tariffs when he came out this week in in a tweet at some point Monday Tuesday and said we're going to billions of dollars into the United states because of all these are not mentioning the consumer is going to pay those jobs but then he turns around in an interview with the wall Street Journal and says tariffs we don't have any terms on this economy I don't I don't understand I guess is what I'm saying\nAnd in that very same Wall Street journal article he also talked about how useful the terrorists have been so like basically in the same breath ah you know on the one hand he's saying we have these tariffs on the other hand he signed the terrorists don't exist\nIt can make your head spin a little bit and you can understand why it has been so difficult for some of our trading partners potentially to negotiate with the people who have been dispatched to negotiate on behalf of the United states\nIf they don't really know what the president wants the president is inconsistent about not only what he wants but actually what he's already been doing then\nIs inconsistent about not only what he wants but actually what he's already been doing then that can be that can make it very difficult to make any sort of progress and you know when I've talked with a business groups when I've talked with business owners they have expressed a lot of concern about the the uncertainty that comes from the fact\nThat Trump does not seem to have a particularly sophisticated understanding of international trade or clear goals for that matter about what he's trying to get out of these negotiations\nNew on other running from the wall Street Journal interview and and ah one has to say it's the goal is to put pressure on the Federal Reserve he once again called the fed uttered budget power or his biggest economic problem\nI'm even as a German ... told me back in June even as the fed doesn't bring attention with President says one does wonder if\nYou know with some signs perhaps the economy might not be a all that it will be for too much longer um and the fed might be thinking about rage what does this kind of pressure you suppose due to the motive ... well\nYou know it makes a hard job even that much harder right so what the fed is really concerned about is how to keep the economic\nBull market running how to keep economic growth in and stop lung still normalizing policy because women as and we know that it will be aware and eventually the neck in recession hits he wants to make sure that he has to look at is this fully ready to to stop\nA the slowdown as possible and that means raising short term interest rates it's a very effective tool the fed has been using it for years and they want to make sure that tools ready for the next recession and they want to do so in in a context of economic growth and so that's what's happening here very moderate in ...\nAnd so that's what's happening here very moderate increase in short term interest rates from zero rain so\nAlong that path any political ... political ... of a very moderate increase in rates makes the heart his job all the more tricky and that sweat and has to be negotiated going for a port\nRichardson a at a Edward Jones Catherine Rampell at the Washington Post on a friday I'm In New York City Thanks you too thank you ... have a nice weekend on Wall street today down day to end it up and down weak and let me say one more time I think\nLike the fourth time this week I've said this this is normal this is what's supposed to happen markets go up\nThey go down but it has been a while since things have felt this chopping right well that the details when we do the numbers [noise]\n\n\n\n\nAll right\nBack we're going to go to the GDP report from this morning because you know a list economic indicator and all that is Catherine and Neal and I were saying it's pretty good number credit where credit's due\nBut you dig a little deeper as we want to do around here and you could start to separate what is boosting economic growth consumer spending for instance from what is not helping growth all that much at all one of those drags last quarter was trade marketplaces Tracey Samuelson explains what's going on there so how much\nFaster with the economy have grown without this drag from trade you would have seen a much larger growth rate probably closer to over five percent at the end of you know it's cheap\nCloser to over five percent at the end of you know is chief us economist at essence ... global what you saw was exports down pretty sharply imports were up pretty sharply\nTogether that shaped nearly two percentage points off of GDP Growth but he says imports were driven by a strong dollar which is making foreign products a good deal plus she says companies were replenishing their inventories filling up their shelves head of the holidays\nThey may also be trying to get ahead of tariffs on Chinese imports that are set to jump from Tempe present to twenty five percent in the new year\nBetter to spend now and have it ready to sell rather than having to purchase more that cost more down the road\nThis macro economic data matches what we've been hearing from public companies as they report their quarterly earnings Matt McDonald is a partner with Hamilton place strategies which analyzed transcripts from recent corporate earnings calls\nThe trade discussion has a ... for the first time and when they're talking about trade there almost all talking about tariffs\nFor example Ford has estimated the Trump administration's trade policy will cost the company a billion dollars this year in part due to higher steel prices and tariffs on imports from China\nThat does feel like from both the way companies are talking about it and from what we see in the GDP numbers that the impact starting to bite\nAt least at the country and company level consumers just aren't feeling it yet a majority responding to a recent marketplace Edison research pull

cloud obviously is just basically somebody else's server but you know when you need long term archival storage you want something separate it from the Internet\nAnd you want something that's going to uphold massive amounts of data even more than a server and that's where the tape comes in and the experts say the tape is the medium of choice because it's cheap it's good it's it's reliable and its stores a heck of a lot of data\nYeah Gen cheapest important with all that data right I mean I don't even know what gets bigger than terabytes but we have a lot of them\nYeah ... terabytes is equivalent to about a million books I'm right now a a single L T o seven linear tape can hold about Fifteen terabytes that's about Fifteen million books on one tape on one card\nGosh okay now there

I go by Chris I'm from Anaheim and I'm thirty five ...\nCorn Jessica I'm forty years old and I live in Houston, Texas Susan\nBoyle I'm fifty eight years young I reside in Anna Maria Florida\nKeith big him and I am sixty years old and I live in Everett, Washington\nI defined financial security I Would describe financial security measures security mental security\nAs having more than enough money and resources to do whatever I Need to find a\nRoof over your head screwed on the table and I'm getting medical care if any that you should have at least\nThirty to forty percent more than your expenses are among\nThe fund set aside like in your savings which can cover your expenses for six months and then also leg\nDown for you to cabinet getting\nFences for six months and then also leg\nDance for your time mentoring and education for your kids you know being\nFinancially secure would be like a seven digit number my savings account [laughter]\nTo be prepared for another recession I feel that probably three to six months worth of the salary would feel safe yeah\nPersonally have the six months of saving so I'm not much worried about that\nDepends on how severe the recession might be I feel like I'm both of our jobs or jobs that won't disappear\nI think that we do okay um I Would I Would hope so he planned for the worst and hope for the best we have always um built a cushion and always tried to pay down debt\nI feel somewhat prepared because I recognized that my security is in my own hands so that means growing my own food that means having good relationships with my neighbors that means knowing how to\nCreate clean water or shelter or what is edible landscaping\nWe own a condo we're still paying on\nStill paying two car payments student loans and\nWe're not being able to put a whole lot away for retirement\nIt doesn't take too much to go through your savings that I like if you don't have the income you know so that's where they keeping that steady flow of income you know by keeping the job is very in a city you know\nThat's a real concern is like are we going to have to work that we're Seventy five [noise]\nIt would just take one hospital stayed to ruin us\nIt would just take one hospital stay to ruin us\nHealth care as it happens in this country top economic concerns twenty eight percent of people that it is the economic issue that worries them the most\nYou can slice and dice are pulled out of yourself and marketplace dot org on Wall street bank wells little slice and dice does well down three hundred on the down and up and then down again whether details when we do that I\nLot of the thing we learned in our poll is that a majority\nOf Americans and this is across party won a majority of Americans say we are in a trade war they're not especially worried about it just ... percent say traders are topic and I'm a concern\nBut on the theory that nobody knows which way the current us Chinese trade relationship shall we say is going to go what might get more people more worried one way that things could you ask your is that it is if China sold off a lot of the American dead\nThat now holds ... looked at the likelihood that might have\nThe U.S government spends more each year than it brings in in revenue and to cover that shortfall it borrows money selling treasury bonds China owns more of these treasuries than any other country\nAbout one point two trillion with a T dollars and this has been a source of anxiety long before the current trade war here's Hillary Clinton on the presidential campaign trail back in two thousand seven\nAre now dependent upon China and how do you get ... on your banker thing is\nAnd upon China and how do you get top on your banker thing is China's stockpile of treasury bonds is a theory small fraction of the total us that about five percent Mary Gallagher is the director of the center for Chinese studies at the University of Michigan I think\nThe notion of China as our banker is overblown both in terms of how much debt is actually owned and also whether or not their alternative buyers\nBut while China owns lots of treasuries it hasn't actually been buying many more in recent years so the question is really with China dumped the U.S debt it owns as a weapon in the ongoing trade war you know flood the market with lots of bonds to try and mess with US Economy Gallagher thinks maybe anything is I think possible\nGiven the fact that the trade war is more pointed then I think people initially expected\nBut selling off a bunch of treasuries would likely mean selling at a discount meaning losses for China a fire sale means but I was going well below ... at UC Davis thinks China would have to be provoked to resort to that it's unlikely that the Chinese would use this option\nUnless the reached by phone\nA lot of the actions which the ... short term as bond prices fall the yields or interest rate market demands would increase that would raise borrowing costs on lots of types of loans Brad sets are with the council on Foreign Relations says don't reserved to the rescue\nThe Federal Reserve has all the tools needed to limit the damage that China could cause through sales\nThe fed could tweak its plans to raise interest rates in order to offset any fallout from China's bond sales\nThat's why I Am much more worried about the risk to China might conclude that it just was weaker currency and try\nConclude that just wants a weaker currency and tried to uh respond to terrorists in that way\nSince our says allowing the Chinese currency to appreciate against the dollar would make its goods cheaper globally and that would be much more disruptive and much harder for us to counteract I'm Tracey Samuelson for marketplace\nGot it All right so we're gonna facets ordinarily out so this is receiving okay All right so you want to walk them through what you're doing\nHow are you I'm caught me most of secrecy and tell me what you are doing\nYes so

E. Cano political I think I'm quoting that phrase officially by the way it came from former White House economic adviser Gary Cohn today he did a whole thing on CNBC said he is really pleased with the state of the economy overall except for this one thing\nWe are a service economy our economy's driven by Serbs were eighty plus percent of our GDP eighty plus percent of our job creation is services so when you're a service economy the way to stimulate your economy the way to grow your economy is to allow consumers to buy goods is ...\nIs to allow consumers to buy goods as cheaply as they possibly can and use the rest of their money to buy services or if they're lucky enough to say anything that raises the price of a good doesn't make sense for our economy even if they're paying it to the government as a terror it's just another tax\nAlthough we never did actually come out and said it's widely believed coal left the White House over the president's decision to go ahead with the trade war that we are in and a trade war by the way it does seem to be picking up a little bit of steam commerce secretary Wilbur Ross was in Brussels as we talk and things over with the European Commission and you might recall back in July the president\nAgreed to hold off on his threat to hit European auto imports with tariffs that would have been a very very big deal the president agree to hold off while the two sides negotiated the bigger trade deal\nWell three months later both sides are now blaming the other for lack of progress on any discussions with Ross saying quote our president's patience is not unlimited marketplaces named Scott has the transatlantic latest\nBack in late July European Commission president John ... and President Trump stood side by side in the rose garden and announced the makings of a deal\nWe agreed today first of all to work together towards zero tariffs zero non tariff barriers and zero subsidies\nFor non auto industrial goods thank you so what's the hold up\nFinance professor Jeffrey Berg stranded at the University of Notre Dame says for one thing the U.S trade officials have been a little busy hammering out another deal to replace NAFTA and that involved just three countries\nWould you take that to twenty\nInvolved just three countries\nWould you take that to twenty eight countries in the European Union it's a very demanding procedure demands a lot of time\nAnd Michelle Egan a fellow at the council on Foreign Relations says some of those non tariff barriers like different regulations and industry standards are hard to resolve\nTheir differences in regulations on cosmetics for example because of animal testing different sense in the way cars to test it in terms of safety lights or seatbelts\nAnd then there are the politics says Charles captain professor of international affairs at Georgetown he says in Europe growing anti Trump and anti American sentiment could be another road blocks\nAnd on this side of the Atlantic you've got a protection is president who is none too keen on striking a deal with you because he sees it as a ... vote has been seeking to take advantage of the United states\nOn the other hand captain says the Trump Administration has a big incentive to forge a deal to put pressure on it's bigger trade target China I'm Amy scot free market place\nThat's trade the early part of this week economic news was was dominated by the budgets actually the budget deficit all seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars of it last fiscal year a Seventeen percent increase over the prior year that was on Monday and then yesterday\nPresident Trump said he wants to cut five percent from the federal budget next fiscal year instead of majority leader Mitch McConnell\nSaid he is disturbed by the deficit and blames Social Security and Medicare\nBut here's a big chunk of the increase in ... we're going to ... every year is because the federal government is pulling in less tax revenue thanks to the tax cuts passed last year yes\nPulling in less tax revenue thanks to the tax cuts passed last year yes the tax cuts that were going to pay for themselves marketplaces Kimberly Adams drugs in on that has gone\nSo yeah despite the rhetoric in the run up to the passage of the tax law\nTax cuts for no we're going to pay for the\nBrain read all is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and used to work for the Senate Finance committee\nScenario which sucks for themselves they're probably going to be true in a two and a half trillion dollars or ... years\nBut let's review that scenario where they do pay for themselves over ten years first you cut corporate taxes businesses invest that increases productivity wages go up\nAnd boom that magical three percent growth per year we've heard so much about our ... at the American Enterprise Institute says it's too early to know what's working\nI think looking at one is numbers and saying well the tax cuts and not walking and the adding to the deficits instead of reducing them I think is is is kind of misleading\nEven if things take time she says time isn't the only issue we paid for these tax cuts with a dead\nEven in
