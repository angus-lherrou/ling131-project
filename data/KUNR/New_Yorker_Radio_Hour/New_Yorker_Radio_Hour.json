in America right now this is very much the subjective Rebecca Traister his new book good in mad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nThe book and binds a kind of history of women's uprisings with an analysis of the me too movement\nTraister is written for New York magazine el the New York times in the Washington Post and her last book was called all the single ladies unmarried women and the rise of an independent nation Rebecca Traister and I spoke on the very day that Christine Blasey Ford and\nBrett Kavanaugh both testified about her sexual assault allegations Rebecca there's\nNo way to avoid this we are talking now just hours after the Senate Judiciary committee has done its questioning ... there was a very specific story being\nTold by professor Ford as well as as as we near us and others ... very particular meal you as well what did the specifics tally\nThe specifics of their stories yeah well we are getting a very full and detailed view of cultures around wealth white\nCultures around wealth white\nFundamentally patriarchal power centers that begin in you know when people are teenagers the prep school the the you know Deborah Ramirez is story which was about how she was an outsider to this very elite\nUm friday hard drinking badly behaved relatively repercussion free um social circle of extremely wealthy privileged white men who were all on have tournaments power\nAnd the narrative of it was when I was young in a responsible I was young in a responsible boys will be boys\nRight who who amongst us has not write like that and that's again that's about the sort of invisibility of certain kinds of a power abuses um I write about in the book and something that I've I've become kind of obsessed with and thinking both about how\nFor example a black lives matter movement has been talked about in the mainstream press and then watching the same kinds of things around the me too movement it's helped me to understand a little bit about how when power is abused in the direction that is sort of natural the more powerful do something bad or harmful or even violent to the less powerful\nIt's sort of invisible right oh oh he was a drunk boy of course he did this like what young man what Seventeen year old healthy young man with a sex drive in a keg leg wouldn't have an behave that way it's like an discernible as harm in some way\nIn your book good mad you write very early in the book I Am a white woman who's been angry in my life and my work occasionally on my own behalf but more often about politics about inequity and the grotesque unfairness of the world in this case\nWhat about politics about inequity and the grotesque unfairness of the world in this country how it was built and who would still excludes and systematically diminished and then you're off to the races [laughter]\nUm this book is in large measure about anger the legitimacy of anger or the ... of anger historically toward toward good um what's that you often\n[noise] um it was an attempt to\nGet my thoughts clear after the election I was um that take some doing oh God yes [noise]\nI didn't know I was I was wrestling with what my job was I was wrestling with what my work was how do you mean\nI was very muddy about what the story was that I needed to tell I have to say that I haven't I haven't talked about this before and\nUm there's a degree to which I was deeply obsessed by the question of the white women I was acutely aware of my identity\nUm as a white woman the the degree to which my work has been lingered by my white miss my work on feminism the degree to which I have been pushed to be better to think\nMore clearly about race and class um that's been a big part of my evolution as a writer and there was something that had happened right before the election I've been on part of a pod cast with a bunch of women\nAnd one of them had said about the white young white men who was like the classic Bernie supporter like\nShe had said something like where are you guys out there trying to to persuade people to vote for Hillary because it's your guys as white men who are not voting for her where the left white guys go get your boys right that was the phrase that she'd use go get your boys right and it was not a surprise\nTwo boys right that was the phrase that she'd use go get your boys right and it was not a surprise to me that white women had voted for Donald Trump\nBut I was acutely aware of this demographic and I felt some responsibility and I'm very sympathetic to the argument\nWhich is like leaving beat it is not worth the investment and trying to persuade white women to be on our side there's a woman in my book just morale is who says she worked on the Hillary campaign and she was like look this was about persuading white women do not be Phyllis Schlafly and that has never ever work they're always going to be Phyllis Schlafly right I understand and have sympathy you\nWith that like just let 'em right right and they want to they want to support a system that fundamentally oppressive them and that oppressive other people great but I felt some that that phrase go get your boys without going in my own head\nAnd I think that I part of what I wanted to do was also think about white women and what impulses and messages or work on white women\nAnd um I felt like it was my responsibility to examine race from the perspective of of waiting is in conjunction with looking at gender and then the anger so I I was feeling that but I wasn't sure how to do it right I I and that was the question about my work how do I do that what do I do what is my job what's ... what's the story here\nBut everything was so crowded [noise]\nAnd I was on a walk with my husband um between Christmas and New Years of that year says twenty six you know twenty Seventeen and I was trying to explain to him that despair I was feeling about like not knowing what my role was supposed to be what it was what was my work going to be professional professionally\nAnd um I said I just can't think straight dries I'm I'm so mad and he was like well maybe that's what your work is\nI'm so mad and he was like well maybe that's what your work is\nAnd I said what do you mean and he goes well maybe that's what you need to write about is anger and as soon as he said it he's not a writer um he was just something he was responding to and what\nBut suddenly in that in that exchange I'm not exaggerating when I said it was the first feeling of like clarity enlighten us in my head that I'd had at that point in two months since\nIt is interesting that the law to the exemplars of\nConstructive anger in the book historically a black woman mhm I'm Shirley Chisholm\nFlorence Kennedy who I remember well watching on public access television for hours I'm In her great hats or Rosa Parks and in and of course the the mother of Emmett Till that's not by any coincidence that's not that's not by accident\nNo not at all women of color have often been\nNot only the leading activists organizers and the the people who who first gay voice in forum to a lot of the transformative social and political movements that have that have reshaped America\nUm they also often have done the thinking I mean ... poly Murray who somebody I write about in this book Polly Mary was credited\nBy both Thurgood Marshall and Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the intellectual work she did laying out the framework for racial and gender inequity in this country and and laying the groundwork for the laws that would ultimately wind up I'm protecting\nAnd uh try to ameliorate the kind of gender and racial inequality that she was she was trying to address she's still very rarely credited as this leader um\nAnd Florence Kennedy I haven't heard the name Florence Kennedy in years I mean she's very much of the generation of Gloria Steinem or little even if she wins\nMuch of the generation of Gloria Steinem are leaving either she ... she and she and Gloria Steinem we're speaking partners caught on the road again right to tell us a little bit about four it's kind of so Florence\nKennedy was a ... a black feminist lawyer um she was outrageous\nFor her time but I think she would be outrageous now I like soccer in her demeanor and her willingness to\nBe vocally pro family\nUnapologetically enjoy fully pissed off about everything she was pissed off [laughter] and there was a lot of it she was mad about racism she was mad about sexism and she wasn't going to play nice at all\nYou know you wrote a book about a time when you're you're working in a male dominated office uh-huh and you found yourself in two years you're angry and you're crying until you write a chili hard asked manager those are includes a woman\nPulled you into a stairway and said you they don't know you were furious they think you're sad\nAnd we'll be pleased because they've got to you when we were we were what was going on [laughter]\nUh was at the New York observer um I don't I've never talked about this with a woman who said it and I don't know if she were even remembers um and I don't remember to be honest I don't remember what I was angry about um I mean I can take guesses but um I was\nThe thing that was astounding to me is that\nThis is a person who had always intimidated me because she wasn't there was nothing outwardly emotional no sense that she was paying close attention to the experiences\nThe people she was just she was incredibly efficient incredibly talented manager of people [noise] um and a copy [laughter] and the ...\nI'm an of copy [laughter] and the fact that she saw in sort of what was a split second something that I wouldn't have been able to describe as soon as she said it was like I Am furious of course of course I'm Crying because I'm furious I think that's such a common experience for women\nWhat's what this means that we can get the money is we've been talking about taking out of it [noise]\nWe've been talking about in the oven off\nOne million dollars All right now that is not the greatest fan of the great advantage to somewhere and all of us not to say oh\nI'm twenty to twenty five trillion dollar counting the value gold and I'm sad on all these other [noise]\nIf you can find even through your friends or something like that you\nHeard him right he said it's really stuck he said he was involved in a project to get us\nBonds currency and gold bullion out of the Philippines\nWhere the treasures were said to be in secret locations guarded by poor tribal people now if you're thinking how can I get in on this I should tell you that the story\nIs very much like a number of scams based in the Philippines including some investigated by the U.S Secret Service and stuck himself wants to fraud at a bank in Maryland\nRobinson recorded his calls was Stuckey suggesting that he might have been suspicious and yet for over a decade up to the time of his death\nHe sent Stuckey hundreds of thousands of\nDollars his kids lost their inheritance and his wife lost the house\nI city you know you cannot send that man any more money you're enabling him and um after he died I found out he sent him another fourteen thousand and we didn't have fourteen thousand\nCherry Robinson's daughter Mack was left with the tapes of phone calls and she began trying to understand how her father who have been so conscious so successful in business had fallen for what seems like an obvious scam\nSeveral times larger number one\nSome um learning and I'm\nRenee they've been there a large sum of money will become a genius in\nEverybody will want to know\nClose to [noise] Maggie decided to go and meet the man responsible although against expert advice in last week's episode you talk with Maria ... over a New Yorker contributor and author of the book\nThe confidence game I mean to number one don't go\nComical was sort of Jim sticky were con artist he could be quite dangerous\nAnd don't underestimate old men they are people who have been con artist their entire life and if you think they have end of life regrets think again I mean I don't think Jim is going to assault but someone else\nAnd not only that she was afraid that Maggie might get conned herself and\nShe's going to talk to you know he's going to seem nice and you're going to say oh like you know maybe he's not such a bad guy\nOnce that happens and they preach could of the distance between the two of you that's the moment that objectivity stops that's why it's always very easy to tell when other people have been conned but the people in the ... and we judge them for [noise]\nHere's part two of our story the\nLong distance call [noise]\nWe're we're about to do it [laughter] [laughter] we're about to get on the plane\nPlaying in the mail

Hong Kong airport on a layover to manila\nAnd with my producer Daniel who's asking all those questions and my husband who is a very nervous though I really don't want to get on another way and this is Daniel is worried about something else\nDo you ever think about what\nMaria talked about um\nDo you mean when she was like you have to remain vigilant\nUm I have had to block that out [noise]\nI just talked to the security guys are so if your gym his point of view why are you coming unless it's to get some kind of revenge for all that\nYeah I mean I probably think that to\nThe security experts that that is gym with a big time con artist and he might be well connected in manila criminal underworld\nOversee the other thing is that the\nAnd he says if the guy's really scared he can make people disappear for a couple of bucks cool\nCheapest eh we so we have to go with the assumption that we're going to be murdered or disappeared ... oh\n[noise]\nWe're just not dangerous animal [noise]\nWalk

joined me in the studio and I wanted to begin at the very beginning\nSo at the New Yorker we have a whole fact checking department [laughter] so I Want to start with the fact checking thing sure I read that as a kid you wrote an entire musical inspired by the Stevie Wonder album Journey Through the\nSecret life of plants all about photosynthesis what was it like what was this musical like\nWell my uncle was a huge Stevie Wonder fan and he played the album and then I was like oh we're learning about photosynthesis in our school\nAnd I started to just write about me 'cause I was living with my grandmother at a time we were in between houses and I started to write about me and just this attack on a or not attack attack on humans from plants how are you\nShoot I had to be in like elementary school 'cause we rent we had science class maybe like the fourth or fifth grade who\nThe writers and an even performers are songwriters that were just been inflaming your imagination when you're that young\nWhen I was young I was really influence because I was I was with my family you grew up in a big family like me I have over fifty first cousins swan our mother had my grandmother had twelve children\nThe first cousins swan our mother had my grandmother had twelve children well and I have a huge family and so I was with them a lot and I come from a musically inclined family my great grandmother's are both play oriented piano what their churches um the church was it was a huge inspiration from\nYou did you sing in church the in the in the way the singers that I'm from an earlier generation to the way they are is a kind of grow up knowing the music of Sunday Morning on Saturday Night\nYou know I did sing in church but it's not the type of song that she was think would be some in church it's not treated high gospel no I actually was that five six year old kid\nWho would be sitting in the view and in my past her would be between yelling and sweating in bad to get the whole

I was a rebellious Christian\nNow you're also interested in musicals and musical theater and did you have access to that or was it all through records in radio\nI didn't have access to musical theater

Hill was my biggest inspiration\nAnd I love Judy Garland yeah arguing Judy Garland were were my my my heroes\nAre pretty different performers why those two\nThey were just women that I felt really use their voices you need to have a first of all unique tone\nUm and they just came across as strong I didn't know a whole lot about Judy Garland\nObviously I'm from Kansas and the wizard of Oz you know in her being in that um I felt like she was a dreamer and she was a strong woman I Know she had a complex life\nBut Lauren Hill in particular I resonated with me as a black woman who did an album and

watched Fritz Lang Nineteen twenty seven German expressionist silent film\nWhen I watched that metropolis Oh yes it it it ends or all of my work really it was the birth of metropolis the money that by

and bishop this is Kay you win our public radio row\nWe'll come back to the New York\nWe'll come back to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick the mid term elections are often said to be a referendum on the presidency and that's never been more true than this year in the era of Donald Trump at the same time no matter where you live there are also other issues on your mind as a voter local stuff\nThat is maybe nothing to do with whether you watch Fox or CNN or even how you feel about Donald Trump\nReporter Eliza Griswold has been spending a lot of time following races in the state of Pennsylvania and what she found is that for voters across a wide swath of the state thing that's foremost on people's minds is a gas pipeline it's already under construction and it goes through a lot of people's backyards\nAnd they're really unhappy about it one of the communities allies visited was exton Pennsylvania in the suburbs of Philadelphia [noise]\nAfrican is a place where two tectonic plates in American politics me we thought Pennsylvania go narrowly for Donald Trump and twenty six teams in the Philadelphia suburbs are one of those places that political consultants like to talk about is kind of a bellwether\nAlthough the larger county went for Hillary Clinton accent is heavily Republican about two thirds of its voters are Republicans and al ... is running as a Democrat for state assembly and she thinks she has a chance we gone rogue\nWere on a leafy suburb and straight their colonial houses which are made of brac inside in the final it's a middle class place how are you guys and Danielle is going door to door she's a suburban mom of two kids under the age of five\nAnd she works in marketing I have you heard about running for office\nShe works in marketing have you heard about running for office Danielle excuse orange around you do okay well I actually live right on Devon drive and I decided to run because for the last five years our neighbors here than dealing with us\nWe how she's pointing to a long stretch of orange plastic fencing that marks the beginning of the controversial pipeline which is supposed to be buried about forty feet behind all the houses on the street\nAnd fighting the pipeline for the last few years is what motivated Daniel to launch a novice his campaign for the Pennsylvania state house taking on a Republican opponent and the establishment in her own party um there are\nOne two three four five six rows of\nPipes it's within five fifty feet in my backyard like Seventy feet from my house and um we're standing right now ten feet from playground that my neighbors kids my kids play on your\nGreatest fear is Danielle with the pipeline I mean if what how does it impact how do your fears about an impact your life um [noise]\nIt's horrible to think about a couple of weeks ago I'm a pipeline exploded in India for county in Pennsylvania and it was a smoker pipeline that was only a week old and so I actually was I'm taking a nap in the afternoon shortly after that happened and I jumped out of my bed because I had this nightmare\nOf like my babies like burning in their bed\nAnd I'm I called them and I said we have to move like you have to move we can't keep 'em and like thankfully in beaver county there were only thirty homes\nAnd like thankfully in beaver county there only thirty homes within a mile of that explosion and the closest family with five hundred feet away and the skates with their life but they're homeless destroyed um\nThose things seem like national news to most people but to people like me that's like reality [noise]\nSo you know we're here trying to connect some of the dots between what's going on politically nationally as well as on a state level I'm with and the pipeline how do you see the pipeline as relating to national politics\nJust an example of [noise] the egregious ness\nOf what's happening at the on the national level and all of these regulatory role backs and how it really affects our daily life and how it can affect anyone anyone\nLet's put it that's why I never in my life never in my life I Would run for office never never ever occur to me it just wasn't something\nLike maybe I thought it would\nRun for school board or something like something small local when my kids were older and I had a little more time on my hands but after all of the things we've experienced over the last few years and just the lack of humanity from are the people who represent us\n[noise] it's it's ... it it makes you feel powerless but I refuse to be powerless\nOpponent and district one fifty five is Becky carbon a Republican has been in office since two thousand twelve I reach representative Corbin for an interview and she sent the following statement\nI Am a proven record of standing up to oil and gas companies to ensure that\nI have a proven record of standing up to oil and gas companies to ensure the health and safety of our community then she lifted her opposition to a number of bills which she said would have rolled back health protections standards for oil and gas wells and made it easier for public utilities to use eminent domain\nBut here's the thing about Pennsylvania politics in both the Republican legislature and the Democratic governor Tom Wolfe had signed off on the pipeline fracking has made Pennsylvania the third largest oil and gas producing\nState in America and\nAnd that's brought in a lot of different players including to know go and its parent company energy transfer partners which owns this pipeline project the Mariner east\nWhen we build a pipeline safety or top priority for highly skilled engineers environmental scientists wildlife biology and geology design or probably want to follow the safest round with the smallest environmental footprint\nATP is a private corporation but they were able to use eminent domain to take people's land against their will in order to lay the pipeline\nThe pipeline moves natural gas liquids\nFrom the Marcellus gas fields in the west for three hundred and fifty miles to the eastern markets hawk outside Philly where it shipped overseas we were following the root of the pipeline through Pennsylvania our second stop with a hundred miles west of accident in the small town of blows or fail at blooms\nGun shop we not Ralph and Doris blue\nTheir shop as a small building in a modified garage on their property or shot guns are mixed up with things stun guns in the interests and its infested was quick to thirty\n... was quick to thirty five years to make a junkie like it is that it ain't going to do you think going to get any better city called him a pipeline\nWent right through their property and they say edit killed their high and ruin their drinking water\nBut we have no water we have another drink and water for doing because we haven't had recognized drink or two thousand and Seventeen there's or water behind it that we got back then that's the way it come out of the ticket it's black and\nAnd nobody plain words because he was maligned would\nGet his grade I went to hike or burger which is our state senator three times\nFor help nothing went to the blue more representative I think three times nothing the last time I went to bloom I took him to bottled water over and showed him how to drink this is what it is he actually come out and looked at the damage to did\nAnd nothing just don't do nothing\nI reached out just to know go to comment on issues related to the pipeline but they didn't respond Ralph as a registered Republican but he voted for Hillary Clinton in the last election because he said she would have been good for the gotten [noise]\nHe and his wife Doris gave us a tour of their property on their four wheelers we wrote up a hill pass their house and surveyed their hay fields [noise]\nMountain over that law as we can see where it's clear cut through the trees yeah tons all the way down through that pasture yep crosses that road\nWhen we shouldn't show you how to do it because I mean for you to work on on like\nAnd when we shouldn't show you how to do it because I mean for you to work on I'm like gosh I Believe you have a phone call scheduled at a chef of a Mexican restaurant not long at all ever [laughter] yeah the ... strain and all this and\nSo we're I mean the plan and the plan was down there no red cliffs and check of short restaurant reviewer tables for two written by hand a gold field of herself a former checkered\nShe was very pleased to hear you protect your face [laughter] way he'll yes\nYeah and it's a sort of view of a restaurant a Mexican restaurant called ... when we started a new checker we sit them down with a manuscript and have them under lined up for what they think is ... fact and what's not\nWould it be right to underline that does each house from like the the ingredients from the males\nYeah gas off with the old\nAll held by seasonings seafood seasoning on so then she wants you to check that and that's the kind of thing you can boast do off the website and then check was chef he asked for your call was set up with an eleven\nYear while we're going to say that Ron I collect she lay out what she lived\nNever heard of a a dissimilar to the beaches soup ...\nAnd you do also when when there's kind of like a negative judgment in there you would us back\nOff and maybe see a a life long line up yeah well ... yeah well we want to be telling you\nIt was so too it's a Green Party restaurant where the Venice Beach aesthetic the problem\nIs that that's a little if he says no it doesn't have a Venice Beach for some reason he's offended by that formulation it's ... it's her judgment summit\nOffended by that formulation it's ... it's her judgment\nSo maybe you could just say like a California beaches static um\nNephew to end with this will set up a job interview she wrote a switch careers I don't know like they have a much easier job right now [laughter] so less pressure\n\nAfter I saw that Daniel ... had a good from of course grasp on what was ... what was not I walked around the corner to help him work with Parker Henry another ... one of my deputy lose\nAll the time I talked to said look if I may when\nI'm you know the first\nSmash Parker and Daniel went to the Oxford local website where they looked at a news prices and photos of the restaurant\nYeah right off on yeah yeah and to\nHang on a hot as it would be ... but I don't look at California for everyone it's constantly seeing as I'm a bomb\nWorth so just because Parker and Daniel ... has the Venice Beach five doesn't mean that that's the way the chef smoker wouldn't describe it\nI don't know it's a bit of a ... like fantasy so I don't know like how are you in fact [laughter]\nUm you can frame it like you have no idea that potentially offensive huh I'm playing down his key density\nUm yeah playing down his key in on entity to actually [laughter] I'm okay

movement known as the old right\nAnd he's watching how it influences mainstream politics\nInjure you've been reporting on the fringes of right wing nationalism and all the associated movements people like Mike ... for example who was involved in pizza gate\nAnd you've also written about the Nazi website the Daily Stormer which is built on disturbed Nazi lore we've seen a lot of this on the Internet but it's been many years since really far right white supremacist had been running for office in the United states of America when did this all start what did the origins of it\nIt's never really not exist but in terms of the most recent resurgence of it um you know Trump has a lot to do with it I mean there there's always been dog whistle politics right and we should definitely note that Democrats have engaging that Republicans have engaged in it\nBut it's not even really a dog whistle anymore it's kind of just a whistle you know there's there's there's more and more openness with people just espousing white\nAll you know there's there's there's more and more openness with people just espousing white nationalist views and that has a lot to do with Trump\nWill people would point out that when Ronald Reagan was for his campaigning for president he campaigned and give a big speech in the show but county Mississippi and he talked there about nothing less than states rights and this was at the very least a dog whistle to the far right is that something different and why\nBecause he voted for tonight it when people asked him he said states rights doesn't mean that when people ask Nixon what do you mean by silent majority what do you mean by law and order he the separately denied it\nThey're not really denying it anymore so people like you know Steve King who is a congressman and Iowa he's not flirting with the line he he doesn't believe that these lines should exist\nSo what does what does Steve king's history what does he said and done\nSo Steve King is a congressman from Iowa he's a represented the western part of Iowa for Fifteen Years at this point he's running for re election in November\nAnd he he's very clearly into you know dog whistle racism he talks a lot about western civilization and European heritage and that kind of stuff but he always in the past would leave some plausible deniability\nAnd then just in the last couple of years partly because of Trump's and partly because he has a Twitter account\nHe um has been saying things like demographics our destiny and then he says we can't restore our civilization with someone else's babies\nThere's no way to read that that doesn't take our civilization to mean white people there is no plausible reading of it other than a white nationalist reading to see tonight well not really I mean he kinda gets called to the mat and says\nNo I don't regret saying that he doesn't take down to eat he doesn't delete them he kinda says oh this you know PC culture everybody gets called racist all the time you know you guys are always pro clutching and stuff but he never\nBut he gets called racist all the time you know you guys are always pro clutching and stuff but he never walked back the actual substance nor does he ever like explain how that could mean anything other than white nationalism\nWell let's talk about what we're talking about let's listen to one of Stephen King statements about diversity this is from an interview that he gave to in Iowa radio program\nAnd when you START I that's the way the differences then you'll end up with people that are at each other's throats than adding up as panic than black and he predicts will be a greater number than whites that America I operate activists panic then the blacks will be fighting each other before that\n... what do you make of that\nOr I mean there are there are much more extreme examples of his rhetoric than that but basically it's that's kind of a turning the tables have saying by talking about\nAh you know the black voting block or the Hispanic voting bloc\nAnyone doing that is there for the race is Paul Ryan the speaker of the house was asked where do you stand on this and he waits three days or something and then I forget how long he waited but Paul Ryan puts out this very carefully worded statement that doesn't mention Steve king's name at all that just says\nWe abhor racism so in other words it's not like he's such an outlier that the rest of the GOP can very comfortably washed their hands with him and say he's not our guy he is the guy they're not pulling funding from him at least not in a way that they're making public\nTo what does it suggest about American politics that the most powerful leader and one of the houses of Congress Paul Ryan feel they cannot afford to reject somebody like ...\nIt's terrifying it's yeah it means that they've read the tea leaves and they know that this is too big a part of their support base to give up on\nYou spent the last year marinating in the juices of what one could call a cyber proud of fascism yeah fortunately talking to a lot of ...\nOne could call a cyber predator fascism and yeah unfortunately talking to a lot of people who are are the very most active players and voices in what you're going to fascism and what does it tell you about American political life\nLook I think it's not that everything has utterly transformed and you know we weren't\nWe weren't close to the brink and now we are I mean we're closer now for sure but um what is the brink well it can't happen here you know that that notion that you know yeah ... fascism could have happened in Europe but it can't happen here I think we're now all starting to see that\nThere is no law of nature that says that the walls of the United states that we we we are extremely flawed\nSociety where the extremely a dicey racial history\nThat I'm perhaps a uniquely so among the countries we're talking about democracy is a very delicate tricky thing right if Steve King is now going out there and just essentially saying to the people of Iowa hello I'm a white nationalist do you want to vote for me or do you want to vote for the other guy\nThere's no guarantee that they want to vote for the other guy well let's talk about the other guy his opponent kings opponent is a Democrat and former baseball player named J. D. shoulder to shoulder to have a chance and what are the dynamics of that race look like\nHe's much taller so that's generally a good thing about sixty six six and he's driving around the district in Winnebago and you know shaking everyone's hand and being very folksy he's out fundraising king\nHe's still down in the polls incumbency is a very powerful thing in house elections and king has been there for six terms what's the district time it's deep deep red as they say and king you know it's it's you you might not know this from looking at his Twitter feed but racism is not his only thing you know he also\nYou know once ethanol subsidies and he also you know\nThe only thing you know he also you know once ethanol subsidies and he also you know says he wants to support farmers now he's been in Congress for Fifteen Years he has sponsored exactly one bill that passed which was to rename a post office in Iowa so he's not the most effective legislator\nNow that we live in the age of ... are there new politicians on the scene who seem to be entering the stage or coming onto the stage in a way they might not have before\nYeah I think someone like Cory Stewart he was someone who the Virginia a GOP just thought would fizzle out and he's running for Senate he's running for Senate against Tim Kaine who will probably win but you know with this level of support\nHe's doing better than one would expect I mean he\nHe won the primary and his whole national image is based on being standing up for these Confederate monuments we can't turn them down there our heritage he was born and raised in Duluth, Minnesota so\nNot the heart of the confederacy are to the confederacy and Steve came by the way it used to have a Confederate flag on his desk in the Capitol building which by the way Iowa sent a lot of soldiers to die to fight against the confederacy so it's like gee I Wonder what that flag means to you\nIn New Jersey and the state of New Jersey or New Jersey congressman Seth gross and was dropped by the Republican Party after saying that diversity is crap is that an outlier incident is that a very rare instance of the of the party standing up to some of its extremist voices\nI think he I think the set Grossman thing was a bit of an anomaly I mean you have even more in most cases than that you have\nA guy named Arthur Jones in Illinois who is literally a Nazi who stands in front of Nazi flags and give speeches and he won a GOP primary in a district where it's heavily democratic and so they don't bother to run a lot of Republicans in these in these races so he's not going to win the general election\nRepublicans in these in these races so he's not going to win the general election it's very scary that a literal Nazi is is running for office in Illinois and that and that this guy Seth Grossman is running for office in New Jersey but those are outliers I mean so I don't want to paint the picture that you know this is happening everywhere all the time\nBut again the fact that someone like ... New Jersey in New Jersey\nWould have you know concealed his feelings a little bit more\nOf just a few years ago just a couple of years ago but now he's on he's unleashed he's unleashed he's linking to this a blog post you know calling black people inherently dangerous and you know he's just posting this on his website and then he says oh well I'm Jewish so I Can't be racist so\nI'm falls yeah I can falsify that one of ...\nA century ago it was a second flowering of the Ku Klux Klan and there were a coup Klux Klan members in Congress Ku Klux Klan members in every business organization in chamber of commerce in the country\nUm it was like a social movement in some ways Ku Klux Klan barbecues and block parties and all the rest of the somewhat different from the the um first flowering of the Ku Klux Klan but it was the Klan nevertheless\nIs that kind of mass acceptance of white supremacy are organized white supremacy I'm a possibility\nYes I think it is I mean this is I Do think it ebbs and flows and I think it's important to note that\nWhen the year anniversary march happened there was no one there I mean literally like Fifteen people their year anniversary of Charlotte Charlotte so right so that Jason Kessler tried to go to DC in and do it again and no one went with him things do change but I Do think\nIt is possible for this kind of broad based you know\nIt is possible for this kind of broad based you know racism as a as a fun social club\nThing to take off again um you know the Proud Boys are a social club the ... or this group of you know they called themselves the western chauvinists ah they denied being a white pride organization but they're a quote unquote western pride organization and the Proud Boys just this past\nAnd when you go see 'em a second time on January twenty seven yeah he asked me to come back ... was that different are the same or what it was it was a little\nDifferent in the sense that um he was a bit more combative I guess I Would say in this discussion and I you know testified before this sort of one of his first questions was what's it to the department of justice if one White House official live to another\nAnd and what did you make of that [noise] um well I tried to explain\nTo him that it was a whole lot more than just one White House official lying to another which\nGod that would help he would be concerned about anyway but then it was more than that that the underlying conduct here that General Flynn having these discussions to begin with is problematic but beyond that again it's the issue of compromise that the Russians notice it provides potential leverage and this was a problem\nAnd we also thought you know the vice President Pence\nWas entitled to know that the stuff that he was saying when he stood in you know in front of of the public\nThat that was a trip so we were trying to help them\nSo your second meeting with Don McGahn is January twenty seventh also on January twenty seventh I'm an executive order is issued yeah um\nBanning travel from seven Muslim majority countries did you know anything about that until it was issued\nNow and and that's the remarkable thing I'm sitting right there\nAnd that's the remarkable thing I'm sitting right there and Don McGahn office talking to him at length\nAnd he doesn't tell me that the president at this point has already signed an executive order as you said banning immigration from these countries and that the department of justice is going to have to be in court the very next morning defending this\nSo how did you find out about the travel there um I was in the car I was literally in the car on the way to the airport\nAnd get a call I was able to keep one aide with me want us to my principal deputy the top deputy the whole time and so ... calls me and he says after you left you know I went online I was reading the New York times\nAnd it looks like President Trump has issued some sort of travel ban\nWe spent the weekend\nI'm trying to get our arms around and communicating with the White House um what is it that you're trying to do and\nBy Monday morning I was told that we would have to take a position on the constitutionality of the travel ban the next morning and in a case so we convened everybody in my conference room and it's been a very long time in there I'm Talking through what the challenges were\nWhat the White House position was in terms of the scope of the travel ban we talked about the different challenges constitutionally and statutory early and otherwise that have been filed [noise]\nUm and at the end of that conversation\nI was not satisfied that it was lawful or constitutional and what troubles me beyond that\nTo ... what troubles me beyond that was that it became clear that\nTo defend the constitutionality of this I was going to have to send department of justice lawyers and to take the position that this travel ban that applied just a Muslim majority countries had absolutely nothing to do with religion\nAnd this was in the face of all of the president's statements that he had made both on the campaign trail and after he had been elected and\nThat did not seem like the truth to me\nBut isn't it usually been job of a department of justice to defend actions of the administration even if you personally would not have ... you know issued that order or ... years the president's ... the executive branch's lawyers writer why wasn't that good enough for you to say I'm going to defend this\nWell it wasn't just that I disagreed with this on a policy grant and perhaps the appropriate thing then to do would be to resign if you can't be part of that um but not directed apart but not to defend it but here's what's different is that\nI happen to believe ... should go into court and make an argument that's not grounded in truth but the department of justice [noise]\nI mean [noise] if the\nO. J. stands for anything it's supposed to stand for what is true and what is just [noise] so what did you do [noise] I knew that I personally couldn't be parked a defending this an argument something that\nParked I'm defending this an argument something that that wasn't granted in ... um but you know I thought about what may be the thing to do was reside\nAnd that would have protected my personal integrity I wouldn't have been part of this um but I was like just the head of the civil division or you know some other component of the department [noise]\nI was the acting attorney general of the United states and I felt like I had a responsibility to protect not just my personal integrity but the integrity of the department of justice as well and I thought back to my confirmation hearing\nWhen I'm there were some senators including Senator Sessions who they were all over me and my confirmation hearing about\nWhat I Would do if the president asked me to do something that with unlawful are wrong and I think Senator Sessions said you know even if it's just something that would bring disrupt ... to the department of justice you know you're going to be asked to do that and will you saying that you know none of them were asking\nMe will you resign they were asking me will you say no and they were right about that it wasn't my responsibility in that position I think to resign I think it was my responsibility to sign up so how did you say no they\nI mean it wasn't like a state public statement it was just a communication\nAnd we both we had there were communications going on at levels below me and between me and Mr McGahn and I should the directive to the department and then what happens [noise] um I was fired ... you were fired by Donald Trump before it was fashionable [laughter] but\nYou were fired by Donald Trump before it was fashionable [laughter] hired by Donald Trump did that surprise you are or ... how did you think the story was going to end once you said you weren't going to allow the travel ban to defend it\nLook I certainly recognized there was a very real possibility for like probability that I Would be fired in this in this context but I hoped\nThat maybe there was a chance that by doing this that would cause them to step back and take a breath and look at what they were doing and more\n... okay I Know everybody's got a impolite so loud [laughter] seems kinda silly now doesn't it um but you know I did\nHarbor this hope that maybe they would step back they would have the kind of process they would get the kind of input I'm there would be real discussion about this um I had spent twenty seven years at the department of justice I loved that place\nUm I did not want to have the period on my service they're being fired\nWhat what's your assessment of the whole series of events\n[noise] um I suppose you could say that the president and made a campaign promise and he was making good on that promise but beyond the fact that I Believe that particularly the first one was a lawful unconstitutional I think it's\nAbsolutely the antithesis of who we are as a country and [noise]\n[noise] and [noise]\nSally a long time Justice Department official who was the acting attorney general at the start of the Trump Administration Sally ate spoke with Jeffrey ... at the New Yorker [noise]\n\nNow I'm as you mentioned the travel ban was revised one ... was revised twice the courts have struck down each of the versions including the third and final version until it went to the Supreme Court\nWhich upheld at five to four ... what's your view of the travel ban in its final form and the Supreme Court's decision about it\nYou know I haven't studied travel ban three the same way that I did the first one that you know I I still despite the other ... you know taking out the preference for Christians\nUm and throwing in a couple of non Muslim majority countries despite the fact that you know they made some changes you know I Am still troubled by\nUm the animal is that I Believe infected the first as well as the travel ban ... and\nHad this paradoxical situation since Jeff Sessions has been attorney general where he has been in the policy areas you talk about very much advancing the Trump agenda\nAt the same time the president has been just beating the hell out of him in public ... what do you make of that I mean ... what what\n[laughter] what are you\nWhat [laughter] what are you making that what's up with that at one time [laughter] thank you [laughter]\nYou know I mean I think he clearly has been trying to humiliate him into resigning I mean that you know that's been going on for so long now and what doesn't even make the news anymore\n\nThere are ways you can tailor your will or trust to have a lasting impact on valued community organizations like hey you went on just put them helpful information about estate planning K. U. N.

mix\nOf mountains uh sometimes it's ... along the lines of ... or ... and other times she sounds like a mind these vocalist along the lines of Janet Jackson you know\nThere's a real intelligence in her musing an points to someone who really understand and appreciate the sources of her own music and also kind of implicates where that music might go in the future\nSo we talked and then she also gave an incredible live performance along with one of our producers in the region\n\nThank you so much for being here with us for the Nineteen New Yorker festival and for the top [noise]\nFirst of all I have immense respect for any singer performer anybody who goes with just the first name as ... as far as I'm concerned [laughter] can you tell us how did you decide you know how you wanted to present yourself about\nWell I was really committed to the full name calling it on ... and stuff I I really wanted to be known first and last mhm and everybody was like ... and ... and you're going to run into issues on people try to search your name basically\nVery strong from the thank God but um yeah I Know you grew up in the DC area and then there was a sort of\nStrong from this article as long as I Know you grow up in the DC area there was a thriving culture music or the things you are listening to agree we're starting to perform and um to to start writing songs about all those will just come and go over\nUm you know it's it's really weird because you know I feel like I'm grown up in a really ... it's\nAn intersection only experience you know there's a lot of things going on at the same time you know I'm a I'm a daughter of immigrants of African immigrants is African immigrants particularly if he opens and then there's the lair of\nGrowing up in a suburb of DC I'm\nI'm being bussed from a you know ghetto suburb [laughter]\nTo a wider suburb and what that means you know um there's a particular way that you're processing the world when your school is extremely segregated I Would say that's the case for everybody but you know there's a way it was happening in my school\nSo I was listening to a lot of different things you know I was obsessed with with armed be any armed evil was just down his like zero us home base\nAnd I would say before that I was listening to jazz and in world music and just you know a lot of traditional music and then\nI remember my ex boyfriend my first boyfriend had a Napster membership one of the first of all while\nWe were all and I got no really divorce you know [laughter] I kept\nThat membership for a few years to survey every\nFemale focused\nThis survey every female\nVocal period I was just on a mission to just scan the world for every single type of thing and\nYeah and so I just would learn music and other languages but mainly jazz\nYou know that was the thing that I was sort of serving the most and um so you know I've had different periods where I was just\nImmersed in one sound um and then after that it was sort of a really experimental music you know so electronic and experimental music\nWhen I think about my experimental electronic music side a lot of those references are still black because I'm thinking about Jimmy Jam and Terry list or I'm thinking about both the comments or you know I'm just\nIn a non famous or Herbie herpes\nWhat was it about armed beer made it sort of the U.S when we're kinda more to dress for some ... some pool on you know I'm\nI guess it was just pop music that was you know like there's a way that you know you can't there's there's no come around every around um jazz when you get to your elementary school\n[laughter] for job for him now where you want to be room is no you don't get to kindergarten and people like you know ... you know\nLike that so I'm yeah I think that is just the pool it's the thing that happens to every him is small human being the when they see Michael Jackson for the first time or when they see 'em you know when they hear Mariah\nUm you know when they hear Mariah\nAny of those sort of bank huge artists won't have that pool you know um but you know my love for jazz never never died [noise]\nCan it can keep my no\n... in the\n[noise] still get\nThen the\n\n\n\nAnd jazz is part of what you're supposed to do is reinterpret the standard you know that's how you get good so for me I always just been interested in how those things could be ...\nOh it's just been interested in how those things could be flipped\nAnd be presented to you I'm so that you you like it in a different way I'm yeah\nSpeaking of reinterpreted as soon as they are like a song you have a song you want to sing and he's going to get my money's going to be wrong but you look ... salt on it and you were\nThat Coelho sauce [noise] um\nThere's there's yeah there I mean there are some songs there is a phone call Thirty years by buddy Carter some favorite songs in the world um\nThere's there's a few jazz songs are just like waiting for the prompt you know waiting for the for the appropriate context for um yeah there's a whole I think organic instruments\nSide to what I Do\nHow do you sort of manage the business of ... there's this sort of our book but you into the room and there's also this look look the entity though did you how do you write taco between those two\nIt has taken 'em a lot of intention to a rally people around who\nI actually am and not a projection of what they would likely to be you know um\nThat is I think a struggle for for any artists out there but uh there's a particular way that um as a black woman I'm being asked\nTo present

generally a curious guy I enjoy the poking around part I like to do that in my free time in August twenty sixteen at the height of the presidential election it started poking around the Kennesaw State University's Center for election systems\nWhich ran all the elections in Georgia\nOr in the course of doing that I did a very very simple Google Search 'em I said for the ... election dot Kennesaw dot edu or Google please give me all of the PDF documents on this website\nAnd generally that turns up reports or public presentations\nAnd this this particular search didn't\nTurn that up instead I found a very curious link and I was presented with a very long list of what appear to be a vote or names in some sort of identify her next to their name and I immediately thought while that seems a little strange\nAnd then he crafted a simple program to download what was publicly accessible from the George election website and and what he found in all of that data astonished him\nThese documents contain supervisor\nTim these documents contain supervisor passwords to be used on election day there were also windows programs that are placed on electronic pull books\nYou don't need to be a cybersecurity expert to know that supervisor passwords should absolutely not be sitting around on line unprotected\nImmediately I thought to myself while this this doesn't look like sort of data they would purposefully put on this Web server\nIn total lamb downloaded Fifteen gigabytes worth of data from the center for election systems this by itself will be a huge story but on top of that land also found security hole through which you could download the entire database of the state six point seven million registered voters\nI had access to their full name their addresses birthday last four digits of their Social Security number and their driver's license number\nAnd then there were also gyms databases and uh gyms databases are used by the um gym server which is the central tabulate er which does the final vote count\nIf Logan lamb had been a bad guy this would have been a bonanza that is\nThe scariest scenario I can think of would be\nAn attacker implanting malware on the programs that are placed on the electronic pull books were altering the voter registration databases to disenfranchise voters\nAn attacker could have compromise that Web server and used it as a beach head to get deeper into the center for election systems networks [noise] this is right\nHer into the center for election comes about works this is right around the same time that the Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp rejected an offer from the department of homeland security to help the state harden the election system\nTo protect it from hackers because Kemp said that the system was secure the way it was and that the state didn't want any help from the federal government\n\nIt wasn't until march of twenty Seventeen so seven months after lamb's initial finding that the system was finally\nPatched then more information started to trickle out [noise] the intercept published the\nNSA report that had been hacked about Russian cyber attacks election systems in the lead up to twenty Seventeen and later the more indictments found that the Russian hackers had looked for vulnerabilities to election servers in a number of states including Georgia [noise]\n\nLook we have no idea of the Russians made alterations to Georgia's election systems and twenty sixteen and if they did we probably wouldn't know but this is a critical moment we know that foreign actors are interested in our election system just as we head into the midterms\nA few months ago the director of national intelligence that the warning lights are blinking red some states took this seriously but others seem to have left themselves wide open\nWe're in a new world now we need we understand that they need to run elections that their authority but they're not cybersecurity experts Susan green hall is the policy director of the national election defense coalition\nSo you know you and I met at DEF CON where people were hacking lots of election machines left and right um so I Wonder if you could just\nLots of election machines left and right um so I Wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the problems in Georgia I'm with their machinery and perhaps even elsewhere since the same machines are used a cross country\nSure that the machines used in Georgia\nAre computerized touch screen voting machines\nGeorgia is one of five states that entirely has machine that don't have a paper ballot then there's also other machines which count paper ballots those are all the computers and those machines can be hacked and have digital records changed within them and that's why\nHaving the paper ballot it's so crucial because it it's that linked to what the voter got to see and say that's how I voted and to be sure that that's what's counted correctly\nElection security folks are on the ground and people who are the vendors at these machines insists that they're not really ...\nBecause they're not connected to the Internet and I wonder if you just explain why it is that there's this discrepancy in in um the explanation for the safety of these machines\nWell many of the machines that you and I might interact with on election day at our polling location whether it's a touch screen voting machine or an optical scanner on may not be connected to the Internet\nIt has to get programming information from another machine which is essentially desktop or regular laptop computer that program here are the candidates here the races here is how the ballot should lay out that information has to go from that computer to the\nVoting machine that's in the polling location\nThat computer to the voting machine that's in the polling location by some sort of removable media and it's well known that if the device that is doing a programming gets infected with malicious offered it can be transferred to the individual voting machines\nBut furthermore there's another factor that debunked that assertion which is that in many of these machines that are in the polling location\nAre equipped with wireless modems to transmit their election results back to the county headquarters on election night and those wireless modems go over a cellular networks and those cellular networks are part of the Internet\nWe spent a lot of time talking about hacking voting machines or hacking vote tallies but there's this new way of hacking an election and it has to\nDo with the new restrictive voter ID laws in states like Ohio North Carolina and Georgia that purge voters from the voting rolls who haven't voted in previous elections or whose names don't precisely match the name on the voter registration data base [noise]\nThis has been a concern for me because uh on election day in twenty sixteen people were showing up to vote in Durham county North Carolina and um their names weren't on the voter rolls or they they endured county they use electronic pull books\nAnd people were showing up and they were being told you're at the wrong polling location or you've already voted during early voting or you already voted absentee or your name as in\nEarly voting or you already voted absentee or your name is in here or your address has been changed the vendor\nFor the electronic pull books was a vendor named the our system now the our systems had been targeted by a Russian intelligence spear phishing attack\nAnd um the state board of elections did their own investigation or as did the county to county report has been made public it wasn't very in depth that didn't consider a cyber attack 'em and concluded that it was a poll worker or malfunctions\nBut I think that's an open question as to what happened in North Carolina on election day [noise]\nWe heard earlier in the year that a three hundred and eighty million dollars was being released to the states\nUh for election security uh can you talk about that like is that gonna make a big difference in the midterms in twenty twenty at all\nSo there was three hundred and eighty million dollars was a appropriated\nA under the health America vote act from two thousand two so there were no specific security strings put on it you have to do this or you have to do that with the money and there's a lot of states are using that money to good effect to try to bulk up their security profile um [noise]\nBut it would be really useful to have some federal legislation to move the states to those remedies that we know are so central to his caring or elections\nAre you worried about the kind of legitimacy of of our election system and even\nAnother well\n\n\nThat's the beauty of beauty isn't it ... do you ever ... you say you were texting with a known about the songs that did you how much do cheese out\nWhat the song is about oh I didn't I didn't need to I mean for me for me it's mostly about climate change no\nBut you've you've been through a certain number of political moments [laughter]\nBut you've you've been through a certain number of political moments [laughter] sixties and in many moments in between ... and just how does this seem similar different\n[noise] um issues I couldn't have dreams is up all the stuff I've been through and all the countries no dictatorships and the you know I'm In through all that if somebody is hit said can you write a story about how bad can it get I couldn't have written it nor could anybody I Know\nThat it's just you know what we are facing in the administration is evil and it's it's cruel it's there's no empathy zero embassy so um it leaves you believe me thinking how am I going to conduct my life\nIt's you know it's the year the bully and um to bully people now seems to be okay the lying no problem no perjury and not a problem um and said that that is a new normal\nAnd how has it changed the texture of your life day to day waking up in the morning as yeah proceed through the day well I think\nI mean I've heard other people say this to the law oftentimes as hits in the night in the form of this terrible anxiety and you realize that it's real I mean it's not some neurotic anxiety\nAnxious about the state of the world which is terrible and so one thing is to one of my things I suggest spend a lot of time in denial vents and be granted valley yeah\nAnd um don't expect much I mean keep the bar really low yeah keep laughing\nYou know I I was just watching a documentary ... forget which one it was because of this\nI was just watching a documentary you get forget which one it was because\nThe scene appears in so many documentaries of you singing at the march on Washington and I I I just wonder how you\nVisualize and you remind moments like that in your life which are now distant and their iconic in the minds of other people but you you're there you're holding the guitar you are in a microphone and it's kind of lousy sound system and seen it was a half million people or whatever it was\nDo you think about these moments in your past and you know I think\nAs I get older sometimes I Do or somebody to show me a photograph I think oh my God I was there and those people were there and Dr King said what he said um and sometimes going into a quote historic moment you know it and other times you don't know it\nUm in that case I think by midway through the morning you know we all knew it yeah yeah\nYou you mean there's some there's some times a year in the middle of an event that turns out to be a comic and you have no idea\nI think festival a political moment yeah\nI'm I was just thinking about Woodstock and it was a little bit of both because I took the last helicopter in and looking down and seeing these people are like aunt you know they're just gobs of people\nAnd so I had a hint then of that this is going to be something very big but it was after the fact that you realize oh my goodness that's made a dent in people's lives forever\nAnd in yours and mine yeah\n... you know this next song that you're going to do I went to um\nCharleston not just days after the shooting to write about these families and these these ... relatives with people who lost people in the church there in this in this slaughter and it it was\nChurch there in this in this slaughter and it it was extraordinary and then the funeral that followed\nUm that President Obama went to it seems like a million years ago it does the idea of a of a president I'm capable of showing empathy just such a degree that\nNot only is the crowd with him in the field they feel like allies but he's able to sing the song I Begin the song yeah that lift people up as opposed to issue a tweet that depresses hello [laughter] um yeah how do you remember that\nThat terrible incident and why did you decide to I'm covered the so\nWell covering this song it was a no brainer I mean it was whatever feelings I had them or in the future\nThat song just dropped out of the sky shouldn't by the way Milford I did not know and most people didn't know and\nI Need to tune that didn't get to architect\nI mean if I was Quaker a tune that you can only be knocking that guitar and you're killing on not can you hear hearing it loudly\nAnd they just go ahead yeah okay Mm\nMm [noise] [noise]\nMm Mm Mm\nMm Mm Mm\nYoung men came to our house a Frenchman they didn't know anyone brought him he\nWas not friend he was not keen but now when they're doing\nAnd they let him Maine and foreign our this strain\nThey let him me\nAnd for an hour the strangers they did he sat with them many seem to print any\nBut then a young man to God and nine people weren't on young\n...\n... ...\nIn Charlotte in the month of June Mm some mourners gathered in ... the president came to speak some were\nAnd the cameras roll and the nation on her\nNo one could\nSay what must be in a bar all the living and and and\nSo on that day and then that\nRaising gravy

seven miles nautical miles to the poll but he feared that if he kept going his men who were already fading would not make it back\nThose four men for my mother\nAnd so I made a decision that always

mileage so that he could reach\nString of making his mileage so that he could reach the end point of the expedition before the end of the month of January because in February begins the winter season
