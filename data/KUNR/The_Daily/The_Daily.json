[{"month": "10", "state": "NV", "station": "KUNR", "content": "Was you know trying to figure out a way to come up against an incumbent who was hugely popular among young voters among minority voters you know what we've come to think of as the Obama coalition\nYour father was born in Mexico so the question is are you Mexican American would you be the first Hispanic president I I Would love to be able to convince people that particularly in a in a Florida primary [laughter]\nI think that might be disingenuous on my part because\nWhat the Republican Party during twenty twelve was wrestling with was how to mobilize some of its messaging around social conservative issues around faith around you know small business regulations\nRomney youngest son Craig spoke to a group of Hispanic small business owner\nOn some of these topics that Hispanic voters tend to have in common with conservative voters\nWho shares your values\nPresident Obama used his healthcare plan to declare war on religion at the same\nExact time the president has been feverishly focused on winning Latino voters in Spanish language ads about Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor the Democrats\nAnd President Obama's campaign and they were reaching out to Latino voters in very targeted ways\nThe stories of Latino community are stories about the American dream young people who believe that anything is possible and parents and grandparents working hard to give their children the chance to succeed\nAnd then in August of twenty twelve effective immediately right before the election you have the introduction of DACA\nThe department of homeland security is taking steps to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people\nWhich really was a huge moment of elation for Hispanic voters and for Latinos broadly who cared about immigration reform\nSo how did these dueling strategies Obama's Ann Romney's work out for each of the candidates when it came to the Latino vote\nWell I think to answer that question you really just have to look at the results President Obama won the Hispanic vote by something like Seventy one percent and Mitt Romney took just twenty seven percent one of the all time lows in presidential election history\nSeven percent one of the all time lows in presidential election history\nAnd what lesson do Republicans take from what looks to be an electoral blowout when it comes to Latino voters or a little bit\nTo mass focus and not focus in people's hearts that we don't relate to I think average Americans more than we should um stuffy old guys\nThey came out in twenty twelve with the now famous autopsy report which really instructed candidates to find ways to communicate with Hispanic voters and with other minority voters to bring them out to the polls to show them that the Republican Party is\nNot just open to them but support policies that will help them\nThe report recommends the G O P spend ten million dollars toward new minority outreach efforts and even more ON Technology and building it improved voter database\nAnd important piece of contacts that we need to remember is that President George W. Bush\nWas actually fairly popular among Hispanics he pulled in forty percent of the Hispanic vote ... thousand for just a few elections before that is a huge swing and what it signaled to strategists and twenty twelve was if only they could get the messaging right if\nOnly they could show Hispanics that Republican conservative policies were going to help improve their lives than you know in the future they could wear away at the sort of democratic Obama coalition that had cost them two presidential elections already\nSo one Republicans see that there are potential inroads what do they actually do to try to win Latino voters back\nAfter the twenty twelve election after this autopsy report\nLatino voters back so after the twenty twelve election after this autopsy report\nBoom boom you have you know Jeb Bush George W Bush's brother of course running for office showcasing his bicultural family\nI'm married to a Mexican American in the United states citizen I'm immersed in the culture I'm bilingual I feel like I'm bicultural I'm proud of of the diversity of my own\nFamily speaking Spanish but a lot of campaign stops\nIn these bottles me well George Bush they didn't feel this morning at all\nYou have Marco Rubio running\nOn the strength of his support in Florida and on the fact that he had you know tried to cooperate on a comprehensive immigration reform bill\nAnd when we talked about illegal immigration is not about demanding writes about appealing to the passion of the most compassionate nation in the history of the world\nYou have even Ted Cruz senator of Texas at times attempting to speak Spanish at debate\nAnd I don't I don't know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesn't speak Spanish and\nThink they know how they fill out and everybody wanted to get it [noise]\nAnd so you really start to see that the Republicans are taking seriously the idea that they need to reach out to Hispanic voters really trying to meet them where they are\nRight in what could be a greater testament to this kind of cultural changes in the party and the fact that two of those candidates you just mentioned crews and Rubio are themselves Latino it goes beyond\nAnd cruise and Rubio are themselves Latino it goes beyond political pandering\nIt's true representation ... to have Jeb Bush's bicultural family prominently featured on the news to have him\nBragging about his ability to speak Spanish fluently that sounds really positive signals of inclusive at the end of support to Hispanic voters and I really think that that can't be overstated\nAnd then came Donald Trump\nWhen Mexico sends its people they're not sending their best they're not sending you they're not sending you they're sending people\nThat have lots of problems that they're bringing those problems with us\nWhat we see is Trump is um and in particular Trump's controversial immigration related rhetoric\nSlowly creep into the mainstream of the Republican Party during that campaign during that campaign\nButton in twenty Fifteen when he first announced his candidacy I think that Republicans were aghast at his remarks and we're trying to figure out how to marginalize him but did not imagine that he would become the nominee for their party and eventually the president I\nKnow I think I'm going to do very well the last you know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics because I'm going to bring back jobs and they're going to get jobs right now they're going to get jobs I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics\nSo obviously we know how the election turned out in twenty sixteen how exactly did the Latino vote shake out in that election\nWell this is where there was a bit of a shock exit polls at the time showed that around thirty percent of Hispanic voters actually supported President Trump during the twenties\nThirty percent of Hispanic voters actually supported President Trump during the twenty sixteen election he actually did a little bit better than Mitt Romney dead at the ballot box better than Romney better than Romney\nThat feels genuinely unexpected\nYou know when I saw the exit polls yeah my first instinct was surprised I thought that he would get a lot fewer voters than Romney did in twenty twelve ... but then when I started looking at the numbers as they became available\nMy realization was that it wasn't so surprising that\nRepublican leaning Latino showed up at the same rate that they did in previous campaigns\nWhat was surprising to me is that a record number of Latino didn't vote fourteen point three million Hispanic voters did not cast ballots in twenty sixteen\nDespite a race that seemed like it would very much animate Latino voters theoretically against Donald Trump\nAnd what that indicated to me and what I think it's been born out in conversations I've had across the country since then\nIs that Trump alone was not enough to motivate a lot of voters immigration policy alone was not enough to motivate some of these voters mhm what I concluded and I think what a lot of other people are starting to see is it the Latino vote is just much more complicated\nMuch more nuance than we understood before and they care about a lot more issues than they are being spoken to about\n...

did they all look at this you know single document\nSo there's a big bugs but when they walk out and reporters are pampering them\nWith questions and some of them Senator Whitehouse are trying to escape they don't want to say anything we're running after them in the hallway saying you know what can you tell us about this report what's your take on this or did they interview and you know kind

will\nThat they offered to fly to California to interview her in a setting that we've been comfortable for her and would\nHave maintained her privacy so you know they're actually accusing Democrats of running a what one of them I think Chuck Grassley called it a demolition derby\nAnd we're just about destroyed a good person to be on the Supreme Court\nSo for the Republican Cheryl the message is that the FBI report confirms what they already think that without definitive proof that an assault ever occurred\nKavanaugh should be considered innocent and because there's no definitive proof this has all been a calculated attempt by Democrats to hold up this nomination and smear Brett Kavanaugh has time for all that to end and for this guy to get confirmed\nRight\nAnd what about the Democrats how are they spending the FBI report on third\nI Am not allowed to be held I can tell you I'm married\nBelieve that the message was designed to get to the truth is that\nThe Democrats are saying this

out there that the FBI could have interviewed\nSays out there that the FBI could have interviewed\nMany fears that this was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting all the

report doesn't offer any new information they're not saying that this report corroborate\nThose allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh it sounds like what they're saying is that because this report was always so limited in its scope because of the small number of people who were interviewed and the large number of people who were never interviewed that it can't possibly prove anything for anyone that this report was\nKind of a waste of time\nWell right and not only that it can't possibly prove anything for anyone but that it was never intended to prove anything for anyone\nCandidly
