own noting it reflects an increase in hate crimes across the country jak Rosen is president of the American Jewish Congress\nJak words fail you know we're so sorry about this route to community\nBut has this been in the back of your mind you know what were you thinking when you heard about this attack\nBy first thought was this is a\nBrutal anti Semitic killing tech not only in the Jews but Americans and our values and the shock of it all was\nJuice had been living in America is comfortable it's accepted in all communities around the country she changed since the fifties and sixties and in the anti Semitism bigotry against Jews and many minorities\nAnd here we are again one more time or the ugliness not only pop to the surface goes ...\nBut it seems to ... a good number of people in them or\nWell uh ... let's talk\nIt's a good number of people in America\nWell uh ... let's talk about the climate in which it occurred dues make up about two percent of this country's population the FBI data says they account for about half the countries where they just hate crimes\nAccording to the Anti Defamation league that's nearly two thousand incidents and twenty Seventeen five hundred more than the previous here have you been feeling that increase\nIn the last two three years we've seen more anti Semitic acts Nazi symbols on the on the Jewish cemeteries are schools this act on Saturday is quite a shock to the community and to America is seems\nAnd you know the the gathering there in Pittsburgh thousands of people came out of out of your feeling that\nSupport from across the board and yet we heard the President's Day in his first remark it's hard to believe that this could happen in this day and age I mean you're saying somewhat the same thing\nExcept you're saying that you are also aware of a rising incidents do you think that maybe possibly this horrific act on Saturday that maybe at\nThe very very least you know it's a small consolation but there there can be a a a moment of people understanding that there is anti Semitism in this country\nI'm fearful that unless we mobilize ... political leadership decides to change its ways they won't be any\nMajor changes taking place you know there's an opportunity next week when we vote in America maybe of those that have had been spewing out some of his viral language you know politicians closes who not spoken out against intolerance against minorities and\nMaybe that will send a message in shock the system you know the answer to this your political leaders they have the microphones and most important political leaders our president is a bully pulpit as the biggest microphone in the country and I think it starts\nMost important political leaders of president as a bully pulpit as the biggest microphone in the country and I think it starts with him changing the town\nOf how he speaks about Americans and politicians from other parties but it also has to go down to you know our representatives in Washington are man governors and mayors or you know it's a local issue and if we can mobilize be a little loud voice to make sure that\nThey understand that this is not the American way than Americans won't accept it and they'll go to to the polls is necessary to to change it and it becomes a priority that's where it has to begin and\nWell uh actually some would say we're hearing the opposite from the president had been\nFor a while we know that the government in Pittsburgh shattered the same racist rant that was heard by the marching white nationalist in Charlottesville in August of twenty Seventeen and we know that you know on line these white nationalists a supremacist Nazis\nAbsolutely believe and foment the thinking that accuser pulling the strings somehow behind policies they don't like let's listen to these marches it's hard to hear but let's listen to these marches again in Charlottesville\n\nSound from a documented is put together that day I mean when you heard that that that's what he allegedly the shooter was allegedly shouting in the synagogue that had to be tailing\nYes of course you know coming off of Charlottesville and Charleston and other attacks I think Americans are very conscious of\nThe wrong song being set in America I Know everybody speaking about the president having a big responsibility in this because of his views and his political rhetoric we should all working hard to let him know that we don't accept that in America but it's not only him as the point I'm trying to make\nIt was just happened to be watching Clinton sharpen your show\nExcept that in America but it's not only him as the point I'm trying to make it was just happened to been watching Clinton sharpen a show on TV yesterday\nHow shocked and I know it'd be the\nDiscussion tend to surround Trump the bigotry and hatred that he shows been showing you the wrong tone has been setting I said to myself what about how can\nYou speaking of Louis ... leader of the nation of Islam\nYou know he just a few weeks ago said the Jews are Tom writes why don't you speaking out against him is that because you're a Democrat and\nRepublican but our political leaders should also be speaking out against yellow hatred coming from all sides from all parties we can maybe hold president a little more responsible\nYou know he has to since he has the biggest microphone she's going to have to uh you know live with the fact that\nHe's the one they talk about the most but we shouldn't forget other parties all leaders don't just get a pass\nHere in the mail kinds of an inch on head that they were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville and some got permission half as much as I don't think\nThat you you couldn't talk about Nazis and the old right and Americans I just don't think that comparison makes any sense to ten of us America's\n... president of American Jews Congress thanks so much and again ... for the last in your community\nThank you for your time thoughts and appreciate

that also happens to be a finalist for the national Book Award for fiction\nBut secret Nunez is exquisite novel the friend is about suicide and it's also about the writing world with the author says is a sinking raft with too many people trying to get on\nAnd it's about a dog a harlequin great Dane named Apollo after the suicide of her friend the narrator is asked to take his massive pet in and they mourn together to goodness focus last march\nThere were these three strands that I I wanted to bring together into the same story and one was about uh the suicide of of people that are very close to you and another was um [noise] my experiences as a writer and a teacher of writing\nAnd ah I've always loved animals and I have always wanted to write about animals and I've always been interested in this human animal bond particularly the human canine bond so I saw a way that I could write a story leaving all those strands together\nAnd did you ever um and throwing in by the way along the way I'm suddenly there's Beckett and finally O'Connor and Kafka and you're quoting other moments in literature as is written another book dogs do us the honor of treating us like gods and we respond by treating them like things\nThat is a quote from ... from his novel disgrace\nAnd what are you trying to say about these not just overall noble creatures but in this case a character named Apollo who's one of the largest dogs you can imagine but when he first comes into the narratives apartment his tail is lower like a beast of burden what do we know of\nDepartment his tail is lowered like a beast of burden what do we know about whether dogs grieve [noise]\nWe do know that they do grief because we can observe that and we do know that you know we can't explain to them all the person died because he was in a car accident or something I Can't explain that to a dog but they definitely do mourn\nAnd uh you know in this book she didn't think about this because it wasn't her idea to taking the dog but once she has him she realizes that he is going through a process of grieving just like her own and that and draws them very close together and they get through it together they help each other he'll now\nI remember I had to put a little dogs asleep ones and the person who came to the house that it's better that the other dog see this ah so that they know where the dog is gone and I I thought what seems odd but\nI Am such made yeah cats you can't say for sure that that would happen\nWell when the when the shot started an injection to you know put him to sleep the\nOther dog ran from the room jumped into the bath tub and peaked over the top as if to say is anyone noticed you're killing a dog here I mean you know fascinating they and then he did more afterwards or\nAs I Do think that although we don't really know what's going on inside dogs hands because we we can't and they don't have language we know that they're smart I think they might be many many times smarter than we actually have thought to this point\nBut the book isn't I mean for those wondering we've seen books recently that concentrate on an animal and somebody's relationship with an animal yours goes off I mean there's whole chapters where we're not hearing anything about Apollo and every now and then you say it's only happened to the dog or is something going to happen to the dog\nAnd every now and then you say it's only happened to the dog or is something going to happen to the dog because you presume it's like old yell or you presume okay embracing here if there's a book with a dog something's gonna happen but you go off with your narrator to other parts of her life would be thinking there\nShe has a life outside of the dog even though during this period of mourning she doesn't do much besides take care of the the ... I mean he's he's her whole emotional lives during this period\nSomebody asks where the party argue the woman who is in love with the dog\n... with a giggle them but also if you are a writer and this narrator is\nA big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a talking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know where you do have a person\nWho in trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain writers and certain books and certain words and that's why I quote people like\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she was trying to tell a story about ... and the and all of those writers do have a part in her life as people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow along the way I I I kept thinking I should Google this I should Google this is it true that during the Nineteen eighties and California there were many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight yes and they all lead atrocities and what they were just psychosomatic ally they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYes they did have psychosomatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it\nIt true that research is\nThe nation that doctors had four it\nIs it true that research has shown that it helps I think it was damaged children or six children to read aloud to dogs\nYes that is something that uh has been going on in classrooms in libraries fairly recently I think I'm needs a therapy dog say they know to be calm and just sit still and and listen and to the child is having reading difficulties\nThe dog is listening but he's not judgmental and anyway it appears to work about what it does for the dogs I don't know but it does seem to help the children yes that's also true yes\nYou also talk about people we talked about the site but you also talk about people who weren't dying their throat because of something powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times to our narrator we're not going to give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend\nIs all along is the dog and maybe not the mentor who committed suicide\nOr it could be boats ... or maybe the friend is the narrator\nYeah and what about you said you know you've loved animals but you make your narrator a cat person who isn't sure how she feels about a dog\nMy my ... my married are really does this is something I definitely share with my married her she says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like a lot of other people have trouble\nWith this idea of dominating any animal ... and you don't dominate cats you dominate other animals horses dogs\nYou know at some point she says uh they're almost two poignant and their relations with the person that and to our cat person for example she says\nRelations with the person that into our cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet can live without me\nShe just much happier with the idea that her cats would easily survive [laughter] her dying suddenly whereas this dog is totally traumatized by the disappearance of his best friend\nYeah dogs can be unbearably poignant and she said although I'm reminded of the great essay writer the public radio as a writer Alice furlough who wrote the definitive essay on a her cat dying and the only solace that she took from it every morning her cat would try to wake her up by not going to Penn on her head\nAs they do you have her only solace is that\nShe is now waking up and the cat's not there it would have been more unbearable for her if the cat was still trying to you know with a pen\nWake her up when she had gone\nOh yes that's that's very moving\nWell and how was this book it's called the friend from secret newness and took it it'd have to ask you it is about writers and writing in the community and the teaching of it um can you give us one tip for those who uh wanna wrestle a story to the ground\nThe piece of advice that I really like is the symbols don't\nFlinch I say it because I Do see a lot of very good work among my students spoiled at least in a draft\nBecause they've done exactly that they have this really good story they have it is really good experience they have very strong feelings about it but when they get to writing it down they get scared and they flinch and they pull away from it\nAnd that you know makes it not as good a story as it could be\nAnd that you know makes it not as good a story as it could be\nWell I Would say if anybody wants to see how you can write a book about a dog that for the longest time in the book isn't really about a dog and then suddenly it was all about a dog in you know with such a punch\nPick up the friend um and how much of this is you you've told interviewers this isn't my writing class [laughter] you know I'm not that frustrated with student riders but is the suicide maybe so when you do know because we read the germ of this was people who you knew who were contemplating suicide\nOne of the reasons why I did want to to write this book was because there were several friends that I had well let me know the suicide was something that was on their mind it's not like they were planning it next week or even next year but it was something that he started at started thinking about and thinking that that it eventually what would happen\n[noise] mhm\nFunding

I'm Peter O'Dowd I'm Robyn Young it's here and now the alleged gunman behind Saturdays deadly synagogue shooting that killed eleven who was in health injured in a police shootout was wheeled in and out of court today as he was assigned a public defender\nAnd at that huge interfaith vigil for the victims last night Pittsburgh Mayor Bill ... vowed to fight back against the hate the shooting represented\nWe will drive anti Semitism in the heat of any people back to the basement under some ... in a way from the open\nDiscussions and dialogue around and around the sun\nThe herring is a reporter with a W E s hay in Pittsburgh I'm only a how does seem to you there\nThere is a collective sense of real profound grief here people are very shaken up still and feeling the pain\nBut there's also a real sense of resolve and unity and people pulling together to support each other across fates and identities\nAnd really expressing not support both in words and actions really remarkable thing that's been reported is that there are Muslim organizations in the community who have raised over a hundred thousand dollars\nAnd in the community who I've raised over a hundred thousand dollars to help support victims and affected people here\nAnd there were Muslim leaders at the vigil last night thousands of the pictures from there were unbelievable packed inside and then under umbrellas outside the city you know crying but how are the the injured doing we mentioned eleven\nKilled six more wounded four of them still in the hospital any sense of their condition [noise]\nYes so we do have some reports from the University of Pittsburgh Medical center which is treating patients they say on their Twitter account that\nTwo of the worshippers are either in stable or critical condition as sixty one year old female is in stable condition a Seventy year old male is in critical condition\nAnd there are two officers who are still being treated there is at fifty five year old male officer he's in stable condition and a forty year old male officers in critical condition\nThose officers confronted Robert Bowers the alleged gunman as he was leading the synagogue drove him back in and had that of exchange with him in which they were wounded by the way so what are people saying about something President Trump said which was that if only the synagogue had had a security\nOfficer one thinks it is for\nHeavily armed police officers couldn't stop this man a security officer might not have been able to but what what are people there saying\nThey're responding with deep skepticism and anger in some instances mayor ... himself has refudiate at that statement saying that we need to focus\n... statement saying that we need to focus on the irrational thoughts are behavior that leads to the dangers that we saw on Saturday as opposed to trying to just\nFight those dangers with more weapons I'm at the same time he does expressed support for limiting the sale of guns\n\n\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners or W. B. U. R. Boston and exact science is offering Colo guard for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon cancer screening test that can be used at home by prescription only information at coal to guard test dot com\nIt's here now and now a story that feels not a moment too soon given the news\nIn July New York became the first stage required that every public schools have a form of mental health education the law was passed in twenty Fifteen and it's being enacted as suicide rates for kids and teens who are in fact\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention suicide became the second leading cause of death for younger Americans and twenty sixteen behind car accidents\nGlenn leaving is CEO of the mental health association in New York state a group that's pushed for this law for years Glenn tell us why\nWe wanted it to be basically a basic understanding about mental health signs and symptoms of internal you have support from the community\nWell so what are some of the ... the concrete things I mean talking about the fact that it's real and shouldn't be a stigma and it's as much a disease I guess as you know I'm diabetes that's great for awareness but then where does it go from there\nWhen we did get the legislation passed one thing we did not advocate for words with specific curriculum because what you teach in the Bronx might be a little different than what you're teaching in upstate New York\nIn the Bronx might be a little different than what you're teaching in upstate New York so we wanted to make sure that you know each district could determine what they perceive as their best sort of lesson plans best curriculums to put forward\nHow would that be given for our national audience you know the Bronx is very urban upstate New York very rural how might it be different\nWell I think that the understanding and and the socialization and things like that are are a little different in a rural areas suburban area in the city\nNot that there's a greater understanding in one part of the state versus another part of the state but just a sort of an overall cultural peas and just a greater you know knowledge about mental health in general\nIt well and I'm thinking that Long Island day suburban Long Island may have more of an acceptance of\nThe idea of therapy and mental health being on the table then let's say a a a small town and I'm not going to pick out you know but a small town in upstate New York or it may not be as widely used\nCorrect yeah and there are cultural differences too there's\nDepending on the culture there are cultures that are very accepting about talking about mental health more openly than other cultures are talking about a more openly so\nThat also has to take into into place too and also school history some schools again have rolled out mental health court comes in the past and so we don't want to transpose our piece over what they are already teaching but what we did do in response is we were able to create a resource center at school mental health resource center\nWhere we were able to\nI have a a group of experts mental health and education experts meet through the state department of education to develop what we regard as sort of a\nYou know best practice lesson plans so people can go to our website and look and see that there are lesson plans out there are dedicated to elementary school\nAnd see that there are lesson plans out there dedicated to elementary school to middle school in the high schools\nYou've got that teacher training there and other tools so willing people it here in our data word but bring sample like let's say you decided to implement this in grade school wasn't like a specific part of a curriculum and then what might one be in eleventh grade\nSure well a lot of what you're talking about in elementary school especially early on in the ground in first grade second grade is just about things like feelings about sadness and happiness and\nJust general kind of sense of a basic knowledge you know obviously we don't want to bring in topics that are too heavy by any means especially to very early age\nAt this idea of talking about feelings developing an emotional awareness so that when trouble comes has the teen years approach maybe somebody's ah got the tools to deal with it\nAnd it's exactly what we try to do is create a progression recognizing that okay where where buildings sort of like the the structure now for an individual to have that\nThat emotional intelligence to have a basic understanding so when they are older and facing you know more challenges in terms of their mental health that they are better able to to deal with that so it's almost like really building into progression\nThe national alliance on mental illness nominee\nHas all sorts of stats one of them is that one in five young people live with a mental health condition in the u._s. but less than half get treatment so this might also funnel people to real treatment as opposed to education but don't you know there's opposition there are teachers who don't feel comfortable with the subjects whiz kids\nTeachers who feel that it should be the parents who handle something like this or therapist\nI think what we say in response to look it's a very very legitimate issue\nI think what we say in response that look it's a very very legitimate issue and we are really emphasizing that this should be an inclusion of families in this discussion as much as possible\nAgain we don't want psychology when uh when we don't want teachers to go and talk about here is a different diagnoses or anything like that we just want teachers to be able to go in and and give a basic knowledge about mental health and maybe again to your point when you were saying and talk about the things that we already know talk about stigma\nTalk about things like the connection between physical and mental health issues and we hope that as more and more of these discussions going on and people are realizing T educators families that you know this is just a normalization of a of a of a condition that hopefully people will be much more open about talking about it\nThat's going to leave many CEOs and nonprofit mental health association in New York state what are the groups that advocate it for the new law that it's just going to affect the climbing on public schools to have some form of mental health education Glenn thanks so much sure I really appreciate robbing\nA profile now of an artist you may have never heard of her name is Mary course from Southern California her body of work goes back to the Nineteen sixties despite a steady career she hasn't\nGained much recognition outside the art world there's never been a comprehensive museum survey of her work until now the beacon north of New York city and the Whitney Museum of American art in Manhattan are presenting major exhibitions of courses work\nWork that you have to see to fully see as Karen Michel reports\nThere are times when a friend is telling you about an inch or the concert attended and then kind of you who you just had to be there and that's how it is very [laughter]\nAnd that's how it is with Mary courses because with every team to light in the room every movement made by the view or something else emerges from the deceptive apparently modeled climatic simplicity\nSome of the paintings are thirty feet long twenty feet long so it takes time as you walk by so without a viewer does that work exist [noise] that is a good question does the tree fall I think not [laughter] [noise] perception has a lot to do with creating reality\nHorse tries to get it that by creating large canvases filled with rectangles in lines and sheets of white that aren't immediately apparent artist an art critic beat her playing it has both exhibited with and written about course he's heard lots of other artists make similar claims about the role of the viewer\nIt's an old aesthetic ... you know that every work of art requires a viewer to complete the circuit probably her more than most\nHorses exhibition at the Whitney is called Mary course a survey in light and in fact course calls yourself a painter of light we play games does take issue\nThere's something to commercial about it it sounds like you know central painter a light right like some really bad PR lesion artist was Seventy five galleries all over the world painter of light is probably more compact than painter who's cruising around was late and ... you wouldn't want to say that\nThe corps throughout our history painters have been screwing around with white is Whitney curator Kim ... points out\nActually her practice has to do with something that painters had been thinking about for centuries think back to an artist like ... ...\nThink back to an artist like car garage into the Italian broke period trying to figure out how do you capture the ephemeral qualities of light from going round with every day it's kind of phenomenon how does that translate into paint and how does that translate onto the surface\nMary courses been wrestling with that cannot grim since early twenties at one point she was experimenting with light as part of the work first using fluorescent lights and later the more subtle radiance Oregon\nStill for older experimentation she was pretty much out of the big boys club of Los Angeles art in the Nineteen sixties as the consensus of the time was the painting was dead concepts we're in the men were he men and women are just were pretty much ignored\nI was younger than everybody else so I was still really a girl I was in my twenties so maybe that had something I figure that has much to do with it as being a woman but I've also been in museum shows good shows and they listed everyone in the show but me I was the only woman and my name was left out\nAnd it keeps happening prominent curators wouldn't even come look at her work and it wasn't like the burgeoning feminist art movement pioneers of the time had her back either\nEven though I wasn't that political at the time I didn't want the art convene political the woman's limits should still likely because how many single artist raised two children single moms so I was working hard to live my life free\nAnd on Thursday this week Kay you in are partnered with our town Reno to present some of the stories

were abducted from the school in ... book in northern Nigeria the kidnapping provoked worldwide reaction including from first lady Michelle Obama who had this to say the following month\nLike millions of people across the globe my husband and I are outraged and heartbroken over the kidnapping more than two hundred Nigerian girls from their school dormitory in the middle of a night\nBut then what happened to those girls some managed to escape right away Twenty one were released in October twenty sixteen and in May of twenty Seventeen eighty two more were released their stories told the new HBO documentary stolen daughters kidnapped by Boko Haram it airs on HBO tonight\nAnd joining us now is writer producer Karen Edwards welcome\nHigh and producer Sasha Achilles with us as Well hi Sasha ... ... so the girls that we first meet in your documentary of the ones who were released by Boko Haram they're living in a compound apart from their families\nAnd their captivity was the one thing the government didn't want you to ask about wasn't it\nYeah it was a part of the condition of the access we always see the kid the access with the government's consented to any way to do it\nBut they were adamant that we shouldn't speak to the details about what had happened to the gym three is that they were held by Boko Haram why am partly a I mean they was you know the government's his cane that they control the narrative\nBut also we the girls were released in may we started filming with them and not governments safe house in early July so\nAnd not governments safe house in early July so it was they had only been out of captivity [noise] for about six weeks so it was quite rule they um we're still processing wanting to happen to them\nSo that was part of it it wasn't for us when all counsellors to push them into reliving and telling his what had happened that we tried to give them the ... in the space to if they wish to\nBuddy clearly anytime we wherever alone with the girls the government minders and security shut them down quite quickly so it's twofold I think the government also wanted to manage how\nThe rest of the world on Nigeria see that goes time in captivity because they were held for three years before and they say some wisdom and they were released\nWell what do we know about their time in captivity and what would what it was like well they they um low they was free to speak to is they did give us that diaries discreetly\n... and they kind of make it clear that life wasn't goods that they were forced to marry if not they would have the what they called the and the full Boko Haram treatment ... ah and\nThen the phone what we do is the uh the girls that you book goes who were taken would actually just the tip of the ice but there are thousands of girls in Nigeria here were taken by Boko Haram who are free to speak and they do tell us\nWalked the Boko Haram treatment is so through that testimony we get a sense of what happened to the ... foot goes as well\nWhat happened to the book goes as well\nSo such a let me bring you in because uh you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one\nGirl in your film who was married had a kid ah with somebody from Boko Haram and it's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid she's I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's of Boko Haram baby\nYeah say what we were told by a lot of the goals that we interviewed who and all and the film is that you kind of had two options in the forest either you marry a soldier or you become a slave\nAnd if you're a slave than you know life is not taught us so it's a question of kind of survival and in a way even if you end up marrying a soldier or the golf felt like they you know we're rights\nAnd and we're supposed to be that why it say she as she says I was two months pregnant when I ran away and when we fast that had like she she did tell us I don't love\nMy baby as much as I Love the two little boys my baby of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually were kidnapped as well uh and ended up being made into child soldiers\nYeah say one of the untold stories is the number of boys and men who have ... have either been kidnapped or killed during this will say about ... than kidnapping children but also\nWe'll say about ... than kidnapping children but also older men and uh some of them are forced to pick up arms and fight\nAnd then when the military engaged with ... and they tried to take back territory they will kill an arrest or people who look like soldiers and so a lot of men have been killed in this fight in the process of trying to eradicate Boko Haram\nIt's kind of amazing watching how terrible the situation is and and as you report so many people have not been kidnapped but they've just flooded their towns out of fear of book around they're living in these tent camps um that this isn't getting more attention globally\nYeah it is functioning I think all the focus has been on Syria and yet the famine in the north east of Nigeria\nIs just terrible it's a very widespread and high level and they all will running two towns and these they called them id Pete comes a intently displaced people\nAnd that's why they have to run through because Boko Haram you know they don't just could not be then Ben and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even know places like my degree which is kind of\nA one of the the main towns it's incredibly dangerous producer safety by numbers on that whether the food aid is going to see how if you want food and you want to live that's why you have to run\nTheir ... but then a lot of the I Love the tiny displaced people end up living within the community say despite the fact that the ... there is some fair towards people who have escaped Boko Haram but they will ...\nTowards people who have escaped Boko Haram but they will have been incredibly welcoming to the numbers displaced people who have come to made a gory\nWell let's talk about that the the people who have managed to escape from captivity by Boko Haram they tried to go back into society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nYeah I mean I'm made a gory is in a kind of normal front line will would say it that it's it's controlled its miniaturize it's controlled ... Nigerian military and\nTheir constant infiltration of suicide bombers to come into the city so when we with that like the second to last night it happened to be the end of Ramadan\nThat was sick suicide attacks\nIn one night and you just never know who to trust because Boko Haram uses young mostly young women as suicide bombers they stop them up and send them you know towards checkpoints where they manage to make it into ... said the city [noise]\nAnd so there is a lot of fear because unlike a kind of normal front line ... ... you just don't know why this is coming from and where and when I said there's a lot of mistrust\n[noise] what about the girls who are now out of captivity and looking to the future and and try to have a hopeful future or the government is making it possible for some to attend college including a some who managed to escape let's listen to one of them from your film\nI'm not and you mentioned ... and has it changed my life now and I thank you\nChange my life now and I mean ... ... ... [noise]\n\nDo you see a bright future for some of these girls yes I\nThink ah for the ... girls who are are in a un of the American universities I dropped the American University in Nigeria which is where all the girls who were released a negotiated full and ah the escaped goes who owned the nights that uh\nThe kidnapping happens so tuned in Seventy six were kidnapped\nFifty seven of them during the long journey on the back of trucks to somebody's various kind of jumped off the back\nAnd half of those have gone straight to this uh University in yoga and that's where these beans that are three is and they feel positive about life and so the two book goes everybody just stopped he lived on a year at the university\nFunding\nFor here and now comes from the listeners have W.

Simpsons Bob's Burgers and the family guy they also got a peek at the networks new experiment in advertising Fox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair of five and a half minute blocks of branded content\nHere's a promo for a block of branded content that ran after Family Guy to\nMore or less thought it would only do we have fought for ... take on prime time with a five minute we can't we can't say\nThe Sunday Edition sponsored by Google ...\nHere and now media analyst John Carroll joins us now John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what what's going on with ranking behind us\nRight that's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brand the content of the overall thinking here Fox believes and many people do that audiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots\nAnd also trying to reform at some of the advertising into branded content which is marketing package as entertainment or new ...\nAren't let's take this first change Fox is calling it the nine ... nine second sixty seconds ... nine sixty seconds break jazz pods jazz parts what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and Z which being sued traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial pilot so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually a second year this has got a problem when there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching it\nIs it also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain right right so\nAnd because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight right so brand the content is really adds in sheep's clothing so last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute block a brand new content there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and uh and other Mars candy ... brands and and basically it's due to a website with more of that kind of content it's\nOK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in prime time by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for this\nSo the financial model is to charge more for the jazz pod so they could be double or triple the standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in volume advertises like this they're not sure yet they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air\nIs worth something they're not sure how much it's worth so this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nRise right as they say the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain a\nCarroll here and now media analyst thanks very much thank you so is Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the automobile ride sharing and now car sharing have disrupted the taxi and rental car industries\nThey're also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest Sam ... is founder and CEO of a company called get around it allows you to rent your own personal car to other drivers and he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from that\nAnd he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from the top conversations with business leaders Samuel company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nYeah well I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost two hundred fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day\nAnd so getting around really allows us to address this problem of car overpopulation by using the cars we already own so instead of buying a car you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that old cars will be shared\nWe fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen and that you know where we are today with personal car ownership that the entire ecosystem needs to be disrupted and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority but the minority in that every car will be assured car\nOkay so let's talk about the specific how get around works are right now it's available and what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an app you see what cars are around you and then what\nYou know so you don't arrive you can look at the cars around you you can find that when you like the rent for anywhere from an hour or two you know multiple days you'd pick that car we run a real quick check instantly to make sure that you know your driver's license is valid and then instantly you have a car you locate it from the phone\nA lock the doors and try and you can rent some pretty nice cars by the way yes you can you know you can get anything from a previous to attest led to a Porsche people share all sorts of course\nWell let's talk about the competition because there is a lot of it there's Toro or which has one point seven million monthly active users car to go as something like eight\nMillion monthly active users car to go as something like eight hundred thousand there's your company and then there's the old man of the group Zipcar which has been around probably the longest do you think the markets too crowded\nNo we think this is a massive opportunity to disrupting a trillion dollar market which has car ownership and so the main competitor here is people buying cars the more you can shift people away from ownership towards access to more of this market gross for all players\n... well some of your competitors might also be something like ... or lift um Cox Automotive recently did a survey that said\nThat those companies and sought customer's increase by Seventy seven percent since two thousand and Fifteen but car sharing only increased by Seventeen percent what do you what do you think about that I mean are people really that eager to rent their car from a stranger when they could just jumping to lift\nIs I don't know the methodology on the Koch study um I I certainly know what we've seen and it's been much much higher than Seventeen percent increase in businesses twenty Fifteen\nSo you know I think that the way we think about that and what we hear from our customers\nIs that people are looking at moving away from ownership but they can't rely purely an ride sharing um they can't rely on car sharing they need a combination of you know public transit car sharing and Roger to really allow them to live car free in fact we have a very public partnership with over a where they've heard the same thing from their user base and so\nThat's why we came together as two companies to offer a more complete set of solutions to the marketplace so you believe people really do want to live without a car I think if you offered them mobility an equivalent level as you get today from ownership that's absolutely true yeah\nThis summer you got a big injection of cash three hundred million dollars from softbank the Japanese from what's your plan for the money\nIt's pretty straightforward I mean we plan to continue doubling down on ...\nWhat's your plan for that money it's pretty straightforward I mean we plan to continue doubling down on expanding into new cities are both the United states and her nationally and then you know we've been very fortunate to partners some some great companies like turn over so it was continue investing was partnerships and expanding our roster partners\nWill speaking of super and Toyota I mean these are companies also that are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves\nIs a great question and it's something that we've since day one than\nSort of very aware of in fact it was a ton of his cars that drove us to the idea of getting around which is if you're going to drive itself would you really park at twenty two or twenty three hours a day you'd probably the other people use it and this maybe you'd start with friends and family are colleagues but eventually strangers just makes sense\nSo we really see the rise of autonomy as it begins to become a more prevalent as something that makes our marketplace more fluid allows those carts be used by more people different cases and in fact as autonomy comes around it actually opened a lot more opportunity as to what can be done\nThrough a you know a marketplace get around were checking people or owners of vehicles with um you know companies and individuals that need access to\nI'm just thinking how that would work let's go Fifteen twenty fifty years down the road a ton of vehicles are here and they're here to stay [noise] would I just call a vehicle from somebody's parking space that isn't being used to have it come to me than drop it off and then they would go somewhere else\nYeah I think you can imagine that but I mean in the world were were fifty years out in the town of media sort of a mainstream technology I think you think you're actually in a world where you know the cars we know today is different the foreign factors of those cars have changed and you know fundamentally we're talking about a sort of a fluid network of cars that will be\nYou know fundamentally we're talking about a sort of a fluid network of cars that will be operating in around ... and outside of cities in suburban areas\nUm any of those cards might be self driving but they're fundamentally not no self cleaning or self maintaining until there's a lot of infrastructure and sort of network functioned is required to sort of operate those vehicles and that's very close to even what we do today right we help owners\nShare cars efficiently in urban centers across the United states and we work with partners you know who helped service those cars or keep them on line and and continue to operate

former Democratic congressman from California\nGerman welcome back and you think the u._s. should consider new sanctions against Saudi Arabia over this\nI think condoning murder is something we should not stand for our foreign policy is based on values and interests and values that we have in this country a rule of law and a freedom of the press or both of which were violated in this case I Believe\nA an interest that we have are working with allies like Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has been our ally against things\n... like Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has been our ally\nAgainst things like a Iran's malign behavior in in the region a and surely Iran has been engaged to proxy terror groups in malign behavior especially targeting Israel but also elsewhere I mean a Saudi Arabia claims that Iran is meddling in Yemen\nAnd Yemenis targeting Saudi Arabia and that's why Saudi Arabia's in Yemen but at any rate uh I don't see how a condoning what happened even though we have an incomplete a picture of what happened\nIs in the U.S interest and therefore I think that a sanctions against Saudi Arabia if we have proved that there was a murder here are appropriate but I also ah suggest that perhaps the thirty three year old\nCrown prince a has a some some growing up maturing to do and that it might make sense from the Saudi point of view which is not something the U.S would dictate\nA to have a a you know some kind of a adult supervision are there are so that excesses in his behavior\nWould stop happening I think that would be in Saudis interest I think that the the war in in Yemen has created the the largest could humanity to humanitarian catastrophe that we currently she and I think that this episode especially if\nThere was a Saudi cover up and plot uh to to do this is a really shocking and in every sense\nDo you think that the Trump Administration which has been watching the war in Yemen go on for years now a un hasn't put the pressure on the Saudis to uh stop it that this was going to change President Trump's relationship for example with the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nPresident Trump's relationship for example with the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nI think the Trump Administration wants Saudi Arabia as a good ally in the middle east and also as a good trading partner I think those are two agendas that it has\nAnd ah I'm not against either agenda uh but what I'm against is condoning bad behavior or in order to make sure that agenda continues a I think we can do both\nLearn more about services an appointment at south ... dot

endorsement to New Jersey is democratic Senator Bob Menendez and it does is facing a challenge from Republican newcomer Bob you get in the paper writes that\nThis is a dismal election with bad choices which brings us to our Senate tracker this week Joe Hernandez has been covering this race who's a reporter with WHYY in Philadelphia Hi Joe in Germany so Sen Menendez trial for federal corruption ended in the midst trial last year he's been trying to change the subject\nEver since a at a recent campaign of and he told voters this election is not about me it's about you and our country how has that been working out for him\n[noise] ah it's been a struggle for him I think it will be fair to say he has been struggling to break into the lead in this race he is in the lead by um you know some recent public polls but it's been hard for them and that's surprising in New Jersey which is largely a a very blue democratic state\nWell and ... and has been trying to draw attention to the ethics issues associated with eminent as Syria's on Fox News earlier this month\nBeen over four hundred campaign stops already event meeting with the jerseys of every location in our state\nCampaign stops already event meeting with the jerseys of every location in our state they want change they're embarrassed by this guy you know he violated federal law abused the power of his office\nDespite all of that are there have been some Democrats high profile Democrats who have been sticking by Menendez Hillary Clinton was just there for a fundraising event how would you describe the support that he has among Democrats nationally\nNationally he's getting some support from the party to Senate majority pac just dropped several million into the race to cement Menendez has lead and in New Jersey\nDemocrats largely are standing with him um you know top leaders in the party here senator Cory Booker his colleague in the Senate\nThey're all standing by him and I should note that his corruption trial ended in a mistrial so he was not found guilty by the jury he was however admonished by the Senate for ethics violations so when ... says he was guilty of violating federal law that's what he's referring to\nAnd what about Bob huge and he's a former executive at a biotech company that developed cancer drugs and he's been criticized for raising prices on one cancer drug here's Sen Menendez speaking to USA Today\nAnd at the end of the day is a question about just\nWho's judgment you want sitting in the Senate finding [noise]\n... you can raise the price on cancer patients last year alone not once not twice was re times for drugs that those cancer patients politically need\nHe has blamed insurance companies for some of the costs of the drugs that his former company makes he's called for changes in how drugs are priced but when you look at ... as a candidate he's also pro choice he's pro marriage equality um tell us more about him well it's\nHe's pro marriage equality um tell us more about him\n[noise] well it's true that his company or the company is called ... and they're based in New Jersey they did raise the price of their blockbuster cancer drug reveling that they've doubled it in less than a decade you would say that many patients are vast majority of patients didn't actually see that price increase when it came to their bills because it's got to go through\nInsurance companies and all that but the price of the drug did go up\nCell gene has also you know ... uh settle a lawsuit from a whistle blower who said that the company was advertising drugs for causes that weren't approved by the FDA but you're right that ... is trying to run a moderate Republican campaign he's pro choice\nHe he's been talking a lot about women and and the equity of pay for women but he is also tied to Donald Trump he spent a hundred thousand dollars on the campaign to elect Donald Trump he he he went to the\nThe Republican convention so you know he doesn't have a record voting record for people or journalists to look at he's a he's a first time a political candidate but he has supported Trump and the Republican Party in the past\nFrom the voters you're speaking with how much is Trump factor compared with Menendez is ethics issues\nYeah you would think a Trump was on the ballot this year because people keep keep talking about um it keeps coming up in my conversations with people\nBut so do Menendez is ethics issues and and for a lot of people they see you know ... tied to Trump and Menendez tied to his trial and they're trying to decide on the lesser of two evils that that is you know the calculus for many people in New Jersey this year\nIt's been a long time since New Jersey had a competitive Senate election\n[noise] yeah um you know it's been about forty years since the state elected a Republican to the Senate New Jersey is pretty pretty reliably democratic in that way I mean you know we had a Republican Governor Chris Christie for eight years New Jersey is ...\nDemocratic and that way I mean you know we had a Republican Governor Chris Christie for eight years New Jersey is quite blue when you look at you know voter registration and things like that however these races do happen um you know New Jersey often\nDoes elect a Republican and and and ... them for a long time Republican Congressman Frank little beyond those retiring this year after decades in Congress so it does happen but it's surprising this race it's surprising how close it is because of ... support and the party\nAnd just his popularity and previously\nThat is Joe Hernandez of WHYY talking about the Senate election in New Jersey Joe thank you you got to\nKnow now that our next story might not be appropriate for all listeners it's estimated that hundreds of thousands of boxes of rape evidence or sitting on shelves at police agencies across the country are waiting DNA testing DNA evidence can help identify sex offenders by matching their DNA with the federal database\nSome state legislatures are trying to reduce the backlog including Washington state but as Anna boy co why we're on memorization K. U. W. reports progress is low\nThe Washington state patrol the state's police agency estimates there are between eight thousand and ten thousand rape kits that haven't been tested\nEvery one of those represent survivor his wife's wasn't hurt who didn't have justice and also potentially very dangerous offender still on the street\nThat state representative Tina or wall a few years ago she sponsored a bill that passed the legislature it required that every kid be tested it didn't solve the problem now there's a bottleneck at the state crime lab\nRecently in Seattle and the city of Tom water to pieces emerged of men who continued\nAll in the city of Tom water to pieces emerged of men who continued raping women as their DNA sat in the testing cue\nThat's increased the urgency to fix this problem we're looking at how other labs like in Ohio had been able to process the more quickly this year Ohio was able to nearly eliminate its backlog around fourteen thousand rape kit [noise]\nAt the crime lab in rural central Ohio the rooms are set up like well equipped high school chemistry labs along narrow core doors so this again this is the biology lab during the laboratory supervisor Christians labor stands in front of the rooms are last window on the other side a scientist is testing a rape kit he's going to see the\nWhite box that's close to the window so with the paper bags rape kits are smaller than a shoe box\nThey're filled with material and Q tip like swabs of body fluids collected by a nurse after rape\nAt this lab robots help test those samples for DNA these are our robots have names like a vi Ninety seven hundred and ... than the robots do three times the work of one scientist their key to the labs efficiency\nSo is another word you might be unfamiliar with guys and sleeper explains that they basically did a hack us on\nUsing a Japanese productivity philosophy called highs and rape kit testing follow something like an assembly line and\nThe idea was to examine each step to make it more efficient sleeper says it worked it used to be\nThat it could take a scientist a day an entire day to work a rape kit um and now it can take an hour two hours for that\nUm and now it can take an hour two hours for them to open it do minimal screening take their notes and cut the samples into tubes and then move it along to the next up\nThe Ohio labs were essential and providing evidence from many sexual assault cases testing the kids helped uncover three hundred serial rapists and solve over one thousand crimes including the case of lives Garcia\nGarcia was raped at home in Cleveland in two thousand and four\nI was looking in the mirror I was like oh I did a really good job with my here this morning then I noticed that the door was opening so that's when I turned my attention to the door\nA stranger in a ski mask walked in choked her and raped her\nOver a decade later that man is now in prison for life without parole DNA testing helped linked him to the rapes of Twenty one women Garcia says getting justice helped her move forward\nThose kids sitting on shelves do nothing for us for us women in the process of our healing we have to know whether the assailant has caught we have to get our chance in court to face some\nRape kits in Ohio are tested and out the door in less than a month but in Washington state it can take around a year and a half to test one rape kit gene Johnston is a crime lab manager with the Washington state patrol she says the labs are in a tough spot\n\n\nFor here and now comes from the listeners have W.

I Can't even remember a time before the smartphone existed\nAnd that's a time when social life is very important where teams are forming their identity\nWhen what\nReally shapes and a lot of times is the time that they spend with their friends and how they spend that time with their friends has fundamentally shifted to go on line social media and texting and away from hanging out with each other in person\nDo you see people in this generation who shunned this way of life who who decide that they don't want to be on their phones all the time even though they've never known any other way\nWell there is certainly awareness or that a lot of time they're spending too much time on their phones they will in their own words often describe themselves as addicted\nBut Ninety five percent of teens um had a smartphone now and it is become it has become a normative to spend hours and hours a day on the phone to always respond to your friends taxed instantly to want to be the first to post a like an ... and so it's a real cultural norm that shifted\nAnother thing that is different about this generation we we've been hearing that the generations are becoming more diverse in this country but generations ear I ... is actually even more diverse than the millennial generation\nYeah absolutely so they are the most diverse generation in American history and that's reflected in these big um surveys that I work with whether asked about\nTree and that's reflected in these big um surveys that I work with where they're asked about um their experiences with um people from different backgrounds so say high school students of course because the high schools they go to a more diverse much more likely to um have friends of other races and ethnicities to hang out with people from different backgrounds\nThat's definitely more common among ige and then it was just say ten years ago with the millennials\nWe mentioned nine eleven how do you think U.S foreign policy has shaped this generation\nWell\nThat's hard to tell from the the data that we have because\nUm you know foreign policy is arguably it's changed the most in the last few years with the Trump Administration and we don't have that survey data yet\nBut the U.S has been at war for the entire lives of many of these people\n[noise] true um but because there's not a draft road that hasn't had a direct effect on the majority of the country\nHer company's marketing to this generation in a different way than they have to the millennials for example\nYeah they they do have to market to this generation differently because there's this such that big a generational shift I think a lot of them are picking up on the same trends that show up in these big surveys such as\nI Jen is really interested in safety is not something you usually associate with teens and young adults but in their conversation and what they say in um you know they're in their attitudes and in their behaviors\nAre very interested in physical safety and what they call emotional safety and I think that's something companies are starting to pick up on\nAnd um I think is well that there's a lot more awareness\nAround stress and anxiety that um companies are realizing\nAround stress and anxiety that um companies are realizing is another theme um with this group\nSo we're just a a couple of weeks away from the mid term elections do you think that many of these potential voters will actually vote Generation Z people\n[noise] I Wish I could say yes I'm\nBy statistics from past elections and what they say about their attitudes toward getting involved in politics and government and voting or are not encouraging so in these big surveys Eighteen year olds are now less likely to sense they're interested in government or social issues or politics\nDan teams were say Twenty years ago why do you think so um well I mean because there's so many other things to do\nThere's always the possibility of a ... something new to see on I'm On social media or a new game to play or a new series to watch on Netflix and you know I think some ... some of the interviews that I did a lot of teens\nYou know say well you know we have all these other things to do while we pay attention to the news I only do that if I have to do that for a class was very common response that I heard ...\nInteresting I mean I've had some many conversations with people who are in this generation and I always find that yes they they are definitely more reliant on their phones their mobile devices the Internet in general um but they're also often really smart ... I'm quite impressed sometimes when I speak with them\nOh absolutely they're definitely smart I mean they've they've had access to all this information and um they're they're quick thinkers on there was actually data showing that IQ has has gone up over the generations so I think sports is is definitely not the issue\nSo obviously a generation Z is going to have to deal with\nCecily a generation Z is going to have to deal with some of these problems on their own as they get older ... and and even right now what can those of us in the other generations due to to assist in any way with some of the problems of this generation\n[noise] well I think we do need to be aware I just how severe um the mental health crisis and right now among teens and young adults so there's a little awareness around that but not half as much as they as there should be that we're seeing unprecedented levels of depression and\nSelf harm a among teens and young adults now and we need to have more resources and more awareness of the causes behind that and then more funding and awareness for treatment", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Reno", "day": "22", "locations": [["W.

twenty sixteen there's a lot more Republican enthusiasm than it's being reported\nFrom Boston Globe reporter and editor Ben Bradlee junior just spent some time in a key county in Pennsylvania which President Trump won he profiles twelve Trump voters in his new book just out the forgotten how the people of one Pennsylvania county elected Donald Trump and changed America\nBen Bradlee junior welcome to hear now that you will first tell us about this county in Pennsylvania [noise]\nIs a county ... county in northeast Pennsylvania county seat is Wilkes Barre uh it's not very prosperous fraying at the edges and has been hurting for a long time\nAnd combing through a vote in the three critical swing states Pennsylvania and Michigan and ...\nThe three critical swing states Pennsylvania Michigan or Wisconsin I discovered loser and county which is a traditionally democratic county hadn't voted Republicans since Nineteen eighty eight for Bush senior\nPresident Obama want it to time resident Obama\nWon it twice but its surged in the other direction for Trump and he wanted by twenty points building up such a margin in this one county that it was sixty percent of his victory margin for the state of Pennsylvania so without this one county or he wouldn't have wanted to state or perhaps the presidency\nAnd you profiled twelve people in this book how did you find them well I went\nDown initially poking around and you do what the journalists do you go to community leaders and a newspaper editors talk show host\nAnd learn who the Trump voters were and start talking to them when one person a region to another and ended up interviewing a over the months a about a hundred in depth but it's settled on\nTwelve a who stories I decided to tell and I think that this is a window or a deep dive if you will into the Trump vote and that at least more than half the country remains shocked at a candidate as unusual as Trump got elected\nAnd there's a hunger to know more about how it happened and\nYou talk to a number of people who are kind of had different reasons for supporting Trump you you you've dipped into many different views of him one of the people that you spoke with Tiffany cloud told you that Trump's simple relate a bull speak like huge\nDo you that Trump's simple relate ... speak like huge big league or big league may have turned up voters in other parts of the country but it helped him connect with people in Lewes earned county but I think people\nBase most of their vote for president on the extent to which\nThey can relate to them on a human level a likeable they are I think that that is in the end more important than where they stand on a variety of issues and I think the people that I settled on a generally like Trump on most issues\nBut really liked his style that just like to do is uh is moxie his feisty in is how we get up every morning and I'm as a tweet storm and a six to the elites\nAnd they did not feel that he was being condescending toward them that he was talking down to them\nNo on the contrary they felt heard and listen to and felt that Hillary was talking down to them especially with her now infamous remark calling them the deplorable\n[noise] one of the things that we were talking about during the campaign is that what Trump was saying was\nNot what he actually met or not what many people were hearing from him um and and you talk to people here in loser and county who you know they hear him say I'm going to build a wall and what they would here is like not actually going to build the wall but he's gonna he's going to beef up the wall\nYeah the interesting they talked about the importance of deep coding Trump saying that the press was unfair to them to him and would treat him uh\nIt was unfair to them to him and would treat him or to literally by merely covering\nA what he said we would get into lively discussions about this and I said well that's the press his job candidate says something in the press is supposed to report it and they said no no you're really making too much of a hall of blew out of you know the Access Hollywood tape and we know what he meant that kind of thing and so it was a way of\nApologizing for him and trying to make his rhetoric a understandable\n[noise] what about religion this is a place that is very Catholic um and it's also a place that used to be big in the coal industry that that's gone away but how much does religion play into how people view President Trump it's still\nPredominantly Catholic not majority so there's a rising are evangelical population Trump's um evangelical vote was off the charts he carried a eighty percent of the evangelical vote\nSo I I talked to I'm a woman for whom Trump was literally sent by God\nShe believed that Trump was sent to cure America's political dysfunction\nAnd does she feel like he's delivered she does he's\nAppointed evangelicals to his cabinet vice president Pence is evangelical they're willing to um excuse the Stormy Daniels business\nAs essentially much ado about nothing that he's been married three times they don't care for them the the most important issues are abortion\nAnd his delivering too conservative Supreme Court justices\nAnd his delivering too conservative Supreme Court justices\nWhat about just the overall sense of the place ah right now in twenty eight teen this is a place where there's not a lot of opportunity there also a lot of drug overdoses going on I mean this is you you could go there and just do a book about the opioid crisis in this area the opioid\nCrisis is really bad they're really bad and it's affecting the entire county\nEven if you don't have someone in your family who is a an addict I'm the ripple effect is a widespread and ah I'd read at the county coroner\nDown there and he is uh just overworked and a thinks that it's an enormous problem and is trying to raise public awareness about it but it's pretty bleak in Missouri and county\nAnd young people are leaving is a brain brain there's not a lot of opportunity beyond\nMaintenance and I'm working in warehouses minimum wage jobs\nAnd do they think that things have gotten any better under Trump maybe at\nThe margins are the unemployment rate has gone down in the county as it has a nationally and perhaps it's a little bit better there but a lot you know a lot of the economic promises that Trump made during the campaign he hasn't really followed through on you know he said he would repeal and replace Obamacare\nOr the individual mandate has been repealed but he's been really uh sabotaging Obamacare and there is no um\nSabotaging Obamacare and there is no I'm neither Trump for the Republican Party has come up with an alternative plan he said that he would reduce the deficit by in his first or eight years\nThere's only going up the budget he filed in February or a shows a seven trillion dollar increase so you know Republican Party doesn't seem to care but that's not what about these voters do they care about those things they don't hasn't been able to do they don't seem to really care in the final analysis because\nThey just like Trump I think it's it's personality over or anything else\nDo you think that the Democrats are connecting now with the people of Lucerne county I remember speaking to the liberal filmmaker Michael Moore who said you know they they didn't even try to win a place like Michigan or in the last election they didn't come here the way that Trump did\nUm there's been a lot of criticism that Democrats are ignoring these people that you've been talking to in in places like was there and county well they certainly do it and\nWithin twenty sixteen and I think they would do well to listen more to Democrats one of the people that I talked to were Democrats are but felt that the party had left them rather than they leaving the party\nAny thoughts on what might happen in the midterms\nWell if I had to guess I Would think the um this so called blue wave I don't know how big it will be but I think probably big enough for the Democrats to retake the house but not the Senate\nThen barely junior ... one of the things I really liked about this book is that you gave us a glimpse in to the mind\nIs that you gave us a glimpse into the minds of many people who voted for Trump but\n\n\n\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the

in the same home room so they'd have a place where they felt less like the other here's director Philippe cast and\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience but the parents\nOf some of the minority students headed smelled of segregation and they worry that a gay their kids the feeling of being left out so the school end of the policy our question is it the right thing to a group African American or Hispanic students together when they are the minority in school\nWe turn to Dr Beverly Tatum she's the author of the best seller why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria she's also former president of Spelman College in historically black college for women\nThat container and the director of the little red schoolhouse said they're revisiting this maybe it should have been more structured but then it was very well intentioned your thoughts\n[noise] um I think it was well intentioned and certainly\nThere's a lot of evidence to suggest that there is value to give black kids time together sometimes that time together is called affinity grouping\nTime together sometimes that time together is called affinity grouping not necessarily in class time but time in a school time to talk to each other about the issues that adolescents are concerned about that can be very helpful talk about what is happening\nFor these teenagers because as you write in your book in the chapter called why are all the black kids sitting together and the cafeteria [noise]\nIt seems are different in grade school kids are playing in the sand box with kids that look different from them and then something happens in high school was happening [noise] one of the things that's happening is that changing adolescent brain meaning that as kids move into puberty\nThey start to think in a more sophisticated way they start to recognize the ways in which race plays itself out and you know there's lots of literature to suggest\nThat a black boys in school in particular are more likely to be disciplined for similar behaviors and also girls\nExperiencing questions about what does it mean to be a young black girl and having space to talk about that is not a bad thing it can be actually a very helpful thing the stereotypes that we see of\nBlack women are imposed on them and so they might develop some oppositional behavior lane that\nSure well if I Am a young African American students and I'm trying to understand what it means to be a black person in a white dominated society\nOne of the things that I might be thinking about is\nI don't want to be perceived as quote acting white some social scientists have said you know the black kids think doing well in school is acting white but that's not universally true if you are in a largely black school and a lot of black kids are in schools that are segregated because their neighbor\nBlack kids are in schools that are segregated because their neighborhoods are segregated they're going to the local school and if you are in a school like that\nThe honor students are black but if you are in a predominantly white school the honors group is largely white and most of the black and brown kids are in the lower tracks if that's what your school looks like\nThen you are likely to think doing well in school being in that on his track is so called acting why it's such a vicious cycle because very often\nThe kids are in those lower tracks maybe because they come from low income families but very often there's bias on the part of the teacher that puts a child in that track when in fact they should be in a higher tractors a lower expectation\nBut what ends up happening is in a sense that they don't belong anywhere else so they start to bond further with the group that they're in and in fact tracking often does result in re segregation we'd end racially integrated schools for the reason we were just talking about\nThe kids of color are being put in the lower ability groupings\nPerhaps because they are less well prepared and maybe that's related to family income and previous preparation but sometimes it isn't about that because there's also data that suggests that black kids who test as well on placement exams are still less likely to be placed\nIn those upper track you know the the the little red school so they looked at research it was probably yours in your book\nBut to read that was pretty amazing that have the same test scores are still not be placed so what do we do\nAbout how to address this notion that perhaps there should be some support without making it look\nAnd that perhaps there should be some support without making it look like\nSegregating them or again reinforcing the low expectations this brings us to the Boston medical program the greater Boston metropolitan counsel for education opportunity program Nineteen Ninety four the notion of bussing kids from the inner city from troubled spots in the inner city\nOut to the suburbs very good schools but all white schools\nIt was kind of a failure at first talk a little bit about that and then what sure so most of the children who are traveling from Boston and to the suburban schools are black or Latino\nAnd often there's this sense of not really belonging they are not part of the local community and so when superintendents of these programs look at the performance of the black kids in particular\nThey often find that the kids are not doing as well as they would like them to be doing there's also may not ... but you write another anecdote about a young girl who was in a school\nA majority white and the teacher was saying are you going to the dance kid doesn't want to see how we're going to get to the dance you know I I get busted school my parents don't have cars we live in the city but she doesn't say that and the teachers get so frustrated that she won't say she's going to the dance\nThat she then ends up saying something racial she says oh come on you people love to dance which\nAdds to the racialized moment that the young girl was feeling exactly that teacher who made that comment was well intentioned but nonetheless projected a stereotype and it made the students feel even more like she didn't really belong in that school yeah but there was a program back in the nineties I was very involved\nAnd uh one of the districts I was involved with decided to start\nAnd uh one of the districts I was involved with decided to start a program in the middle school\nFor medical students and they set aside one period a day for the kids to meet together to talk about issues related to academic performance academic achievement as well as some of the social concerns they had wait a minute this is a little little red schoolhouse his own room [laughter]\nIt sounds like there isn't it but what the difference between this experience and the little red schoolhouse is that they did it for a year and then they evaluated how it worked and what they found was that the children who were having that experience improved academically\nAnd also they became more engaged socially why what are the kids say happened\nI'm at the kids said they felt more supported they had the opportunity to talk without invoking stereotypes about some of the things that were challenging them so if you've been riding on a bus from Boston for an hour and maybe there's been conflict on the bus\nYou could go to that meeting and talk about it get it off your mind and then the more focused in class or if something happened in class let's say here's an example that one of the kids provided in this study um they were watching a film eyes on the prize which is about the civil rights era\nAnd some of the white kids were laughing at something that happened in the film something that the black kids found upsetting and so the fact that their white peers were laughing as though it were funny and the black kids were feeling like this is horrible\nI'm was upsetting to them rather than a walking around agitated they were able to talk about it the brief it's so to so to speak\nIn that um [noise] time together in ways that they found helpful by the way the title of your book\n[noise] time together in ways that they found helpful by the way the title of your book again why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria\nNobody ever asked why the white kids in the cafeteria\nTheir bonding in in many ways absolutely and it's also important to say as you just did\nWe don't ask why all the white kids sitting together in the cafeteria but in fact at the college level it is actually the white students were more likely to be racially isolated it is possible for white kids still to not engage with the diversity to stick to people who look like themselves\nJust such an odd thing in any high school or just about every college the entire culture is black whether it's the music comedians that they're following or the sports figures it must be very odd for young blacks to see that\nWell it's true I mean certainly the cultural references that you talked about so you know those black artist to the music becomes mainstream you know those athletes who are admired by white teens as well as kids of color um those are physical symbols\nAsk your smartphone speaker to play kill you in our yard will it's twelve o'clock\nFunding for here and now comes from network greeters have not lie to

G A ... and of course we remember in Trump to set up right there\nUh and of course we remember and Trump just said it right there trumps the U.S has a big relationship economically and politically with Saudi Arabia\nIt's incredibly important I mean one of the things that's been quite disturbing to me over the last couple of years is how the president has pulled America back from some of its international relationships but then also pulled back from talking about American values when you go around and that's why I spent a lot of time earlier my career\nTraveling the globe and over half of the governmental baffled private organizations\nAnd you know I always felt that security that if something happened to me the United states government would be there to help ride to the rescue I just think if you're working for an international organization in some part of the world today you don't feel that level of security may have felt six months ago because ... was a U.S read a\nLittle bit Alice how would you advise talking all he was president also working for an American newspaper which\nPresident Trump age he hates that newspaper the Washington shouldn't matter right where they go but em but Alice how how would you advise Republicans at this moment of the crown prince\nHad had other moments you know he was detained um Saudi billionaires in a hotel there are the war in Yemen there's a war in Yemen um here's Republican Senator Lindsey Graham on Fox and friends just yesterday about Mohammed been selling\nThis guy's gotta go Saudi Arabia the lifting there are a lot of good people you can choose but NBS his tainted your country and painted himself and\nAlice is this painting Trump because there's a whiff of the fact that he has personal relations with the Saudis his son in law and daughter you know have potential business deals with them and it's it's starting to feel like it's more personal than for the good of the country for human rights Robin unfortunately it feels as though\nThe country for human rights Robin unfortunately it feels as though there is a little bit more than a whiff of connection between the president and the the first family and\nUh the Saudi officials which is a big concern I I Do think is critical for us to get all of the information before we uh make any big declarations I Wish there was a little bit more of a Lindsey Graham and Donald Trump when he's talking about the situation in the fire and fury that we we do here ... and Lindsey Graham's voice\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners or W.

also created the memorable dancer Ruth Peter Pan the king and I [noise]\nThe new\nBook makes the case that these hockey was teases kept Robbins from assuming his proper place in dance\nThat because he was regarded as one of the twenty century most powerful story it was too low brow for the more abstract world of twenty second tier Jewish balance the sweets Russian boy choreographer and cofounder of the New York city ballet who hired a thirty one year old Robbins and ...\nAnd co founder of the New York city ballet who hired a thirty one year old Robbins and Nineteen forty nine to be that companies associate artistic director\nAuthor Wendy lesser says she's made it her vow her sworn duty to overturn the prevailing miss about Robbins her new book Jerome Robbins a life in dance and she joins us now when you lesser welcome thank you for having me Robyn just you know thinking of the west Side Story scenes that we that are now in our minds\nYou write it too but I hadn't heard that in the film version these sharks and jets napping their fingers are like above us we're beneath them somehow and that's because Jerome Robbins had trenches dug\nThat's right and if you go back and see the movie and I have to say although I Love the ballets and I am championing of them in this book I Am not saying anything bad about west side story is a master piece it's a great work and so was Peter Pan you know he really was a genius in that field it's just that\nUh because he was so good in that field for the reasons you said his ballets got the wrong sort or not enough attention right anyway about the west Side Story family yes he had trenches dug into the street and you can actually go and see the movie again and see that you are lower than the dancer Isaac\nOlivia fabulous well so how do we start you are familiar with the ballet world had certainly observed it um had written about it and then you started writing this book for Yale University presses Jewish lives series for the one hundreds centennial of Jerome Robbins birth\nCertainly knew about his work says we all would know about west side story and and the king and I\nAnd then you're bowled over by something you didn't know about I didn't either until you wrote about it the German Robbins Nineteen Seventy one\nYou didn't know about I didn't either until you wrote about it Jerome Robbins Nineteen Seventy one ballet Goldberg Variations for the New York city ballet set to of course music from Bach let's just listen to a little\n\n[noise]\nOkay so you will have all of the of videos that we talk about here in here now dot org but what ... what are we seeing in this valley what did you see that that really got you [noise]\nThe thing is that I went to that program not ever having heard of a Goldberg Variations by Jerome Robbins I didn't know he did a dance to it [noise]\nAnd I went to see the west Side Story sweet which was on the same program and to my enormous surprise Goldberg Variations turned out to be an incredible masterpiece eighty minutes long with a live in a stove or on the side every kind of movement you could imagine standard ballet folks dial\nFriendly formal it was just an amazing range of dance it use thirty dancers and all and it had the feeling of the music I Can't say anything better about a piece of dance than to say\nThat had the feeling of box cobra variation and I loved it so much I went back the following week and then I thought something's going on here that I don't know about I think of him as\nThe west Side Story man that Peter Pan man's fiddler on the roof man but really if he can do a ballet like this how many others could have done\nAnd you even spoke to a friend who said oh yeah I saw that back when it first came out and I remember really loving it and then feeling a little bad about that\nRight that was the impression I got and I couldn't figure out exactly why that would be although I knew that Robbins had a reputation as being lower than\nWhy that would be although I knew that Robin had a reputation as being lower than Balanchine who was the king the saint of ballet and I knew that a lot of people thought because there was a Broadway guy he couldn't really do ballet although Balanchine never thought that\nBut then I read Amanda veils and\nDeborah Xiao it's excellent biographies two of them and they both mentioned in relation to Goldberg Variations that Arlene crochet had pant it and that she was hit most powerful a dance critic and absolutely the most powerful ballet critic of her generation\nAnd you said you sat there stunned at the beauty of this piece for however many many minutes [noise] uh she called it Ninety minutes of hard labor and also called germ Robbins affects all angry man that was later but\nYou became as you write like a court appointed lawyer you were going up from Robbins worth as a belly choreographer\nAnd so let's take a listen to some of it again the pieces and we will have as much as well as we can hear now that ordered afternoon of a fun Nineteen fifty three to the music of DC I'm willing to do the Nineteen fifty five Canadian TV taping of it with the original ballerina tend to feel a click penny\nRobbins muse and dear friend [noise] and this was years before she was paralyzed by polio [noise]\n\nPalestine a reimagining of\nThe afternoon of a fun [noise] well I I just loved the stats and\nIt's only about ten minutes\nMinutes long you can watch over and over and it just feels wonderful every time it's\nOver and over and it just feels wonderful Everytime [noise] it's not just a reimagining of the music better reimagining ... version that he did in the very beginning of the twentieth century the fun is the main character and he has priest is is dancing around them and stuff but he's practically\nWhereas Robbins imagined this as a ...\nWonderful to ... I think we're at simultaneously [noise] about the ballet world we're looking at two dancers in a studio partly and then it's also\nAbout a fond and his dream girl who comes and visit\nHim and with those two dancers tend to kill a clip and Jack Kemp was it was a knockout\nAnd what are they they're like they're watching themselves into practice mirrors that is what it feels like\nAnd we are the mirror there looking toward us out in the audience but they seem to be looking in a mere as\nDancers sometimes do in the studio said that there's this weird feeling of\nWe're spying on them in a way [noise]\nAnd bouncing himself never took the superior attitude toward things that had a plot he was Balanchine loved dancers at a gathering which Robbins made and Balanchine said it\nWas so great you should make more make more it's like popcorn and he said like you could eat at the whole thing endlessly\nPopcorn and that's probably drove others you know off the cliff but let's do a little dances at a gathering this is a the dance Robin said to Chopin music in Nineteen sixty nine [noise]\nHe had been away from the New York city ballet doing Korea because\nHe's a Broadway but this stance of data gathering with an instant hit\nWhich is to [noise]\n\n\n\nAnd what do we\n\nAnd what do we see in this day\nDancing the gathering starts with a young man alone on stage and sort of ends up with him [noise]\nTouching the stage\nAfter many many minutes I you know it's quite a long ballet all the dancers coming in and joining him and they all get to strut their stuff and they combine in many different ways\nBut the idea is they are dancers hanging out together and so one of the things Jerome Robbins did this happen stand up beside watching each other as others are dancing\nIt's again like afternoon of a fallen\nA combination of\nA work that meant for us and that it's meant to have\nA real worldly reality and the work that talks about itself being on the stage\n[noise] uh you talked about his childhood which was difficult fraught relationship with his mother\nUm and he became difficult there's a famous and encircle story about him backing up on stage during rehearsal you know he has his back to the audience that companies in front of him he's backing up back up and no one tells him that he's coming at the edge and he falls in the orchestra pit and no one comes to help him\nUm he you know can be cruel\nYes in ... and a lot of people talk about his cruelty and there are many many stories about how difficult he was and not just to the dancers to Leonard Bernstein for instance when they were rehearsing west side story in Washington in a theater and Leonard Bernstein was sitting there near the front of the theater listening to the play his music\nIt's a nine point five K.

morning what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nSecure now every president since\n\nThis is here and now every president since Jimmy Carter has voluntarily released his tax returns to the public but Donald Trump has not here's Trump on sixty minutes after he was elected in November twenty sixteen\nAt the appropriate time I will release them like right now I'm under routine and nobody cares deal and cares is you know you and a few people that us and question obviously the public didn't care because I Won\nThe election very easily\nSome Democrats have been pushing to get Trump's tax returns released Here's Democratic congressman Bill Pascrell speaking in Congress in April\nI call on the German and ways and means just stop delaying it get rich to Trump's tax returns now\nThe Democrats efforts have been sidelined by Republicans being in control but if the Democrats win a majority in the house in November it means they could get Trump's tax returns joining us to explain is George ... who's a professor of law in taxation at the University of Virginia school of law\nAnd former chief of staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation welcome to hear now high Germany so what is this law who is allowed to ask for the president's tax returns\nUm the law authorizes the chair of any one of three tax committees in Congress to request the tax return information of any person or any business\nAnd directs the secretary the treasury to furnish the information that's requested a upon receipt the committee must examine the information in a confidential manner\nUm but it can important agents such as a staffer ... outside experts\nAre the law doesn't specify but I think given the significance of the possible action by the house\nGiven the significance of the possible action by the house in the house committee\nOr it would probably be very wise for the house the full house first to pass a resolution authorizing the committee share to make this request and to be very clear on what the legislator purpose of this is\n... and it would just require the Democrats taking the house to do this they wouldn't have to take both the house and the Senate\nThat's exactly right so either committee or any of the committees can act unilaterally and so if the Democrats simply took the house is not the Senate the house committee could proceed on its own a symbol leave the Senate could proceed on its own if if the opposite situation\nFor example if the house ways and Means Committee or to get those tax returns does that mean the public is going to be able to see them\nWell I'm there is a further provision in the law that allows the committee after completing its investigation\nTo submit any of the information that it's a pain to the full house or the full Senate and presumably it would be by some kind of committee vote that committee would would resolve to do this\nYou know again the law doesn't specify but I think sound practice would say that there should be some reason why the committee feels it needs to share this more broadly beyond simply the committee and its staff what kind of ... could you think of\nWell you know there are any number of reasons it really depends a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with this this is a tax committee and so it certainly could be a legitimate reason to examine because the committee\nCould be a legitimate reason to examine because the committee has oversight over the tax function\nOr the long history going back forty years in this country has been that every president has voluntarily turned over his tax returns and you know there was a good public purpose if you will for that and so the committee could be carrying that out\nBeyond that obviously there have been stories or the New York times had a story about some of the tax filing prior tax filing by um by Mr Trump's a father\nAnd there have been obviously a issues about potential conflicts of interest the New York times also raises the possibility of fraud in that story\nYes well I mean again I I Would think that you know it's it's up to the committee and the house to decide what exactly it's doing and why it searching it but I\nI think I could come up with some very legitimate arguments purposes for the committee to take this action what is the history of this law goes back to Nineteen twenty four the law that allows the house to do this to to get somebody's tax returns\nYeah so it is a almost a hundred year old law\nAnd the circumstances when it came about and we're actually fairly close to our current circumstances of the law prior to this law allowed only the president to make a decision of who's tax information could be disclosed\nAt that time when the law was that law was in effect it frustrated Congress and the early Nineteen twenties uh there were a variety reasons two principal one word\nHe's a there were a variety reasons two principal one where they were carrying out a number of investigations of the executive branch\nIncluding the scandal that became known as the teapot dome scandal involving some high level executive branch officials\nAre the committees that were investigating wanted to examine their tax returns and because of the law they had to actually go to the president and request permission from the president to get a tax material even though they were investigating\nYou know I'm executives under the present it and so obviously Congress realized she we're not really a co equal branch of government if we have to go through this kind of procedure\nOr there was a similar concern a about treasury secretary Andrew Mellon who um was an extremely wealthy and successful business person prior to going into government and like the president or did not surrender or\nPlace in a blind trust his business interests but simply or retain them while he was in office and that obviously been raised all sorts of questions in Congress is mind\nUh the the the Coolidge in ... that time was pushing through various tax legislation just like the existing administration push through at the end of last year\nAnd there were issues of well how would this legislation affect you personally how would it affect your businesses\nYou know so there was all of that going on in Congress ultimately decided to be a co equal branch of government it needed to have the authority to get this information directly just as the executive branch already had Jesus\nThe executive branch already had [noise]\nDo you think that if President Trump's tax returns are released in some way if if the Democrats take the house and they're able to get them that people who want to see them will be satisfied with what they see because what are we really going to learn from them well that's\nA tough question because obviously it depends on what people want to see and I can't really say that people will be set aside without knowing exactly what people want to see\nUm I Would think of some policy matter you'd want to see you know somebody who for example is very honest and their tax filing because that goes to the character of a person let's make sure that you first dude filed returns did pay taxes and paid more or less the right amount of tax\nBut it gives President Trump for example took a big loss on real estate in one year and didn't pay taxes for ten years after that that would be as he's been saying legal it may not look good to some but it also might not prove anything that people don't already know about him\nSo I agree with that I mean what I've been thinking about more as in terms of character is simply complying with the law but I think another area that would be\nFairly obvious to me would be the possibility of conflicts of interest we know that\nThe president has a lot of authority to undertake various ah relationships on behalf of the country and the question is what are the decisions and is there some personal or business interest on the part of some of the decision making going on I Would think that would be a very legitimate inquiry on the part of\nI Would think that would be a very legitimate inquiry on the part of a number of people and the public and if they wanted to know that well that would be something that might come out from an examination returns\nAnd I would add one more thing which is whether he actually made as much money as he said he he did what we would find that out in terms of his yearly income yeah although I think\nThat you know you need to be a little cautious about that because of tax return typically doesn't really show the amount of income the way you and I might or the ... member but the public might think of that is you know how rich you are and how much and so forth\nBecause a lot of that income of that sort doesn't actually translate into taxable income and so uh the return may not really show I mean it may show are relatively modest amount of taxable income and in fact as you say it may show little or no taxes paid", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city":

I I guess the thing is what do you see and and I and really it's the idea of for one day why don't we stop looking down\nBecause so many times when we walk around the world we're not looking out we're not connected we're looking down at our mobile devices were looking down at our feet\nLet's start looking up and be more expensive if we're in a city and we have light pollution at night we're still seeing something we're still seeing the buildings were saying what people are we're even seeing our impact\nOn this planet\nSo we want to know what you what that makes you feel you know what we're trying to do and I know a because I'm an astronaut people said we're always talking about stars riding but it's really about our planet when I was up in space\nI saw the earth when it was a day and I saw the earth when it was night and each time there's this then shimmering layer of light that is our atmosphere it's this planet that warms us in cools us and enveloped with all we need\nWhat we have to do is recognize that our home is on this planet and then while we're connected to the greater universe which I'm very much felt I felt like I Belong to this\nFirst which I very much felt I felt like I Belong to this universe I also belong to this planet and we have to figure out how to share it we have to figure out that we're earthlings\nSo it sounds like the the words you're not using here but you're implying is you want people to pay attention to climate change [noise] well\nI Want people to pay attention to climate change pollution but to war because here's the thing\nToday we have these incredible technologies to address so many problems we have so much knowledge but we don't use them\nAt least effectively because I don't think that we really see ourselves as connected than we really don't see that what I Do\nIn my country in my backyard has any impact on this planet so yes climate change but also a huge amount of plastic right the size of the state of Texas in the Indian Ocean the fact that we have enough energy\nAnd we grow enough food to feed everyone on this planet yet we wasted and at the same time whenever there's a hurricane when there's a disaster\nWe really care about each other but that carried only happens when we're come face to face that\nI can see someone simultaneously on the other side of the earth and so we want to do this in a fashion where people have an opportunity to look up to the sky something that's common to all of us look up and just say what do you feel when that happens\nI think a lot of of human about astronaut like you and think that you have a different view of\nAnd think that you have a different view of space because you've been there but what I'm getting from you now as you also have a ... view of earth that's the only a handful of people have\nNo I actually have\nA view of earth that I think we all can have that view of earth is what happened when I was a little kid when I used to look up\nAnd and imagine that some child on the other side of the earth was looking at the same thing I was looking at and I wonder what this was like and so it felt really really comfortable it felt really good to me to know that we were connected that way\nWe were calling the ... that we have that's completely free we're calling it\nA ... ... is a sky selfie and that sort of like our connection between the sky you know humanity and the universe all in one\nOkay well we have you and and again people can go to our website here now dot org and learn more about what what you want them to do in terms of uh this app sky fee but I just want to ask you a couple of questions why we have you because you you were in space you're the principle of the one hundred years starship project which seeks to enable interstellar human space flight by Twenty one twelve\nOr do you think that we're going to need to leave the earth in the next hundred years\n[noise] so let's I when I hear your starship is about making sure the capabilities for human interstellar flight exist within a hundred years and it's really about radical innovation pushing our knowledge pushing the uh the technologies and our capabilities in terms of energy in terms of\nOf governance in terms of you know\nIt is in terms of you know human biology and health and using something that's really difficult like interstellar flight to do it but here's the thing we will not if we don't figure out how to live on this planet\nWe can forget about anything and even if we're able to get five hundred people on Mars what five hundred people are we going to send right right who gets to decide\nI Would rather us understand and make sure that we're keeping this planet welding counting on a plan B now what's fascinating and what's incredible about space exploration is it is really change fundamentally how we see ourselves we know so much more about our planet\nThrough being able to look back down at our planet from satellites we know more about the earth because we've been able to study Venus we've been able to study Mars and understand how planets form in what could happen to them yet at the same time the balance that we have\nIs taking that knowledge that we live on a planet we live on our own space ship\nAnd the only thing that's happening is we have to figure out ... as a crew how to live together that means that we don't foul our planet through\nPollution but we only do that if I understand that what I Do changes what happens to other people that we understand that we have to live on this planet in our behavior makes a difference [noise]\nThird now are a number or a small number but a number of African American women who have gone to dispose\nYou'll always be the first ... what does that mean to you\nWhat does that mean to you [noise] so ... it was really interesting to me because not only was the first African American woman but I was the first woman of color in the entire world to go up into space and\nIt's a little girl growing up on the Southside of Chicago there is no way that I Would have imagined that by the time I got old enough to go into space that I Would be the first anything [laughter] because I would've thought that we would have had lots and lots of other people going up\nBut being that being the the first one was called her in the world is going to say what I realized that my responsibility is including other people\nBoth in yes being space explorers whether it's being the the rocket scientist to suit technicians you know are being a crew members to involve them in space exploration\nYet even as important is making sure that we understand that individuals on this planet have a right to be involved with space exploration that they understand the impact\nOf this technology and how profound it can be to help us build a better world do you want to go back into space again [noise] [noise] well you know what we're in space right now\nC O on your smartphone and K.

R. dot org go check it out\nFrom NPR's WB you are I'm young I'm Jeremy hops and it's here and now secretary of state Mike Pompeo said this morning that he wants to give the Saudis more time to finish investigating the disappearance of Saudi journalist ... before the United states decides how to respond\nWell I think it's important for us all to remember too aware of any long since Nineteen thirty two over long strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nTo continue to be important ... reporter or they have custody of the two holy sites other and important strategic alliance of the United states we need to be mindful of that as well\nThe United states also has important ...\nAll of that as well the United states also has important economic ties to Saudi Arabia and joining us now to talk about that is Robyn fires that host of the podcast full disclosure Robin let's start with oil how much oil does the U.S imports from Saudi Arabia\nBut that's about Thirteen million dollars of imported Saudi oil and that's a now about four percent of the dollar amount consumed it's actually not that much when you consider all of the developments in the U.S shale patch this game has completely changed over ten years\nAnd what about us government bonds we've been hearing in recent days that the Saudis own a lot there one of the biggest foreign buyers of us treasuries\nYeah look it was last clocked at a hundred and sixty five billion dollars of US government debt this summer which sounds like a lot but then you look at the likes of China and Japan which have more than a trillion dollars each\nFees are the two biggest foreign holders of U.S government's securities they could if they wanted kind of hold us hostage on that but it cuts both ways the Saudis\nThey really can't do it a oil shipments our dollar denominated for the most part they need a stable dollar they are very threatened by too strong a dollar so it's a situation where you really have to put it in perspective\nAnother important part of the relationship that has come up is arms or the president of the United states has mentioned that the Saudis by billions of dollars\nOf arms from the U.S he says a hundred and ten billion that number is disputed but then we heard this from a a fan of President Trump's evangelist Pat Robertson who spoke earlier this week on the seven hundred club\nRather an arm of the everybody on a piece of is like one of the hunter Nineteen billion dollars is huge and they only have a lot of jobs and I don't think you know a lot of money coming to our coffers and uh it's not something\nOur coffers and uh it's not something you want to blow up willy nilly\nSo Pat Robertson they're telling President Trump maybe not to go too tough on the Saudis if it is found that they have something to do with a ... death\nSaudi Arabia is still counts for less than one percent of the United states international trade through this summer and when you look at arm's UC that hundred billion dollar figure bandied about it's actually three point two billion dollars of defense exports I think the president and the secretary of state to kind of want to secure this great relationship and that\nTrump went to Riyadh he posted the Saudi prince here and you have these enormous sales and that stuff that he could sell to defense contractors in a in a midterm election year in reality the numbers are far smaller on an annual wise basis\nOne other thing I Want to ask you about is the tech industry uh we we were hearing that Hoover has a big investment from Saudi Arabia we remember that when Iran mosque famously said he was going to take a Tesla\n\nFunding for here and now comes from W.

power could be out for weeks and we're learning how far inland the storm reached some of the Tadic Rodney and Jason is emergency management director in Jackson County Florida he's in Mariana\nWhere there was three deaths\nAnd Rodney a year in our north inland from the Gulf Coast what happened where you are\nWhere there were three ... and ... a year in our north inland from the Gulf Coast what happened when you are\nRight we we took a direct hit the when it hit us it was ... at a high cat threes low cat for which is somewhat unusual for inland hurricanes but this is becoming the norm although a lot of places and people will realize that they're stolen does affect people that deep inland\nAnd when you've got a storm of this magnitude and moving as fast as it did it held together a lot better and that's why we got such an impact\nWell and the impact included you land and you're home run hit\nYes it was it was a heavily damaged and pretty much it it it is destroyed the the structure stood the house basically over pressurized and blue part on my roof off and we're hoping to get some some adjusted today\nYou know well I'm Sorry to hear about that but we know you're you're in good company they're just give us a thumbnail of what Mariana looks and feels like\nIt does look like a you know I have a I spent Twenty one years in the military and it it's the damage is it just off the scales bath and buildings down almost every tree has been affected snapped off halfway up and it's a landscape I've never seen people coming back that have used to live here and come back so they don't even recognize a town well\nThe county appraiser Carlin he can't tell the Tampa Bay to be in that she's guessing that Ninety percent Ninety percent of the homes and businesses in the whole county ... county we damage she's using actual an aerial pictures that you sent\nA sense that we ... we had a\nCrew go out and take a look and they gave us estimation that approximately five hundred and eighty two structures that they were able to look at were severely damaged four hundred plus are completely destroy so you're looking at a thousand structures have been just damaged or destroyed\nOr with Gulf Power spokesperson said this to restore that you're heading to rebuild the entire electrical grid and we understand is a patchwork on city and a cooperative utilities and then after big storms in two thousand five and\nCity and a cooperative utilities\nAnd then after big storms in two thousand five and six utilities were tone do more to be turning improve the power lines me you know maybe I'm put some of them underground to prepare for these storms do you think there was a failure to do that or do you think anything could have been done\nRight I can say personally and professionally that the power companies did everything they could do I can tell you on a critically they do an unbelievably awesome and difficult job\nAnd they have had very aggressive programs to bring back those trees to upgrade the grid and I see people putting power lines underground and yes that is is a good idea but it also causes his own unique issues when you do that but no the power companies have been I mean I can tell you have done it absolutely awesome job upgrading thing\nOh what are some of these issues because I I think we heard in one report that horizon is out in one area but it's because they're underground cables were affected\nAnd that's happened because people don't realize fiber does ruin the twin towers and our biggest problem with that was that the towers stood the cables stood is just they were so much to breed though they could not get back to ensure the propane tanks refill for the generator so the generators stopped and so they were not transmitting\nNow you've got the personal here but also the professional what do you think should happen a measure to improve communications among the utility companies and another to find a study on storm response failed in the state legislature and twenty Seventeen\nDo you think the state needs to get back to you know some form of high level of emergency convening on what to do going forward\nWe're looking at an infrastructure in this country that is fifty some of it's a hundred years old we need to take a very hard and fast look at all are critical infrastructure issue we've got to do to fix it\nLike asking Romney just briefly um does Iran have to be more of an acknowledgement that that something is happening because of climate change\nI I don't know if it was so much climate change\nYou meant that that something is happening because of climate change\nIs she'll which climate change is it is just a natural process that occurs over the years\nYou don't think this is I mean you're looking at an hour inland from the coast ... a town\nWiped out and you know every scientist worth their mental saying that uh this is a direct result of warming waters\nAnd and I'm I'm sure there might be some issues with that but I'll be honest with me in my level there's not a course of climate change is a question of changing the climate of people getting ready for these things and I can almost guarantee you this will change the climate of my community and the attitude of those in this area\nWell uh Rodney and reason there in Jackson County and Mariana Florida we wish you the best\nCase thank you very much [noise]\nWell parts of the country are lucky enough to be in Paris season so we want to take a closer look with here now resident Jeff ... who is in the studio Hi Hi Robyn you don't have to say I'm One of those people I Love\nPears I think they are an art form I have ... cookbooks pictures of pairs\nAnd all I Do use them and salads we blue cheese okay well your whole pair world is about to get blown out of the park and I say so I Love writing okay well\nThe most common one that we see in grocery stores is that on Jew or mans you um there is a red and you and then there's also a bright green one which is kind of an egg shape\nThey tend to be soft juicy they're great Rob they hold up to poaching and baking as well and you're going to find as I describe these that\nIt's an incredibly versatile fruit most or all of them can be cooked as well as eaten raw and they are somewhat if not completely interchangeable how dark brown ones that seem to have a tougher skinned okay so that's called an Asian\nDark brown ones that seem to have a tougher skinned okay so that's called an Asian pair and I went up for you right there they are very crunchy very tart sweet also these are best eaten raw to me and Asian pair tastes like\nPair and meeting with a water chestnut and it's got that wonderful crunch and a little bit of juicing is and wonderful and salads wonderful graded also Bartlett another very common for a ride him very sweet red and green as well\nThey are ... they are wonderful texture for poaching what I Love about them is they retain their shape when you cook them\nThere's also boss pairs same deal very earthy flavor and ... parents have any long gated neck which is really fun because when you poach them it has this elegant long to talk about the poached because we have when we did it seems so hard\nI'm really glad you said that because I\nAm going to absolutely show you how wrong you are okay All right here's what I did read ... I peeled the pair but I kept the stem on yeah okay I peeled it okay with me and they can make it ... I took a couple of sugar ... and a couple of white wine and two cups of water and I boil them ...\nI could add a cinnamon stick I could add some fresh ginger to that\nI let it cook down that's called the simple syrup mhm\nI place my naked as you call them pairs into the syrup\nAnd I let them cook for about twenty five to thirty minutes and what happens is the parent releases its Jews into the syrup\nAnd the pair than cooks in this week delicious ginger syrup it can be made well ahead of time it keeps in the syrup\nIt can be made well ahead of time it keeps in the syrup you can eat that for breakfast and you could eat that as part of a salad but you certainly could serve that for dessert you don't need whipped cream it's healthy it's light and I think it's so refreshing\nLine right now but the other thing about Paris is that they swing both ways they're savory and they're also clearly sweet so I made a savory salad that's a little bit different than a normal pear salad I took 'em in this case I Believe I use\nA Bartlett pair my peel did I put a tiny bit of olive oil salt and pepper on it and I roasted it in little wedges and\nThen I have fresh spinach and fall greens\nAnd I put my roasted pear around it and I took some French bread or bad get toasted in thin slices and spread blue cheese on top\nAnd I ... in a little bit of maple syrup so you have crunchy green tart\nPungent from the blue cheese and sweet and voluptuous from the pairs and the phone oh and there's also sun dried cranberries seasonal specialty in the vein of grad okay we have this what is this\nThis is an upside down ... that you probably heard of upside down pineapple cake and it's very similar I used to variety I use comments I use a um\nFor a rally pair which are smallish that means trout in German and it's got a wonderful from heart flavor and then I also use the boss pair so I melted some butter and brown sugar and let that cook\n[noise]\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

Corrine maybe not a household name but some think it should be and that's where we turn for this week's DJ session a ba Corrine edition [noise]\n... is host of plastic mornings on W. I. O. L. in Urbana, Illinois Dick welcome back Jeremy it's great to be back thank you and you wanted us to start with the menu at from the string quintet in eat major this is played by the Smithsonian Chamber Players [noise]\n\n\n[noise] very\nFamiliar tune that this was actually made famous by the Nineteen fifty five movie the lady killers about a group of these that rent an apartment from a widow in London and they say they're a string quartet that just want to use the room to practice or this is a song that they play I've heard this and a lot of movies since that tell us about it\nIf anybody has ever said they haven't heard anything of Luigi ... have in the day throughout his peace and in our time it became famous in the Nineteen fifties in that film but I understand that in the late Nineteen century\nThat they were arrangements that were made this piece went viral and it's time you could say there were range means for\nA Mandel lesions for piano for saxophone for ... choir with a Latin text added so this piece has been popular will before Nineteen fifty five and the fun thing about the lady killers and the use in the film\nThis is a word that's written for a string quartet to violins viola cello was an additional cello no there is a joke about the film it's either an error in the film or it's an additional joking that these crooks pose as a string quintet with an additional viola\nAnd not with a cello so somebody should have been on to this and that those guys are walking around without a second cellist\nYou know the other film that it's in one of my favorites is Ferris pillars day off this is what they play when they go into the fancy restaurant in Chicago I Try to get in [laughter]\nWhether or not supposed to be but it's it's been in a lot uh I Wonder was it actually too\nTo be but it's it's been in a lot uh I Wonder was it actually to another version of the same piece this is the saint Paul chamber orchestra with Bobby McFerrin conducting an on vocals [noise]\n[noise]\n\nYou know when I said Bobby McFerrin on vocals I was waiting to find out what that meant exactly but there you have it he's not singing necessarily but he is a humming along to the to the tin\nBobby McFerrin is being Bobby ... and I think it's a fascinating arrangement other for our time if you like this piece you should know that Luigi ... wrote over a hundred string quintet this is one simple minuet from one quintet so there's a lot more there to explore\nHe was writing these for the younger brother of the Spanish king dome release and while he was doing it he was writing string quartets for royalty and playing the additional channels himself so he was doing this so that he could play along with them and then he would also right\nStream queen tests for depression king who was a cellist so he had a lot of opportunities to write to stream queen tests and string quartets in addition to other cheaper music [noise]\nWhat do we know about what influenced\nAnd the other cheaper music what do we know about what influenced Corrine who influenced him\nWhen he was a cellist early on he learned the cello he also learn singing his father was a double bass player he and his father were playing in orchestras and you realize city couldn't\nMake a living just by being a cello virtuoso that you had to compose music so he began to compose music\nAnd he ends up getting very wealthy patrons who demand a certain kinds of music and that seemed to influence he's writing chamber music rather than say a president at the time\nWell let's get to another offer ... and this is the cello concerto in gene major performed by the Canadian ... orchestra and on her bills ... on the cello dusted by Jean\nWhat the ... or something you have to admire\nThis it's it's a lot of playing and then the can sure does there's a lot of\nIt's it's a lot of playing and then they can sure does there's a lot of virtue wash stick writing as well and I think those two things sort of defined bill Corrine in many ways that he was a virtuoso and wrote\nParts for a cellist in his country or does and he's also known for having been gifted in writing melodies kind of wonder if he if he would have ever written more than a couple of operas that he wrote late in his life whether he would have been a great opera composer but here we get both sides of them in a in the cello concerto is\nOkay now to one of his symphonies this is the symphony number three in gene major played by the London Mozart players [noise]\nOr\n\n\nOne of the things that I hear they're at that this was obviously recorded in a big hall or which I Love that you can tell that by listening there but what do you hear that tells you something is a book or in a piece\nYou can hear again this gift for metal and he's writing this in a symphony heightened was writing symphonies at the time it's been suggested that book read was sued detail oriented that maybe he didn't have\nAn ear for the architecture of a full symphony or if it's funny there's a contemporary book greedy violinist composer ... ...\nTemporary book greedy violinist composer ... ... and his famous lined\nThat if the almighty wish to speak through music it would be that of heightened if the almighty wish to listen to music we'd be data book read and book really had that gift for melody and had the gift for the detail and you can hear that just in this a portion of the symphony number three by ... why\nDo you think then that he is not as well known as Mozart Beethoven Chopin Tchaikovsky and others\nIt could be that most of his music is cheaper music\nAnd I would say that the appeal of chamber music is not as great as see the appeal\nFor orchestral music and it's not that he didn't write orchestral music and I think it's becoming a little bit better known but I think compared to those other composers or there isn't as much of it I think that's one of the reasons why it's not as popular in our time", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Reno", "day": "18", "locations": [["Boston", 42.35843, -71.05977], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Saudi Arabia", 25.0, 45.0],

in in America a history hungry it's banned welcome to hear now like you and I want to start with just what's going on right now what everybody's paying attention to which is what do you think is going on in the stock market at the moment\nA dollar more sellers and buyers strong [laughter] that was the question of more seriously uh it's essentially the movement of long term interest rates moving higher\nAnd concurrently the wage rights are being pressured but mainly interest rates and it's creating this a fairly significant adjustment a it's a typical not unexpected\nBut whenever you get to the spread between the five year treasury note on the thirty year bond opening up which is what has happened you have a significant impact on stock prices\nBut this is not a big surprise to anybody that the fed has been saying for a long time that that interest rates were eventually going to go back up again why do you think the market is reacting like this\nWell I think it's basically the combination of not what the fed is doing\nWhich remember the short term interest rates and it's what the market itself is doing\nFor the ten year treasury note and say the thirty year treasury bond they've moved up significantly and that's where the major business decisions are determined\nOut at the scale of other when it's ten years Fifteen Years out not overnight which is largely whatever comes from\nIs there anything that the ...\nIt comes from\nIs there anything that the government can do um about this either through monetary policy or a fiscal policy or should they do anything or just let things happen as they do\nWell we're in the process of adjustment and we've had interest rates in this country at the lowest level in American history\nWithout coming out of it and gradually adjusting\nSo long as long term interest rates were just I said is a critical factor continue to rise the pressure was going to be down would on stock prices but it's very difficult to say where it goes from here because the pundits have been right half the time\nAnd President Trump has been saying that interest rates should stay low that the fed is moving too quickly\n[noise] uh\nWas in the

coming down from Georgia and it being battled over legal race\nPretty much what we had what we have here it is big industry and go but not really taking care of us down here and you know kind of like I got a buddy lives in Georgia this this\nAnd you know kind of like I got a buddy lives in Georgia that says the rain that falls in Georgia, Georgia water but then when they get too much crime they send it to ... down the river and I know that people have land is going to have water to drink and they will but\nUh they should have thought about this for years ago\nBefore I let them get as big as they are you know I mean that all men Tommy ... for about four hundred acres of ... and we spent tons of money about six years ago to you know when our lease but with the water we got coming down

that there's\nDefeat going on here so funny we're walking overly stuffed shells as we now\nI'm looking out on this day it looks gorgeous can we describe what what is the grass it's over there just got really healthy marsh is throughout the outlets Kobe that one of the protective factors in terms of talking about the storm that has come in\nMarshes protect from storm surge flooding so those are going to slow down wind and rain Florida waster population Ninety percent of it was coming from the Appalachian coal a bay ten percent of it nationwide and and that's changed dramatically over the past couple of years the oysters an indicator species right at the Keystone feces\nIf you have a healthy oyster population and the scientists will tell you guess while you're going to find out you've got healthy fishy about healthy\nIt's like you're going to find out you've got healthy fishy about healthy crowds you got healthy shrimp and so when you see this challenge with the oysters guess what you're going to probably find out you got challenges going on with their other parts of your system\nYou're the river keeper you're charged with the keeping of this river just your thoughts about the emotional importance of having a healthy river\nI Would sound very selfish if I was to say I was the only person in love with this river and really get why it is incumbent upon us to protect and take care of it this is the one of a ... place I could rattle off all the special environmental ecological designations for you\nBut you can just walk around town and talk to people and ask them what the river may mean to them and you will get\nYou will get many stories of why people love this place that are fiercely protective of it\nAnd they include scientists and researchers say\nWe've retreated to deliver keepers office a boat you had to be called off the bat whether Dr Felicia Komen director of Florida state's coast and we love her colleague Dr Sondra brook\nAnd write ogles recently retired from the state's department of environmental protection join us I start by asking Dr column and that question we started with why do we care about this\nI'd say the most spectacular fishery collapses have occurred worldwide on rivers that have had tremendous re diversion of water because that that water bringing all his nutrients is not coming down into the selling aided water and coming down anymore such a really important component\nComing down anymore such a really important component I think that's overlooked\nWell and talk more about that Dr brook because it's not just that it's encouraging the fish growth it's discouraging the growth of the creatures that might pray on things like well he's just like the conch which like the salty water\nYes when the balance of salt and fresh changes then different things happen the problem with soldiers that encourages these marine credited such an oyster drills and ground called\nAbout these oyster drills that sounds like a horror film ducked Dr ... tell us more they latch onto the oysters and they like that come out\nA sit down on an oyster and then all of a sudden they always to his this scrape scrape scrape and eventually they'll scrape through the shelves and tickets for buses in and basically consume the always to from within and there's not a whole lot they always to can do about it it is rather horrific\nCan check it out on YouTube it's [laughter]\nIt's like a bad movie what else can be done I think some people wonder why the bay wasn't just shut down so that it could replenish\nStart with the day and\nA an ecosystem because if we don't address the problems with the ecosystem if\nWe're constantly reacting one of the things that happened\nIn the wake of the oil spill was at a fisherman were allowed to go out and harvest all the oysters and the fear was that the spill would come in and kill the shows in a couple of years later and there was no brood stock left there to re populated I think about the function the set oysters surfaces beyond ...\nSurface is beyond the economics like clean water but they also offer refuge for a number of juvenile species that live inside the crevices\nThey help protect it from storm surge you can't have this industry without that resource you can't have good sea grass beds without that the oyster resource you can't have high water quality you've got to restore all those things\nBut you have to do it in a deliberate fashion\nOne of the problems with the bay over the last few decades has been\nReaction reaction to the oil spill reaction to a water flow planting a coach out there and if that\nPaul ... is the only stir shell what they larval oysters settled on but distributing it without a plan you might as well be casting it all into the when what\nWould you recommend I mean we haven't even mentioned climate change and the drought that have been a part of the fresh water coming in from the river drying up ... you say it has to be deliberate what does it have to be\nTheir particular types of research that can be done that could\nRelatively quickly and the next couple of years make some very good decisions about how we restore the bay the fisherman really understand what's needed but they want their livelihood restored so there's a tendency to go for whatever looks like the quickest fix closing the best probably not a terrible idea\nI think you would find fishermen that fully support that will do to Brooke ... research and really committed effort instead of throwing short term\nCommitted effort instead of throwing short term solutions what about in desalination plant I think\nThey're up more problems in the bay unjust salinity you know they had the drought back in two thousand seven and nine and since then we've had decent rainfall but they always just haven't come back\nIt's usually want a system crashes it's not just one thing but there are also other factors in play you know the the ... they're not as high as they used to be we don't know where the lobby\nOf coming from or what does the ... the bay looked like you know how much of the coach sits where it is it's all these questions that will help us\nFigure out a way of making a comeback\nHe this is so interesting because after Sandy we did a lot of reporting on people who wanted to bring the oyster beds back to New York harbor it used to be filled with ... as a barrier against that storm coming in you know pass a statue of liberty is a solution aquaculture and we're all shaking your head to know\nYour environment window where it's not

those seem commerce faceless to us\nDo you think will figure out who's doing this I'm\nSure that we will what I've done from law enforcement and the past is a really research pipe bombs I've shot a hundred and thirty pipe bombs are looking at how they've fragment looking at how little material you can put in them to get a true destination\nUm the fragmentation study really was if we could decide what had been in it if it had already exploded now in this case law enforcement is fortunate because they haven't tacked devices and nobody was hurt\nSo there's tons of evidence I think they'll be resolving this rather quickly\nWhat does it tell you that none of these so far have exploded\n\nFunding for here and now comes from WVU are Boston and carbon night offering secure data protection solutions for growing businesses including automatic back up for servers and computers I availability and disaster recovery solutions and automated data migration learn more carbon I dot com\nIt's here now\nMore carbon I dot com\nIt's here now and we're in Florida head of the midterms and also after hurricane Michael cut an unbelievable ... through the Florida Panhandle in the northwest part of the state just truly unbelievable to see a looming crisis homelessness\nFEMA and aid groups like the American Red Cross providing temporary shelter but then what especially for the poor and low income\nWhere we can McCarthy is a senior news producer with W F F you and me and I know you and your colleagues have been really pulling at this threat is quite a story\nMichael ... fold more than two weeks ago but so many people still displaced do we know how many\nRight when we last spoke with FEMA they told me there are more than a thousand people in shelters at this point and of course we know that not everyone who was displaced by the storm are are those people in the shelter so we can imagine that that number is much greater than not you know thousand or so people will\nSomebody with family or friends or in cars uh your colleague Lynn had her spoke with tons of Denise Graham she was a victim from a low income housing project in Panama City because of the storm damage was listen\nWe want to make\nMoney [laughter] [laughter]\nWillingly life [laughter] I don't know what I Want [laughter]\nAny more\nSo you multiply her I'm sure by many and she has been approved for FEMA rental assistance we forget about it I mean she was in low income housing but there are all these renters who don't have any recourse she got to see ... rental assistance and his waiting on a check\nTo see ... rental assistance and his waiting on a check 'em but but then what I mean where she's supposed to she can find housing but we're supposed to find housing\nRight that's that's the difficult thing is that there aren't a lot of places available right now for housing and FEMA\nHas made some hotels available on their their vouchers said that you can use to stay these hotels but many of them are outside of the hardest hit areas so people have to have transportation to get there really there's about twenty that are accepting those ...\nAnd did you say you know trailers are on the way people think about those FEMA trailers\nBut there seems to be a you know some slow down in the process they say they need to work with local governments they can't just come in there and say here we come we're putting these trailers here the local governments need to ask for it and of course those local governments are are still putting themselves back together and so I think that's why we're seen sort of this slow response and\nThey're also shelter is of course yeah ... well a and by the way\nWe see FEMA people all over the place in their boots teachers they're working very hard you spoke with Michelle chestnut though she was staying in a shelter in a local high school and just when I listen to how\nWe say we're in charge and maybe it was just like all the windows busted out back\nAll the trees come down and landed right beside the church though you know I'm I'm a at her house was destroyed a brother in law does houses destroyed you know a lot of wealth or home\nWell so first of all clarify for us because driving around this has driven home or in the panhandle people might be picturing in Miami Beach and thinking these are second homes are beach homes not\nThis is a part of Florida where we have a lot more rural people a lot more low income people and so these is there even people who maybe don't have any insurance on their homes they are homes that have been handed down\nWho maybe don't have any insurance on their homes they are homes that have been handed down for generations and so since they have no mortgage and they really don't have room in their budget for insurance they don't have health insurance which will make this recovery even more difficult they don't have that way chipped to begin rebuilding their homes\nWill and rebuilding was what because with so many things down a incomes have been cut another big challenge is joblessness that's looming 'em and you heard from ... or Walmart manager in Mariana who said people are showing up for work even though they have really trying circumstances let's hear\nWe're getting some company called one of them is the ability of loss loss we got here\nAnd so I've got like I've got a system as we call him Dr loss is allowed\nAfter three days he's in here\nThrough smiling and grace is going to just write he has a job that he can recover from and the law says that there's more calls\nWhen he says we got air he means is he conditioning air conditioned right how are people getting by they have no income I think that it's\nTough I'm hearing from people who who are very concerned about eight Gilmore had opened his store and it wasn't open to the public but he was allowing his employees to come in and just help with the cleanup process so that they could get a paycheck many of these people are living paycheck to paycheck there is some unemployment like specifically storm related unemployment assistance available through the state\nBut again that's difficult for is a fisherman who maybe don't have a good way of tracking\nWhat their income has been and so they don't have a good way of applying for that assistance\nWell running water mostly back in some places it's not drinkable communications as we have discovered are still pretty spotty um it's just really I have to say it's just remarkable to see the trees uprooted\nIt's just really I have to say it's just\nRemarkable to see the trees uprooted everywhere even hear it you know inland Tallahassee ruse off high school fifty miles inland it's really a quite humbling a as I say F. S. W. F. as you senior news producer of Reagan McCarthy thanks so much for sharing your appointment I think you\nWould have been talking about housing even those able to return to homes and it's unbelievable again will have pictures that here in our dot org are having trouble hearing those cars Bentley went to the coast and brought back this luck [noise]\nMuch of\nThe area between Mexico beach in Port saint Joe looks like a hurricane went through yesterday not two weeks ago cars in boats are turned on their sides strewn across the street from the bonds homes are split wide open there's debris everywhere but for those able to return to their homes just part of the Florida Panhandle as one big construction sites [noise]\nTroy Bryant's watches as workers tear the shingles off his room [noise] they're they're born all changed I just had the new route but all last September\nBryant and his wife ... bought this beachfront property and moved here from Georgia earlier this year they stayed in a hotel in Mariana Florida during the storm in return two days later to find their new home intact but severely damaged\nWell when I first drove up I thought well that's a you know the garage doors with money but I thought was not so bad [noise]\nOutside to the back door the garage and it opened up and then this is what you're saying here [noise]\nI had a white picket fence that we just built all around the front of the house are part of it in the back part of it in the garage [noise]\nThat house right there\nUsed to be right there\nBrian says that house is forty feet from where you\nBrian says that house it's forty feet\nFrom where it used to be innocent Allen Cronin live a few blocks from the beach they were on vacation in Tennessee when the storm hit and when they came back they found four feet of water swept through the building they also saw whole houses lifted off their foundations and swept into the streets by the storm surge and high when\nThis second lock most album\nHave some sort of damage course they there's was pushed up for it got kind of total you know\nAnd there is a house in the street in front of your house\nCatty corner that block\nAnd stuff when the storm surge came up and started flooding of course and it just ... around\nOf course you'd say our neighbors car wound\nThe Cronin are spending their new retirements repairing their house by hand living at a camp or in their backyard they're determined to stay but Allen Cronin says this area will never be the same\nBase a large percentage of these homes that were owned\nBy grandma grandpa\nGrandma and grandpa was not going to rebuild and your\nGrandma and grandpa squirrel settling\nI keep in mind that a third to half the houses here we're actually built you before Nineteen Seventy they were literally not built to any hurricane go they were built for\nAnd people have lived in them for years\nNow they're not going to live for many more and in five years this will be the same place it was\nLifelong resident Clark downs and his daughter Kimberly downs Norton rode out the storm and carts house\nI was confident on a category one and two but then after I realized it was going to be a three or four it was too late\nAnd likely we will survive today\nAnd luckily we we survive\nToday they are helping their neighbors clear down trees from this yard Clark says Michael was a historic storm\nThere's a history here ah of even when I started school here in in elementary school there's a book called the great time where the city was destroying three pounds one's a far west by yellow fever and wants a tidal wave which was really a hurricane so Ken this is number four combat what he said I just know that people are combat that and I'm Sorry\nYou're already building well yeah I've got three for ... and I've got two people come in to straighten some of the messages out so yeah oh yeah what do you think it really\nHow do you think decisive change or for well I don't think it'll change and I was thinking of a market for all we can say more at the stars at night now [laughter] you know we had so many trees at four in the yard and we couldn't see this ... now and see all the stars that are\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

seem to be serving\nTheir archaeologists under white canopies excavating up hit ten feet wide three feet\nUnder white canopies excavating a pet ten feet wide three feet and millennia deep\nCSP lined up just right to make it work properly\nOr I got a four point seven six to ... were nuts yeah you're on it on okay good good\nI'm Dr Andy ... with your solar research Institute and we are at the edge of a pit that we're excavating dating from modern stuff right at the top all the way down to potentially maybe Fifteen thousand years ago some of the earliest occupation\nNot only in Florida but in the new world wow we're kind of just getting to the the good stuff as we get through the earliest Holocene material and get into the end of the ice age the end of the terminal places the material\nWill be looking at things in the twelve to fourteen and it's like I said as much as Fifteen thousand year old range [noise]\n\nBuckets are lined up shovels gently first class tickets for ... thousands of years that every ... castle exacting work you never know what you might\n[noise] we've been finding stone tools just somebody knock the big flake off it was really sharp on when it so they took a little um a piece of amber or another\nHammer stone perhaps interest sharpened it up a little bit more a drill the tip of broken off of that and we're probably guessing and again in the\nFive six thousand year old range part of today's excitement has been that we had a little lens of charcoal and as we dug it out this morning it started to have some structure to it on Tom said perhaps corn cob it a corn cob shouldn't be in nine thousand year old dirt share but it's conceivable\nSo so that'll be the that will be the excitement this afternoon is removing this little pedestal that's got quite a bit of charcoal in it\nRemoving this little pedestal that's got quite a bit of charcoal in it [noise]\n\nThe scraped material is dumped into the buckets and poured out over what looks like a screen door laying on its side on legs now move over here to have a a screen everybody knows what this looks like it's framed and you're brushing that than through what are you looking

an I'm an ... or an sharpening arrowhead or a projectile points and then make these little tiny flakes\nOkay you sound went down there a larger one larger when it's a half a quarter of an inch long yeah that's a big yeah that's a big one\nHow do you know that's what they were doing that\nThere is there is a man for the call these primitive arts festivals where people are making arrowhead today and this is a Denver ties that is what's on the floor after they get through making a same during appointed except ... this is probably ten thousand years old [noise]\nI just touch something ten thousand you know right this is cool [noise]\nWell that may it wasn't my hand that Dr heading who just wiped out a few hundred years of history with one says oh there's so many ways to mess up here [laughter] [noise] [laughter]\nIt's funny\n[noise] [laughter]\nIt's funny but the reason he slipped may not be\nArtifacts are most beneficial to archaeologists they reveal their story best when they're found where they were left and storms like recent hurricane Michael can disturbed that if you stand in a\nPlace long enough you can feel the same ... you know a little bit and it's caused you know it's no into problems and education's\nDo you think that's the rain as you as you shake your ... with the elements to just now\nIt importantly [laughter] um\nBut these things are thousands of years old so they've been shifted\nSure if they're in place and not currently ... and that's really why we were so very concerned is that we have an open excavation pitted almost a meter deep with soils would have not seen the letter day for the better part a nine thousand years\nWe've we've made it vulnerable and so we covered this with tarps sandbag the whole thing and we we got off awful like\n[noise] and so they continue the work that was started by an angel devoted his life to saving the history beneath Florida soil and found this site when a sewer pipes was laid\nThe original work was done by the then said archaeologist Calvin Jones just along the sidewalk outside the large in Nineteen Ninety four and that's when some of the most important earliest fines were made\nCalvin Jones isn't he the one who got a wheelbarrow of loan delivered to his home and he's the one who realize that there was some ancient tool in that who said wait a second yeah he yeah the Jackson has and he's the one who said wait a second this there is more than dirt is part of this ancient burial site yeah here\nThey had a delivery of dirt and\nA search and within the ... there were\nThat is archaeologist Barbara causes a Florida public archaeology network\nAnd we've traveled to the place where Calvin Jones got his loan and realized it held treasures it's now the lake Jackson mounds archeology state park in Tallahassee a beautiful carpet of lung leading to grass covered hills rise like the facts of green elephants one bigger than the others said\nOkay we walked across that vast lawn and there it is I mean how how high near would you say this ... this is the\nTallest of the southern mountains it is thirty six feet tall these mountains were built basket by basket load of dirt\nAnd let's just backup what exactly is the mound this\nSite is actually part of what's called the southeastern ceremonial complex which is the south eastern regions version of the Mississippi in culture known by many as the mount builders\nOver time they would build these mountains and their leader would live on top of the mountain a hut when that person past they would then be and hurt are buried in the mountains and their home would be burns and then they would cap it off with more soil\nAnd then the next leader with live on top of it so overtime became taller and taller and you can actually see those different layers of soil if you were to kind of cut this mound and half you would see evidence of that you'd see the charcoal from the burn homes you'd see the burials in the mountains\nSplit us climbed the mountain and didn't feel kind of [noise] I don't know you're walking on someone's funeral\nOr is that it's a place that you you have to respect um people lived and died here just\nYou you have to respect um people lived and died here just as we live and die today it's definitely a very respectful kind of foreboding place\nI feel that but we are going to climate stairs to the top of it as a as a leader would've done hundreds of years ago so here we go [noise]\n\nAre there native peoples who are direct descendants of the people who lived here the\nDescendants of the people who live here where the Appalachia Indians that were here during the time of the Spaniards arrival there are still living descendents today most of them live in Louisiana and come over for educational events and things like that\nSo we're not climbing the the wouldn't stairs up\nThe mound um which is covered with wildflowers it's actually quite pretty I Know there's concern about how these ancient sites might have been impacted by what was the third largest hurricane you know in the country's history but I'm thinking since the year one thousand AD\nThese mountains and we're right on top now these now have weathered when did a lot\nYeah I think the biggest danger to the mountains would be trees falling over because they take their root ball with them and with that of course they take part of the mountain and then you have an open place where rainwater can wash away parts of the mountains here we are ready on\nTop of the smell and we have all this growth so the leader of a community would get higher and higher and higher above the people I'm looking now\nOn the big long where they'd all be living this was strategic\nOn the big long where they'd all be living\nThis was strategically placed over here to our east we have a lake Jackson I always tell people when you're looking for archaeological sites you look for your basic needs food water and shelter there are other sites similar to this throughout the south east all the way up through the Mississippi Valley up into Ohio even when they were excavating here at like Jackson\nThey were finding copper brass plates or ... ... it's we don't have proper in Florida\nSo it was evidence of trade with those other places\nUnderstanding this mound when it was excavated there would be a family there was a dog at one point\nThey found women they found one child I Believe he was about eleven years old and yes there was a dog burial\nWhy is it so important is again a thousand to Fifteen
