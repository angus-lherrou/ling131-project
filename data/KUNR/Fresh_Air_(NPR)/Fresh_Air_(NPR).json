I was a Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter who is the author has a book about that movement titled rising out of hatred and focuses on the story at Derek Black Derek ... father\nIt focuses on the story of Derek Black Derek father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan\nCreated the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nDerek was seen as an Arab parents in the movement but here we now says racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties\nIn a few minutes we'll hear an excerpt of the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with Sasha ... this morning\nAnd I says low welcome back to fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program when I heard about the massacre the synagogue I thought about your book\n... black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father done black is still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front he did not pull a trigger the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that but do you find Don black story relevant\nTo the views that were expressed by the shooter Robert Bowers\nI think you can draw a straight line from dawn views and ... work in this movement to the views expressed by the shooter um you know not straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooter spotty yet attached to a fourteen eighty eight am to white nationalist slogans fourteen refers to a fourteen word\nSort of statement of purpose that is central to what storm front does about and it was securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children are in and saying things like I'm here because of the white genocide and I can't stand by and watch my people get\nGet murdered 'em as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language and the motivation that exist on storm front and that's the way that they speak about this a quote unquote race war that they believe is under way\nYou know the um uh ...\nOr that they believe is underway\nYeah the um uh Bowers had had said that um he believe the Jews were committing genocide against his people genocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believe the Jews are committing genocide\nThey do and both Don and Derek were central to the the sort of creation of that language even the term genocide that was one of the main things that Derrick and Don tried to spread and popularized on the radio show and and and the idea behind it was that instead of speaking about uh you know\nMinorities and slurs or things like that that they could appeal to white people by the idea that their race was slowly disappearing and more than that that this was a genocide that somebody else is doing to white people uh you know it's it's\nThat's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting at synagogue\nUm instill in front is the site that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founders son\nSo so what are you reading on storm front now\nAre some really file I'm sort of celebration of what happens ah there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero\nReally vile I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero and racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm front and\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storm front over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that\nWell this probably isn't quite the way to go about it that he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself\nBut our our global is and ah choose who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\nSo you have you spoken with either done or Darren ... since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular and you know and and I think that he's\nHeartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels in small ways culpable and he wanders and you know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism\nPlays into you know incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating the phrase white genocide and to to popular icing on the movement said to then have somebody\nGo into a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio um for years and you're young wife is a I think it's it's haunting\nYou liked slow is the author of smoke rising out of hatred about Jared black swimmer white nationalist whose father Don ... founded the Internet's

fresh air the social media posts and statements made by Robert powers who shot and killed eleven congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nWe're going to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Jared black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we known sing those views when he was twenty two he helped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nBarracks father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm front\nDerek Black is the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli sass low who we heard from earlier in the show my interview with black also included sass low the first question was addressed to Derrick black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national nationalism kind of ...\nThan white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to like it's not that we're better than but we're all better off being separated by by race is like my dad popular everywhere and white nationalism in so that was his thing\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was far it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he found that storm front and called that a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that that was a not\nAbout superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that wasn't what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's is totally irrational I how exactly do you think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nFor a second I've always wanted to know\nThe early people who re branded white supremacy to white nationalism what are they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable or whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism\nReally did believe they were not\nDoing bad things to other people that the uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and maybe unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better\nUm the the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed him\nSir for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race and their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud I'm confident way\nInception was everybody is basically all white people are basically race if they're just afraid to express it so let's give them a language in a safe space\nSo that they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insult toward the latest clans word um\nIs racial an hour ... over the years if you look at the language in terms of how many people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively pursuing in and cause of separating or\nYou know races into into different homeland Sam White supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is so if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguish the movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist\nMuch of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures are based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still effective and useful for us as we talk about it\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick black a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who has since renounced those views and Washington Post reporter Eli ... who wrote a book about black called rising out of hatred we'll hear more after a break and Terry Gross and this is fresh air [noise]\n\nUm I'm\nThen you've

M. C. C. offered educational programs at an affordable cost [noise]\nI'm Talking point about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme that it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kids in the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against that every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire ideology the endpoint the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean you want to separate people have different races into different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea\nThey don't know they don't they have they have no idea at so which I think it's the core issue that and it raises a nebulous thing that's a that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining because\nHe was a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public\nEr and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to are we going to do this or that and one of those with how are we going to define who's white because only a white person can be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to say the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white N's and where something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to as to who is white was that you had a\nGenerally be considered visually white by most people in America and you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're listening to the interview I recruited in September with

father Don black as a former KKK grand wizard and founded the white nationalist website storm front\nWe're also hearing from Washington Post reporter ... the author of a book about Derek Black\nCalled rising out of hatred\nSo Derrick one of the things you did you'd been home schooled so you were pretty isolated from any believes outside of your family is racist views um but then you went to college\nHe's racist views um but then you went to college and from the way you described it in the book was a pretty liberal college in Florida that were Jewish people there you initially tried to hide your identity and then figured you might as well [noise]\nLet people know a before you were ousted by somebody else you placed a magazine [laughter] you must have publication with an article by you in a gym so that people would find it and realize oh God I stared black\nSo after you kind of out of yourself and after having befriended people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were very upset when they found that you really are um you had Jewish friends who reached out to you\nEven had a girlfriend who dated if we didn't initially no was Jewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends said to you\nThat made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nBut I think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and mostly Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew about dinners took the strategy that I think was very very smart\nOf ... are not talking to me about it ah I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up well every this other thing that we were possibly interested in did\nA and I think the Matthews said that the reason for that or was that it\nWould have been a not as effective at allowing me\nTo see him and dinners as people\nThat when my family is talking about\nOr does as people that when my family is talking about something anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or talk about his life and this is very human and he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd that offensive I actually actually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know Jewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYou know I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that the Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermined the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups that are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all of white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where I said this is this is crazy when you to stop attacking Jewish people back off\nIn addition to being the story of Derek transformation I mean I I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on this campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYou know profound change and they did that in a lot of different ways I mean there was a civil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of cast staring out and made it clear to him\nHow how awful and how he'd for and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who ah who won one is trust\nWho ah who won one is trust built a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like point by point went through and and ah and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited to Derrick over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build a relationship hoping that\nJust by spending more and more time with them and he would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes to the people into the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in of itself could be transformative\nAnd I think it's important to note that that did not happen quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the beliefs of this ideology and the things that Derrick had said Matthew in ... in between these dinners would sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site\nAnd they would see the horrible things that he said about Jews and and ... yeah\nUh Jews warm their way into control over our society Jews must go all Jews Moscow and you're in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid of beliefs Jews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe\nThe Jews have propagated a scheme of multiculturalism and are\nAre sort of the number one enemy of what white nationalist with defined as the white race and so ... had also in their own lives experienced large degrees of anti Semitism in ... case he's a from a family of Hungarian\nThe case he's a from a family of Hungarian Jews there was all but wiped out by the Holocaust in Bergen dose and and that was the definitive experience of his\nYoung life was growing up in an orthodox community that was largely defined by\nA by by an an incredible history of anti Semitism and and the Holocaust and ... had had gone and travel to these concentration camps and had had learned German to connect with his father's history\nAnd Derek it also learned German because of his very divergent family history and the fact that the two of them a week after week we're sitting at the same table sometimes having conversations and the Germans they learn because of\nBecause of these incredibly diversion family histories and began to have an effect\nThere's a lot of Holocaust denying within the white nationalist movement can you explain to me how it's possible to believe in the first place that the Holocaust didn't happen it",

and\nSo this McCarthy welcome to fresh air and love you in this new movie so congratulations on it this is a really different role for you you play somebody who is very funny in a caustic sarcastic dinner way\nBut I Want to call in movie a comedy and there there isn't any physical comedy ... in it and you're very no physical comedy so I Know you start in St Vincent an a dramatic role but do you consider this movie a new direction for you [noise]\nI think it's a it's a new direction for how I think most people are used to seeing me I I was in New York for many many years doing um dramatic place so\nI'm quite comfortable and I was kind of think if you you know\nThis was fresh air and if you're just joining us I guess is Melissa McCarthy she's starting in the new movie can you\nEver forgive me which is based on a memoir by Lee Israel who when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you're very famous for as a role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene [laughter] when the bride and the bridesmaids get food poisoning as their ...\nThe bride and the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dressing yet um you know bridesmaids stresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink and your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of a of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross had comedy just as men can and it really wasn't a point of it oh okay no no\nNone of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak did into the film kind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled data and thought we don't want to do this\nGrossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to determine ... more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what are the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of [noise]\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it\nBecause it's weird things like this do happen I said if it's less about gross for gross and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like you have to look at this we were all desperately [noise] even though we were friends with in the movie saying like oh my God\nWe were friends with in the movie saying like oh my God just look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the facts of like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and\nAnd how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIt's interesting to hear you say that 'cause the second half of my question [laughter]\nWhat's going to be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do grows out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality by doing gross out scenes and so you're one of those really interesting 'cause you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but it wasn't intended and it was really\nTalked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for\nBathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible and wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all falling said the wrong thing had some\nShaming thing done and they think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if that particular action hasn't happened to most people\nMelissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for is I'm insults [laughter]\nInsulting no [laughter] I'm not real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know I don't know why are you not [laughter] but but the most famous example of that is and this is forty and there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and lives le mans teenage kid\nYou're a teenage kid and polarizing live le mans teenage kid and it becomes a feud between the three parents and they're all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd the the the other ... couple have threatened you so you're all just kinda going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash that he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do ... you know to know what I said was that we need to keep an extra hour and our kids because with all the technological advances or they need to learn to use them\nResponsibly no no when he when he said to me was he called me a one language Catherine language I mean I can relate to what they do not balls sent to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manager ... next door so\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake Kabul was like there are bank commercial that's what you look like your bank commercial couple none of this talk\nIf productive I Would like to really enjoy my legs and kick you out in the job with my ... bone you're just really scaring me this is what happens when you corner rat you corner me I won't you drew you to certain you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this was forty uh it's just you kind of him and thriving insults in that scene in it just goes on and on with more over the top insult is that something that you're famous for outside like and the real world being able to to do really funny and sold\nSide like in the real world being able to to do really funny and solve no I Know I Do not oh go around insulting people um I Hope ever um\nI don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I got it all out on a screen but [noise]\nYeah one of the first time I watched that back I kept saying I didn't say that [laughter] I never say that\nAnd the first time a sitting with was to sit for watching you say it you said all of it and I I didn't remember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say every anything that came off the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory had you improv insults before\nYes I've had a\n... and only have played a lot of kind of very assertive um characters that you know I think in the heat\nOr especially part of part of the\nPart of the characters DNA was just to literally say anything she used to kind of kind of tear people down and I think kind of try to stand her in her own authority so it was a big part of that character and you're very impressive detective and that very aggressive detective um\nThere is a fun to it I mean I Would never want to do it in real life but it's part of the fun of getting to act you do these things that you would never do your Boulder your harsher\nThings that you would never do your Boulder your heart sure you know you're you're just ripping insults at someone and uh there is a there is a fun to it because hopefully you know you you don't do it in your real life\nMy guess is Melissa

the new movie can you ever forgive me when we left off we were talking about her early stand up comedy career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex is one of my favorite places to perform I just loved it also because you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did a longer time probably better than I did I didn't um\n[noise] it when you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there was this\nComedy club something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nSo he's one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go club to a club like are you actually the same guy [laughter] and it was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like take your\nTop off [laughter] and you're just like what like what\nDoes that ever work for you has any woman ever been like\nMy God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my top off [laughter] like I just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly each other now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting an actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler God\nI don't think it was my favorite I think the more work the more I hated it um it usually would dissolve into some kind of thing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement\nOh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road if like this so surprisingly can get a show of hands for women who\nWho is in crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off like and I would do votes and then talking about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels bad like to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what's the first of all there is no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAt the Oscars if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there a home body there was a comedy club owner like happened is watching thing times oh my God so I Know there's\nThe light oh ... ever present uh not to ever not be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the white men\nI wouldn't flash and it's like ...\nYes and when that light flashes is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know the stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics ...\nWho's ever running the night is also a huge deal to the other comics ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a oh my God it's a really big deal yeah\nAnd the ... other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they are going to get less but the first time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch to my surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booze\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal um applause from the manager kind of I ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great so I kept talking and the light kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I\nI got off to finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me a in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was yeah that I truly didn't know\nSo you don't want to know women who has taken on like producing and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act immaterial\nTo make sure that you can act immaterial that means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles\n[noise] I think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where I don't realize how lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed\nYou know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read were kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant\nI was like I don't know how to play pleasant like ... who who cares there's nothing to think your teeth into it's like the perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't I didn't want to play it I also thought all the people I Love and like are\nFilled with\nQuirks and eccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even dislike people think we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is and so often I I've I felt that everything I read for female character was really blend in and\nOften a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like car all\n[laughter] than I Am still I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and say the guy's name I'm like why doesn't she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun\nIsn't she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why she always a bummer I just ... I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to play this because I don't know why she's doing it\n[noise] I'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement\nWhich you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors\nTheir careers or at least temporarily ended because they were ousted for assaulting Oregon Ratzinger mental behavior yeah try to women so like a as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer a producer has the kind of\nChange and climate been meaningful for you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more empowered and Hollywood now [noise]\nEvery little in ... I Will take every centimeter forward it will take I think the more we talk about it and the fact that is is becoming less acceptable you know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be dismissed you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like me you know boys there has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think is so important about me too it's it's branching out to everyone and it's all women that need help that need money for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and\nI think the more we we linked up and realize their strength and numbers it can't be for the worse\nWhen Melissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on our show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you in your new role and\nComing on our show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you in your new role and can you ever forgive me and let's continue the conversation some other time\n[laughter] I Would love to this has been a just a dream I Love the show so I think so much for having me on\nMelissa McCarthy stars and the new film can you ever forgive me as a writer turned literary forge or\nAfter a break John Powers will review and new BBC series about a police bodyguard assigned to protect a woman politician who may be a terrorist target it drops on Netflix Wednesday this is fresh air\nLeast it's fresh air on K you in our public radio good afternoon [noise]\nEvery night at nine or ... or on the week nights we feature a different program tonight it's reveal [noise]\nAs we approach twenty teens mid term country has its eyes locked on Georgia's governor's race [noise] it's a close contest between Stacey Adams a former state congresswoman who could become the first ever black female governor in America\nAnd Brian Kemp a tougher talking Trump loyalist with a penchant for the second amendment is race has become a battleground for many of America's most pressing concerns about democracy from voters depression to election security at nine pm tonight okay you in our revealed tackle that topic [noise]", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "22", "locations": [["Philadelphia", 39.95233, -75.16379], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Istanbul", 41.01384, 28.94966], ["Turkey", 39.0, 35.0], ["Saudi Arabia", 25.0, 45.0], ["Vermont", 44.00034, -72.74983], ["Milwaukee Wisconsin", 43.0389, -87.90647], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Guatemala Honduras", 14.85646, -92.06622], ["El Salvador", 13.83333, -88.91667], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Alaska", 64.00028, -150.00028], ["Alaska", 64.00028, -150.00028], ["Alaska", 64.00028, -150.00028], ["Alaska", 64.00028, -150.00028], ["Anchorage", 61.21806, -149.90028], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Literary", 18.39467, -67.11324], ["Iraq", 33.0, 44.0], ["St Vincent", 59.93863, 30.31413], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["kinda", 58.01315, 15.73373], ["Kabul", 34.52813, 69.17233], ["Hollywood", 26.0112, -80.14949], ["Georgia", 41.99998, 43.4999], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795]], "not_found": ["Netflix", "u._s", "Netflix", "Netflix"], "ep_coords": ["Reno, NV", 39.52963, -119.8138], "in_country": ["Philadelphia", "Washington", "Vermont", "Milwaukee Wisconsin", "U.S", "U.S", "New York", "Alaska", "Alaska", "Alaska", "Alaska", "Anchorage", "Washington", "New York", "Hollywood", "America", "America"], "out_country": ["Istanbul", "Turkey", "Saudi Arabia", "Mexico", "Guatemala Honduras", "El Salvador", "Israel", "Israel", "Israel", "Israel", "Israel", "Literary", "Iraq", "St Vincent", "kinda", "Kabul", "Georgia"], "in_state": [], "out_state": ["Philadelphia", "Washington", "Istanbul", "Turkey", "Saudi Arabia", "Vermont", "Milwaukee Wisconsin", "Mexico", "Guatemala Honduras", "El Salvador", "U.S", "U.S", "New York", "Alaska", "Alaska", "Alaska", "Alaska", "Anchorage", "Washington", "Israel", "Israel", "Israel", "Israel", "Israel", "Literary", "Iraq", "St Vincent", "New York", "kinda", "Kabul", "Hollywood", "Georgia", "America", "America"]}, {"month": "10", "state": "NV", "station": "KUNR", "content": "You can ask your smart speaker to placate you in are and you can follow kill you in our public radio on social media two o'clock\nFrom WHYY in Philadelphia and Terry Gross with fresh air\nI used to be on the TV show called horsing around Jersey the older applause will held\nToday the creator of Bo jak horsemen ...

episode when the women step forward\nIt really dates the show doesn't it have Charlie Rose be the the voice of sober reason that you know look at bow jak who is such a mess and all of the Rio and unprofessional and Charlie Rose or played in in this clip by patent Oswald is are are straight person in the scene\nAnd uh you know when the allegations against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nBecause it wasn't it was truly oh no Charlie Rose and and all the women that he allegedly targeted a that's terrible but it it it is interesting now to to go back to that first episode and look at it and think about how times have changed\nSo how did you come up with the idea of starting a series with a horse that can talk and walk on two legs and dress and be bitter like a human being and have him be the washed up star of the family sitcom\nWell the idea for the show really started from my friendship with Lisa ... who was a brilliant illustrator and cartoonist and I have been friends with her since high school I\nMean when I was you know in Los Angeles pitching shows around um she was living in\nAnd and oh jak isn't such despair afterwards and feels so responsible he's driving any closes his eyes and nearly drives off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the wheel\nWhere I Would say it's a lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt plausible deniability or he's not actively killing himself but he's\nAllowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a ... maybe minor distinction to us that he is soldiers bonded and despairing but he was willing to do this but not so much that he was going to active we do it himself\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season season five which you wrote is um an unusual episode because it's one long monologue ... mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dementia and low jak does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her so he's at a podium at a Mike her coffins at the side\nAnd he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in his family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was mean to his mother and they were both mean to bow jak [noise]\nI I Want to play a brief part of his eulogy and this is will or not\n... and this is well are not as much jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called horsing around seriously though hold your applause\nWell held it was written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named Sarah Lynn\nAnd it was about these orphans and early on the network had a note maybe don't mention they're orphans so much because audiences tend to find orphans sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they couldn't imagine their parents to be anything they wanted they had something to lung for\nAny way we did this one season finale where Olivia's birth mother comes to town and she was a junkie but she's got her self cleaned up and she was being Olivia's life again and of course she's like a perfect grownup version of Libya and they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted in any way that words tries to want to be careful\nMoms have a way of letting you down but Olivia\nJust thinks the horses jealous and when the mom says she's moving to California Olivia decides to go with her\nAnd the network really juiced the cliffhanger ... gone for good and\nThat of course because it's a TV show should not gone for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and had to go back to rehab facility had hitchhiked all the way home getting rides from Mr T. out in the cast of stop of course that's what happened because what are you going to do is just not handled Libya on this show\nYou can't have happy endings sitcoms not really because if everyone's happy to show it would be over and above all else the show has to keep going there's always more show and you can call horse in around\nThere's always more show and you can call horse in around dumb or bad or unrealistic but there is nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more show\nI guess until there is\nAn assay saying until there isn't he's looking at his mother's cough and you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broken your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that I'm so he he really had a bad relationship with her and when he says early in that clip\nThat um he indeed are are fans because they could imagine their parents any way they wanted to [noise] um what made you think about that well\nYou know I I I think a big part of this episode at a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ... and his relationship with his parents is about\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but it's gone now and will never hurt you again and\nEven in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself and I'm really interested in that idea and that that question of\nYou know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think\nWhat's really interesting for me is the tension between that and to easy forgiveness of public figures right and and I want to believe on a personal level level that nobody is era dean ... or so far gone that they can't find a way to be better and be forgiven\nDawn that they can't find a way to be better and be forgiven and how does that track with me where I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've hurts so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption\nAnd I don't know how to reconcile those two ideas and and that tension for me\nHas been at least a ... a really interesting to explore over the course of this last season but also the show in general\nSo in this era of the me too movement was so many men have so much to apologize for [laughter]\nI'm One of the funny things that you've come up with for the the richer you un the writers is do we forgive you awards you created a whole awards ceremony for people who need to apologize for saying would you describe the ... the ... election\nBut we forgive you rewards as presented on the show are awards that celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a a ... we forgive you award from\nI think for time forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd it one of the sad to slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about how sad it is that our industry is so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men who do awful things and the rate was kind of likes linked back into the limelight and we wanted to satirized that and then over the course of ...\nRight and we wanted to satirized that and then over the course of the last year it started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry\nAnd then just in the last month or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe we'll forgive me\nI don't know maybe this is sadly relevance a new um so it feels like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture\nNews when in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening for years and years what makes you think that people are being forgiving again well\nUh it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers\nAnd I I don't know if we have we forgotten his anti Semitic remarks is homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her is use of of racial slurs\nIn miss defies me in this area that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable\nThat it still feels like we are not you know Louis C K A stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation a there are reports that Garrison Keillor and and Matt Lauer planning their comebacks I think that there is\nWork that those men can be doing to better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do\nCome back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know we think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards\nProfessional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I found it tremendously upsetting\nMy guess is Rafi ... the creator and show runner of the Netflix animated series bull jak horsemen after a break he'll tell us why

S. um sounds a little bit about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so my mother owned a a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob and it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the um bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto and the surrounding area\nAnd so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books\nAnd and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish state school um you know I even after a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt\nA extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never once felt like a minority and the communities that I was in um\nShe would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of minorities that were chips um we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah that's as happy Halloween cause it's missing an end\nHanukkah that says happy Halloween because it's missing an end to have the the misfit toys or Monica um it it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life um and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWas a disconnect between being told about anti Sam ... senators and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated times now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes\nUm and\nIt's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country and they're they have a lot of power and there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage\nUm and that's been very scary to me\nUh but also scary how little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening\nUm especially big some for someone who you know as a Jew hear the story of a Holocaust over and over and over growing up\nAnd the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing right there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who were shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd you know officially one of the Jews who control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kind of feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nThey said it because it's the ... and like I think yeah and I and I would\nSay a couple of years ago to be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember was middle school or high school but somewhere around then\nSo it was a difficult for you to concentrate long enough to to read books\nUm yes or sometimes you know I I I can always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there is something that really interested in me I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took a pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience that I Love making\nThe center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience and I love making people laugh but a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't\nNobody was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize it inappropriate\nYou know like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants inappropriate inappropriate and and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy you're pushing the boundaries I did because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified\nThat oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take\n'em you know or just\nA shouting out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's a ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I I have I Want to say this thing so I'm going to say it\nAnd I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and save the funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a sentence has been a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference when you know the problem with ADHD and other a mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not\nOh you have this thing there for you or this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this precisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas\nDoing this precisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have you know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps in what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat was TV like a safe space for you or you could like unless yourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of\nWhat you were consuming than the natural world and the reason why I ask that is that like there's so many pop culture references and bow jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and they happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them\nUm so it made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nWell TV made sense to me and you know there was a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely\nWas a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate if I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this seem that I was living in\nFeel like the scenes that I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful as being a writer and having an outlet and now if I Am in a situation I think of the funny thing I can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto this and I'll have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or\nAnd I have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think of a funny situation you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or someone came in here and did this I can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment I'll\nI'll get paid for by putting into the story later so having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\n[noise] you know I'm thinking now the comedy central and is running bow jak witches and Netflix series now the comedy central is rain yet starting with season one\nUm what's that like for you because you in retrospect for like some of the jokes and season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter] cable\nYeah you know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks and making under the right time for Comedy Central and you know we're obviously want them to\nKeep their dignity\nAs an up sort of television not edited out anything too important but as we are looking for cuts one of things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or would this scene work without this moment and if it does sometimes we'll take those moments out um but I also think look this is the show and\nIt has to do exist on its own terms and hopefully people you know as they have embraced the show on Netflix will embrace the show on Comedy Central and if there are flaws with it they will see those laws for what they are\nAnd you know we'll see what happens\nWhen it's been great to talk with you thank you so much it is my pleasure thank you so much\n...

this story really dissect that narrative and I think more than anything else offers\nReaders now based on the actual facts um in based on actual documents an entirely new financial narrative the forty for president\nWell let me reintroduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne ... and David ... of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece on a President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans you got from his father the tax evasion schemes the family had\nAnd that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk more about how Donald Trump engaged\nIn suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father after we take a short break this is fresh air [noise]\nHope you're enjoying fresh air on K U and on fresh air

of the three writers who reported just\nA couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how is the self made\nMillionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred Trump Donald's father funneled to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about\nUm ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that he got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlayed that into his into his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws\n[noise] uh we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans low one million I'm In today's dollars of course it's two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million votes\nOn top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct wealth that we saw transferred to Don and what we what we also saw but I think what is important also is that in many cases um these were loans that were never repay aid you know he would take out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to that and he's barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to to Fred Trump to get more money and we saw especially that the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you'd run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream that went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then off being off to the races\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nHe used the money for many of his ventures the how Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support his ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars um in debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars um he was in ...\nNot only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars um he was in debt to his father was going to get his father these very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and end up in debt in a lot of instances instead of making a fortune from its own investments\nIt also see that when his so you know when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety was there to catch them there's one spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and\nYou see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is a time\nIn the you know the back end of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of his companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment\nAnd Fred Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money steering million dollars' worth if it was three and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's will centrally and do well and it was caught a soldier the wheel is taken to Fred Trump's house in December of Nineteen Ninety\nAnd Fred Trump immediately sees this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire and potentially put at risk and ...\nEmpire and potentially put at risk\nAnd Fred Trump immediately says no he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald was the sole executor front Trump's will inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new well is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him that he makes this move it's incredibly dramatic move and scoring to the family what he did\nSo what you're saying I think that at the end of ... life or toward the end of ... live\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bail himself out and Fred Trump Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money over so many years\nWhat we know for sure is that Fred Trump perceived to this is an attempt to put his um to Jane complete control over his state and potentially to use\nThe the the empire that Fred Trump doggedly and patiently built over many decades to use that as far as I'm potentially as collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nI guess or New York times reporters

but have Fred Trump use schemes to avoid paying taxes or transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump\nMeasured in today's dollars Donald received about four hundred Thirteen million\nSo then after ... died Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off\nTrump die Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything that Fred Trump still own at the time of his death why did Donald Trump make that decision so the interesting thing about\nThat sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that for a Trump very much wanted this empire\nTo stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would keep it and I I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nHe sold it in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting and they had regular family meetings after fraud Trump died they would hand out checks you know for Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months\nUm to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a check\nAnd then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell\nAnd quickly assembled a private sale to a developer in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSounds so that the the buildings that were selling all of those buildings ... own at this time of his death out their dos include all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred Trump to the children\nThey included both of buildings that had been transferred down the ones that he owned it was it was pretty much as ... empire and it's sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer and ... and the price tag was just over\nNew York development ... and the price tag was just over seven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the ... the documents that we went through that that sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value at out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that dot empire um was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the deal out of the century that down Donald Trump may it definitely wasn't\nSo if the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the I. R. S.\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with that so it's true that the virus actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact the IRS ours did push back some and especially on the lower valuations they're placed on buildings made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning if him for a million more bucks on that return\nBut the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got an agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families who are the most expensive legal and accounting helping\nThe most expensive legal and accounting helping who engage in these very sophisticated maneuvers to to avoid or evade taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an odd or\nThey're looking though at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just in a state tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art video the art of the comeback or The Apprentice\nAnd tell us what was actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nOn public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David or the comeback [laughter] go for it [noise] [noise]\nOh well so he publishes the art of the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of\nYou know pulling himself up I'm Out of the ... of his casino collapse\nAnd through his grit and determination and Wylie negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book so happens to coincide with the time when the actually\nAnd to coincide with the time when you're actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate\nTax schemes that we describe in the story so at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the bat it actually cause it's perfectly with the moment when he was just taken possession of twenty five percent\nOf this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice in the song money money money money\nThat happened in two thousand and four I'm right is the sale had gone through the the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Fred Trump and yet when you watch not opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that fried Trump built and paid for [noise] I'm Wondering\nHow you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making\nAbilities\nAnd so many people still believe the math and Donald Trump is still putting\nIn that it's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked\nPete it over and over and passed down into history become stocked\nAnd I think that we've ... that I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think the the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents up I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's hard for a few because it's absolutely true in the documents are there in a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for this to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access and who were locked up in this room I'm ... who cleaned it who is allowed to go you know [laughter] we\nUh we did not have the cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come in one day with a with a little vacuum and and [laughter] [laughter] but we uh yeah it was just the three of us for a year um with a yeah it's a pretty messy\nWith a yeah it's a pretty messy\n[laughter] I don't go right but ... and it'll claustrophobic too I Would imagine that other people now are you were locked up in this room [noise] I'm a few people\nKnew our our editors do but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it we are kind of kept to ourselves and uh it was it was difficult everybody you know these people keep asking you what you're up to and [noise] um but we uh we tried to keep a lid on it as best we could\nWell

new book the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball I spoke to soccer club yesterday when the jury in the case was still deliberating\nWell my ... welcome back to fresh air you know any enterprise that generates large sums of money can be beset by corruption how much money does college basketball generate\nWill billions I mean it really depends on how you calculate it but directly to the universities and to the NC double a\nBillions but if you figure in the gambling money and money that's generated by recruiting sites in all these crazy ways you know you're getting into the four or five or six billion dollars a year right and what does the money go\nThe money largely goes to the adults who run the games very little of it goes to the players or the players get the value of their scholarships so if you look at a program like Louisville which is program that I focused on\nThey generate about forty five million dollars a year in revenue they give out Thirteen scholarships that adds up to about four hundred thousand dollars a year the rest of it gets spread out to the coach who makes\nA year the rest of it gets spread out to the coach who makes eight million dollars a year just the assistant coaches who make as much as a half million dollars a year all throughout the athletic department people are making six figure salaries it does not go to the players and what I call the unpaid workforce\nHow big is the NCAA a championship tournament March Madness\nJust about a billion dollars a year goes to the NC double a itself\nWhich is the non profit organization that runs big time college sports\nBut the money that that tournament throws off and all kinds of different directions is where you get into the two or three billion dollars it's the kind of money that pro franchises are are making or generating the differences that they're actually paying the players\nYou're right about the University of Louisville which you say it was kind of a quiet commuter school\nThey're exploited their dealers in human athletic flash and they are trying to get their hooks into kids and get their hooks into families\nAnd get into their inner circles and then to see what's in it for me can I deal this kid to a particular college can I associate him with a particular NBA agent\nAnd this is very much the scene on the grass roots circuit it's known and it's it's part of the background\nAre are there are kids who when they're you know twelve Thirteen fourteen kind of become celebrities kind of think of themselves as a business\nAbsolutely there are there are kids who you know this is their life in one of the things that\nIt's who you know this is their life and one of the things that really struck me when I have been around grassroots basketball is the kids who referred to themselves as being in the business of basketball because that's how it feels to them they may be twelve or Thirteen

contact with you\nWho first make contact with a young player and his family\nThey fly all over the country and there's a lot of pressure on assistant coaches it used to be an assistant college coach was a coach first he taught the game he mentored the young men\nA lot of them now if not most of them are recruiters first and they are charged with bringing the head coach the best players it's sometimes set in college basketball that you win\nIn July and that means you win games by getting the best players from the tournaments the grass roots tournaments in July in Las Vegas and elsewhere but the assistant coaches that's their job get me kids\nThe thinking in\nThe industry and among journalists and many who follow this world is that many of the head coach of say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just bring them to me there are things I don't want to know\nThese assistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep their hard to get back in the business if you lose the job the temptation to cheat is extreme\nI had these kids that are kind of showing their stuff in this amateur basketball kind of network and the street runners sort of pre agents that build relationships and hope to steer them to universities assistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government has charged in this case we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities\nParties to help to lure kids to universities there is another really creepy part of the story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges\n[noise] but then in some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players who are already in college to a certain financial advisor at the St runner has a relationship with what's going on there\nWell that's exactly right and I and I think that's the most insidious part of this\nSo in the federal government's case there have been several assistant coaches charged with taking bribes from these runners or go betweens\nOn the grass roots circuit and the intent of the bribe is to say okay you already have this player he's headed to the pros send them to me I Want to manage his money when he becomes a pro you know put him in my lap [noise]\nAll right so if you're a financial advisor at ... this is what you do and you managed to have ... in some way or another and get an NBA player as your client what's it worth to you\nAnd NBA player over the course of a ten year career can easily make a hundred million dollars or more so\nIf you're an agent and get two or three percent of that salary that adds up to a lot if you have five or ten of those players that adds up to a whole lot if you were quote managing the money of one of these players\nI don't know what that might add up to if you're doing it legit\nI don't know what that might add up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting what a money manager might make there's a lot you're dealing in tens of millions of dollars if I were a future NBA player or I were the family of a future NBA player\nI don't think that I Would necessarily send my kid to somebody who specializes in managing the money of sports stars\nBut there is an ecosystem of people who serve professional athletes manage their money or if you get traded their specialists who will set you up in a new city they will go to\nPrivate schools and figure out what private school your child should go to they will find you designer for your new house and an interior designer so sports is a very insular business and\nA lot of the players want to deal with known quantities and part of this is there's the money manager he manages NBA players money so the game is to become one of those guys and then they have one of these go betweens set you up with a with players\nMichael ... new book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption

scandal in college basketball\nLast year a federal grand jury charged ten men in the case and the first three to be tried convicted yesterday Pitino was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal\nWhen these federal indictments were announced a year ago\nScandal when these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news or people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on\nThey absolutely were not shocked\nWhat the FBI did was put names and faces to what\nMany people had assumed or knew was going on but there was an element of shock and what that was was that the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing\nParents and coaches and players into interrogation rooms as opposed to the NC double a if you're in college basketball\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double a it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be visited by the FBI and maybe looking at prison time that was a shock\n... and has it had a major effect on college basketball program some in Louisville certainly was turned upside down they lost their coach what about others\nI think overall it is not yet had a big impact on college basketball\nYou know I mentioned that they do well in a fantasy land and part of that just involves putting your head in the sand so one of the most prominent coaches in college basketball the legendary Mike ... coach K of Duke which is quoted as saying\nThis is a blip this is nothing you know this trial is nothing um it's a small sliver of what really goes on well nobody\nSmall sliver of what really goes on well nobody believes that but the fact that coach K set it gives you an indication of the sort of institutional reaction\nTo what has gone on and a determination to sort of try to get past this without really changing anything\nYou know you're right that the question in the criminal case is whether this conduct violated federal criminal statutes but what what's really at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of the whole structure of college sports explain what you mean\nOf sports does not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars\nAnd it doesn't pay and at a certain juncture that's just not defensible maybe when the money was a little less you could say okay they're getting their scholarships now you've got players generating ten and twenty and thirty and forty million dollars for a particular programs and they're not\nReal students their loyalty and their their responsibility is to their teen first which takes up forty or fifty or sixty hours a week\nAnd you're not paying them you know you were you were having their elders just spread the money around and they're not all by the way going into pro basketball or pro football some of them are just moving through not necessarily getting a degree\nComing out with some injuries and yet the NC double a ... in the midst of the student athlete when everyone knows that if anything it's the athletes\nWhen everyone knows that if anything it's the athletes student you know the the athlete is what you're there for\nMe to come back to one thing you said earlier um you said a lot of people knew that that shady things were going on and that there was a risk of running afoul of and see a regulations it as a whole new game if you have the FBI asking questions do you think that'll make a difference in the future\nI Do think it will make some difference but I think that difference will be\nJust in the way that people\nConduct possibly criminal activity I think people will be more careful you already heard these people you know on the recordings that the FBI took them\nYou know talking about you know we have to do this and some underhanded ways we have to get it out of certain accounts so they knew they were engaged in criminal activity I think there'll be or possibly criminal activity I think they'll become more careful\nSunny the Cairo the former Nike\nExecutive the godfather of the grassroots circuit he told me these people forgot where the boundaries where you know they got too greedy he also saddened by the way you never do this kind of stuff on the telephone so there's an element of\nAll of this that makes\nThis look like just common criminal activity it makes the three shoe companies seem like crime families on the on the basketball circuit so to the extent that all of this is true and I think it is whether it's criminal we don't know\nIt will continue to go on because there's too much incentive for it to go on\nI certainly think with the FBI on the case people would become much more care\nI certainly think with the FBI on the case people would become much more careful\nAnd just so we covered this I mean ... you said that in some respects shooting apparel companies look pretty bad in this what do they say about their role in in college recruitment in these charges\nThe apparel companies have been very quiet they have put out sort of vanilla statements that this is not what we do um but they've been very very quiet\nThere is a Adidas executive who is one of the three current defendants his name is James ghetto he's being represented by\nA lawyer hired by Adidas and finally James ghetto who this ... executive his father was a high school coach he's an insider he's a basketball inside or almost all of these defendants\nAre well liked well known insiders they're not people who operated you know outside the system I think one of the scariest things for people in the basketball industry to the extent that that they are alarmed is\nThese people were them they were family they were part of the basketball fraternity and Adidas and Under Armour and Nike are part of the corporate basketball fraternity and I don't think they are planning on much to change either if they can help it\nMichael ... thanks so much for speaking with us thank you it's great to be on with you\nMichael ... new
