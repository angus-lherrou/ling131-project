the response was great you're like I'm actually doing an album hair people's paid for it yeah and then uh I mean so what year was that two thousand nine thousand eight two thousand and eight it's clearly different than doing it now ah how I mean how has it changed between doing it then and now with\nCurrent project leave forever deal because back I was so scared that I went to as well because back then there was you know now you're inundated by people saying you know help them with the ever there everything yet so there was nothing else like that\nCNN and other news sources were interested like what is this so I got a lot of publicity for work and you know what I stopped\nAt a certain level because ... ... yeah he put up this really mean ugly picture of me with the dollar signs saying

a way that just seem like much easier than doing character not if you don't want to share who you really are\nWith an auto [laughter] never be able to keep those walls [laughter]\nBut I'm just wondering when you were pitching this I assume Comedy Central was like what do you have and you're like I Want to do this character driven show yes we're the great this is different nobody's doing\nAll right they were they were actually very cool I had done a bunch of sketches on line and we'd put out like a Bobby bottle service and breathe\n\nAnd ... the early ...

response that it deserves a\nAnd it was sort of become a backdoor pilot four of the cruel show I we were very specifically wanted to do character driven comedy I think I've always been drawn to people
