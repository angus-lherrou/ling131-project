written about them as hell writing forms you as a human being like you wrote somewhere um it's an endeavor I go into a now provide solid deep joy\nPerhaps is joy from writing seated comfortably in my court because of a life lesson it provided writing has shown me what happened with the patient ... and some place else you wrote the surprises I've experienced in my writing practice have dislodged me from curiosity into love [laughter]\nI Wonder if you could say a little bit about those qualities and as a way into the question if what if\nYou're learning about what it means to be human through the likes of usually\nI'm I think the writing practice um it was something that I had not expected to be a good fit\nTo be a good fit\nI had never thought oh I Want to be a writer one day\nBut I went to the Institute of American indian arts and um they didn't have a music program that's what I wanted to study right [laughter] but I really wanted to go to school there so I felt like the next best thing was to study writing\nAnd um it was not easy a lot of uh I Would say the first three three and a half years I wrote some really really really bad bad bad poems like really dry it took me a long time\nBut I think it was that patients that is something I've learned through writing a sense of patients and their reward mhm that comes from that\nEven I'm just now thinking about the peace thirty eight but that piece for example took me\nI Want to say maybe a year and a half to two years to write what it was important to me it's kind of an ethics piece it's like six pages long yeah yeah yeah would you just briefly say what what's happening in that piece\nIn thirty yeah\nBriefly in thirty eight it's um written to and for the Dakota thirty four I'm thirty eight ... men who were Hong under the orders of I'm President Abraham\nUnder the orders of I'm President Abraham Lincoln um as a result of this sue appraising\nWhich came at a time when the court to people there um territory their land was\nWas getting smaller and smaller and um and finally down to something like a ten mile tract and the people duck what people do not have um hunting rights beyond that\nUh and basically um and they had no se a\nStore credit with the traders and so they were basically starving so there was an uprising\nAnd I'm as a result um these thirty eight men were hung and then ... ... people were moved west to South Dakota area in different um basically they lost their land\nAs large as legal math execution in us history and yes and it happened the same week that President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation yes that is raised tree we don't know that three or we don't teach 'em yeah [noise]\nSo so you were just talking so this took along this emerged troop patient writing all of this\nAh absolutely I just think um that I've learned through writing the reward and the joy that comes out of just being really patient with peace and patient with yourself I think at least for me the imagination if something\nFor me the imagination is something that I have to really respect\nLike its own little person yeah [laughter] and so we can't demand too much of it sometimes they have to let her\nTake a rest and then come back and being conversation with it again but it's a beautiful process that I've learned through writing\nMm yeah I was looking at page sixty four ... whereas I did

planet and the BCS and and at the same time the way in which you're doing it is helping everyone who's involved to wake up\nInterestingly we did so many things that when I many years later\nArrived at Google because they wanted to have a program there where their engineers could learn meditation\nSo many of the same things that they recognized about what makes a person more creative more able to ah bring their their whole self into work and to be able to grow\nFrom their work as well and not think of it as you know now I'll do my work and then I'll go home and be a real person\nOn the right to say [noise] that is a shaft that is still a still has a long\nWay to go oh for sure in terms of American corporate culture\nIdeals and practicalities\nOr and ideals and and practicality is yeah this story of search inside yourself\nFirst of all I I I Love the story of how you that you had to find that language I mean isn't it right when you first just were offering a meditation course are mindfulness course it didn't take yeah\nUh actually my friend Ming who's now written a book on search inside yourself um he called me up one day I was at the Ritz still running the center for a contemporary of mine and he called up and well first of all he said when I was younger\nHe been through some difficult times and meditation had really helped him so he'd been thinking for some time at Google\nThat or it would be really great to bring into the workplace he'd been there since almost the beginning he was engineering number one o seven [laughter] and um when Google went public they told their engineers set who no longer needed to work if they didn't want to um [noise]\nThat they could stay but they had to do something that would in some way advanced Google's mission\nBut they could decide but it was so men decided it was going to be bringing meditation and shut our posted it and nobody signed up I don't know what to do and I heard you could help so I went out there and we talk to and we looked around and\nWhat we identified was that people are employees there are\nAll quite young very smart graduated the top of their class from MIT or Stanford um [noise]\nTop of their class from MIT or Stanford um [noise] had been in front of their screens most of their lives so I'm after talking for a whole day and figuring out what was going on there\nI suggested that we could\nOffer the same practices but emphasize the practices that that more directly cultivate emotional intelligence and that we could frame and then a different way and so we called it of course they came up with this great name since they're the big search engine search inside yourself\nAnd then the subtitle is mindfulness based stress reduction and we asked Danny go home and who also is in bug guy or with us back all the right guy\nI'm asked him to give a talk at Google about the relation between about why emotional intelligence so important in the workplace and on the relationship between meditation and emotional intelligence he did that and then we posted the course\nAnd in four hours a hundred and forty people signed up and since then you know over two thousand Google lawyers around the world have taken the course and\nThere's a lot of talk now about\nBringing mindfulness into the workplace yeah how's superficial it is and how it\nHelps bad people do bad things better and and it doesn't help people question anything it just makes them more satisfied with what they're doing\nBut this is a serious course and when you sit down and quiet down can calm quiet stable you have to do that in order for any kind of insight\nDo you have to do that in order for any kind of insight to arise and you do feel better usually although sometimes you know really disturbing emotions rise but it needs to be taken to the next kind of level of depths in order for people to begin to\nQuestion right there\nBut this course actually offers enough time practice and a teaching to help people do that\n[noise] I mean yeah and I think that's an important and refreshing thing to name that is you can be a great meditate or and also remained narcissistic right [laughter] I mean there's not as can be superficial and it can be abused like any like any spiritual practice like yeah politically correct is um [noise]\nBut you know nearby something that really so intrigues me in um in your work and in some of your writing is how you know like the language of emotional intelligence that you've just been using and that's now so widely familiar including workplaces um [noise]\nThat what this tradition is bringing forward and bringing to the surface for modern people has\nYou know has this very noble lineage um you know it's what is um that is the tradition that has focused on this for ... years but you know you wrote about how in Eighteen Ninety William James and the principles of psychology\nSaid that the faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention over and over again is a very root of judgment character and will\nAnd I mean I don't know I don't think he was ... but that is the\nAnd I mean I don't know I don't think he was what is that that is the intention right have yeah that is and that's just quite amazing\nAnd then in the seventies you had a somebody\nWho actually I had never heard of David McClelland yay and William James hall mhm um who became a teacher to all these figures have gone on especially in narrow science to this you know David than Daniel Goldman cliffs Erin marketing\nAnd also to me what's fascinating is that he was Quaker\nAnd then something in your work they ... through\nAnd seeing that this contemplative impulse\nIs kind of human tradition as much as it yeah it's in their religious traditions I'm In ... center Owen cs Lewis and the idea of holding that goes back to play down high tech are somehow that you're just looking at your work has brought all that forward for me and it's really critically\nHim so much [laughter]\nI'm honored [laughter] yeah but\nTrue when we started the center for can jump out of mind we uh we're looking for ways in which these practices might be helpful in sectors of American society other than health inhaling which is where it had started\nAnd um we interviewed eighty people we identified this was in Ninety six and seven so it was early but we kind of word of mouth heard and knew\nA number of people in different fields who were beginning to integrated into their work or their organizations and we Andrew you're eighty people\nIntegrated into their work or their organizations and we interviewed eighty people and we ask them for what practices they were there's and that they were teaching or [noise] and um we gathered\nThese hundred practices from all the different traditions it I mean all the religious and spiritual and of course psychological traditions to\nThey are human practices they really about waking up to who we are appreciating and we are opening our hearts recognizing compassion recognizing that you know there's a way in which\nIn a deep relaxation and everyone who's ever done a yoga class you know none of it's like okay this is the time you know completely let go and you drop into the floor you know\n[laughter] as soon as like breathing in and breathing out about three brass fan and I saw these arm's reach out [laughter] I'm\nProud of their phones and about lying down [laughter] sorry for far right they brought their phones in front of their faith [laughter] I couldn't believe it was like the little Catholic girl and ... what's the sec religious right [laughter] right\nWell okay so I knew were denied oh beautiful workers Google and Google is part of the problem here yeah and it to the point that nothing is pure and um but you also written about and it's very practical like mindfulness practices like social media practice mindful emailing what do you talk about\nYeah that's really ... yeah yeah um we devise that at Google [laughter] loved that she put her magazine um I mean it's so simple but like most mindfulness practices [laughter] it's so simple and we don't do it um [noise]\nYou just type out your email either a response\nYou just type out your email either a response or an initiating email and then you stop takes three D. press follow your brass\nIn and out in and out and in and out and then you read the email\nAnd you read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it and there we were focused on emotional impact so you know is this person likely to be agitated or angry or you know frustrated or whatever the emotion would be negative emotion\nOr maybe even as this person likely to think you I mean you're offering more than you actually are what whatever we asked them to think about it from that person's perspective and then either you know change it or not and then send\nAnd the first time we we did it there was a week in between the classes and so a week later and they came back and we said how did it go and um\nThey all said that was radical you know [laughter] I'm amazing and then one guy said I did something really radical I said what is that I picked up the phone [laughter]\nYou know I mean there we all are emailing to the people on the next cubicle you know and so uh that's really helpful\nReally helpful I wanted to go back for a minute because I didn't answer your question about social justice activism really house yeah I got off on the leaf but yeah one theme that\nA leaf but yeah one theme that comes up so often with activists is that if I give up my anger\nWill I lose my motivation right and it's my anger that keeps me working for this change\nYeah but what mindfulness compassion practices others help with is\nThe understanding that it's not either acting out on your anger and being driven by it on the one hand or repressing it on the other hand but there is a way to\nNotice your anger begin by noticing the sensations in your body\nAnd then notice what your anger is see it and recognize it as energy energy in your body right but at the same time holds a compassion and echoing immunity for the situation because\nYou're more likely to be able to see what can be done to make that change if you're not driven by anger 'cause it clouds mind\nAnd it also makes communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult yeah whereas if you can cultivate acronym Annie and compassion for the situation you're much more likely to both see\nInteresting ways to resolve it and to be able to act on a communicated we did a lot of work with lawyers and\nAnd see how that Los Angeles or anything about that I Want to ask you about that is so interesting every especial retreat for judges where they wanted to learn how to be non judgemental [laughter]\nThey wanted to learn how to be non judgemental\n[laughter] it's I mean we we laugh but it has\nYou know it they will lawyers worry that\nCan they be a zealous advocate for their client and the same time have compassion for the person on the other side of the case and um of course the answer is yes and what that means and what those judges men is not eliminating wise discernment\nIt's eliminating pre judgment so that day judges are unbelievably overworked\nThey have so many people coming in front of them all day long one after another and they said you know some young guy comes up in front of me and before I even know his name I'm already thinking that this is probably who he is and what he's done right\nAnd they can't not having that arise because they're they're they are all day long hearing all this stuff\nBut they don't want to prejudge they want to be really there in the moment clear and open minded with whomever comes before them but it's really hard so just being there and really listening to what's actually being said\nThat can be cultivated through mindfulness practice and\nThey loved it oh yeah I just read in a a science magazine at the present moment as we experienced it as a pet two to three seconds long\n[laughter] kind of interesting great like physically like what we experience as a present moment is too yeah and also that you can then it can be a longer\nAnd also that you can that it can be a longer\nRight which is all you meditate or have said oh yeah absolutely and that you can also completely not be there can be yeah [laughter] [noise]\nI'm Krista tip it induces on being today with Buddhist teacher mirror by Bush who works at the intersection of industry social healing and diverse contemplative practices\nYou know you said a minute ago like with everything with mindfulness and contemplative practice [noise]\nIt's so obvious and in some ways easy but we don't do it and uh and I should say like for myself I have some I've had many experiences across the ears on different settings retreat settings or something less intense we're having the irony is that uh [noise]\nEven a kind of one off contemplative experience can be instantaneously\nGratifying right it can be just transformative and now they're asleep and all this science about how good it is for us on these very big like biological levels and stress and all that but it's very hard to\nCreate this habit and has been hard for me I I've recently I wanted to ask you about this since I have you [noise]\nYou know I recently decided that I could do six minutes in the morning while my piece tapes which just\nCould do six minutes in the morning while my teeth states which just seems so pathetic but you know it's and you just get it out of our time yeah\nAnd I wonder um I Want to ask you this you work with so many different practices I mean there is this something where you really do have to find their way that works for you yeah well\nThe center we we've done all kinds of things I mean we've had retreats where we've offered you know we've had a Buddhist teacher\nAnd a Jewish teacher teaching traditional Jewish practices brother David teaching Christian practices um someone doing to be chanting we've done it that way and then\nInvite people to find something from all of that that works for them sometimes we've offered really simple practices like um\nMindfulness other breads and walking meditation right and my listening and so on as an opening for people and then knowing that if they begin to appreciate the begin to reshape the inner life\nAnd the benefit that comes from as you said I mean\nIt's amazing that they found the reduction in stress and cortisol levels yeah after ten Fifteen minutes of meditation or that once people begin to experience that that they will find what works for them the other thing I wanted to say is that\nThere's so much work being done with\nMindfulness and that is a great introductory\nPractice but when I have found in ...\nPractice but when I have found in the beginning you couldn't ever say what the uh environmental leaders are

talk talk of the Quakers looked like they were kind of um that they were ...\nYeah well I think you've spoken about how I'm living in that diplomatic world um you know so you are you are known within sociology is the founder of\nThe sociology of emotion and I I just want us to summarize and you tell me if I get this wrong but but she feels important I Want to really dive deep into that so that the backdrop as in terms of how we analyze uh\nThe other world of the south um southwest Louisiana I came to to realize that there were different\nCame to to realize that there were different truths you differently truth and so there are fat so I Believe in the ... she is yeah it's the deep story and again we all have a deep story a\nIt repels certain facts don't fit it and it invites other facts to do [noise]\nI'm Krista tip at indices on being today with the esteemed sociologist of emotion early hope she'll [noise]\n\nYou in strangers in their own land um take up what you call a key whole\nIssue um to kind of go deep into what are the dynamics that collect around a specific subject and to to really understand the dynamics and you're talking about the the great paradox and um [noise] you know you point at this dynamic that in the\nPart of the country you're in there as well first of all and I'm ... and beautiful natural environment and ... great pollution and great relief resistance to regulating polluters and I I think that's such an example of where\nUm people from the outside of all the dynamics that go into that would say um it's just obvious\nAnd but you know there's a the background I think right right [noise] um parts\nGround I think Frank I'm partly I think people I came to know a in Louisiana felt that the federal government was\nA bigger better version of local government and the truth is that in the state of Louisiana a local government out of the state government has not protected people okay from pollution\nYou know there's a there's this passage in in the book that I uh and strangers in their own land that I\nI just just just as an example of this and maybe this person you're talking about you know the ... the state yeah always seems to come down on the little guy he no he says his take this by you if your motor boat league's little gas into the water the war no right you up but if companies leak thousands of gallons of it\nAnd kill all the life here the state lets them go\nRight I have an example hits home it may I can see that\nYes yes the big companies are are so rich and powerful that and say basically have a bond [laughter] the legislature and that there was that the companies have outsourced the moral charity work to the state\nSo they say okay you know let's let's get a legislature that goes along with our developed let's talk jobs jobs jobs\nAnd so the company is with the money that the state gives them ... for it I think it was one point six billion dollars that uh was in the last five years in Louisiana offered to companies\nUh was in the last five years in Louisiana offered to companies yeah to come in with that public money you know came from Texas I'm they then can make donations to the autumn on\nSociety or for a new football uniforms for that was you know looking good and setting up third grade classes in chemistry meanwhile state officials the Louisiana department of environmental quality\nIs being very weak and giving out permits ah [noise]\nAs one of the people I interviewed said like candy so the state looks terrible the company it looks good it's kind of emotional actual manipulation you could say to get you to feel like the company is your friend and to feel like the state is your enemy [noise]\nYeah and there's ... you also describe\nThis interesting dynamic that um that again is is new want strides not something that would be obvious to anybody I mean a lot of this is true but I mean for example you um\nYou you have this chapter called the remembers ... and there is something where you you a decision to send ... about a sociological\nUnderstanding that memory just in general is an indirect expansion of power and then you say so ironically strangely embarrassingly the memory of southern environmental glory fell in part to respectful clerks in federal offices internal environmental is\nSo much complexity there\nYeah [laughter]\nSo much complexity there yeah [laughter] sure heart\nDoes mine yeah oh yeah yeah\nBecause the people I came to know are no more about the environment they know you know which fish are in what area where you said the crab pots where\nYou know what ducks you can shoot at what period of of the year\nThey love their land and yet\nAnd yet they're they're caught I mean people work in the plants and I talked to a woman who said you know I asked you do talk to neighbors about ah environment she said you know our neighbors working plants and\nUh I don't want to hurt their feelings I don't want them to feel accused\nYeah you know as if the people working the plants would take on the guilt right or is that I didn't get along with it and you know and again it's not their personal guilt a it's a company policy and it's a the absence of\nA regulation here the rules you're right you're right like California is very strict rules we enjoy a cleaner environment as a result it's at that level the guilt it's not a personal one right so that was very poignant and sweet of her\nTo be mindful that you know an operator might feel with two ...\n[noise] yeah [noise] and scan like poignant this whole thing gets it as well and what you are shining a light on is the human complexity here\nWell and what you are shining a light on is the human complexity here and we may ... ... it does make things messy right but again I you know I just feel like you are for this is saying let's let's deal with reality not wishful thinking\nAnd\nLet's talk about reality and not wishful thinking by having a simple a respectful public conversation yeah you know where nobody is is bullying conversational anybody else you know new year coming together\nTo see if there can be common ground on the environment\nAnd there can be I think\nThe people I came to know we're very interested and very approving of\nRenewables in fact there's something called the green tea move that as Tea Party that's up all for renewables\nBut we're not even finding common ground because we weren't even respectfully reaching out to look for it right here in our ... still in fact I I think that problem remains with us\nAnd especially on the left I think uh there's a kind of a rigid sort of in for turning I Would say I find it very sad I think we have to reach out looking for potential common ground\n\n[noise]

I think maybe this was a ... interview gave you said even among the most ardent extreme people you met over five years of research you\nFound specific issues on which there is potential for coalition\nSafeguarding children on the Internet reducing prison populations for a non violent offenders protecting against commercialization of the human gene I'm pushing for good jobs rebuilding our rail system roads and bridges and our social infrastructure [noise] um\nSo interesting to think about what if we started by saying a what we could start talking about tomorrow right [laughter] well now hanging fruit right yeah\nMhm yeah that's right and do it in the in the spirit we've been talking about yeah mhm\nYou I'm In I'm strangers in their own land you near the end you say you write a letter to a friend on the liberal left you write a letter to Louisiana friends on argued see ... you know if you imagine if I if I had a right to my friends in Louisiana and the writers are right to liberal friend I mean I there was a sentence and\nIn your letter to\nYour friends on the liberal left I was just kind of humanizing and its provocative and human way consider the possibility that in their situation you might end up closer to their perspective\nThat's it [laughter] I think I think that's true mhm that we are products of our own experience you know and what if you grew up in a family um\nYou grew up in a family um but ... said oh we were poor but we didn't know it had a great childhood but we were poor you know\nI'm OK what does that have been your experience and what if your dad's job and how much you earn was the central fact of your life you know\nAnd what if it was a blue collar job but you felt put down for doing that blue collar job no [noise] I think there's something actually missing in the\nEntire vocabulary we have for talking about social class yeah 'cause I didn't go just to another region or ... people with different political views I went to a different social class and there is a lot of smearing on the left as\nA at the blue collar class that live there Yuri up said look we're the daily workers we're\nClimbing the telephone pole to repair or telephone ... were re paving roads where [noise] who are you know to put that down and there's a lot of humble pie to each year\nAnd a I think it's a problem I didn't know when I set out that I Would come back and be as critical of\nOld cocoon I've long been here as I Am and a kind of you know it's not only a a contempt that really bothers me now whenever I hear it or see it um\nAnd that is buried to some degree but there's a kind of a reluctance to to read\nBut there's a kind of a reluctance to to reach out at ... on the left there's a lot of good political we'll but it's gotten curled up in\nOnto itself and become a kind of self monitoring program oh you said this wrong on\nInstead of reaching out to build coalitions 'cause we're a big country not ruins like us I was like them what we need our sturdy coalitions that and I think\nLabor unions when the labor movement was much larger and and uh there there was a way that people of\nDifferent colors and classes got together and when you had a compulsory draft\nRight right with different colors and and classes got together natural way they're going to be ... each other they will yeah public school systems um but we're down on those\nThose crossover connective institutions I think we need to build another one I Would like to see a civil service you know one year acquired of every one\nOf every one where a very good yeah yeah of everyone and you go to a different reach and get to know people get first of all get to know how to\nTreat people respectfully and listen to actively be immediate everybody should learn those skills and then go cross a to see if we can rebuild does\nThat connective tissue yeah\n[noise] that connective tissue yeah\nI'm I'm sure people have said to you and I I I can into this conversation myself that um\n[noise] there's critique that there are all kinds of groups of people including like people of color um who have long felt like strangers in their own land in this country and they run this late right and yeah yes and especially now yet again and\nIt's when white people that you know the critique that white people wake up to this phenomenon when it's about other white people\nUm how do you have you work with that in your mind it's true and I think it's a it's an important insight\nYes I I think it's an excellent point okay I mean for example the opiate addiction problem has has been oh now they're called a diseases of despair yeah which is kind of a compassionate way crack\nEpidemic\nWith no yeah yeah oh whereas the crack epidemic in the inner cities which it lacks a wasn't it was a criminal and timely yeah yeah that's right yeah even worse so and so it's a point is that should be broadly received mhm [noise]\nI Want to draw too close to suspend just such a big wonderful conversation I'm just kind of curious about that you say somewhere that the English language doesn't give us many words to describe the feeling of reaching out to someone from another world and then\nTo describe the feeling of reaching out to someone from another world and then it says and I ... I ended up having that interest welcomed\nAnd he said some of its own kind mutual is created I just found that intriguing 'cause I think so much about the power of words and I wonder if you had 'em or their words you're using now he's thinking or their friend and branch that gets at a symbols and how important that is for us and in constructing our world [noise]\nWell I use the word empathy and

W. J. F. dot org\nWe generally avoids the lightning rod figures on this show\nBut earlier this year the University of Montana in Missoula a blue city in a red state invited on being to attempt an outside the box civil conversation between two pundits with big followings on contrasting ends of the U. S. political spectrum\nIt became a sold out public event in the spirit of Montana's Senator Mike Mansfield who famously model\nSpirit of Montana's Senator Mike Mansfield who famously modeled integrity courage and humility across the partisan aisle in the two most of the Nineteen sixties and seventies\nWe first reached out to CNN commentator Sally cone who for several years was best known as the liberal lesbian contributor to Fox News\nShe just written a book which gathered its own controversy called the opposite of hate Sally has to be paired with Erick Erickson she was a long time executive editor of the conservative blog red state and he's an evangelical daily drive time radio host in Atlanta he enthusiastically agreed\nSince we recorded this conversation the two of them had been on polar opposite sides of the Kavanaugh hearings and as controversial as ever before\nBut I couldn't let go of a conversation I had after the event with two twelve year old girls who waited in a long line they told me they'd come at the insistence of a teacher and had expected to be bored\nThey were instead exhilarated\nIn the short span of time in which they've come into political awareness they told me they had not witnessed or imagine that this was possible\nA true back and forth marked at once by bedrock difference and goodwill and humor and a willingness to bring our questions as well as our arguments our humanity as well as our positions into the room if only for an evening Mm\nI'm ... and this is on being this conversation unfolded at the Denison theater in Missoula, Montana and was co hosted by Montana Public radio [noise]\nYou know as as I uh moved through two thousand sixteen\nSo you know as as I uh\nMoved through two thousand sixteen um\nWhat started being clear to me kind of midway through the air is who ever won\nUm\nThe deep work that we were going to have to do as a society was about was human work about repairing like stitching relationship across that rupture that had suddenly become on you know we could no longer not see it\nAnd that somehow that was going to involve each and every one of us wherever we were on the political or social spectrum\nTaking some kind of stock in terms of how we got to this place and um you know Sally you ah\nYou know you you mean you have to say you're a liberal like your credentials are from um\nThank you and I don't think [laughter]\nI've worked really hard yeah okay\nThat you tell a story that I found very you know and you know how you you grew up\nAs a community organizer and you know if you said that you know right wing or somewhere my enemies and I hated them and you even grow up in a kind of ... up with a philosophy of community organizing that formed a lot of people that you're political enemies or devils\n'em and you you've worked to not be that way but in this election that all re service for you um you tell the story and I think also something that you both have in common is you're both parents are right in the thick of parenting and that's influencing how this reckoning you're doing and you tell a story of being in your\nLovely leafy neighborhood block party in Brooklyn in the summer of two dozen sixteen and and there was a penny out of Donald Trump's head\nOne thinks they're mean and again it goes back to ... it's not just pools talking to neo Nazis and talking to a terrorist people think their motivation is fundamentally good\n...\nThese tows didn't think they were doing something mean in fact they often thought I was ...\nAnd these trials didn't think they were doing something mean in fact they often thought I was the one who is meaner on civil or cruel or unkind um\nAnd and in fact when I heard some of their stories I was so struck that here I Am mildly irritated by the annoyance of being called things I Can't repeat on public radio and online\nUm and they're going through a real hardships in their lives and I think it's unfortunate in a number of ways that this was one of the things they choose to do with their time but still\n[noise] um no one thinks they're mean no one thinks their hateful no one wants to be hateful\nOkay how do we do with that what do we do about that because because we are we're we're I mean this well the only thing I was just saying that this was I think part of that is that they also didn't think anyone was paying attention to their tweets which arises like Ryan tweeting now but still there were like\nI didn't think anyone was reading them I mean they are and we've forgotten it's or it could hurt you that they make you feel the way you were feeling and they had the opportunity a lot of them apologized ... thanks but why did you then do it right and the sort of it has something to do with\nA lack of accountability it also has to do with this way that the Internet comes to exist within our own heads\nAnd so I mean there are studies that when people have to uh you know are sort of challenge to engage on line and a computer scenario but where they can see the eyes see a video of the eyes of the person that they're writing to we behave more kindly so there's this ...\nOf technology that allows us to fuel the demonization that you're exactly right Krista didn't begin with technology but but they they end up sort of nurturing amplify it yeah yeah yeah\n[noise] um mhm\nSo I mean part of what I think we do\n[noise] um mhm so I mean part of what I think we do is start to understand that we all have a problem\nRight and I don't look I don't I don't care who does it worse I happened to have an opinion on the matter about uh I'm actually an honest what I really think I'm curious do you agree with this Eric is I've come to think that\nUh that the left by and large uh is\nNicer to humanity in general but not people in specific and conservatives are nicer to people in specific but not humanity in general [noise]\nThat's actually something conservatives say regularly [noise]\nSo that's really interesting right and and if we could somehow figure out a way to say okay you know what like let's try to do both um but also from I think that point of recognizing at the at least at the very beginning nobody we all have a habit of dehumanizing and demeaning the other uh-huh\nAnd we all think were justified and doing it because of them I've heard so many people in this election I've been a dinner party so many people my liberal and say oh they're game Trump supporters me that there's still a system there so as long as ... I hate them\nBecause they're so hateful I hate it out of\nIt and we blame the people for then expressing these use as though not it's been done to them but it's inherent in them that that's who they are as people how can we say those two things at the same time so I Do think we have to have some faith in\nPeople's\nIntention to be good and\nAssume I Try very hard and this is where I think it is a script\nAnd I assume\nI Try very hard and this is where I think it is a spiritual quest I Try very hard\nTo assume I tried very hard to assume that you liked me\nIn spite of some of the some of the things I Know you've read and and and er and ... written and said about gay people\nI still don't assume you mean me uh well I don't\nI can and that and that the rest of that is sort of in the pension but it's also I I Want to believe the best and people and it seems to me that's the gift I have to give others if I Want them to believe the best of me\nYou've actually called that a daily spiritual practice I guess that's just you know or I mean Eric I feel like you also have been caught in one of the related dynamics swell up this\nWhich is that the culture we've created that dynamic is that we also really want to freeze people and the worst thing they ever said and then associate everybody who might be remotely like them\nOr who voted like them so but in a been a very particular instance are you said something I mean you said a lot of us here at pundit but a few years ago you you made a comment which you later really have said many times in many places I regret\nYou said something and coarse language about a Supreme Court justice\nAnd I'm route a whole chapter in the book about that well yes\nAnd um and the word goat was in it and yes and also to talk too much about this okay and and and when we announced on Twitter that we were doing this interview and I said how excited I was to talk to both of you you know and I hadn't actually picked up I hadn't followed the saga yet but\nSomebody came through and energy and beyond loud ... ask Erick Erickson what\nA you know saying this has to do with repairing\nThen what are you saying that this has\nTo do with repairing civil discourse ...\nYou know you usually only made earlier that we sometimes in in what I did that it was I think two thousand nine\nAnd ... it was just I didn't know anybody but it a couple of dozen people on Twitter at the time and it was just friends and it wasn't my remark it was someone else's and we were laughing about it and I took ownership of it though and I've had to apologize for nearly every day since\nUm but the number of people who still bringing up because they think I Need to be defined by the yeah and I've gotten a lot of people you wouldn't see there's about the right actually I wrote several weeks ago about people in the right suddenly being okay with dictatorship as long as it goes their way and\nThe common themes or one people don't know the record but to the fact that both sides really are at a disturbing point in this country where as long as their site is winning they don't care\nUh and I think that is only possible again and I hate to sound like worker record all this but it really is where my heart is right now\nThat it only matters when we're oblivious\nTo the people in our city block\nTo the homeless people in our community when it's just national politics when Washington is the be all end all of everything everything's abstract because none of us are in Washington\nYou know look I think it's very ... two points it's it's dangerous to suggest the justice sort of return to prevent ... it could be the solution right because we have to remember that\nBefore the Internet before globalization and global interconnectedness and global awareness we still had segregation and we still had sexism we still had homophobia we still\nEd segregation and we still had sexism we still had homophobia we still had all the things we had a lot of things that I think made this country great but a lot of things I think that we had to work on and that that\n... that especially given the historical way in which our neighborhoods have been shaped led to a a lot of my opium so I'd say that look I have a bent on this and I I'm clear on it which is I Will never be nicer I Want everyone to hate last and I think progressive should lead the way\nTo go first to\nFeel like look to the points that were making here or if there was a sign that said that professes\nUm that people can change and grow\nAnd in fact that is a core of progressive politics is that please don't stay where we've been as a country in the divisiveness of racial\nSegregation and slavery and the subjugation of women and the you know yawning inequality economic inequality we are not we don't have to stay there please don't stay there let's progress that is the idea of progression that\nThat demands it invites change in the country and an individual\nAnd so if you if if your vision involves people changing and growing then you have to be able to literally practice what you preach and create space for people to change in ...\nWhen you see this because I've said something somewhere on the right that you know we've we've gotta we've got to improve within a preview others are we going to ... and I get a lot these days will that unilateral disarmament\nAnd I get a lot these days will that unilateral disarmament we we can't be nicer because the other side's gonna there's this is absolutely use those ... lack of faith to believe the other side is capable of grew in\nYeah I um I get it to 'em I still have friends and you know activists and organizers who feel like hate and and ... is one of the strongest tools in their toolbox\nUm you know look I just I always returned to I'm One of my favorite quotes Martin Luther king quote and he says darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that yeah\nHate is not the answer to hate and he said hey is too great a burden to bear correct yeah and it and you can't hate your way out of hate yeah I don't know what I Want to say liberals and I love that definition of progressive but I don't think progressive have you\nKnow a corner on the market of leaving and human growth and change right and and you are a at a devout evangelical Christian and conversion is an important value and belief in Christianity\nYou have to be open to being persuaded yourself these are two ways streets they have to be and not like you're faking it really authentically meaningfully hearing what someone else is saying [noise]\nUm I mean look we have to do something about um the way in which our lives in our communities are segregated and that is increasingly ideological uh it's also racial economic um\nAnd you know it's a very interesting thing about the gay thing right like you could have the stealth gay people I was one\nWhere I was like ... in my family that whole time and then suddenly surprise I'm gay and they already liked me so it's sort of worked out well and that's why we have a quick progress\nOn gay rights as a country that doesn't usually happens say with like black people are Muslims you know like your cousin doesn't just suddenly one day come out of Mexican for so [laughter]\nAre there are studies that you know look kids who go to racially integrated elementary schools ... grow out\nGo to racially integrated elementary schools how grow up to actually they have less racial bias and college students who participate in racially integrated uh\nActivities and after school programs are actually reduce their racial bias so there's something about us knowing each other [noise] being together relating to each other but then\nHas a much more positive effect more broadly Mm mhm [noise]\nActually I have actually leads me to one of the questions I Want to ask us we um [noise]\nAs we wind down which is\nIf the goal of a robust civility is not that we agree right and that in fact uh\nWe really do have some deep deep differences where there's not even going to be a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or a a proposition is that we we're not we're not going to let common ground easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist on creating something called come in life\nThat if it is about also just learning to disagree better\nWhen we're integrity more personal integrity not hating 'em what what difference does it make and like the two of you have been and you're both really good at saying you know I'm not perfect at this you know Sally\nSaid I haven't learned to stop hating it and and and and Eric ... yeah usually I just wanted them not well paid your book you know you said the need for a relationship and community is why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have been and can still be on social media\nSo so this is a work in progress for any of us we're all sinners um what is the experience you have of what does shift\nUm what is the experience you have of what does shift what shifts what becomes possible what difference does it make\nI um\nHave had the experience myself of being unexpectedly kind\nThe face of people being cruel on line or off\nAnd seeing the difference it makes in yourself in for Neal better [noise] I feel better when I'm not a jerk I just do 'em try it [noise]\nUm but it and then as well mhm uh people write back and say hey you're you're All right you know I'm your friend warning you that you might and likely [laughter] uh\nI had the privilege of finding example after example I mean there are in credibly powerful stories of people who were you know professional hate mongers\nOr kids who were just saying nasty violent racist things and who the targets of that hate\nShowed\nAnd generosity and transformed those dynamics on Twitter people who left entire hate movements because the people who they had been raised thinking we're hateful showed them kindness and I have to say I'm aware of that\nThinking we're hateful showed them kindness and I have to say I'm aware\nOf the power of the burden that\nIn a way this suggests is that those who are perhaps if you believe it's not even those who perhaps are at the receiving end of more of the hate\nShould have to shoulder the burden of taking the high road I I get that there are times where it feels daily unjust and him and in some cases it's too much to ask for long enough to laugh at us and the other hand this is where\nThose of us who are yeah privileged can in fact step up and and also I Want to say I I look I Believe in the high road I Believe in treating people like they are all\nExtraordinary and beautiful in equal and so I Do feel like that is the that is it that is the work\nI I'm blown away by the difference it makes\nKnow I'm always struck um ... if it just ... to some degree or what is the first bad\nIn scripture but what is the very first bad thing that happens in genesis it's not Cain and Abel and it's not the fall short putting the apple it's actually in the garden of Eden before evil even ears the world God says it's not good for men to be alone\nThat's the first bad loneliness and so many of us can caught relationships and communities on line\nAnd we're still alone and then we get in our tribes are Republican conservative liberal progressive Democrats will that tribes then becomes alone insulated we don't mix and mingle\nAnd then becomes alone insulated we don't mix and mingle with the other and when you don't mix and mingle with the other and it's a lot easier to believe the other is the enemy\nAnd I really push myself more and more\nTo to make sure I'm actually having physical interaction with other people and you know we went with a wife\nWho has cancer and I know we're we're running out of good years um and being in middle Georgia where most of my friends are on line\nOr and not there ah I'm more and more mindful of the fact that it really is necessary for people to have actual real friends\nAnd I don't think there's a coincidence that all related ...\nThat we both began having these internal conversations um with having kids\nUm that level of local and I don't mean to keep our local here there's not an additional just community physical real break bread community and in my book I Am a firm believer that everyone should learn to cook\nBecause you should open your home\nAnd bring people in who you want to be your friend that you don't know um there's a there's a great Christian author was area Butterfield who was a lesbian scholar at Syracuse and she writes to the Christian Community a lot that you and there is no better community in America than the gay community\nWhere an unlocked door and a warm meal could be the difference between drugs depression suicide and that if we want real community it needs to be radical community we need to recognize that our blessings our blessings to\nShared with other people [noise]\nWe're blessed to be sure with with me\nPrefer Jesus ball\nIt is\nWe under value in the twenty first century review community and real meals and if we get back to that I think lots of the world's problems can be sold around the dinner table with the war meal with strangers getting to know them\n[noise] I'm going to fit this is on being today with Eric Ericson and Sally [noise] okay we could\nFinish one minute early which would please something deep in my radio bones but I'd really like to get can we just keep going for five more minutes you're better\nI mean I've had um [noise] I don't know if this is a I just want to bring\nUp with the two of you and in this room that very much on my mind is so happy we haven't talked about the White House tonight right just because we're so fixated ride from William for\nReally because there's more to life and there's more to politics has more to us in politics and um some things that puzzles me and I'm curious about the two of you\nBecause you are in that world is that on so many of these things on which were so divided in which a lot of hate gets thrown around by the extremes which we allowed to define and frame of are important discussions\nThere's this middle ground this vast middle ground where people aren't the same but you know for example I mean you know for a long time\nYou know for example I mean you know for a long time it's been true that on abortion\nYou know something like sixty to sixty five percent of Americans across party lines saver you know abortion with limit now there's a big conversation about what those limits are but rather than always having the same fight about it's always right or it's always wrong", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being", "city":
