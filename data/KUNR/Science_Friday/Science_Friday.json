DNA sequence email it off to your favorite supplier of DNA and they will send you back in the mail that DNA\nSupplier of DNA and they will send you back in the mail that DNA\nYou say in a talk that I I Want to write new DNA what does that mean to you\nActually it's easy to write and you know DNA what's hard is composing it you'd think about it DNA is the code of life it's the product of almost four billion years of evolution\nWe don't know how to compose new DNA we can ride it we can read it we can edited but we don't know how to compose it how do you compose something codes of a complex biological function that didn't exist before [noise]\nSo if you if you ... what is the problem in the composition why can't you compose [noise]\nBecause we don't understand how DNA encodes function remember biology molecular biology is a brand new discipline it's been around the the structure of DNA was published in Nineteen fifty three\nSo it's not been understood for but for a very short time\nAnd how DNA goes through all the complicated things of his cell and makes biological molecules in codes the ... the the the structure and function to these biological molecules\nIs a brand new field and we still don't understand those rules\nAre so what you mean then and what what do people mean in ... when you say uh the directed evolution of something what does that process me\nIt's just like breathing it's we've been breeding cats dogs race horses lab rats corn for thousands of years without really manipulating the DNA directly but now\nWithout really manipulating the DNA directly but now that we can synthesize DNA and put it in a test tube I can go direct the DNA and\nCombined DNA from different sources different species I can dial in levels of random mutations that can direct negotiations so I have control over the underlying DNA diversity and then I decide who goes on to parent the next generation\nAnd then how do you get a useful product out of that what's the next step [noise]\nSo you put the DNA into a microbe and they start reading it as if it were their own\nAnd a day and they then take the DNA and create the proteins that the DNA encodes than I as the breeder of molecules so to speak I have to decide who is better than what I started with\nWhich one of those microbes makes a bitter protein and that's called good old fashioned analytical chemistry so hard even take the DNA out of that and feed it back and I do it all over again\nIt's sort of creating life and that so it was a new you're creating a new form of life or you're not [noise]\nWell I I think that's probably exaggerating because life was there for me to work with were using the tools of biology to make new things I'm making new proteins they're not alive but they do do some things inside of cells\nBut you do you need the cell to help you make the protein [noise]\nActually so [noise] you don't have to have this self there's now very powerful systems where you can do everything from DNA to protein inside of a test tube with notes\nWe can do everything from DNA to protein inside of a test tube with no cells at all\nAnd so uh where do you eventually see this research going what is what is your ultimate goal here\nI run my ultimate goal is to allow human beings to use the power of biology the power of biology to do chemistry to make molecules to make materials to make their ... and\nAnd and pharmaceuticals and and basically all the things when we need in our daily lives from renewable resources without producing excess waste\n...

whether it be towards chemistry or um math so may not be completely relevant question but I Would like to hear your thoughts on this subject how to identify your kids or younger generations um your skill sets that they can go towards chemistry or science of physics\n[noise] did you know did you know what an early age Dr Arnold that you\nWant to I I I was lucky my father was a nuclear physicist and he always thought the girls to do math just as well as boys could so he never discourage me and I also had four brothers to compete with\nAnd I like being the winner [laughter] so I had a father who encouraged my natural tendency never discouraged it and had plenty of people to compete with\nWell you know I hear this from so many scientists we've talked to over the years that they had a role model mentor somebody could even be their parents who kept them are good kept alive or encourage their interest in science same thing for you it seems\nIt seems so and I miss my father he passed away two years ago but he would have loved this news\n... or ... and he's the right to add to to answer the listener's call is there any way to identify any young age who's talented in science\nI think all children are talented and if they love it they will ask questions they will do it I think the most important thing is not to discourage someone ...\nHave a tweet from Sydney who says please ask what she knows about how we instinct is encoded in DNA example dogs urge to bury things\nI Wish I knew but it's clear that many important behaviors are at least partially genetically encoded loyalty in

more things and under ... and measure their properties will be using important and powerful tools like machine learning to peace out and to try to pull out what is that genetic basis\nWhile you weren't you in his updated my and my last question and that is are there what tools would you like to see I mean I'll give you while you've got some money now from the Nobel right what kind of tools would you that don't exist would you like to have\nWell I Want to be able to measure important properties rapidly so that I can do this breeding faster I don't have a powerful enough tools to do that\nBut I'm also interested in how do you use AI and machine learning to interpret the results of evolution to make it even faster than it is now\nI noticed on your Ted Talk you said that one of your great ambitions is to be invited to give the Ig Nobel awards be [laughter] you know we broadcast the eggs every year the day after Thanksgiving and we know mark Abrams pretty good so I think we

chemistry and she's a professor of chemical engineering bioengineering and chemistry at Cal Tech\nSeventy five degrees [noise]\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow in a time of contentious dues indivisible political races Ken we have better conversations about the issues they get us most emotional talking about how a better understanding of logic\nLogic can help us talk and listen and maybe start to bridge some of those divides or at least understand why we're disagreeing so passionately our guest is Dr Eugene Chang mathematician a scientist in residence at the school of the art Institute of Chicago\nHer newest book is the art of logic in India logical world and um [noise]\nWe want to hear from you as anyone's logic ever change your mind about something some some listeners of funding in and first one Alex's from Chicago hey Ellen neighbor\n[noise] hey Sallie they're either and go ahead so odd\nPreviously identified myself as a an aspiring feminist\nUm and I had done so because my logic was that I really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women face I'm as a male um and I was met with that logic from a coworker of mine who um had said you know Alex as\nA black male you know you might be\nDoing things that contribute to I'm white supremacist system that you might do so knowingly or unknowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer a an African American male in the same way um women or being a man who contributes suicide genetic systems unknowingly wasn't necessarily make me\nI'm unable to to identify as a feminist\nUm it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to feminist system and so I'm being able to see the fact that you know I can still be a male male experiences while existing feminist um and identifying myself in in such a way\nA male male experiences while existing reminisced 'em and identify myself in such a way really changed my mind\nUm and I thought about that that's great thanks for calling us that is great that very heartening\nIs you know as part of the problem was that we don't see how we are there see us\nI think that is part of the problem but I think a big problem is\nThat we often spend you know trying to defend our own points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view and we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what it's believed as he is and one thing I found very interesting in that the cool has experience is that\nIt was a great example of using some abstract structure to tap into the person's own experiences\nSo in a way I think the logic was used very cleverly using emotions as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will understand from their own experiences and then hope that they can translate that\nTo somebody else's analysis experience\nI have a tweet from James which has to me logical discussions doe requirement he requires empathy empathy is caring enough to respect the view and listen to it is that emotional I don't know\nI agree I think the logic does not require math but logic is in a way parts of math\nAnd these things have poorest boundaries I mean we've constructed a lot of us official boundaries between subjects the bureaucratic purposes\nBut I Am a mathematician and from my point of view because I Am so deeply steeped in the discipline of mathematics I find that the full discipline of mathematics helps me with logic in the real world I'm not saying that\nAnd if mathematics helps me with logic in the real world I'm not saying that you have to be a mathematician in order to use logic and that's a good thing because I think everybody can use logic whether they're a mathematician who knows\nWhat to talk about some from the current events or let's turn out to the oddest topic in current events and that is voters and Congress are divided over whether to believe\nAccusations of sexual assault ticket and it's a judge Brett Kavanaugh and whether this should affect his confirmation to the Supreme Court and you write than in terms of how people respond to stories about sexual assault\nThere are a number of different logical process as at plagues and tell me what you mean by that\nThat's a whole other on a whole lot of different\nParts of this argument that we can analyze starting with what we mentioned before about Rome definitions because all of the people claim to the principle of the presumption of innocence\nAnd the thing about the presumption of innocence I think is that it's technically for court cases and criminal trials\nAnd it's something that gets bandied around as a general principle but it's really a very specific principal and similarly the idea of freedom of speech is often bandied around as a general principle when in fact that's just about whether you can be in prison for things and things\nSo going on from the presumption of innocence there is a paradox because some people say well we have to presume someone innocence until that until that proved guilty and the thing is that if you have an accuser\nAnd an accused Boston or let's just say the acute ... as a woman and the accused person is a man then what about the fact that we should also presumed a woman to be innocent until she has proved guilty of a false accusation and so then we have a ... because we can't actually hold the mom and the woman both innocent at the same time because that causes a contradiction\nThe woman both innocent at the same time because that causes a contradiction and mathematics and civil Sufi have studied paradoxes for a long time and\nStudied ways to resolve paradoxes\nBy shifting levels are finding that things are to a different level and the thing is I think that we we can start with the axiom of\nPresuming the accused person to be innocent and then we can look up ... whoa that creates for us and what mathematics does all the time and it starts with some basic assumptions and builds a logical will run out and then we look at world and good what do we think of this world\nAnd so we can look at the world that we've created by presuming accused people to the innocence until proven guilty and I think what we should see is that we've created a world in which people know that they can get away with sexual assault because there is almost never actual evidence that can prove that it happened\nAnd if they know that they can get away with it that means that they will do it more and so we've ended up in a culture where sexual assault can it can happen does happen on happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives so do we care\nThat so many people are getting away with sexual assault all we more afraid of what some people are worried about which is that that will be false accusations and innocent men will be have their lives destroyed by a false accusation so having a ... a false accusation\nUm would be when somebody is innocent but is thoughts is accused of being guilty and the other way is when somebody is guilty but isn't for you to be guilty and so it left off\nAnd that's really about whether your prioritizing the plight of victims of sexual assault or\nPrioritizing the plight of victims of sexual assault or the the potential innocence of men and we have to have discussion about that and about the fact that we're somehow prioritizing the the men who might be accused\nWere prioritizing them over the thousands and millions of women who are suffering sexual assault over time and so the question is are we going to do anything about that\nSo the next problem is a a question of black and white thinking and this happens a lot ... people get into arguments in extremes and so many of our arguments at the moment ton device is because we take extreme opposite positions instead of something more moderate and between\nI'm so there is a an argument's around saying something like ... you are making everyone into a rapist or what one that professor lung but set on his book that that we are kept rising just spin the both will crimes ... rape\nAnd that's taking very black and white view of thinking but we're calling all forms of sexual assaults and harassment rape which is not what is happening there is a scale I'm Better off ... the uh as bad as rape and there are other things that are bad but ... not as bad as rape\nWhich comes takes us to the issue of false equivalence is and stroll puffing arguments where you can take that falls equivalents and then you can declare while using everyone has a rapist which is not what people are saying\nOr your ... some people say you're saying any woman should be able to destroy the life of any mind justify accusing him ... sexual assault\nWhich again is a very extreme position that I don't think that anyone really is taking 'em ... finally\nThat anyone really is taking\nI'm finally um that's the question of knowledge and alternate hypotheses which comes up in scientific testing a little while you have to decide what you'll default position is meant to say you say in the absence of further evidence I'm going to take this default position and I'm going to wait until I found enough evidence to change my mind\nAnd the thing is that in\nA court case to trial it's very important because we're going to punish somebody badly for something so before we do that we should be very sure that they deserve to be punished whereas in the case of a Supreme Court\nAppointments than what we're doing is we're giving something something very good and important and so we should be very sure that they deserve that very good an important thing\nIn that case one might argue that that that situation could be negated by one bad thing happening whereas in the case of a trial\nBe we should nuke we should not punish somebody if there is some doubts about whether they should be punished which means if there is something something good to offset the showing us about the fact that they are bad\nAnd those are two they sound the same but that's slightly different situations that have a different ... situation [noise]\nCelebrating fifty five years of broadcasting from the University of Nevada Reno this is eighty eight point seven and Ninety One point seven K. U. N. army no Ninety One point five K. N. C. C. L. go it's noon\nNPR and W. B. U. R. I'm Jeremy ... I'm Robyn Young it's here and now another ten day this morning that Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court\nWas voted to to a final floor vote tomorrow that could happen as soon as tomorrow morning but senators can change their vote tomorrow so the drama has been will date a key swing Senator Jeff flake voted yes in today's procedural votes says he will vote yes to the nomination tomorrow unless something big changes\nAnd Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no today\nSomething big changes and Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no today so she will again tomorrow telling reporters that Kavanaugh is a good man but not the right man for the court at this time\nAnd right now we're waiting for another key swing senator Maine Republican Susan Collins to make a statement she voted yes to end debate today but may soon say how she actually plans to vote\nTomorrow Collins is going to be speaking on the Senate for momentarily and we will bring that speech to live when it happens but as we wait we're joined in the studio by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg and NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow a welcome to both of you know what are you expecting and the next few minutes [laughter]\nIf I if I had a crystal ball believe me\nI would've said when I was expecting before I this is one of those very dramatic moments because if Susan Collins says that she's going to vote no would Lisa Murkowski\nThen everything is on senator Manchin of West Virginia who's a Democrat in a very red state West Virginia and\nI have no idea whether these three people have been consulting each other the way they did actually up ... up until let's say ... a day or two ago but at the time when we were that all the stuff was going on about was they're going to be\nAny sort of an FBI investigation a mansion Collins Murkowski 'em and flake all were in constant touch with each other\nNow the question is Scott\nWhat do you think's going to happen I think there are a couple indications that that that college is going to vote for Kavanaugh the fact that she she viewed the FBI investigation is very thoroughly\nFor Kavanaugh the fact that she she viewed the FBI investigation is very thorough unlike Democrats who said that it was woefully short and the fact that she just had lunch with Mitch McConnell and McConnell apparently emerged from the lunch saying he felt very confident about how the boats going to go he did not look like a leader suddenly scrambling to get the nomination across the finish line\nWho would you would want to be the meaner Scott just to remind us what's the math here tomorrow I mean what what how you know what happens if there's a time when a limbo changes as we said right now it's fifty one forty nine to nearly ... ... what do we let you got\nYour guy and then it man on the Senate is divided fifty one forty nine Republicans at fifty one seats Democrats have forty nine seats at today's a cloture vote was a party line vote with two exceptions Murkowski hopped to the Democrats to vote no mansion hop to the Republicans to vote yes\nSo if there's one more no votes and there was today and it's fifty fifty then vice president Mike Pence comes and breaks the tie which would certainly be unprecedented for a Supreme Court confirmation vote\nScott as you watch this and the decisions that the senators are making\nIt does appear from the outside that their own futures are in their minds more than anything else perhaps that they're thinking about whether this whether it's Joe mansion or whether it's Susan Collins or or others that they're thinking about what it means for them politically coming up in the midterms\nAbsolutely uh Joe mansion that's the case more than anyone else Joe Manchin is a Democrat running for reelection in West Virginia where President Trump is wildly popular\nHe somebody who supported a Trump's last nominee Neil Gorsuch and uh before before the Ford allegations arose look very likely to vote for judge Kavanaugh mansions in a tough spot and I really don't think he wants to be viewed as the decisive vote but that's where he\nTough spot and I really don't think he wants to be viewed as the decisive vote but that's where he is because if you go if you vote for cabinet if he helps get Kevin on the on the court at the loan Democrat and a decisive vote\nDemocrats will will blast him and and and maybe abandoned him over the next few weeks but if you know then uh then he might lose a lot of support and innovate Oregon President Trump's very popular\nYou guys are looking at pictures outside Susan Collins office\nRight now uh it's packed you know tons of people there and of course that you you will know they've been people in the corridors of the capital you know for the last couple of weeks but huge crowd there now\nI'm just your thought because everybody the same sort of new territory and what happens if the vice president has to break a tie what what's your thinking about Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh heading towards the Supreme Court potentially it sounds like you know most likely\nA tie vote that honor the virus on on the Thai yeah I'm sure that he and Mitch McConnell\nWill think that that is better than losing\n'em and that he will go there and people will forget\nThat it was a tie vote or that the vice president broke the tie on and I I don't actually think that that it may be significant in some historical sense but given the number of rules that have been changed or broken in the last\nTwo years to get through first Neil Gorsuch when I'm Republican leader McConnell a lead the fight and it wasn't much of a fight because they had the votes to get rid of the filibuster rules so that\nYou could confirm somebody with a simple majority instead of needing sixty votes so that was the first one then\nNeeding sixty votes so that was the first one then there were all the rules that were broken or ... or\nLong term a customs of consulting senators from states over a lower court judge ships and the Trump White house stopped doing that in many cases and then there were all the rules about the number of people who could be considered at one time that used to be one or two\nAt most in a single hearing now is you know a half dozen two dozen sometimes so when it comes to judge ships\nThe Republicans who have had locked down control of this process have changed a lot of rules just having the vice president cast\nThe deciding vote I I think would not rank high among them\nWas actually going to ask someone who's seen as a partisan a you know that that a tie had to be broken but also that you have a retired chief justice Stevens come out and say he was against him or you have you know he's someone who I\nThink you tell me I'm like recent nominees actually worked in the political realm in the Bush White House ah was accused of handling other controversial nominations of judges William prior and Charles Pickering and saying he wasn't involved in an email showed he was involved\nI'm going to have to ask you to hold that thought because I think\nWe do know is man sergeant armed forces stand until this [noise] ... order and

international space station had to abort their launch after a booster rocket malfunctioned\nThe made an emergency dissent back to earth and are happy to report both are doing well both landing safely Rachel Feldman science editor of popular science issue to bring us up to date on the launch and other select Detroit subjects in Science Welcome back right Joe\nThanks for having me Ira anything more about what went wrong there yeah so we know that about two minutes into the launch there was some kind of booster failure and they\nTwo minutes into the launch there was some kind of booster failure and they had to undergo what's known as a a ballistic landing a ballistic descent which is so called because\nUsually they add make kind of um [noise] a shallow angle as they come down to create a little bit of left and take away some of the um\nThe the force on on the astronaut string landing and this is where the rocket is really coming down more like a projectile and this has happened before but only ever um during landings which of course appears a lot less dramatic because uh they were supposed to come back down to the ground and the first place\nSo this is the first time they've ever had to make a such an aborted landing during a launch and um the Russian space agencies that immediately they would begin investigating and uh so far that that's all we know\nOne of the good news about it is that it worked right [laughter] right [laughter] right and again this is a rare but the kind of things that astronauts\nTrain for all the time it's not something that happens a lot but certainly one of the procedures that they are expected to uh occasionally encounter so you know not something we want to have happen but something that is certainly on the roster of things they have learned how to handle\nWere were ... with the Soyuz capsule being the only way for humans to reach the international space station isn't this now or you know a little bit of a problem is no other way to get up\nRight so there are um I Believe three so use missions planned that are now kind of up in the air because the Russian space agency again is undertaking this investigation and so it's possible some of those\nIs undertaking this investigation\nAnd so it's possible some of those will be put on hold and even if they're not uh you know those two crew members who were counted on who are now on the ground instead of on I assess a minute there's there's probably going to be a gap in staffing you know we have three people on the space station right now\nBut they're scheduled to come back in December now they could extend their stay a bit but the Soviets capsule they have up there that's going to bring them home\nI Believe it's only I can only stay up there through some time in January so\nUh that's the longest there'll be able to say before coming back down and that means that the space station probably will be an crude for some amount of time which is something that we know should be possible there are procedures in place for it but I don't believe it's ever happened before\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow\nThere is less than a month until the mid term

break into voting machines so what are the real risk\nTake into voting machines so what are the real risks to our voting infrastructure happen we security systems how does all of this affect voting

seven to four to five five\nEight four for ... you can also tweet us ... what concerns you most about voting security heading into these terms\nLet me bring on my guests Lawrence Norden is a deputy director of the Brennan Center Democracy Program at New York University Welcome to science friday\nThanks Ira You're welcome Charles Stuart the third is a professor of political science and the founding director of the election data and science lab at MIT welcome to science friday\n... and it's nice to have you um Larry I mentioned the Russians hacking during the last presidential election what areas where the Russians or whether hackers compromising and what were they they trying to do there\nI'm not sure that we know in tire Lee what they were trying to do for first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um [noise] there's a lot of\nConversation about Russian interference in the election and two thousand six team over there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned out one of these\nAttacks on the election infrastructure um but there's also um [noise] that kind of political purchased a political ads social media propaganda and attack on campaigns and their emails those are those are two separate things or if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself or we saw them\nFor focusing on the election infrastructure itself\nA we saw them targeting a voter registration databases are again not entirely clear what they were trying to do there and um and and of course voter registration databases are the rules that had the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote\n'em and um there were phishing attacks against um [noise] uh election officials we know that um it looks like at least one or election systems vendor which uh manufacturers e pull books was attacked but I think\nUm we don't we don't know exactly what was going on I'm unclear or just that there was certainly a lot of I'm\nLooking around on their part\nWas that was that the vendor company that was putting the see anywhere on the on the machines as maintenance but the softer wasn't taken off [noise] is that what you're talking about in that case or is it something different\nYou know know what I'm Talking about is um uh there there is a company the our systems my actually I think they may still [laughter] they may still a U.S not have confirmed whether or not there there certainly was an attempt to hack them\nI'm ... and again they manufacture IPO books and and deal with registration databases\nUm electronic publics or what you can kind of what our use their off in a a tablets or or ... or or computers that are used to check people in\n'em and uh uh as I said I laughed I checked I think they have they they moved in either direction we successfully breach but at least in one of the Muller indictments there was an indication that there was\nSome dinner and it sounded like them or that that was actually breached\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine be compromised\n[noise] well um [noise] ah well that's actually quite a controversial\nQuestion if you ... you mentioned um well so let's start off by making distinctions and I am and Larry really helped um I'm making the distinctions among the Russians um what they were doing in various ways um\nYou know perhaps to influence the elections ranging from um affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think um\nIf we're asking about um what can be done to hack into say machines and systems um in the first um distinction we would make is between you know the voter registration systems which I'm wary was just talking a bit about 'em you alluded to at the Twenty one states\nUm they got attacked those are voter registration systems um and then there are the voting machines themselves which can either be electronic voting machines that are used in several states um\nOr potentially the scanners that are used to scan\nScan paper ballots and if we're thinking about voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners um that's actually the answer that question is actually quite um quite controversial you made a reference to the death con um activities and\nSo what we do know is that if you have um access to I'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerabilities are well known\nThat um you know a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine and do things to it um the\nUm what election officials will say is that first of all I'm In general the machines that have been broken into and DEF CON I'm either had been retired or in the process of being retired and then secondly um that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated\nOn um either had been retired or in the process of being retired and then secondly\nUm that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be successful against these machines um require such a degree of direct access that in order to have a actually ineffective attack on them um and you would need some sort of inside job\nUm that would require 'em a lot of attention to particular machines and would it be easily detected and so um but I mean I think that's where the controversy is that um it's my sense that the computer science community thing is it's easier\nTo actually affect this type of kind of brute force attack against on the the guts of the voting machines than the election officials to\n... hour they right um well I mean I tend to kind of um if I have to go with one side of the other I tend to my take on it is\nI'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about what the um the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities and are taking 'em um are are taking steps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that\nUm the election officials that that are using electronic machines especially the ones that don't have any sort of paper record of the election being there in a position where they have to say well you know given everything we do to try to protect the machine is physically we're confident that\nThey're not being attacked and we're confident because of the logic and accuracy testing we're doing\nThat um there were mistakes made\nBut a skeptic can I think rightfully so even if you think the election officials have done everything they could I think there is still room for a skeptic to say yeah but wouldn't it be great if one could independently verify\nThat the machines weren't monkey with and there were mistakes and the programming so um so I I tend to you know I I tend to fall on the side of thinking that the machines right now for twenty Eighteen are well taken care of\nAnd are highly unlikely to be subject to the sorts of attacks that we see it\nThe Eighteen are well taken care of and are highly unlikely to be subject to the sorts of attacks that we see a DEF CON but it would but who it would be good for the state's the move and directions to make it easier to demonstrate the skeptics that that was\nI I if I could just jump in real ... point um [noise] I I\nI I think there to to build on on what Charles just said ah I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about\nUm uh problems with them and potentially somebody reaching them in various ways but but I'm more importantly there's there there's a lot of the election infrastructure of course that is connected to the Internet um and an example of that my an obvious example was election night reporting which comes out\nUm and that's how we get the unofficial results although we don't call them that on election night very quickly um that comes up on on websites and gets report it out and uh uh we we have seen in fact not in the United states\nOr that I Know of but in other countries ... election reporting attacked um and um if if you get ... incorrect numbers there in in the environment that we have today the hyper partisan environment where there is\nUm a lot of false information put out on social media ... I was talking earlier about that level of interference from the Russians and the two thousand sixteen election casting doubt on election outcomes if you don't have as a as we don't in in in a Thirteen states at least in in some polling places and Thirteen states\nA paperback up that you can go back to afterwards and say\nYeah maybe there's been out cast on these elections but we can go back and we

number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to one point five degrees compared to two degrees or more\nThe conclusion every bit of warming even that full point five degrees matters here to break down the report\nAnd tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years is that to Kelly the Vin she is senior associated with the world resources Institute Dr living welcome back to science friday\nThank you so much to be with you\nI Want to send out a shout out to our listeners began with this question as we barrel toward a one and a half degree increase in global temperature are you worried are you worried about climate change impacting where you live give us a call our number eight for for\nSeven to four to five five eight four four seven to four to five five\nYou can also tweet us at ... fry 'em so back to live in the the the goal is to prevent it to a degree increase in average global temperatures but this report tells us\nThat even a one point five degree increase is gonna bring some pretty big changes\n[noise] yeah that's absolutely right said that um how's it going to actually has these two ...\nThat's absolutely right so the Paris Agreement actually has these two goals as you said\nTo limit warming well below two degrees and pursue at first for one point five degrees Celsius of warming and that was because for some of the most vulnerable countries you can think about small island developing states on one point five degrees Celsius is also going to harm wellbeing to a tremendous extent\nSo what this report did was look at what are the differences between warming of one point five degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of warming and how much harder is it to get to one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to two degrees Celsius and they found that indeed we are definitely not on track\n'em and and the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference\nAnd for example [noise]\nSo for example on what they found is they look across a number of different systems and they found a for example for extreme heat the percentage of the global population exposed to a severe heat wave which we've already started to experience with one degree of warming on at least once every five years is two and a half times worse\nWith two degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming\nIf you think about on sea ice free Arctic in the summer um when you don't have any ice on top of the Arctic\nOr this could happen at least once every hundred years with one point five degrees Celsius of warming but at least once every decade under two degrees Celsius of warming and that could impact climate change even further because you have a dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth\nSea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one point five degrees and while that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to ... million\nOne point five degrees and while that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to millions more people\nBeing impacted a species losses um two times worse for both plants invertebrates that lose at least half of their range under two degrees of warming as opposed to one point five degrees of warming three times worse for insects\nI'm almost forty percent worse or under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the dark in the Arctic\nI said these are some really big numbers one of the most devastating and surprising wants to me was for coral reefs\nWhere the report found that under one point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of the further decline and coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent which is just tremendous\nYou know does it look like there's any way we're going to be able to stay on the bad to point zero degrees\nSo what the report finds is that both um two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible um there have been a lot of modeling studies where analysts come together and see what would have to happen um\nTo make that transition happened on right now a emissions are roughly fifty to get tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\nThey're projected to increase even with the climate change commitments that we've made under the Paris Agreement by twenty thirty\nInstead we essentially need to have that amount and go down to twenty five to thirty gig tons of carbon dioxide\nPer year by twenty thirty and then we actually need to phase out net admissions altogether by mid century so this is a tremendous transformation and the combination rates that are truly\nTremendous transformation and department is Asian rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about on it also would require behavioral and technological shifts across the board\nSo for example by twenty fifty we're talking about renewables projected to supply Seventy to eighty five percent of electricity\nOr to be able to me at one point five pathways we're talking about reducing energy demand\nIncreasing the efficiency of food production changing dietary choices\nUm a lot of different measures ah which were I'm just starting to do in certain locations but none of them we need\nA you know the president said he wanted to know quote who drew the reports I won't go there with that can you can you answer at least who commissioned do what they do they use [noise]\nThe way that the IPC she works on is on in this particular case under the Paris Agreement there was an accompanying decision and that decision\nOn requested the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental panel on climate change to put this report together\nOn and what the scientists do they commissioned about a hundred different scientists\nAnd had had a very lengthy review process of several different drafts being um reviewed publicly reviewed and I was one of the reviewers for that on the scientist basically assessed all of the recent literature and in this case on one point five degrees Celsius\nAnd see what the science says I'm up to a certain cut off point where the literature is published\nOn and then they put together a detailed technical analysis interestingly in this case on there's an accompanying summary for policymakers which was agreed upon in Korea um about a week ago and that all of the government\nPond in Korea um about a week ago and that all of the government signed onto including the United states and that is actually something that I'm negotiators come make sure that they feel comfortable with the um the implications for policy makers so in this case\nI'm part of the answer is that the United states I'm did actually indoors this report [noise] Mm\n[noise] oh we're a lot of people want to talk about it I'm going to go to the phones to Janice in South Carolina Janice [noise]\nYes hello so\nSo I'm an agriculture and I think what ends up\nConfusing people when you talk about one and a half degrees people are real excited about it\nWhat really hurts us in our culture is the high temperature the record highs so for example in the mid West is corn gets over Ninety five degrees Fahrenheit at night it kills the pollen and greatly reduced to view or in the Central Valley of ... of California when tomatoes\nWhen the pilot temperatures get very high over a hundred degrees that kills the pollen and so this is really critical of the er the highs not just the average temperatures and and I could fix this by growing more plants that's what the little ice age was about\nThe north America for a screw back for a hundred and fifty years after Columbus and all these trees took so much the ... atmosphere it's cool to play it at all so much we had all the little ice age and I wish more of the scientists will talk about that because we can we can substitute a lot of our renewables can be biofuel ...\nOther things like that that will instill make us grow more\nPlants and we can have them for food feed him till I play you are you a former [noise]\nNo I'm a researcher actually but I have a small farm and I'm the developer the energy to Burke which makes food for food feeding fuel all and the same maker and it uses little water and nitrogen and you know everybody thinks we're going to have some input Seattle to an atmosphere where all the plants will take it up if we switched to the renewables using plants\n... let me get a comment thanks thanks for your call\nPlants ... let me get a comment thanks for your call what about the kennel we saw some of the CEO to reverse some of the\nThings on ... some really good points here I think first on as um as you mentioned the one point five degree goal is for global average temperature increase so temperature increase at any one location especially on

broadcasting today from the studios of Casey ill you on the campus of California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks California\nLater in the hour a primatologist takes us into the world the south America's squirrel monkeys and what they teach us about our own evolution but first the Maya invented a sophisticated mathematics system that included the number zero zero how to be invented\nThey use this in their calendars and astronomical studies they also had farming systems in a complex political structure to govern the sprawling city networks it was a complicated place and the full story is getting even more complex\nLast month scientists surveyed a Mayan mega city in Guatemala that I had over sixty thousand structures and this week researchers say that the Maya may have also had a salt industry on the coast of president they believe\nThese results were published in the proceedings of the national academies of science here to tell us about the ... the economy is Heather mckell up she's an author on that study and professor of anthropology at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge welcome to science friday\nThank you it's a great pleasure to be here\nIt's a great pleasure to

using to make salt [noise]\nWell I like the people around the world of course everybody needs dietary salt in ancient\nCivilizations and other farming cultures as as well but uh the might have collected salt from salt flats off the north coast of the Yucatan but\nIn in other areas like the coast of belief where it rains a lot and you you they don't have the solar ... of operation

elsewhere on the coast and I was looking in shallow areas\nBecause in the water because I knew but we did that applied syllable rise and we found site said or about a meter below the sea floor and we excavated them and they had pottery that identified as salt making pottery\nHave been published a book on on the fine salt white gold of the ancient Maya but in two thousand and\nFour we made a major discovery and that was that below the sea floor it's mangroves Pete and the Pete which is resulting from feel of a rise a\nIt preserved within posts and now we've mapped over four thousand we actually

sat atop an American Jupiter rocket waiting her blast off into space\nMiss Baker was her name and after nine minutes of weightlessness she fell back to earth where she became an instant celebrity inundated with Leathers letters from school children and even then mobbed at a press conference as\nOne of the first two American Animals successfully launched into and return from space miss bakers flight was a study and how we humans might fare\nIn orbit in space but there's a lot to learn by studying these small cousins of ours right here on earth analyzing their communications the structures of their societies and the brainy wave that they navigate their world\nAs my next guest says the neatest stone assistant professor of biology at California Lutheran university here in Thousand Oaks welcome to science friday I think it's great to be here you know I remember a squirrel monkey that squirrel monkey for my childhood\nAs one of the first animals that went into space wow what what can you fascinated with study scores so\nI'm I'm from Brazil and uh I went to grad school here in the states and uh I knew that I Want it to work in the Brazilian Amazon for my research\nResearch and I started reading about square monkeys and became fascinated with them and then I saw them in the wild and it was just the perfect combination to look at the questions that I was interested in so off I went to um Amazon in Brazil for twelve months\nAnd I thought it would just be one you know one project one season but the more time I spent there the more I became fascinated with all kinds of questions about them\nAnd I couldn't find a lot of answers in the literature because there really aren't that many people studying them in the wild [noise]\nUm I kind of know why now after so many years there are a little bit of a pain to study they're very challenging [noise] um but yeah that's how it all started wow I'm\nA big show how many do you study how many of the group a number of your study\nYeah so um the groups are very large a there but my groups have thirty to fifty animals so I monitor to a sweet groups regularly\nAnd do you do they each have each personalities of the room and you give them names like you keep track of them\nSome square one of the challenges of working with ... monkeys is that because they're so small and by small I mean we're talking a kilogram max so that's about two pounds\nThere's fifty of them and they are they moved quite fast they're pretty active so it's not that easy to individually identify them I'm particularly the juveniles because they they kind of look very similar but there are some adults that stand out you know if they have a a certain more dominant\nOut you know if they have a a certain more dominant or forceful personality or yeah they do stand out okay give me a typical day in the life of a squirrel monkey [noise]\nOkay so square monkeys wake up really early I'm usually by five AM they're already moving out of their sleeping tree and uh they spend a lot of time active uh all day they they're nonstop\nOr they eat a fruit and they eat mostly insects and so they spend a lot of time forging in the morning for insects but really that goes on all day\nWhen it gets a little hotter in the day they tend to rest but rest for a group of ... monkeys is about ten minutes [laughter]\nUm and then they keep on you know forging and um they don't go to sleep we followed them a pretty consistently and um they don't usually go to their sleeping tree until about seven ...\nFor their ... yeah or twelve hours I hear that they have a strange way of eating grasshopper\nYes so grasshoppers are one of their favorite uh items so to speak and um they catch these pretty large grasshoppers sometimes and the way they do it the way they handle it once they grab it is they hold it by the bottom\nAnd a with a head up and then they bite off the head\nKind of like an ice cream cone and then they slurp the insides and then finally they'll eat the legs and the wings sometimes and they seem very happy while they're doing it\nWow [laughter] and I understand and an artist\nAnd to attack a ... a ... [noise] wait why don't why haven't they do that\nYeah so I've only seen adults do it but I actually seen it quite a bit so what what they do is they will approach a ... a particular species\nAnd um they will knock it down very quickly to the ground so these are nest that Hank pretty low\nAnd once the adult lost desert the nest the adult a squirrel monkey will basically move in and eat all the larvae that ... left abandoned in the nest\nWow so they're pretty brave they're pretty bad and patient inpatient [laughter] it was once we're not leaving so far right yeah I've done this myself we have a clip I'd like to play and then maybe you can translate for us what's going on here let's\nOf ... of of the other one of the spider monkey let's let's hear that clip\n[noise] I\n... I said spider monkey everybody does that ever is that right yeah okay tell us when we're listening to [noise]\nOkay so this was recorded in captivity um and what it sounds like to me is that these are contact calls but these are made by animals that are not very close by these are longer contact calls\nI'm so they're basically talking to each other from you know not not a very close spatial proximity\nCan can you actually tell the individual monkeys in there you can you recognize their own um I reckon\nAnd there you can you recognize their own um I can recognize\nYes um the the the sender and the receiver um but when there is you know ten of them in a tree it's kind of hard to figure out exactly you know who's who's making the vocalization\n... we have another clip that sound a little bit more how shall I put a contentious mhm [noise]\n\nOkay so that's definitely a little squabble um it doesn't sound like a serious fight to me like something we hear in the wild um my guess is that there was an adult male at least in there making one of the noises and my guess is that there is a quick fight over some food item\nYou know it's interesting as I was listening to that it just struck me that when we we see movies of jungles or you know that that that's so sad that we hear is that rises there there's usually this is those squirrel monkeys and we're listening to\nMy ... ... it might be birds actually because square monkeys sound a lot like birds when you're in the forest right um that's what my students usually notices that isn't that a bird and it's you have to listen to really closely to be able to identify that it's a group of square monkeys instead of bird\nHow hard was it how much time has it taken you to know the difference and to study this sounds they make\nIt's not something that I personally study but just from studying there for Eighteen years I'm from being with the monkeys um\nTeen years I'm from being with the monkeys um you just get used to it um it's it's probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations or but ah my field assistant who's a local field assistant he's\nThe monkey whisper and he knows everything about square monkey then so he can tell right away if it's a bird or a troop of monkeys\nHow long have you been doing it for a little longer\nHe started with with ah a couple of years before I got there so he's been doing it for about Twenty years\nThe monkey whisper yeah well do you call him a yes sometimes be busy like it he loves it [laughter] is there anything that we can learn about the human language for evolution of our language from from studying them the squirrel monkey\nYeah so um it's interesting that you bring that up because I'm so there's a hypothesis that was proposed about Twenty years ago called the vocal grooming hypothesis\nAnd um the idea here is that you can try to understand the evolution of human language so the idea that humans started living in social groups that we're increasingly large and so manual grooming sort of the the kind we seen bad dunes andme attacks\nBecame less less feasible really and so the ideas that humans would have invented an alternative form of grooming vocal grooming so it would be a way to maintain contact and social bonds with their their friends\nUm and that would leave the hands also free for other tasks um and the ideas that that is\nOther tasks um and the idea is that that eventually would have evolved into human language now square monkeys for living in groups so group so large they're actually\nPretty a social they don't grooms we expect primates all to do that but they don't actually groom each other they to live in social groups that are large um they don't groom and they talk all the time they're constantly chattering there it's nonstop sound when they're forging when they're traveling\nCertainly hope you enjoy and of course don't forget to take us with you it eight point seven Ninety One point seven day you went on [noise]\n\nIs science friday I'm Ira Flatow you know every year salmon and go on the most important journey of their lives after living years in the wild\nWild oceans they must win back to the coast to one very particular river mouth and then ... miles of tributaries branches upstream until they finally finally arrive in the little freshwater spring where they were born how did he do this and well like in\nAny good trip yeah you need a map and not just a compass that's just telling you wearing north is also need to know the location of the place you're going to get to is it straight nor does in more north east east than south well you know a few years ago researchers concluded\nThat what did they had long suspected that Pacific salmon can detect the magnetic field lines of the year their map is they're magnetic\nKind of the your beer map is they're magnetic and what about their Olympic willing cousins and when you look fishy living quiet landlocked lines you know lived their whole lives with dozens of generations landlocked what happens to that map\nHere to explain Moore's Michelle Scanlon a faculty research assistant Oregon State University in Corvallis welcome to science friday\nThank you for having me you know I just I just said about but\nSalmon living impressive lives right they travel all that way how many miles do their journeys take\nThat is pretty impressive and their journeys can be hundreds or even thousands of miles to their oceanic forging grounds\n... and then they usually actually these tiny streams miles inland and I have to go back there that's correct and they don't just have to navigate upstream may have to find the right stream to go how does he do this they they don't have a well maybe they do have a GPS of some sort in\nThis size than have a diverse array of tools that they use in order to navigate and so when they reached streams uh they generally would use their sense of smell\nBut in terms of the oceanic journeys and voyages they use something more broad scale and in this term we think they're using magnetic maps and they make information\n... now I Know that your research is looking at a different group of salmon the Atlantic salmon what what makes them so interesting to you\nIt was rather interesting opportunity because the Atlantic salmon that we use for this study are actually descendants\nOf individuals that were transferred from a landlocked lake\nMaine to a landlocked lake in Oregon over sixty years ago for recreational fishery\nTransferred from a landlocked lake in Maine\nTo a landlocked lake in Oregon over sixty years ago for recreational fishery so these fish have never had access to the Pacific ocean and have never sat thin outside of a lake or in the instance of our fish outside of hatchery\n... and ... and yet you round but they still have the Jew magnetic maps in them that they would have needed that they knocked ... that's correct and and how were they able to retain these and why\nThat's an interesting question a so Salman when they use magnetic information they can use in different aspects of the magnetic field especially for maps and so the earth's magnetic\nField has a couple of different components one is the strength of the magnetic field or also known as magnetic field intensity and so those intensities are stronger at the polls and weaker at the equator\nAnother aspect of the field that they can use is called a inclination angle and that's the angle at which magnetic field lines intersect the surface of the earth and so they're steeper toward the polls and shallower at the equator and both of these components predict or favorably\nAre predictably variable across the surface of the globe\nSo it's super convenient because these gradients of intensity and inclination angles aren't parallel so they form a type of by coordinate grid over much of the earth and so animals can actually derive both latitude and longitude all information from the magnetic field\nTo have little magnets in their bodies that can do them\nSo they're the mechanisms behind lag NATO reception are are still unclear but it's\nOf the leading hypotheses is that a salmon and other species have tiny chains of\nIt's one of the leading hypotheses is that\nA salmon and other species have tiny chains of magna tight and that is an iron oxide mineral that has magnetic properties\n... and so these chains of mango tight are associated with nerve cells and the thought is that these chains can be pulled by or strength magnetic fields\nAnd so changes in both the field strings and or the inclination angle can result in action potentials\nSo these structures are thought to be found in the nose and also the latter alliance all along the sides of the body of a fish but the ... meter receptor itself a is still elusive\nMhm now why why is it important to you why why does it matter that they can still detect these\nFew\nWell it's a rather interesting question that we wanted to know whether landlocked numbers of species that\nCould go to the ocean retain a map sense just to a point of curiosity\nAnd we also wanted to know um if it lent examine\nAlso possesses ability it's another group of individuals that does ethnic maps of diverse ... know amounts of species but we also wanted to know what happens when you test animals in novel sort of magnetic\nEnvironments one can they even detect the magnetic field but to can they actually differentiate between those fields and three how do they actually respond\nMhm and so how did you go about testing research\nThe eggs from the individuals at the lake in Oregon were transported to the organ hatchery Research Center where they were rewritten subsequently tested\nAnd so we tested these individuals' using a series of magnetic coils and essentially it's a series of wouldn't frames that are wrapped in copper wire\nAnd when you touch copper wires to an electrical\nIt's a series of wouldn't frames that are wrapped in copper wire and when you attach copper wires to an electrical power supply and crank electric current through the magnetic coil a byproduct of that\nElectricity is a magnetic field and the really cool part about are coils is that allows us to\nAlter the direction and also the average of current in order to allow us to simulate magnetic fields from almost anywhere on earth\nMhm so what you're doing I Know for my basic physics you know in grade school of if I take a magnetized object and put it next to some mentally will magnifies the mental in a certain direction\nSo that sounds to me basically what you're doing to the Fisher you magnify them setting beer magnetic structures up to to know where they are in a certain direction\nIf that were present them with magnetic fields essentially that hopefully interact with what we think are these tiny chains\nOf NATO tight right that right somehow connect with an herself right and and so having a fish respond to this\nSo we evaluate the movement fish movement by censoring the fish in the ... so there's a a platform with a bunch of testing arenas we have one fish Purina and then we have cameras that are mounted above those testing arenas to give us a bird's eye view of the test subjects during the trials\nSo what this means is that we are generating thousands of photos of our fish and so we take photos and we assess the position of the fish is head relative to magnetic north\nWow\nThat's terrific guy and you know um do do you know how good the resolution they have is I mean how just how accurate they can be to these magnetic fields\nSo I mean you know how just how accurate they can be to these magnetic fields\nThat is a question for future research so we don't know the how finer core scale the night with those maps is yeah\nSo what so ... speaking of looking forward what would you like to do what kind of other experiments or equipment would you like to have to test these fish again\nSo we have a whole number of experiments that we have talked about over the years but one of the experiments would be to actually look at night and magnetic resolution of this map so having a theory that points moving them closer and closer together and to see how finer core scale their responses actually are\nSo uh could could you save endangered salmon man by knowing some more about them\nI mean it always helps to know more information about us bases that you're trying to conserve them knowing how they're making movement decisions would certainly be helpful and probably a tool and Sam and conservation but certainly not the only thing\nThat we can ... them yeah well good luck to you and your future experiments All right thank you very much

of C sections happening all over the world listen to this worldwide rate\nHas nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent\nIn the past Fifteen Years and in the United states one out of three per se is by C section how\nA series of studies in the journal the Lancet looked at this trend to see what is behind is uptick what are the effects on mothers in babies\nAnd what into ... can be done to decrease that number and that's what we're going to be talking about C section rapes globally also what's happening here in the U.S and my question for your listeners is did you or your partner you get a C. section\nWhat factored into that decision what was your experience like you can phone it in or you can tweet us our phone number\nA poor for seven to for eight to five five you can tweet us ... fry let me introduce my guest Holly Kennedy's an author author on that a Lancet series he's also professor of midwife midwifery\nAt the Yale School of nursing thank you for joining us today alec enemy\nThanking a tell us the Lancet series looked at a hundred and sixty nine countries an overall there is a rising C section rates can you give us some of the numbers of different regions must have buried around the world\n[noise] well it does and and what we found was that over sixty percent of countries overuse C sections and twenty five percent under use that weren't procedure so there's a quite a disparity and there are multiple reasons and part of it has to do with um\nThe and sort of socio cultural acceptance of surgery is enormous um thing to do\nExcept in sub surgery is enormous um thing to do part of it has to do with um insurance and um access\nAnd a and a large part of it has to do with um women not being able to get a ... birth after they've had their first this area and so it it's it's it's complicated we've seen the rise I'm\nIn a particularly in North America Western Europe Latin America and the Caribbean for example in Latin America it's gone from thirty two percent to forty four percent\nAnd um it it there's a bit of a paradox when what we would call 'em\nToo much too soon and too little too late so in the countries that overuse says area and they are probably intervening too much in low risk women that really don't need the procedure and in countries such as in Africa that um\nDon't have enough to access probably are under using it for the world Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about ... about right\nSo when you you think about one in three women in the United states having 'em as this area and we're way\nOver was talking about over by us there's it's just to for example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital getting C sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there\nWell I Can't speak specifically to you know the the interaction but\nBut you write women who are wealthier who have insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have a C. section and it's and it's and accepted normative part of the culture\nIt's an accepted normative part of the culture in in Brazil\nMhm are there are big differences within countries in China the rate ranges from what ... percent sixty two percent depending on the province [noise]\nExactly and again that has to do with access and a wealth education um interestingly enough I'm women that are have greater education are more likely to have this as area and and um which is a bit of a paradox in itself because\nI'm ... says area and is not a low risk um surgery it is it's a major surgery and and things are\nThere are small but serious risks are both with the immediate surgery and then later in terms of the scar and still birth and preterm birth leader and with um subsequent pregnancies and it's one small part of the piece of ... of the puzzle in the United states were increasing maternal mortality rate\n... you mentioned at the in some places there's too much in some places not enough what are those not enough places like\nAnd why they're not enough places are places that don't have access in particularly in Africa and and countries that have lower resources so they just don't have the facilities to to do is his area and sometimes when a woman really needs it and I think it's important to to staying at the outside there are women\nWho and babies that that it is a life saving procedure but it it's not one that should be done for the majority of women\nI Want to focus on a little bit about what's happening here in the U.S and why she sections are increasing\nIt's happening here in the U.S and why C sections are increasing your Tony Golan it'd be\nVice chair of quality in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center in Boston Welcome to science friday Dr going thank you for having oh let's let's talk about this um\n... there's also this idea of of planned C sections right the do the do you have to approach this do you have ... have you seen there's been your experience\nIt's quite interesting I think there's a natural suspicion that this is a major contributor to the C section epidemic and the ... and the United states at this point and well it's true that a family's women can request to have a delivery biases area and\nIt turns out that that's not really the most significant driver I'm In our experience at Beth Israel Deaconess for example which is\nA tertiary care institution academic hospital I'm In the middle of Boston I it really only contributes to about one percent of our deliveries per year\nSo while some of this could be attributed to patient opinions are patient desires or their perceptions of what safer\nUm the truth is is that I think that we as health care providers need to um realize that we are probably the major major contributors to the rise in Syrian delivery right here in the U.S\nWhen you say health care providers you're talking about the doctors who actually are performing and\nYeah uh so certainly the doctors the obstetricians um they're the ones who make the recommendation versus area and I'm at the end of the day on that who's responsible on it's a complex and\nThat's who's responsible um it's a complex environment to practice obstetrics so there are other things that put pressure possibly on obstetricians um we had incomplete somewhat inaccurate data about health and fetuses during labor that might contribute to our decision making\nOn the progress string labor in terms of the cervical dial a nation I is subjective so that can contribute to some inaccuracy\nThere's other things that happened on our unit that might put pressure on us other emergencies that might be happening on a labor and delivery unit that might put some pressure on us to make quicker decisions to move toward delivery\nBut at but at the end it's really our decision I'm as obstetricians to make that recommendation and generally speaking when we make a recommendation like that on patients and families do say yes um and they ask questions but they generally do say yes\nAnd a highly what's your reaction to\nAll I Would completely agree with her that the culture of the unit\nWhere a woman who's giving birth is very instrumental um there's a number of strategies we can do to promote of a first time mother having a bad gentle birth and but you have to have the staffing you have to have the commitment to do the kind of care that's going to help her\nAnd her physiology two two best achieved ... birth\nLet's go to the phones let's go to northern Kentucky Hi Lauren welcome to science friday\nIra thank you You're welcome good\nThough I had an emergency thirty why leave 'em and I think are that are that are available [noise] um but when I got pregnant\nAnd I would super thankful for that for that ... me [noise] um but when I got pregnant for a second time I really wasn't given the option of having that occurred after the section [noise] um I kinda had to do all of that\nUm education investigation on my ... I had to look at the website I had to look at rates and what were the risk for me and my DVD you took pregnancy and um it really was up to me it was um like my provider\nAll that you want to have a repeat of the time I was like oh sure I'll have a repeat that but I wasn't given the risks and benefits of those that to be able to make a truly educated decision um and so I think that um I was able to\nI actually had an extra ... heat and then I changed my mind at thirty six and my provider with really awesome with that and I was able to have you back but I feel like there wasn't a lot of information given to me by my provider I really had to search ... okay in a lot of the information\nWas very emotional and it was really hard to find the facts\nAre learning ... let me get let me get rid of its great great call when we get a quick reaction atone even ... you know I'm truth be told I mean she should [laughter] and I'm One of three you back in the day everybody had to have one ... one after another and born was sort of thing you know I didn't know that maybe I didn't have to have\nGreat weather ahead certainly help you get a chance to enjoy it and the great outdoors you're listening decay when [noise]\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we've been talking this hour about the increase in the number of C sections and what that means for women's health\nMy guests are Dr highly Kennedy professor of midway free at the Yale School of nursing next to Tony going vice chair of quality in a department of of a statue tricks and gynecology at the famous Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and lots lots of folks on on the line let's see we only uh gosh I Can't get to everybody let me ask you how you you worked in research midwifery in the u._k.\nHow you you work in research midwifery in the u._k. how does the approach beer compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nWilling in it a differs in several ways and actually when the land this Lancet series on C. section came out the W. World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help\nHelp us look at decreasing says Erin's and and one of the things that they have recommended is what the UK does which is to have a collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have a midwife and some women have an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed\nIn the Lancet also published a series on midway free very extensive review of the evidence and they found that midwifery was a a sociology with improved outcomes increase the including decreasing C sections and so one what I'd like to just mention is in the United states\nThat study came out this earlier this year that mapped\nThe integration of midway free across each state to see how how friendly the state was in a regulation um and reimbursement independent practice to midwifery practice and so you look at the at New Mexico which has the lowest C section rate of of just about Eighteen percent\nTwenty six percent adverse are attended by mid was in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent adverse are attended by midwives and then they met that with outcomes and if\nYou look at Alabama Alabama has some of them\nComes and if you look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst maternal and infant outcomes in the country and only one percent of births are attended by mid was so that's not a causation it as an association type study\nBut it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um we do have a model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with their midwife midwifery knows then they feel respected um you have better outcomes\nA tornado when you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital dealing after a decade went from forty to twenty nine percent in a in a decade what did you do there\n[noise] well first we recognize that we had a problem and I think that's step one and trying to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence but the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications forces areas and focus very narrowly on primary says Erin I'm first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are in labor\nThat kind of monitoring called fetal heartbeat monitoring is very tricky\nIt's quite an accurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but does not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well\nAnd nonetheless obstetricians base decisions on this test um I often say that and no other area in medicine would we make surgical decisions based on such a on such a faulty test\nNonetheless it's ubiquitous and people use feel heart rate monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing the fetal heart\nTrying to focus on describing the fetal heart rate chasing using science and objective criteria rather than subjective words um we focused on our documentation our communication\nWe also really tried to make sure that people were using scientific modern definitions for progress in labor\nOr old definitions were assumed that women would move much faster and labor than newer more modern data really prove to us we wanted to make sure that people use modern definitions for what we thought was normal labor\nAs I mentioned earlier we focused on improving access on and uh and I'm enthusiasm for be back and then also some other operations issues for our unit to change the culture of our unit\nFrom misspoke here at the Beth Israel and to do with your family is from so blown down here in Boston and so there's this whole me now to the to the hospital you go to determines moralistic you'll have a C section Ina\nUnfortunately it does a and so uh one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on Syrian delivery rates is that if you look from one hospital to the next event separated by one or two miles from one another\nWho take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics\nThere's is there and delivery rates may vary by as much as ten percent\nThis is unexplainable by any other reason other than the environment the unit that you work in the people that you work with and the general enthusiasm for ... birth\nOr wherever tweeter vets relevant to this and services I have to wonder how much of the increase has to do with how much money insurance companies make on them versus a ...\nHas to do with how much money insurance companies make on them versus a typical delivery did did you study that in your your your report\nHolly [noise] well uh ... not specifically except that it is the recommendation is that the financial strategies women who are having more money or were wealthier we'll have more C sections so which implies that\nUm they can get you know reimbursed for that and one of the recommendations that the series made was to not pay more for this area and to really um level that playing field in it and in addition to liability reform\nUm many in studies that I've conducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do a C. section but all I can get sued if I don't do one\nIn in time or perceived to be in time [noise]\nYour your your shoe of reimbursement as is interesting here in the U.S a where by and large physicians are obstetricians do not get a a vastly different amount of money for ... delivery than necessary and delivery\nHowever the hospital does and that is something that I think isn't quite transparent for patients on and probably reimbursement itself\nDoesn't influence a lot of obstetrician decision making here and the U.S a reimbursement is greater but it really goes more toward the hospital side because of the length of today and let's go to Sharon in Somerville Mass Hi Sarah\nHigh um I've had two C sections and um they\nHi I'm\nI've had two C sections and um they were mandated by the doctor due to complications from Crohn's disease and so I'm I really appreciate this nuance discussion but I just wanted to get a perspective of how this is actually playing out I'm\nAmong laypeople and patience and um I think a lot of the talk about this has become very anti woman um when I told people that I was having a plan C section\nDue to my chronic illness complications I had male friends think things like well are you sure you don't want to just labor for a little bit maybe you could just ask if he could labor for a little bit and I really interpreted that\nEnd of his questioning you know can I be a woman if I don't you know push the baby out ... and and that

their own vital parts of our ecosystem weather as food or pollinators are predators and they have another thing in common complex social behavior I think about the term hive mind right\nThis idea that all the individuals in a group are working together to keep each other alive in this crazy world\nBut how well does that actually work out what factors make a colony more or less successful\nAnd can individual behavior still tilt the hand of faith for the whole group\nOr the hives indeed legion\nMy next guest looked at these questions how his word is an associate professor at UC Riverside studying the lives of bumblebees and Noah picked a woman is an associate professor at UCLA looking at these social behavior of bees ants and even spider [noise]\n\nWhat did you know I if you ask everybody you they'll tell you that honeybees get all the attention right and but but\nIf you ask everybody you built tell you that honeybees get older your picture writing a book you've gravitated to bumble ...\nActually did my PHD in a honeybee labs are but I went rogue and worked on bumblebees instead I started when a PHD in two thousand six which is the year that the honeybee genome sequenced and when it was sequenced we suddenly had this tool kit that we could use to answer all kinds of\nReally cool molecular questions and honeybees and so I started fell in love with bomb will be use and wanted to develop something similar for them\nAnd compared to only bees bumblebees have a very different like photo right out of the colonies gets started\nFirst honeybees there what we call perennially social so they're always social uh there's never a point in their lives in the life of a honeybee queen\nOr she's living on her own but bumblebees are different um they have an annually social life cycle where queens in the late summer season new queens will emerge in the colony and he's queens will leave the nest on their own and they'll go off and mate and they over winter all completely on their own\nAnd then in the spring I these queens have to crawl out of there over wintering spot\nAnd start their own nests so they're spending most of their life living on their own and so even though there are social insects and they have queens and workers and this sort of complex social behavior they're also in a sense living like solitary insects are part of their life cycle to\nYou and you weren't brought on this show is with ...\nDid yes you'll notice from the get go that it looks a lot different than a honeybee nests it's really interesting because I'm to the best of our knowledge honeybees and bumblebees to actually share a common origin of sociology so we think that\nThe ancestor to both of these ... groups they shared an ancestor about a hundred million years ago and we think that that ancestor was social but since that time you know a lot\nMillion years ago and we think that that ancestor with social but since that time you know a lot can happen in a hundred million years and so they've all these differences and today they look really different the way the ... the way that they live\nAbout ... meanwhile honeybees are extremely social all the time right yes they are and we turned to confuse the two kinds of bees is having equals lifestyles all the time we really well to be\nTo be right well I consider honeybees is a ... and ... my lab actually studies ants um we do a little bit of work on honeybees but mostly focus and the ants and so\nSome of our work on honeybees is looking at how they forge and how different individuals in the colony contribute to forwarding ... home you're brought from ants were too jarring Jarvis harvest France from I'm here in California oh it's like for partially on the sidewalk since\n... slightly larger than what they are a little bit longer there but yeah and of course she than the ones you see on the sidewalk and why why are you interested in\nThese areas from the blacks are the true ... and and the nice thing about this this particular species is that they tend to move between ... sites\nSo a colony of five to ten thousand individuals will just when they decide to pick up and move from one site to another\nUm and it turns out that the structure of the nest it determines how quickly they forward and how quickly they call their friends to food so another thing I brought here as in the cast and asked to flip it over I was on its head oh\nSo it was like that that's a cast of a an an Smith yes you is that like pouring plaster Paris\nIt's exactly fast their players from Home Depot how far does that go down as just the whole life\nExactly fast their players from Home Depot how far does that go down as just the whole length I Know that's just the top part\nAbout six or eight inches long it looks from just describing for audience but it could go much deeper than that\nYeah so you can pour down other materials we did when ... um which is a type of metal said when you heat it up like water and so it slows down much deeper and then when it's hard to it's easier to dig around and it will break like the plaster\nAnd so we can see that it goes much much deeper probably a few feet down and it depends on the environment to so and then my mentor I said he was the these there's a lot of fraud so that determines how deep they can go\nThrough so much focus on queen bumble bee is what about the drones and the workers can they make a difference in whether a colony succeed\nNot the drones said the ... the drones don't do too much for the call any itself they don't do much work um but the workers are definitely important to you we're focusing mostly on queens in my lab because they have this part of their life or they're living on their own and\nWe've done a few studies now that show that cleans are actually very sensitive during that stage uh so it's an important point to to study\nSomething that ... that when I was reading about this and there were those really amazing is that when we talk about honeybees we know that to make a queen or what something called royal jelly but that's not what the bumblebees do we how do you make a queen\nFor the most part we don't know I guess what we do know is that it looks we know what happens during larval development so just like in honeybees and there's a some point\nDuring really early larval development where a female larva she can start becoming a cleaner worker and if you think about the implications for that and what will happen to her and what she might do in her life is completely different depending on this one or the other sorts\nShe might do in her life is completely different depending on this one or the other search trajectory\nUm and we know it has something to do with food and buy movies we know that it's something that they're they're either getting more food or they're getting more food at a very specific point uh but we think that there are probably also factors in order to just like there are and honeybees\nAnd bumblebees and people just have to look for them yet\nWell interesting lots of questions from the audience let's start right or were there on the rights or just go ahead please\nUm my um my mom is\nAllergic to me I was wondering if there was any way that you could dish extracted DNA from the bees and use it to like help heal\nHer when she gets styles that is a great question I'm allergic to be used to\nBack up first or do you work with ... and you're allergic so I'm allergic to honeybee okay but not by movies [noise] um that's a really great question so the the things that are in the venom that caused the\nTerrible reaction on that your mom would get if she were stung by being me to\nUm those a lot of those components are encoded by the genome of the bees and so if we sequence it and we learn more about what those factors are and they how they trigger an immune response I that there are researchers working on that to try to figure out how we can understand how the two things the immune system and the human and the victim and the B\nInteract interesting ... requests yeah great question but no longer answer also live in big groups with the queen how worried their lives different from something like a honeybee\nThere's a lot of species and so there's different types of sociology and um there's some similarities in some differences in first of all many of them live underground whereas these will and put their hives and say the same ...\nWhereas bees will and put their hives inside the famed three cavities\nAnd so that's one difference for example um they're interesting similarities for example both honeybees in some species advance will relocate from one site to another is so honeybees will go and look for a new nest site and can the way the shape of the\nEntrance of the cavity did they find in the side of the cavity will determine whether or not they're going to go there and certain other ends will also there's a species of ... that will look for\nCertain privacy is that again have small entrances and dark places or there's some similarities in some differences\nI think the size of the one thing there is some species that have a colonies that are only up to you know fifty or a hundred and then there's some that are thousands tens of thousands and even up to ... million so at least cutter\n... can be I have two million individuals\nAnd Justin aren't for Halloween I Know that you also started his social spider borders social spiders\nSo upset about more than forty thousand species of spider is only about forty species are so our social um\nAnd what happens is they are living groups and the reason we think they leave in living things groups and so that they can capture pray that is larger than them and so they ... do these kind of retreat structure is where they live and they raise their\nOffspring together so what you see behind me as a or a bunch of fame spider moms there actually each one is probably the size of a centimeter a centimeter half so half an inch or so\nI mean just taken with a macro lens and the small individuals or their babies that hatched from their ... um and so they take care of all these babies together what they're standing on is basically a little ... the bill and then they build another Web that's what we call the capture Web\nOf airplane seat sizes could lose all coming up for you to afternoon on all things considered on gay you in our [noise]\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow coming to you from the civic arts plaza in Thousand Oaks California [noise]\nThousand Oaks California [noise]\nHow did you sleep last night yeah me neither something about being in the wrong time zone always catches me off guard\nBut I Am not the only one I can see from the audience statistics about sleep in the United states among other countries aren't great fewer than two thirds of us are getting the recommended seven hours per night and you've probably heard by now that it's a bad idea to consistently lose disease\nChronic health problems acute cognitive problems the whole show bang but he's our ability to sleep more than just a product of our habits are schedules\nCould there be jeans at work my next guest says the answer is yes he's on the hunt for genes that regulate how will we sleep and how well we recover from last week\nAnd he's found one of these genes in a surprising place nowhere near the brain welcome back to tame appalling associate professor of integrative biology and physiology at the University of California Los Angeles [noise]\n'cause\nYou need to get seven hours of sleep at night that's what the usual requirement is yes\nFor um the majority of long term studies that have looked have found that if you get significantly less will significantly more than seven to eight point five hours a night then that doesn't work out well for you in time in a lot of trouble yeah\nGet like six if I'm lucky I get seven I Know someone who gets two hours a night and seems to be doing fine with that but you're saying\nSomeone who gets two hours a night and seems to be doing fine with that but you're saying that that\nWell that is that going in all honesty I'm of a six hour crowd myself why do we need to sleep and the first place that's one of the biggest questions actually is why it was one of the reasons I have a job actually [laughter] what we do know is that if you don't sleep adequately\nBad it impairs your health so they're kind of two categories of consequences if you're not getting sufficient sleep every day the first are where we can sort of short term\nSo many of you may stay up tonight after you leave here you may go hang out to a party or you just maybe for the kids not getting enough sleep tomorrow\nYour memory may not work as well you may have a harder time focusing on things you may make more errors when you try to do things that you normally do those tend to be um cognitive affects there are more longer term effects if you continue daily on a regular basis\nNot getting enough sleep than their health consequences I'm it impairs your immune system which makes you at higher risk for infectious diseases\nAnd it also increases your risk for chronic diseases like heart disease\nStroke and diabetes\nI mentioned about genetics and sleep what what is there about genes are they involved in sleeping\nAnd interestingly enough I think God genes are pretty much involved in everything we do ... what does it what\nAbout sleep what our genes control would it be the hour the than the number of hours the quality what what one of the genes do\nWhat we're trying to figure out um the interesting thing when you're talking about James is not just talking about how genes are expressed but you're talking about how they interact with the environment so I was like the ...\nTalking about how they interact with the environment\nSo I was like to point out the study of genetics is the study of genes and their expression but also the study of the environment if you want to understand how genes work then it's a pretty smart idea to try to understand how the environment works I'm from a kind of line of research that has shown that genes play an important role in timing sleep\nOn the time of day you prefer to sleep time of day you prefer to wake up but they also play an important role in consolidating sleep um we're awake most of the day\nOr sleep most of the night on what we're trying to understand our what genes are responsible for the restore the properties of sleep the things about sleep that preserve your memory and your ability to focus\nAnd the things about sleep then improve your health\nThe genes that regulate these aspects of sleep are still largely unknown and that's what my research is focused on\nNow what fascinated me about reading about your research also was that these genes that help with our control sleep or not in our brains they're not in our heads\nWell they're everywhere yeah um what they're expressed in the brain they're expressed in the body the gene that I focused on in my most recent study below one has expressed in the majority of tissues in which we have ... so the ... one is what's known as a clot seem\nYou have clocks in every cell in your body very real clocks in order for something to be characterized as the clock there has to be an input mechanism to set it\nIt has to be an end dodging the timing mechanism like gears I talked to my students about gives on the ... most of them don't lower collectors are [laughter] so I talk about their electronic mechanism in their phones that keep time it is an output mechanism that allows you to\nHi I have is an output mechanism that allows you to tell the time the majority of cells in your body have these clocks and we know that these clocks regulates sleep on for a long time we've been very interested in how these clocks of regulated sleep till we've looked primarily in the brain because the clock that regulates most of your behaviors in the brain\nAnd most of the things that drivers sleep or in the brain but what we found quite surprisingly was that the clocks and the skeletal muscle\nCan speak to sleep regulatory areas and the brain and tell your brain how to sleep more importantly how to recover from sleep loss and what do you mean how to recover\nSo the mechanism we study asleep homeostasis it kind of works like a thermostat if you set a thermostat to a certain temperature if it goes too low a turn the heat on your thermostat or the hit on the goes too high a thermostat turns the air on\nYour sleep process these works similar there's a certain amount of sleep that you need to function correctly every day\nIf you don't get enough sleep your body will try to compensate by having usually more if you get too much sleep will go on to the other direction the clock is the same as the clock on your thermostat in the morning it's set to go to one temperature\nIn the evening it says to go to another and works the same way in our bodies in the morning your clock tells you to wake up in the evening your clock tells you to go to sleep\nOn for a long time we suspected that the clock mechanisms are more involved in the ... mechanisms that allow you to recover from sleep loss and what we're finding in my research and the research of many that have come before me is that the genes\nThat are like the gears on the clock the genes that are responsible for timing\nAlso play a role in your ability to recover from now the U.S\nTiming also play a role in your ability to recover from those so when\nYou say the clock is that the the circadian rhythm we've been talking about the circadian\nClock that regulates your daily rhythms of behavior and physiology so we have a twenty four hour light dark cycle sun comes up in the morning goes down it might um synchronize are clock but if you were in a consistent lighting environment constant darkness\nI'm a constant light than clock will still continue to isolate it hasn't been dodging Tommy mechanism and it would isolate at a period or frequency close to twenty four hours\nQuestion over here you know I had a question about napping as I'm getting older I'm discovering that are really cool thing to have an ... [noise]\nHow might that play with the a clock that you're speaking of themselves\nSo napping is a is a very interesting phenomenon big fan of it by the way they win by yourself and that's all I Do have one of the great things about being a sleep researcher as if I take a nap and miles in the afternoon no one can complain you can write at all I mean I Know what I'm doing research [laughter]\nBut you're saying napping is important is the mapping is very important if you're not getting daily sufficiently and most of us to have\nOr have jobs or live in a busy environment may not be getting um sufficient sleep so if you're not then getting an afternoon nap an hour's usually was about recommended but anything from a half hour to an hour is healthy however you if you are getting sufficient sleep and you're still napping\nThat goes into hypersomnia which is like I said getting sleep too much so much that suggests that there may be an issue however in relation to the clock my lab is currently conducting studies\nHowever in relation to the clock my lab is currently conducting studies to determine if the ideal time for napping is driven by clock mechanism um especially those of us that get sleepy or the afternoons\nSometimes between one to three which is currently the same time of course I'm teaching right now oh gosh I have to be pretty animated when I'm teaching but you can't blame them either exactly right that's why I don't try I understand but that's just me let me go to the questions on his side yes\nHi my question is about the adolescent brain and sleep ah ever since I was in high school we were talking about shifting the start time for high schoolers to be later in the\nDay because yes [laughter] and\nI definitely want that to happen because\nGetting my kids up in the morning before noon is a challenge how does your study affect our decision making and farming our society in that arena\nSo the quickest way to answer your question is that my study doesn't affect that at all", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "19", "locations": [["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Guatemala", 15.5, -90.25], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Guatemala", 15.5, -90.25], ["Guatemala", 15.5, -90.25], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Turkey", 39.0, 35.0], ["Istanbul", 41.01384, 28.94966], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["Afghanistan", 33.0, 66.0], ["Kandahar Province", 31.61332, 65.71013], ["Kandahar", 31.61332, 65.71013], ["China", 35.0, 105.0], ["Beijing", 39.9075, 116.39723], ["London", 51.50853, -0.12574], ["China", 35.0, 105.0], ["the U.
