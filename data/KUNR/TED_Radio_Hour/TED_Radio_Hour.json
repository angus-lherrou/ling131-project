responsible drinking and from the any each Casey foundation gets\nThe Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy Raj and I'll show today ideas about who we are what makes us us\nAnd we've been talking to ... who's been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR cast nine could make it cheap and easy to create humans you are you're basically talking like super heroes right like perfect vision\nSuperhuman strength perfect SAT scores right those are the yoga I think that's that's the science fictional vision of what\nCRISPR could aware [noise] we have long\nLists of gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise] but we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated\nPerson [noise] but we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong bones or leader muscles or lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart disease\nAnd as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have a technology that could in theory you allow an individual to upgrade their genome\nBut why would that be the ... version if it seems like that that technology is a promising like if it was a in a way to make a child more resilient to pan or or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere's a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent of all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have\nEssentially masks theirselves and HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nWe might assume of course they would want that but it's still a game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just select to trade still inherit from the parents something we can already do\nStreets still inherit from the parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents it's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or that disease prevention is you know many people see\nThey divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of two different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think there are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes easier five\nThat's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage and I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning\nBut I mean I mean a part of me wonders sweeping during that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of has sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up ending that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel [laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt so I think this comes down to the question of of how secret as the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted\nSomething that should remain untouched on tainted left alone of course where we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think you have this\nVery radio issue of directing future evolution\nYou know even saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to a point where you could use it embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher IQ\nOr being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off\n... ... ...\n... is working on a book about all this it's called a crack in creation gene editing and I think of all power to control an illusion you can check out his attack at ... dot com\n\nOn today's show we're asking a very important question is\nOkay like you have the answer dino who we are\nI Know who I Am [laughter] I I have an uh an inkling of who we are as Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind and human nature\nSet of ... what what is it that makes us who we are well it [noise]\nMakes us who we are\nWell it [noise] there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain a\nFabricated over millions of years by natural selection that equipment us with a set of motives and emotions and other mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack here so to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just fed and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out so Steven can you can you help us with this okay I'll do my best\nOkay just to get us started human beings have debated nature versus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors\nAre either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slates\nAnd that all of a structure comes from socialize Asian culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker ... stage back in two thousand two in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century and I meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that\nMan has no nature from the historian was going to take a godsend man has no instinct and the anthropologist fast we want to do the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to not from\nHochul a scientist Stephen J gold ... why should have been such an appealing notion well there are number of political reasons why people have found congenial foremost there but I get more blank slates then by definition we are equal because we're all equals zero equals zero\nBut if something is written on the plate and some people could have more of the others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality\nAnother political sphere of human nature is that\nIf we were blanks place we can perfect mankind angel dream of the perfect ability of our species to social engineering whereas if we're born with certainly interesting and perhaps some of them like Dennis To selfishness prejudice and violence [noise]\nFirst of all there are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind is a blank slate and some of them just come from a common sense as many people have told me over the years anyone who's had more than one child knows that kids come into the world with certain temperament and talented\nDoesn't all come from the outside oh and anyone who uh\nA child and a house that I certainly noticed that the child exposed speech full acquire a human language whereas the house that won't presumably because of some innate difference between them and [noise] anyone has ever been in a heterosexual relationship knows that the minds of men in the minds of women are not indistinguishable\nSo for years that debate about nature versus nurture has been jets\nHere's the debate about nature versus nurture has been just that that debate it's one or the other but Steven Pinker has mainly argued that this\nShouldn't be a debate that who we are comes down to both our genes and our environment it's a mistake to think that uh if\nThere is in effect of the environment that shows that were blanks weights or conversely if there is such a thing as human nature than we are our robots and we're programmed to a or walk into walls and be completely insensitive to our environment [noise]\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from the University of Florida we're solving for next is powered by its land grant heritage from renewable energy to global health UF students

what it means to be conscious like why is it [noise] consciousness is\nThe most familiar saying for any of his name we all know the difference between being conscious and not being conscious\nThis is an out fast he's a professor of neuroscience at the University of sex in the u._k.\nConsciousness is any kind of experience at all whether it's a visual experience with the world around us whether it's an emotional\nExperience of feeling sad or jealousy or happy or excited or from the experiences of intending to do something or being the cause is something that happens consciousness is the word that we use to sex inscribed\nAll the different kinds of experiences that that we can have [noise]\nI think pretty much sympathy for conscious system there is something it is like to be that system whereas for something that isn't conscious [noise] better than [noise]\nAnd how consciousness even happens and if we can recreate it artificially it's a question that we're still trying to figure out because what's more fundamental about being a human then knowing we exist\n[noise] and I'll ...\nHuman then knowing we exist [noise] an al ... explains more from the pet stage [noise]\nLast spring this question is so important because consciousness for each of us is all there is without fifth as well\nAs myself there's nothing at all and when we suffer we suffer consciously whether it's three mental illness or pain and if we can experience joy and suffering what about other animals\nMight they be conscious she did they say have a sense of self and ask them she says get faster and smarter maybe they'll come a point maybe not too far away when my iPhone develops a sense of it saying existence now I actually think the prospects for conscious I pretty much\nIn the store I'm going to tell you our conscious experiences of the world around us and about films within it\nAll kinds of control to these nations that happened with free and the causal all living voting [noise]\n\nUm I Love this idea of a controlled ... nation\nIs is that is that what we experience is that how we experience the world that it's\nIt's a control to loose nation we are just essentially hallucinating all the time\nI Love this rise I Wish I could take credit for it but but I Can't but I Love the fries because\nIt points out that everything that we perceive consciously or unconsciously but let's talk about consciousness for now is a construction of the bright I mean it's easy to think that we are in our eyes and objective reality is revealed to us ... through the windows of our eyes again what conscious perception is is basically just\nIn somebody's sitting inside us go looking out there and they see a red table they pass in ... well gained\nLooking out there and they see a red table they send you a passing\nA law again there's batter writers ahead\nThe real reality [noise]\n\nThat's right but the truth is that both perceptions are acts of interpretation that act of informed guesswork that the brain appliance encounters sensory data I think that the way I Can't think of this is is that there is no light in the skull and it's nice sounds that\nWas going on in the brain or electrical impulses whizzing around and complex pop in and out of all the oldest passing much in the in the brain ...\nAppears [noise]\nAnd in some sense we we've known this for a long time since meats and it's been pretty clear that colors red yellow green seven colors and no objective properties of objects in the world they are attributes\nOf of reflected light and and the brain the visual system will make inferences based on wavelengths of light and about what color or something is\nA ... something as basic as color is not something that we just passively receive from the world we activity attribute\nIt to things out there on the world and the idea of control to the nation is is just that well this applies to everything and this applies to everything that we perceive and not just perceptions of things out there in the world but also it applies to our perceptions about self\nAbout Bodie about memories of a sense of agency about sensitive election that every\nThing that we see is a construction but it's it's not a random construction its construction\nIs a construction but it's it's not a random construction as construction that's a best guess but it rained in by the

like ... and and but within just a few seconds you were able to disarm the entire\nYou know massive room full of people by just kind of putting people at ease which is that something you do consciously or or are you aware that initially\nI Do naturally because men stand up comedian for Fifteen Years and when I started doing stand up comedy I was ... New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time and\nI didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable with me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian\nWith me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian is I I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I Move on and a strong funny relate of away people are able to move on with me\nBecause I think for for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's a comfortable like we're not used to that do you think so because\nI mean this really has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy on characters on television this millions made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing and someone with a disability\nWho's proud yeah I'm ashamed and talking about it in a way that they've never heard before but we have been mocked because like\nEven someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever being mocked her bullied when I became a performer became pretty common place for people to do that to me [noise]\nA lot of people with the pain don't walk

of five you weren't able to walk right I was able to walk out fine but I had to be able to walk in order to be made streamed into public school\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try\nWhat did you realize that you were funny [laughter] so my dream in life was to be on General Hospital I didn't know that was funny I went to college for drama and then I came back to New York city started auditioning really no\nOne was hiring me and I had a conversation with an amazing acting coach and she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg and when I saw what would we go over that and saw like how she use comedy I was like wait a minute when I look at my TV the people who look like me are\nMy TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard prior you know Ellen Rosie O'Donnell those were the people who were\nNot typically beautiful possibly had disability you know had different races like Margaret Cho and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an other and still get on TV\nAnd so I signed up for comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out I'm hysterical [laughter]\nYou know it's it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons right or their challenges through humor right in\nAnd do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or or for Arabs and Muslims as well I've\nNever tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own story and justify telling my own story I was controversial I was telling people things they didn't know and this started post nine eleven in New York City\nMy friend and I found that the New York are American comedy festival to counter the negative images of Arabs and media and we\nAlways made sure that the

I'm I named my cat beyond and people are like\nAbout guys are talking about several probably talked about you know like ...\nTalk about all the talk about you know I'm like I really just want to talk

know one fight in Jersey and one foot in the middle East I'm really worried\nAbout where we are right now in this country and when I did that Ted Talk I didn't know how important it was to say a

comedian again for ... and she in a group of Muslim comedians traveled around the country doing what they call social justice comedy and they were trying to open up the conversation about Islamophobia which at times required to little patient\n[laughter] yeah I I think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes\nBut when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract more be without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is a is a joint on shared experience\nLike a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away\nSo that trip and again took was the other comedians they turned it into a movie called the Muslims are coming in too long after he came up something happened back in New York a place where again usually felt welcomed than accepted\nAnd group spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the NCAA that's the New York city subway system\nMoslem poster campaign with the MTA that's the New York city subway system was yours truly offensive not to mention poorly design I mean if you're going to be bigoted you might as well use a better font but\nNot to watch her own poster campaign right the nice things about my lungs so myself\nComedian dino be doll I decided to launch the fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign we raised money work with the NCAA for over five months got approved and today\nWe're supposed to go up a the NCAA decided to be the poster citing political content let's take\nAt a couple of those posters here is one of them can do more Muslims [noise] let's\nGreat for recipe\nFor us are considered political by the MTA that or the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light what's considered political but it is it it's about justice so we decided\nTo change our fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign and try to the fighting bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign [noise]\nBags comedians took on a major in New York City agency and the comedians one [noise]\nA very weird feeling I was like a blonde girls feel like all the time\nWork is meant to be fun

that if I continued telling my jokes or don't kill me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny but just changing all danger I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons [noise]\n\nSo you talk a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment in the film or I think you're Birmingham, Alabama and it will like it was pretty successful yeah so I mean you know when I first talked with in Birmingham, Alabama where we like set up a table called me about religion\nWe're going to read a quote and you're going to tell us if it was all\nNew Testament or the Koran\nDoes your guest right you got whatever like ridiculous prize is like an outdated calendar salivating already and\nRules are salt and pepper shakers are also like chocolate and stuff like that which holy book stipulate for the girl who does not lead on her wedding night should be stoned to death or because\nOf her own it is the\nMan [noise] people guessed wrong on because they just assumed everything that was the violin um came from the Koran Mary\nLord how can I have a son when no man has touched me\nAnd I don't we just we're trying to make the point that all of these tax half crazy stuff in them so why would we hold Islam to a separate standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth was\nYeah yeah people were really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh my gosh\nAnd you could see them having that moment of like oh my God you know a lot of difference between the three of them do you know [noise] it's incredible that I mean that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that\nThe American people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off you are a coffee and they wanna open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found than I've said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get love and return and that's what I found as a Muslim doing very publicly Muslims thing performing on stages throughout the country\nThat's what I found a way I like to look at it as you\nYou got one person to live in a couple of you will laugh and then over a lifetime you might get like a million people ... and those chuckles add up to some measure of of a popular um shift in perception\nAnd that is social change but it takes time and it takes like millions of these chuckle [noise]\nComedian again first she's the

comedian\nRelations users these that are [noise]\nHe's actually read since she's ... she's ready for him though [noise]\nHouse event it was hard it is [noise]\nSo obviously being funny is like Kevin does for a living\nBut being funny\nIs also a way he deals with like humor I think is either kind of like an invitation or\nA shield like you can use humor to keep people on the outside of your life and that's what I did as a as a young person\nWhen I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on and so my defense mechanism was humor\nBut I also think that humor can be this invitation into ideas thoughts in stories that\nMight otherwise be too uncomfortable and heavy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative within them for Kevin humor was a way to deal with his depression\nBut at least in the beginning\nIt was more of a shield than an invitation\nI was Thirteen Years old my best friend at the time in Jordan McGregor passed away in a car accident and\nIt was an experience that really radically changed my life and when he died it just ripped everything out of me and felt like I was shattered in just a million different pieces I mean it's like kind of ...\nFelt like I was shattered and just a million different pieces I mean that's like kind of grief that to this day I kind of really struggled to put accurate words and language around it because it was just so overwhelming but that was my first experience with this really intense feeling of grief and loss and depression\nAnd then from Thirteen to Seventeen kind of fluctuated in and out of these what I might call seasons of depression where it just felt like it would come in\nWaves and you know for a month to three months I Would be really dark helpless place\n\nBut I was fighting that secretly minimum wage I didn't want people to see that I didn't think it was okay to talk about it and so that became this extra weight of shame and embarrassment and killed\nKevin briel tells his

and marketing describing how over the past fifty years corn and soy and wheat have become staples of the western diet\nThing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell and easy to process\nAnd the government's through direct and indirect subsidies encouraged the growth of what we now call mama cropping which means really really big fields or hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time planted in one crop an endless rows that are all\nCultivated an harvested mechanically um but if you look in the late Nineteen thoroughly twenty century it was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest or second biggest producer\nI think the country's biggest or second biggest producer of tomatoes that was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown and now I Know it was just in Iowa and again you can't believe that drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nWe got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many Soyuz corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the troops there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups\n'cause all who can be bought and any store not that they are any good but they were there\nMost bombs cook like mine a piece of royal made a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or\nThe stupidest food ever minute rice\nFor dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now this kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew\nThey became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either some of us reading and good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma it's not actually killed\nBy the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat\nAnd spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home at the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden\nSo now you got here pizza night so you got your microwave lights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself nights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way me junk food cheese the various stuff that will kill you\nGet ... and ... like what you were saying earlier ally that has to do it with the fact that like we think we should food all over the world right [noise] yeah I think part of the problem\nIs you know and this can go back to cooking because\nOne of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want a mango you're gonna be able to get a mango if you want it tomato you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking it\nIs abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you need to everything but you you are a guy that a lot of people look to and say okay well you you've written all these books you or a food to eat like I think of luck that men and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat\nWell I Do think you know I did this book called the ... going before six or\nA few years ago and um\nBasically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinner time and then do whatever but I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know or the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because that are broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can as you can eat\nThat's it yeah\nWithin those rules you eat what you like to eat and you're going to have a good diet\n\nOverconsumption of animals and of course John food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now I there is no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that class and I want to make this clear and it's not the ingredients in plants it's the plants it's not the\nBeta carotene it's the carrots the evidence is very clear\nThat plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming of this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer\nNot bad\nYou live longer not bad but back\nAnimals and junk food we don't need either of them for health boats have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demands were not born craving whoppers or Skittles\nWe have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for every one that's the hard part but by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy the simple formula eat food eat real food\nWe can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals were reduced not only calories but our carbon footprint we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so\nWe have to choose that path\nYou [noise]\nFood writer Mark Bittman you can see his entire talk at ... dot com um well I Know you have to leave marks thank you thank you for doing this and I I tell you the one one of the things I really miss being paleo now for the next ... who knows how long\nIs a great recipe that you put out years ago was that pasta and spaghetti or deans bread crumbs\nRe ... the great use of sardines great how can you not eat pasta ... you can get sweet potatoes pasta which is which isn't Haley of kind of um uh I don't think Boston's gonna kill ya\nMarket menacing that like forty percent of stuff in grocery stores isn't real food but they had to estimate\nGrocery stores isn't real food but but if you had to estimate what what percentage of the stuff in grocery stores has added sugar\nI don't have to estimate it's Seventy four percent I Seventy four percent of all of the food in the store\nHas been spiked with added sugar in some fashion [noise] is it [noise] hidden in plain sight Oh absolutely\nThis is Dr Robert Lustig he's a pediatrician and a researcher at the University of California in San Francisco so there are fifty six names for sugar I mean did you know ... it was shown on digital them or are that's even has the most famous now\nApple puree or evaporated change yeah my favorite because cages so you know juice healthy right what happens when you evaporate changes you get [noise] sugar\nRobert Lustig studies sugar how it's managed to sneak its way into our diet and what it does to our bodies\nWe've replaced a real food diet where they processed food diet because it's cheaper it's portable it's convenient kids like it and it's addictive\nAnd like any addictive substance Robert says sugar can be toxic especially because so many of us eat too much of it has Robert less taken on the stage\nDoes sugar cause diabetes or everyone says well yeah but it's because of the calories sugar empty calories\n\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from life luck life luck with Norton works to help protect identities and the information on devices from cyber

taste food and ... and yet that's an illusion in the sense that uh most of what you're tasting the fruit you the ... the boon to the smoky are actually being because you bought nostrils but operations wonderful ... and\nThe information I get from my nose and makes me believe 'cause if it's coming from I ...\nThis is Charles Spence a head of the ... research liberal tree Oxford University what is the cross metal research laboratory [noise]\nUm ... having the psychology department where we look at how the census interact\nAnd yes our mouth and nose interact when we eat\nAnd yes our mouth and nose interact when we eat the mouse and our ears\nAre we doing experiments where we're feeding people up potato chips and each time they put it into a potato chip we would change the sound that they could sometimes making their own crunching ...\nSometimes quiet sometimes boosting just certain frequency [noise]\nRebel show you that as soon as you change the sound it changed the Christmas to crunch the freshness or these other attributes that\nCharles how our food sounds even looks can change how it tastes\nOne might call a white wine artificially ... within ... tasteless food dye\nAddict and appropriately you'll find the experts the winemakers will get fooled into spelling leaving tasting what they think is a red wine [laughter] all the ... the tobacco and the top chocolates in the state and fruit since I don't even know what they're actually tasting um it is to watch\nAll of this Charles says feeds into a larger idea\nThat how we experience our food is more than just about ingredients here's Charles Spence on the head stage\nThis morning to I'll tell you about the perfect meal rural convinced we can taste the food we can enjoy the flavors and aromas of the wind and the glass\nReflects little what's going on is created by the atmosphere in which we eat and drink out of the question is how to study how the measure is I'm a tendency among the scientists that been your guest strong as it does take people like your eye and a brain scanner give them something to eat something to drink and see which parts of the brain light up to that kind of your brain on flavor or New York astronomy\nRunning is one problem here which is that in fact you mentioned something about it\nOne problem here which is in fact when the mattress off one of the brain scan is lying on your back where they had climbed stale with Cuban your marriage\nThat periodically square sin ah some drink you call it can be full of your head all kind of a jolt and that ... that the brain scan alignment but it's kind of tells you something to do something useful but it doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal and one of those situations [noise]\n\nWhat exactly defines a perfect meal\nI must say it's probably a different for each and every one of us make some very very simple it can be a fish and chips by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere\nThese often will stay in people's minds as as best meals but ... would I guess has to be there is um the mood you're in on the people you're with so because of social aspects of dining a I have no one has ever had that perfect meal when the fighting with up hot in the say\nPart of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seemed to stick with doesn't resonate in the end and you can never quite capture when you get back home is as your moods you pretty relaxed fewer holiday less stressed Tripoli with your family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it something sort of truly memorable\nYou think about like um how many times have you met a friend who's just come back from a holiday and they say oh you've got to try this amazing red line that I tried in Greece and then you try it and you were thinking\nIt that phenomenon has a name that we've all learned versions of its um I was going to problem solve rose a paradox instead use to describe a northern Europeans um but to kill the guy for that so holidays to the Mediterranean\nOr not sitting somewhere on a on the side of the sea sipping that arose they wind blew looking into that love his eyes [noise]\nSuffering that arose they wind up looking into that love his eyes\n... they can hear the sounds of the sea smells associates all laugh and not tasteless like the best glass of wine you've ever had\nSo great that you want to buy a Baltimore case and bring it back to share with your friends and chocolate could taste you have an ... or you bring it back\nAnd then you're disappointed\nAnd your friends are like this is really cheap ... yeah I understand what happened is it something about when the buttons when they're playing with a cold and I you know sport the wind things not about a tool we never eat or drink no we're always\nSomewhere in a certain environments in certain states would mind\nOn all mental state and the environment both together that kind of impacts what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy its missile anyway some myths attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation\nAnd put some of that pleasure into what we think about the food\n[noise] in fact says Charles these ideas about how we experience food have actually convinced some chefs to try out certain methods of flavor enhancement methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients\nIn a good mood food tastes good if you're in a bad mood I never tastes good is this illusion about flavor we think we're tasting the wind the glass but I'll bring everything else the sound of a single the smell of a salty sea or the warmth of the songs on our backs all of that is play against the experience\nOn top chef capturing that insight or in the dishes they are so that any of that too much sense to a restaurant in in Switzerland when he got his tuition star restaurant\nA white table cross\nWas not popular on the table was no glasses when I play like nothing was just a plastic car people wait say well he tells me here seven o'clock hour here on everyone's here in the restaurant and I can say well we'll tables are full\nOur here on everyone's here in the restaurant and I can see what will tables the full nothing will happen\nUntil somebody picks up seriously that plastic how I Wonder if they get up you know there\nIs a little one euro tower and it makes it moving sound and sort of some of those types of it that will be laughing I didn't even guaranteed within a minute you'll have a whole restaurant full of moving fire was laughing Dina's and that\nIs the moment when it first comes out because then he had successfully nothing more than one euro table in the mood and he knows that will improve even the type of uh two Michelin star restaurant\n[noise]\n[noise] wow so it's like from from a neurological perspective do we fully understand what's happening like why that's the case [noise]\nUh no so we didn't know that it does happen but it is the case it's all kind of classic example of just how important the environment is what we taste I work with ... which is if you have here in London and he's been I'm sending a question as several weeks have to ... his restaurant\nI'd say what'd you remember yeah and he said well ... flavor was the soup and people are convinced they can remember but in fact when you check was actually on the menu that kind of constructing something they remember the experience they felt about it and the brain kind of fills in the rest of the details of what they think they thought they reaching\nOur most chefs that you talk to are they on board with with your ideas did did they think yeah it is it is about the experience he's right or they or did they say that this is totally absurd it's all about the food and the taste the food\nAh still some chefs who say no no it is just what I was taught in color rich school days just the sourcing the preparation but nothing else but he says their case from your restaurants um do you serve the food we near plastic cutlery known as a silver and where's your restaurant exactly\nDo you serve the food in their plastic cutlery known as a silver isn't it and what is your restaurant exactly oh it's in the country manor house looking at that nature so the the St Louis things in the one hand but clearly you can never sort of ... through just by itself it's always on something in a certain environment\nThere's going to contextual factors are always that it cannot be avoided [noise] so I certainly I think there are a growing number of the younger chefs who are now putting up starting their own venues\nWho who I really think for the first time in history saying we don't need to just now about the ingredients and cooking preparation techniques we really need to know about the mind those that were sitting\nCharles Spence wrote about his research on how we experience food in his latest book is called the perfect meal\nYou can see his entire talked at Ted that NPR got dark\nSo let's get she still a little bit more creative about what's on our plates because that's what ... does okay my name is Marshall bicker and you are in a while I get in again where it's like an Indian\nRye for him it's very difficult for you to promote you can't do that you were out in the center of the Netherlands\nAnd in the center of the Netherlands about once a week or so and his wife have what some might consider an unusual ingredient with dinner\nAnd it's something that's stuck reports for

you I guess you you started out as a as a public defender right I did um I became a public defender immediately upon graduating from law school and what was what\nWas your idea behind that you thought okay I'm going to be a public defender and I'm going to help people who are defendants in criminal cases [noise] that's right\nAnd I like lots of people had no idea what was going on number little system and my daughter in law school [noise] um I joined a criminal defense clinic at NYU and step into Manhattan criminal court\nAnd never with that but luckily again this is Robyn Steinberg [noise] what I saw so shocked me that I thought this can't be happening in our country and we can't possibly think this passage project\nUm and I committed myself to then becoming a public defender where I spent most of my career\nThere's a story that we tell ourselves about our justice system that it's blind but it's just everyone is treated equally under the law but it's not true well\nWould you begin to realize very very early on as a public defender is how we defined crime policing occurs in this\nWe defined crime policing occurs in this country who were prosecuting in our state local courts is deeply deeply defined by class in by race and so I just wanted to fight for each and every one of my clients as hard as I could\nBut definitely you were pushing up against an enormous expansive criminal legal system that was not just crushing my individual clients that their families and their entire communities here's more from Robin Steinberg on the stage\nFright um nonsense of fundamental to the American psyche that it is enshrined in our constitution\nAnd yet in America I'm\nIs addicted to imprison us from slavery to the massive ... it always has\nWe all know the shocking numbers the United states and crush rates more people per capita than almost any nation on the planet\nBut what you may not know is that on any given night in America almost half a million people go to sleep and those concrete jail cell who have not been convicted of anything these\nMothers and fathers and sons and daughters are there for one reason and one reason only they cannot afford to pay the price of their freedom and that\nIs calm down\nHow much does it generally cost to post bail so when somebody is arrested um judges can set bail and an amount um in their own discretion I have seen it as low as a hundred dollars for the people that we representing the clients that we see ...\nPeople that we represent and the clients that we see bail is typically under five thousand dollars but that is way beyond the reach of most families their families are making decisions about buying a gallon of milk for their children or putting that money towards bail\nIt's inconceivable to lots of Americans that you can't just go to an ATM machine and pull at five hundred dollars but that's the reality for most people coming through the criminal legal system\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from Amazon

changing laws to better serve non human animals like apes here Steven was\nWhat have you worked at the pencil it's a thing it's a legal thing\nIt's a thing [noise] it's a legal thing [noise] it's so rare books you might have or the cars you own they're all legal thing the great age that you'll stay behind me they too are legal things\nNow I can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car\nThese Gray Davis you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James mouse and he wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book how almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father die before his eyes they're legal things\nSo so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal person [noise]\nUh well since Roman times uh thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being at the at the time of slavery\nAnd the person is an entity who has the capacity for one or more legal rights at one time it was a defined as a very narrow way I mean like\nYou mean like ... men\nOr actually Freeman or persons but slaves were\nNot sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now are all human beings are considered to be the person [noise]\nDoes not have legal rights right and the person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons because it's more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons are they are indeed so it can you explain\nHow that works so a person and thing are both terms of art and and that's\nSo a person and things are both in terms of art and and that's up to the legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example in the last\nFew years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights and national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia as a person who has real legal writing\nIn Stephen why these recent changes as positive steps toward broadening the definition of legal person to include animals ... he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since he read the book animal liberation Peter Singer\nNow I read Peter Singer spoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and indeed I was moved by it because I had become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless descended defenseless and I'd never realized how voiceless and defenseless the billions of\nHuman animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and by Nineteen eighty five I realize that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals his interest I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had also become legal persons\nNow at that time there was very little\nKnown about or spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human on one I knew it was going to take a long time\nIllegal person or legal rights for a non human on one I knew it was going to take a long time\n[noise] so your objective at that time was to essentially changed the designation of nonhuman animal some illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my goal and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much to be done and as I began to try to\nUnderstand what the legal history was of slavery and freedom and rights that the\nOne critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia about Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London and\nHe got there James decided he was going to

common law the heaviest corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd I hate to say this corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the painters required to bring the detainee in and get a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty\nWell lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because of James\nSomerset was a legal thing he was not eligible\nFor a writ of habeas corpus only if you could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that\nHe would assume without deciding that James Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should

out on the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walked in but as far as long as concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case\n[noise] so inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your James Summers at of course a non human version of James hammers and\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find a gym summertime we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the nonhuman animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far or chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal studies about the cognition\nOf chimpanzees that we can gather in one place and bring to the attention of the court to make it clear\nThat they are autonomous being that they are conscious that\nThe are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on and on\nWe filed a hundred and sixty pages of half a day that and we say\nAltogether it shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively\nComplex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge\nTo allow an autonomous being\nTo being slave D is something that grinds against every idea of justice and you have to step in and stop this [noise] so\nSo how did you identify the chimpanzees you want to represent and then where to even file a lawsuit\nWhat we did is we spent seven years looking at the law of all fifty states and twenty English speaking countries trying to understand what jurisdiction the law would be reasonably on our side so we chose to the state of New York\nI Would be reasonably on our side so we chose to the state of New York once we understood that we decided to simultaneously file suits on behalf of all five chimpanzees who we could identify who are being held captive in the state of New York and where were they being held captive\nWell Hercules and Leo were being held captive at Stony Brook university at the age of two professors had taken them from their

the show today ideas about hacking the law and we're just hearing from Brett headache who's advocating for getting rid of elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers\nSo I Would make a voluntary once you've sent out ten thousand letters to random six of the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then\nThose who was to interest in that you do a second random selection of those interests with making sure you're actually match the demographic profile of the country so I'm making sure you had gender bounds you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest you would eliminate the\nHe's the structure of the lowest you would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime cares and to me that the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different uh but so much better from my perspective\nThat sort of wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it than that already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this on a self selection buddy ... wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes by John had as some people\nI'm not tonight I'm Sorry I'm like it's got to the galaxy guy at Douglas Adams is that it was it's just I just got my dog of atoms saying are the people who want political power I specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people to all three times the average wage\nThe vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hand out for two years of that kind of income I Would of\nProbably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have to change is one elected and one randomly selected in fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that was\nA regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first a helmet in the world to instigate a one day like the chamber in one solution chamber once will titian buddy\nI wouldn't be surprised if people look at the ... and look at the elected chamber full of politicians busily back stabbing each other and engaging in the typical political power place and go well why do we need that for his chamber a but this is a path to this idea\nRandom selection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute this in out parliament's tried to say to your friends I think we should populated out parliament with randomly selected people\nRely judging what if my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate whose recycling thoughts\nThe perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these Monday examples is it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly don't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would this be perfect of course not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least it's obviously yes\nI mean when you're less likely is it is something that can really spread on a global scale in your lifetime\nWe have out strategy or and that is yet to to first\nWe have our strategy or and that is yet to to first get these ...\nAssemblies happening more and more often which seems to be happening or after the Irish citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost a million pounds to a sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so\nI can see that the wood is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people who take notice maybe spreads\nI could see within my lifetime they're being for example\nA U.S state legislature with a second buddies selected bustle titian that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a huge surely a meal battle to try to convince people and then in French powers to um to try this\nYes uh yeah it does it I'm not I think it will be easy to political changes every easy ... ah especially fundamental political changed such as this but\nUh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political leaders potentially at a local city state level who say yeah I Want to own innovate on to try something new I think half system's broken and unknown a sea change\nRed headache he runs the ... foundation which advocates for random selection democracy can find his full talk at ... dot com\n\nOn the show today ideas that hacking the law\nHow did you even start to think about what you wanted to do\nI did study law\nBecause of a kind of dreamy idea about what the law is this is the bank Mario he's a legal advocate\nThis is the fact Mario he's a legal advocate\nThere's this philosopher ... who has this book between facts enormous [noise] and he says\nDemocracy should be this big open conversation about fundamental questions like what kind of world we want to build together\nWhat do we all want to know that we want to go together and then law is the thing that takes the conclusion the findings from those conversations and turns them into actual rules in institutions that shape our lives\nAnd I I Love this idea of law as the kind of\nThe thing that translates between our dreams about justice on the one hand and real life on the other hand between faction norms\nBut that is not the world we live in a lot of the rules\nIn a lot of places are decent\nBut it was a huge get oftentimes people will need those rules the most have never even heard of them\nAnd um the systems that are supposed to enforce those rules are corrupt or broken\nOr both\nHe began to see this problem when he was a young lawyer so he wanted to figure out a way to
