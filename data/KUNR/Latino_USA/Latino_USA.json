going to be bringing a different kind of politics yeah right and I'm just wondering where like you know what you think about um that notion\nTo be\nThe next or to be like the na our identity is the most I Will say is the most intersection identity in the world so for example\nFor sexual identity and the world's so for example I'm Puerto Rican that means that I Know that I Am African\nI Am indigenous I Am also the product of European colonization\nI feel like to be like the ... and to fully acknowledge your identity and everything that goes into your identity means that we have to champion the causes of everybody in order to champion the causes of ourselves and so\nWhen you look at an issue like immigration for example\nThese aren't just quote unquote Mexicans coming in from the border these are these are indigenous people\nAnd this is their land\nWhere your mom and dad speaking to you in St Luke's on the Anita ... he was proud like being a war was a message like look on Sunday that you're in New York or through and through however you want to define yourself\nKnow I was\nI grew up with a very strong sense of patriotism\nA very strong sense as we are American I also was raised as you are ... like through and through and so I grew up like\nThe music I grew up around was Hector level sell the ACLU's and then hip hop in you know growing up around the brand your favorite hip hop artist would be so hard I grew up around like public enemy\nI grew up around like public enemy and not as Jay Z and then of course you have like this late nineties boom of I like yeah fat job do you have big pond\nYou have all these people that we grew up around as well and so\nIt's it's to be all of those things you know sometimes people say like oh wow you're the way you articulate your platform is do interest action all and to me it's not even that we're trying it's\nThis is who we are and so what what it means to be American and what we grew up and like how we grew up around these values was my dad\nWe'd go visit family and what do they go every year but then we would drive to colonial Williamsburg what really yeah do you mean like for the weekend well I mean we would take a little family vacation and it'll be like ... and you were young yeah those are like a two places where he went on family ... she cried\n[laughter] it was colonial Williamsburg I'm for three going not as bad [laughter]\nHow do you manage that as being a young enough you know a lot of people don't know if they you know it's not like you're walking around member of Congress dreamy with you know rice um and at the same time knowing that you're going to be in Congress\nI'm Still processing a lot of that four months ago or five months ago I was completely anonymous or just like any other New Yorker no one cared about me [laughter] so just like psychologically that's been at the process but I had a friend come over a couple of months ago and there was a ...\nTo go and there was a magazine that had my face on the cover of it with a bunch of other faces in terms of political developments of or political ideas of twenty teens\nAnd she looked at it and we were laughing at it because it doesn't feel like this isn't my ... this is an island but we're laughing at it\nAnd she says that's what you are you're an idea now and I felt like I had to be perfect or else I was going to be letting our community down\nSo that maybe this through an interesting question are you managing your ego\n'cause I mean the truth is is that you're getting all kinds of call backs right and what is the kind of mind games but it can play because I'm sure it's also exciting to be on the cover of a fabulous magazine or a great photo shoot and all of that but at the same time it's also lonely\n[noise] it is and if anything the there are some ways in which I was more confident before the primary [noise]\nIn my brain and in my heart I feel very grateful and I feel very humbled but a lot of the six dreams of terrifying I feel like I have this huge target because I'm embodying\nSome of the most vulnerable people in society\nThe issues that I'm Talking about or not read versus blue\nThey're just not their top versus bottom and so\nFor me\nI still struggle with even conceiving\nI still struggle with even conceiving the idea of getting a call back like sometimes I talk to our team and I'm like do you think so and so would respond to us now like yeah of course and I'm like will they or I so worried about people showing up to my advantage\nThere was an article I think it was in the New Yorker where they made a point of where you know that when you talk to kids you come down to their level mhm and I was thinking about that also in terms of the way you you say you know you talk to people you approach them you come in you touched them you'll be in your yeah are you thinking about it more as like well this is a really affect their political tactics\nFeel like I learned it from my parents and when I reflect on my life experience I think of my my parents were funnily enough my parents were never political\nYou know my family would always come over and we would talk politics around the kitchen table but my parents never organized or did anything like that but\nWhen I think about my experience I think of my parents have natural organizers they were so good at building community\nI went to public school about thirty minutes north in a small town in West Chester but I didn't live that kind of class experience because in any affluent area there is an underclass of people who serve the people who live there and that's what my family was my mom clean the houses\nOf the kinds of people that I went to school and\nAnd my dad really struggled to start his own small business\nDad really struggled to start his own small business\nTo help support our family but it was always struggling growing up and it was really just picking up you know towards towards actually be end of his life and so my mom would invite the cashiers from the local Dunkin' Donuts over to the house\n... ... talk because those are the people that are family could relate to they were always about leaning in to people and the politics come second and that's how I practice as well\nEven though I feel very strongly about my beliefs my number one job is to care about people and to lean into them show them that they are cared for\nAnd make them feel hurt because I Am hearing them\nWe talk about the politics\nWhat is your puppy same to you when you're hearing your dad no\nMan I think uh [noise]\nIt's like I'm so motion although [noise]\nI'm Sorry no was already to threaten oh my gosh [noise] so it's okay what is the prime tell me what your um just 'cause like [noise]\nNo one's asked me that question [noise]\nWeird because like I guess I'm not\nI'm processing this has you're asking me but it's like um\nIt's like having someone walking with you the whole time and it's somewhat and then like you're going months and months and months and no one technology\nYou're going months and months and months and no one's acknowledging the person next to you and then it's like oh what does this I think so it's it's a little emotional but um [noise]\n\nThe last thing my dad ever told me before he passed away [noise]\nWas make me proud\nAnd for a really really really long time\nI felt like I felt\nLike I had failed my parents because of the situation we're in my dad had passed away my mom was back to cleaning houses I was tending bar and waiting tables and I felt like [noise]\nYoung women of color could see themselves and they could understand that it's okay\nTo be depressed that it's something that\nIs normal um also that it's okay to be flawed you know because we don't really see characters like that very much [noise]\nI I think we're expected to be like I like the title says we're expect to be perfect both in\nSociety and within her family is and that's just not realistic at all and so I just want them to know that\nI Know that they exist\nIt's okay it's okay to be who they are [noise]\n\n\nThank you for putting it into words Erica centers

dot org\nWelcome back to Latino USA I'm ...\nSo a few months ago we brought you a story about how young Latinos are navigating higher education and we looked at how one university Oregon State is trying to combat the troubling trend of Latinos not finishing college\nAnd a couple of weeks ago we looked at the future of warehouse jobs many of which are filled by young Latinos and let the nuts and we wondered whether or not these jobs offer a path to the middle class\nThese stories were part of a partnership with the community service society of New York\nA nonprofit that among other things conducts demographic research to help in their mission of fighting poverty in New York City their data helped bring you these stories and today I'm sitting down with lives are Christian he's the organizations\nDirector of youth policy to talk about some of that data that they've gathered about Latinos and education in New York City over the last year\n\nSo I think lives are when I first\nSo I think lives are when I first met you you were like proudly the geek you were like look I Love data\nI Love numbers the whole world makes sense to me because of data numbers and there are a lot of you out there in the world [laughter] absolutely\nI think we live in times where what people are talking about can be a little bit uncertain and I find comfort in basing some of the things I talk about on real facts and figures\nOkay so every person who loves data has a story behind it you like this really wonderful story about what inspired you to do this kind of research and data so what's the ...\nThe particular line of work that we're talking about stems from one day I went with my parents I'm guessing was about ten years ago to see the terrific show in heights\nLike Washington Heights ... the ... day you wake up and I got this little plug\nBecause I actually grew up in Washington Heights where the show was about and it's a Broadway musical by minimum or handling\nJot gene so\nYou know it's a terrific show and displayed in all the glory of Washington Heights with some differences to the community I grew up in it showed three communities within Washington Heights\nMexicans and Puerto Ricans all living together and most interesting to me dancing to the same music all listening to salsa\nWhereas my experience to having grown up in Washington Heights that wasn't exactly the case it is a predominantly Dominican community and actually never heard sauce until I went to college so I started thinking about law I thought it was really great that the show put the communities on the map\nGreat that the show put the communities on the map there the diversity within the Latino community that as a policy wonk myself I wondered if it wasn't getting out that actually the the different communities within Latino Americans and was going to New Yorkers aren't being showcased enough so I started digging into the date a little bit\nTo see well if I were to tell a slightly different story that there are\nReal differences among the different Latino communities what would that mean for the new policy field that I work and\nSo what did you find what surprised\nYou well working in New York City schools and in your policy field\nSo much of your policy when it came to dealing with Latino you dealt with issues of English as a second language and English language learners and the first thing that jumped out at me was that you've got three really distinct communities that Latinos in New York the three major groups of Puerto Rican Dominican and Mexicans and\nThe largest one Puerto Rican New Yorkers really have no English language learner issues over Ninety percent\nOf young people of Puerto Rican origin in New York speak English as their main are are are best language and are born in New York City so I started to think well\nIf the policy field is sort of lumping all Latinos together around this one issue what are some other differences that we could find and then once I started to dig a little deeper a lot of new things started to come to the surface about differences and the communities both ways to make them great and then ways that we can support them to be even better\nRight so I really I Love this particular point that Dominican women have higher college graduation rates in New York City than any other demographic in the Latino population so what's up with that\nReally interesting I think there are a lot of questions that are raised and a lot we can learn from parts\nI think there are a lot of questions that are raised in a lot we can learn from particularly in comparison to to some others but Latino non Latino\nOne thing we think is that the Dominican community in New York like in Washington Heights is interesting in that you have a lot of groups from different incomes living together because it's a relatively new or immigrant group actually compare to Puerto Ricans\nThe schools that are majority Dominican schools you have both lower and higher income families from Dominican origins and what we find\nIs that when you have mixed schools around socio economics the culture pervades all the different groups in the school so the college going culture of the middle and higher income Dominican families really pervades to lower income families as well which is why in those schools you really see much more of a college going culture\nAnd among women in particular which is it's real bright spot [noise]\n\nNow in comparison to Puerto Rican community in New York has been here much longer and you find that some higher and middle income Puerto Ricans in New York and other parts of the country aren't living in the same neighborhoods [noise] so where there are some concentrated Puerto Rican communities in areas of New York you're not having those mix of incomes in the school and college going culture may not be a strong\nHalf need each so there's a whole conversation Ron desegregation of data it sounds like a very technical thing but what it really means is when you're taking big data and you're kind of making it into smaller bite sized pieces is that a conversation that is being had regarding Latinos and letting the United states increasingly\nI think we're seeing the value of diversity in our analysis and now I think the next step is\nNow says and now I think the next step is we're such a diverse community within Latinos how do we really show the differences within them and a show the needs and strength of different communities\nAnd we're really on and exciting frontier as people start to think about diversity and identity differently on the United states census\nBureau's animal Community Survey which is really the baseline survey that we use for so much of our work there's a question about race and then there's the next question about it in a city\nSo in race people are largely answering whether they considered themselves white black or an Asian background or other and then the next question is are you Hispanic", "show_name": "Latino USA", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "29", "locations": [["Reno", 39.52963, -119.8138], ["New York City", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["the

were with her on the campaign trail\nAnd after stopping in Odessa we drove about an hour northeast to Howard College in big spring Texas and other majority Latino city\nWe walk into a they're conditioned room at the college and we wait for the Howard county Democrats to announce that sure ... is there get\nArmy but after listing off her credentials the sheriff isn't really paying attention instead she leans over to us and points to a guy in the corner with a camera\nIn the corner with a camera to doing great friend\nThat's my truck right now to me like Greg Abbott and raise to trust me everywhere I go to take my first people started to wonder mounted on us with the cuts just much more than we were Democrats these\nHigh suddenly she's called up to the stage she's caught a little bit off guard as she adds up to the podium and we're watching her walk up and then we kind of get a chance to look\nAt who is in the room right so if up until this point it seems like Lupe at all does is the candidate who has what it takes to deliver Texas to the Democrats\nThe candidate who is of the people and for the people law enforcement algae teach you peel the working class well this is where that notion it's a bump in the road\nThere's about thirty five people in the room we're in and we noticed that potentially devastating campaign for young people specifically lack there of\nCourse I'm I'm\nReally sure we're trying to get\n'em out this is Rina she's made all the Howard county democratic chair and looking around the room there are no young people here at all and we are at a college there are students everywhere it's who is in session\nThere's actually a room full of college students next door to us in the cafeteria eating lunch\nI don't think they're going to turn out as much as the older individuals I mean I think that's kind of our problem is how do we get them to turn it\nI mean I think that's kind of our problem is how do we get them to turn now\nAnd I'm really not sure what the answer is Erwin ... [noise]\nAnd we're not the only ones who noticed this September Quinnipiac poll has shared held as his favorability rating among young people ten points lower and governor addicts\nYounger voters are important for Democrats to win in any state and one third of eligible Latino voters in Texas are ages Eighteen to twenty nine that's a large portion of Latino voters in a state where the Latino vote\nThese heat [noise]\nBut here we are at a college where nearly half of the students are Latinos and letting us and none of them are at this event\nSo there are a few things that could be contributing to it seems to be a lack of enthusiasm for about it is particularly from young voters the first problem to share of has his name recognition not enough people know who she is\nAnd part of this is advertising and that comes down to money which the sheriff has a lot less of than her opponent governor Abbott has raised over sixty five million dollars in campaign funds compared to the share it's less than half a million\nBut there's something else at play here something that goes deeper into ... as a candidate\n\nThe Democratic primary jolt Texas a political mobilization group for young Latino\nDidn't endorse the sheriff endorsed her rival Andrew white they said it was because of her record\nTo rival Andrew white they said it was because of her record as sheriff of Dallas [noise] they pointed out that during her tenure sheriff cell does cooperated with federal immigration authorities by holding immigrants in her jail cells when requested and handing them over to ice\nWe spoke with ... at a young or from jolt about his concerns and he said he was disappointed when the sheriff didn't have a good answer about this at a forum aimed at young Latino voters in April\nI don't want to hear accountability for her record hurting here like\nThe New York times reported that one of the students who was in the audience to dance a forum said quote you were a Latino when you were helping deport people so why should I trust you now [noise]\nDeserve told us she didn't have a choice she was required by law to cooperate with ice and in fairness she did famously go head to head with Governor Abbott and twenty Fifteen she was refusing to honor ice requests to hold people who were accused of minor offenses\nSince Andrew white lost the Democratic primary jolt is now endorsing her for governor but ... says oh\nWe actually got tax I documented\nI asked ... whether she will take on what some of the younger progress is want her to do to protect undocumented immigrants things like fighting to shut down detention centers and to stop deportations\nSame wired to go to that place but I don't have that power this is a federal issue that the governor\n... that the governor or when you\nKnow I wouldn't just make a statement I take action action can be taken in this before it's before is cruel bill and is affecting the documents that is something I can do\nWhat she's talking about is the ban in Texas on so called sanctuary cities it's a law called as before and it was signed by governor Abbott last\nYear a Governor Greg Abbott\nHe broadcast the moment in a Facebook Live video as our son in law\nThat will band sanctuary cities in the law essentially forces look police to work with federal immigration officials and it allows police to ask people they stop for their papers it ensures that law enforcement officers in Texas can and will cooperate with aren't\nSure if I did opposes the law and has made it one of the biggest issues of her campaign she also supports allowing undocumented immigrants to pay in state tuition\nBut then we ask her about another policy that many on progressive are pushing for\nIs abolish ice part is if\nI used to be reform\nAnd I've seen about the original task advice was to keep people out who do harm they've got away from them\nAnd it needs to be reform but do you honestly want nobody to make sure\nThat another attack on a major city is is not going to happen do honestly just want him to let him come in and and do an attack on the city's sounds a little republic and what you're saying I Know it doesn't it sounds\nRepublican what you're saying I Know it doesn't it sounds like we want to protect our country\nIn\nAnd so maybe some Republicans might like strong borders national security rhetoric maybe she can make up for the lack of enthusiasm offend young Democrats by winning over some Republicans but that's not going to be so easy given how polarized the parties are these days\nAnd so he took that which is not that big of a when I went to farmers branch and went to a couple of other places and said look what I did for valley park I can do that for you too and then he used that when\nTo create confidence in these towns or at least the appearance of confidence\nAnd use that to sort of plow forward so we know for example that he went to farmers branch Texas and said\nI did this in valley park let's keep going there was internal disagreement within the city council about whether they should keep going whether it was worth the money and he said no I can do the same thing for you as I did for valley park and so they press forward ended up spending more than nine million dollars and they are law was entirely struck down\nLike we're not talking about towns the size of Dallas or the size of New York city it's not like they spent nine million dollars and they were like oh wow like they spent nine million dollars and that meant that they couldn't move forward with road construction and so this was actually a material sacrifice\nOn the part of these towns the only person who appears to have a really benefited from this is Kris Kobach so if you think now about you know that strategy ... earlier\nYou know that strategy earlier to what's happening in the United states right now I'm you know what is what is the larger narrative that you see that's at play here in this moment in the United states when we have Donald Trump and the White House\nAnd directing a kind of particular perspective on policies regarding immigration you know I\nI think that prior to Trump getting elected and prior to Trump\nBeing it's hard line on immigration has he has been it was really easy to dismiss people like Kris Kobach but now now does elements of the Republican Party are leading the country and he has a much more impactful voice than he otherwise what\nI think that we can learn from what he has told us he believes in\n[noise]\nI think that it is a sign that radical elements of our country have sort of taken a much larger role and we can no longer just missed [noise]\n\nJust because they do so much for all of your reporting in for joining us on the usa thanks so much ... she had like [noise]\n\nJessica who's meant is a journalist at ProPublica who covers national politics and civil rights we did reach out to the ... campaign\nFor comment on the

was just an ear is not I mean it woke me up out of a does sleep suddenly jumped up\nAnd later she told me she knew she knew the minute she her the during a visit who'd been knocking on doors you know six thirty quarter to seven in the morning and stuff like seven o'clock quite remember exactly [noise] and she didn't say a word she got to grab the good of the girls you know and and went in a room and this was holding them\nCindy is a Mexican American mother of three and she was being arrested for the crimes of her ex boyfriend a drug dealer even though he's been dead for six years the police charged Cindy\nFor having lived in the same house as her ex boyfriend when he broke the law she received a Fifteen year mandatory sentence for conspiracy [noise]\n[noise]\nI mean I have a child\nYou're going to charge higher\nThan any of that credit\nIn\nCindy story isn't unique it's part of something called the girlfriend problem it's a side effect of the sentencing laws were women end up serving time for the drug crimes of their significant others even though they had\nTime for the drug crimes of their significant others even though they had little to do with those crimes [noise] filmmaker Rudy bud is turned his sister's Cindy's experience in prison into a documentary film called the sentence just premiered on HBO\nAnd the film looks at the impact of Cindy's time in prison on her and her family and also her fight for early release\nI'm joined now by both Cindy and her brother Rudy to talk about the film and life during an after incarceration [noise] so Cindy what was your reaction at the very beginning so you just get sentenced to Fifteen Years and your brother's like\nHey I'm can we make a documentary about this I mean did you kind of want to kill them at that point ...\n... it wasn't a documentary and when he started to film a initially it was just he was taking videos of the girls for me so when I came home I could one day watch them run and play and you know the little girls because I was missing all those things\nAnd so it wasn't until a few years later that he was like hey you know I think this could be a documentary I really want to tell your story and by then I had already met you know so many women whose story was just like mine and\nI understood that nobody knew it was really going on and I wanted to share the story I wanted I thought it was very important I still think it's so important that was a devastating thing to happen to our family you know not just to me it happened to my mom my dad you know my daughter's\nIt was hard for them you know throughout this whole process so it was an easy decision to say yes brother share a story like it was almost my way of you know ...\nShare a story like it was almost my way of you know screaming to the world what was happening there a lot\nOf things in this country that are filled with shame that we don't talk about one of those issues is incarceration and I really do appreciate the fact that this is something that most people would never want to reveal you your whole family was like ruining take this public\nI think she was a great word to bring up here because one of the layers in one of the overall themes that I wanted to bring about in this film\nWas shame and changing the stigma of a being incarcerated individual in what that meant and also being with family have incarcerated individual in what that meant and freely letting people look at what the true ramifications we're so that we could possibly\nPut a little bit of that shame on the system\nSo Cindy there's a point in the film early in your sentence [noise] where you're talking to your then husband and you basically say like look I'm trying to hold it together here I'm not telling you how bad it is 'cause I don't want you guys to know [noise] [laughter]\nWhat is it to be a woman in a prison what didn't you want to tell that you can tell them out\nI mean there's a lot of things there's we can go on and on I mean I never felt safe I mean they were mostly well they were all male guards\nThere were always people who were needing a lot of mental health it it was a very heightened emotional place to be so you couldn't say something to somebody without wandering\nYou couldn't say something to somebody without wondering how they were going to react they weren't bad people but they were put in bad situations and motions ran high\nI mean and I'm I'm figuring that there are some things that I'm seeing these insane\nRight about now you write like she kept a lot of that from us throughout the incarceration and you know a lot of people will credit the family for me so strong and sticking by her throughout this entire process but you know in so many ways Cindy was the strongest person",

to ... none of the was known as the fork lift truck stimulated to those in a non Jews to run in\nThe ... this is a forklift simulator game\nOr just dealing with Fox is important and it's up to me to stop the fish and\nIt's like a video of like people playing you know people post on Youtube videos of themselves playing games and they other people I Love to watch yeah I don't understand why but yes yeah it's like a whole thing I don't get it either but like this has seven hundred thousand views and it's just like this dude\nTo outline and like driving a forklift around and trying to pick stuff up and like put other places yeah but when I think it's funny too and I want to show us like if you look at the comments\nSome people are like giving tip so like I drive a forklift and they don't go super fast but it feels like they do when you're in close quarters and warehouses maybe thirty five to forty miles per hour someone else's like keep your forks low to the ground when traveling like under six inches high prevents loads from tumbling off the forks I'm a forklift driver\nGot all these people commenting like actually drive forklifts and far less and the reason I ended up watching this weird Youtube video is that I've been spending a lotta time doing research on the future of jobs and the economy and in fact I found out that a lot of our future jobs involve forklifts and that's because one of the\nFastest growing industries in our country today in the industry of moving and storing stuff especially stuff that we order on line\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWe're going to start our show by diving into one of the fastest growing part of the American economy it's warehouses it\nOf the American economy it's warehouses it\nWe're the party in between space that all of this stuff from cat food to fuzzy socks flows through on the way to us and the industry is exploding\nTwenty third team then President Obama visited an Amazon warehouse in Chattanooga, Tennessee and he gave a speech about the future of jobs in America with a particular focus on getting a better bargain for the middle class we've invited\nFrom the worst recession since the great depression at a golf millions of Americans are jobs homes and their savings and what does it wasn't\nThe long term laser that's been happening when it comes to middle class you're\nObama talked about bringing back manufacturing jobs but he was also there in Chattanooga to highlight job growth in other sectors Amazon had just announced that it was hiring thousands of workers for its warehouses nationwide\nNow over the next two years experts are saying that the warehousing industry needs to hire over four hundred thousand workers just to keep up with the growth and e commerce so the jobs of tomorrow are actually warehouse work\nAnd many of those jobs will be held by Latinos and let the nuts currently in about forty percent of Eighteen to thirty four year olds working in the where housing business are

from working in warehouses\nNo our producers of your buddies that car is taking a tour real warehouse where these young people might work one day\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nIf you remember Patterson, California has all of these warehouses over by the highway and it's a perfect place for them it's empty flat and just a quick hour and a half to San Francisco\nOne of those warehouses if Amazon\nI reach out to them to see if I could come take a look around and\nAnd visiting the facility gave me a sense of what the future of warehousing well actually look like at the commerce gross especially when it comes to increased automation [noise]\nAs I entered the building bears just this wall of turnstiles floor to ceiling kind that you see in the New York city subway\nAnd there are signs everywhere at say no photos\nOnce a guard left me and I realize it's springtime tons of employees are streaming out through the airport security style scanners\nUnder our feet [noise]\nAh we play more than ...\nUh we also him way more than a hundred full time\nI get a tour of the facility from Danny to forget who introduced herself as a community specialist I'm not sure what that means in fact there is a lot of Amazon specific language I hear on my tour Amazon calls are warehouses fulfillment centers they call all their workers associate\nEntry level jobs are known as tier one and over and over again I keep hearing the phrase so stealing our customer promise workers were\nWalking around there or stop signs in a lot of places and lines on the ground like wrote\nWhich is good because I'm\nWe will see another one in a minute we called them ADD ATVs\nBasically it's like a forklift loaded up with items but it's totally unmanned and it follows a map of the warehouse floor programmed into it\nEverything in this warehouse is yellow and gray except for another kind of robot that works here they're bright orange\nWhen you think of robots this isn't always but people have in mind this is Lauren\nLynch who does communications for Amazon [noise] they're\nPerson shaped robots more like big orange room because they're square and on top of each of them is a set of shelves which holds items\nOperate in this\nSo this is how it works so somebody really wants to order a back massager they click it on line once they do that that's when the ice\nOrder a back massager they click it on line once they do that that's one of the item gets ...\nYou're a notice on the screen\nProvided the item\nAnd then a quantity and how many they need\nTo pick back massager a second worker calls the orange robots over retrieved massager from shelf and then puts it on the yellow ...\nKind of like those airport security trace which go on a conveyor belt set and I stopped in the process\nThat we're going to go and so\nAt the population is what it sounds like basically the back massager comes in on the yellow tray and the worker packed into box no robots here this is a place where someone gets to see all the secrets of what we order online\nAnd today that someone is a very peppy ... so what do you have\nMachine\nI Want to know what is the weirdest combo stuff she's seen someone order\nI ask her how many items does she have to pack a day\nWell I Know in our they want us to do about as Greece so\nSomebody would do an hour here and so you can do that we worked ... hours a day\nNormally do for the week so if you do the math actually packs around two thousand five hundred and twenty item a week\nSo the very last thing that happens to your back massager is that it gets a shipping lately all of the labor at this point is done by a magical puff of air\nBy a magical puff of air\nLabel is created and generally play into the air on top of all\nThat sound you hear\nOn the air that is a thing it ought to be this hard I have to admit it's literally my favorite [noise]\n\nSo the robots Amazon pretty amazing and on the way and I pass signs of a mother's room and there are vending machines that I see two\nThey're free to workers with items like ear plugs lotion Advil just this week Amazon announced that they're raising their minimum hourly\nWage to Fifteen dollars but over the last few years Amazon has been grilled about their working conditions for example public records show that thousands of Amazon employees are on food stamps and ... are misleading because they include people who only worked there for a short period of time or worked part time\nAnd a book published this year by a reporter who worked undercover at an Amazon facility in the u._k. details that workers often wouldn't even take bathroom breaks because they feared not making work quota and that workers were actually penalized for taking six days\nAnd responded that they didn't recognize these allegations that's accurate they also said they coach people who aren't making the quotas and that their attendance policy has changed these kinds of conditions are part of why employee turnover at Amazon is a very high while I'm Amazon I asked learn about the\nWe don't have power over light individuals make the decisions they make to stay in a career or a role for whatever period of time\nThey make to stay in a career or a role for whatever period of time they choose to but we are able to do is provide a great work place with great team members and great benefits\nA consequence of so many workers turning in and out of warehouses is that it's really hard for them to push for their rights if they have concerns there are no unionized Amazon warehouses in the United states\nAmazon primarily believes in an open door policy we believe in the ability to talk directly with associates\nOpen door policy basically she's saying that they'd rather have employees talk to their managers that they have a problem than work with a union to voice concern\n[noise] [noise]\nSo without strong worker protections and in an ever shifting workforce are these the jobs that the graduates of Patterson high school really want I head down to Los Angeles to place reckoning with these questions [noise]\n\nThe warehouse workers resource center is located in Long Beach on one side of the room is a wall of photos of workers protesting on the other side\nIs one of the only organizations in the country that advocates for warehouse\nWorkers the train people on things like wage theft and how to file for workers' comp for injuries at the warehouse enter the day I visit is Duane wealth and he's twenty five and he drove forklifts for local warehouses\nAlike working in a way as it is now ... you know your muscles as a child going into\nTweens been working in warehouses and the last seven years after he dropped out of college to start helping his family his mom got sick and he helped out paying rent and bills the biggest problem for him\nHealth out paying rent and bills the biggest problem for him though is the lack of consistent hours the Wayne doesn't work directly for the warehouse he worked for a temp agency and the agency is supposed to have him working at the warehouse forty hours a week but\nSometimes they don't want them to do was we wouldn't be on the so\nTwain sometimes lines up at five AM in the morning first shift at six AM after being called in and still get turned away sometimes the only one full week a month doing shows me his phone\nHe gives me voted the sniffles or\nOkay so it had senior manager and the work tomorrow he says not tomorrow they can I at least we're friday like can you give me anyways is necessarily Thursday night of the things that other than you taxes I worked in a while you\nKnow but that is a constant threat of that basically yeah\nAnd after moving up and getting off the temp hamster wheel green says he's never even seen a way to apply directly for a full time job at the warehouse that he works at\nBasically warehousing companies use temp agencies because it's cheaper\nTemp agencies provide a steady stream of labor to warehouses that don't have to worry about recruiting workers or managing them they take money out of each worker's hourly wage and joins us as a temp agency doesn't tell them how much it could be a dollar ten dollars they don't know and a lot of work or a steady paycheck makes workers less likely to speak up\nBecause they don't want to risk sacrificing the hours they do have\n... case he says he'd like to go back to school maybe become a writer but that's not his plan right now\nThe kind of loose going to school\nThat's not his plan right now\nI kind of ... going to school like the things that they as do I wish I didn't complain about 'cause it doesn't seem so ... so difficult anymore [noise]\nNo it's not it's not about being confrontational it's about seeking connection it's about allowing elected officials to remember who they represent to connect their humanity to your humidity\nWhen\nI was asking myself that question of whether I Want it to tell my story or not and in that moment I just went with it\nAnd he said you know I I was five he was Fifteen\nAnd I shared at that time when I was five with two adults not my parents who either didn't believe me or didn't know what to do that information they never did anything so then I just understood the lesson that\nWe are not believed and these boy he understood the lesson that boys will be boys and I don't want my children to learn that lesson\n\nI Want to believe that in our country we actually listened to survivors\nAnd it was a very painful moment I cried after because I realized\nOh my God maybe my father will hear it this way for me and my mother who hear this way [noise] and then [noise] it didn't reach them but then on friday I texted me that right after\nInteraction with lake and they said you might hear something and then use I Want you to know that I Am okay and he said\nTo know that I Am okay and he said I'm\nSorry I was not able to protect you and I said to him it was not your fault that it's not my fault and they feel very supported by you but you know that fear was confirmed I didn't tell them my story because I didn't want him and other people who love me to\nHave to hold that pain\nAnd I'm not doing it alone like I'm doing it with all these women and I feel so much in community with thousands of women I have never met but whose stories I deeply deeply understand\nWhen you see what happened in the moment with Senator Flake how do you connect that to the kind of activism that you've been doing and developing on immigration how did those two worlds come together in that moment for you\nA lot of the conversation about a survivors has centered or the stories of women kind of without talking about the rest of their experience of who we are I Can't separate\nMe being a woman from being led the now from being an immigrant from being a mother\nAnd now accepting and embracing these other part of my identity as a survivor I think the history of these countries a history of the struggle for inclusion\nOf more of us and the promise of freedom\nIn some ways the the act of bird dog named Senator Flake people will say it is your most overt political act in some deeply human ways it's the least political act\nYeah I think it was the mother and me\n... yeah [noise] I think it was the mother and me\nHonestly that came out there is a quote by a seat activist Valerie

...\nSays the guerrilla fighters inflated their membership rolls of innocent civilians so that they would seem bigger than they really were even if those civilians had no affiliation with the insurgent groups in real life so it was difficult to know whether my uncle ... or anyone else in the family was actually involved in or [noise]\n\nLike me my cousin's curiosity grew with he got older and a few years later he started his own investigation into what really happened to his dad\nHis quest took 'em to amounted lined the town where the family recovered his father's body he spoke to retired gorillas in the area and local law enforcement and the story he pieced together it was very different than the one ... told me\nThis story makes more sense if you consider how dangerous Guatemala was in those days and why my family might have wanted to hide the real reasons for my uncle's death\nWhen a ... ... if you if you get\nIf I ... that can be if you if you get your own in ... and we're not feeling\nFrom Alex discovered where his dad died on a farm all trying to collect the famous war tax the war tax was with the grill is charged farms in rural areas to help support themselves but it was mostly imposed on people so it was more like extortion and donations and this is where it gets complicated\nSomebody must have alerted the locals that my uncle and his friends were coming because when they arrived members of the military would there waiting\nFor them when do you say that I don't ... don't get us how that um [noise]\nYeah ... new book is was helping me if I

guerilla fighter\nThe other version is that he was a guerilla fighter who was extorting people and ended up mutilated by the military given how different these two stories are I asked my cousin about the origins of the bar story after all the bar room version wasn't in any newspaper it was what my uncles told us\nYou don't put as soon as I mean a set of baking no fighting a less they look at the U.S will say these poor people yep I thought I Will build my cousin\nWe do know that they look at the actual city of ... up I thought I looked at my cousin said that after his father died people threatened the family and told them all not to talk about what happened\nAlex things maybe this is when our family decided to tell the love triangle story instead and he says it's okay for them to have their version he's keeping his gaze again because if you don't get your mechanical niche you\n... ...\n... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ...\nI don't know if in the end my uncle oh Hondros a hero or a villain I'd heard that the fog of war treats situations like my uncles were the trees campaigns down\nBut I didn't expect was that people could come to prefer this fog [noise]\nFrom my mom excavating such awful stories about her brother is something she wants to avoid\nWhich is partly why she's only returned to Guatemala a handful of times in the last forty years\nAnd I noticed that some people said that to me why one that was the one I didn't want to use as I don't want to ...

Garcia joined us and she actually does work in Mexico city\n\nAnd she does autopsies on otherwise healthy youth that are basically you know killed in traffic accidents that or other accidental deaths and she looked at their brains and she's compared their brains to the brains of you\nWho have died of similar causes and less polluted Mexican cities like better crews and she basically finds that they have\nBrain structures that resemble people who have early stage ...\nDisease so she can actually visually see in the brains of these young people\nThese changes which\nShe believes are tied to the air pollution that the children must be you know breathing in as they live their lives and heavily polluted city like\nMexico City so in the report the term environmental justice is talked about a lot mhm it and it's been around for a while but just to make sure 'cause there are different definitions what exactly in your view is your definition of environmental justice well\nThe paper that we published and environmental research takes a perspective on distribution all environmental injustice with which has to do with how\nYou know health harming pollution is distributed in space and then how certain social groups are disproportionately exposed to that pollution in their neighborhoods or in our paper in their schools\nSays or just to kind of end on this concept of environmental justice what might justice look like\nThe environmental justice what might justice looked like for for these communities that are challenged\nSo I think it's really tricky because we can't just shift the pollution around [noise]\n[noise]\nThere's evidence that at the environmental justice movement was achieving some success in the Nineteen seventies in the Nineteen eighties\nWhere you know our backyards or getting at least somewhat cleaner in certain parts of the United states that basically what was happening was these burdens like waste incineration was shifting from the United states to other countries\n[noise] so it's not in my backyard versus not on planet earth right and I think moving towards that nope not on planet earth whereby we make very conscious decision to protect our children you know remedy environmental injustices that have been perpetrated against people of color in this country for a very long time\nHas to happen in terms of reducing the pollution everywhere and for everyone and not just you know shifting it on to some other less powerful person who then has to deal with that [noise]\n\nSarah thank you so much for all of your research we really appreciate it thank you [noise]\n... ... is one of the researchers behind the national pollution study she's a researcher and professor at the University of Utah and now for the fans of the\n... original series is lost Hi Emmy nominated actor GED Porto who played his shoes is back in a new FX series Mayans M.
