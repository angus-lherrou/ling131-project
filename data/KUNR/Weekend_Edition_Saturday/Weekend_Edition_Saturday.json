from traveling since his father had left the kingdom to go into exile\nOh there's no question the royal family had banned him from traveling since his father had left the kingdom to go into exile and

efforts by the Russian backed Internet research agency to use Twitter budge to influence Americans in a wide variety of controversial topics including\nIssues raised in sports Andrew beaten sports reporter for the wall Street Journal is written about the impact rushing trolls have had on the controversy over players who kneel during the plane of the national anthem to beaten joins us from New York Thanks so much for being with us thanks so much for having me on\nWhy was this Internet research agency interested in whether football players took her new you're not during the plane of the anthems well\nAt first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at we're sowing discord this\nIssue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues\nSixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets but it's not just people that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this\nWas an issue that reached the top of\nThe food chain what did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency well\nWhat we found was these tweets had gone all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement\nThen we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen\nPresident Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University who helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA sailing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players\nIt's interesting to look at that breakdown wonder how that influenced the conversation\nMm So it it it wasn't direct the TV in a certain result just to to stir things up apparently yeah\nAnd the result just to to stir things up apparently\nYeah and the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraught contentious issue\nAnd also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to try to track to this debate\nAh I gather a lot of these accounts have been closed right yeah so the accounts from this study have been closed but you know what we see with these it sometimes seems to be a game of whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up\nAnd one of the interesting notes that the clubs and professors had was that these are closed but they're monitoring new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations and they're continuing to weigh in\nOn controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charged moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue to weigh in\nAndrew beaten in the wall Street Journal thanks so much for being with us\nThanks so much for having me on\nYears is not a lot of time if you're say Betty White you know what's good for twentieth anniversary is drier Lynch and we have a whole lot of it on our way to

there is something goofy about the bad stuff will highlight that\nAll I can say is the worst of the news and sometimes it's been very bad the more we feel an obligation to step up to the plate and

taking credit for it because he hasn't spoken to me since [laughter]\nAnd the second president the second president was Bill Clinton who appeared post presidency that's right and one of the things I have loved to be able to do obviously again to can compare and contrast your job in the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues\nAs your job and the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues of the day their positions they're inside\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human beings and I take some pride in that if we can get somebody like more recently John Case it for example and we can show the audience that he's actually a very funny guy can tell a story\nThen sure people will go on and they'll think what they think about John Case but they might also have those opinions but now they apply them to a human being I Love bill Curtis yeah how could you not and I miss Carl Kasell\nWe all you've had

in the world series\nJoining us now to talk about some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael friends who teaches political science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political ed these days it's not negative it might just watching the wrong spaces\nWell it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that\nWell it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pit the policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those\nTogether you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition yeah have you\nNoticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV\nThat are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting a job on\nYes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tends to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content online\nThere's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter singer of the season on through\nUh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have ...\nUh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in\nWays that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as essentially being connected to terrorist organizations and that kind of explicit attack is not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been sent out to a number of people and and questions are being raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric in public discourse these days do you draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and the fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nWell yeah this is a tough one to um decipher because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is at an all time high political advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say it as a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television have to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes and so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle but you are also speaking to a middle the set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic in those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael Franz boat in college who is co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being

[noise] you know there were some times maybe from innings fourteen to Seventeen when I took a little does here and there but uh in general it was an absolutely riveting and in stunning\nEighteen pictures used including by by the way Clayton Kurdish arguably the best picture on the field although not last night as a pinch hitter he didn't even throw the ball or does is anybody left to throw the game tonight\nWell the Dodgers have named starting pitcher rich hill after the game Red Sox manager Alex Cora still haven't decided who he's starting later today in game for he had used up pretty much everyone is part of his when now philosophy and that includes\nNathan you've all these Scott six innings in relief he threw just shy of a hundred pitches he was brilliant and of course max\nShy of a hundred pitches he was brilliant and of course max Muncie ruined it for him and the Dodgers Walker bealer regattas a healer dealer [laughter] my God he was a brilliant this was two games you know literally was tonight any games\nAnd for the first game Walker Mueller was the star uh he threw seven innings he was given the ball and asked to basically save\nThe Dodgers season because if the Dodgers had gone down three oh no teams ever come back in the world series from a three oh deficit Walker below goes at Heathrow seven innings holds the mighty Red Sox line up to two hits he was fantastic he turned the ball over after the seventh inning\nTo can lead chance and they're great reliever and had he not given up a home run to Boston it would have been just kind of a normal\nWhen with Walker bealer being the start of the night does not LA now have anything left in the tank to win ... that's a good question to ask either of these teams Scott because they both put absolutely everything and more into this game\nLA one and so they're they're feeling really good about that but you know going into game for but both teams are stocked with professional baseball players they'll figure out a way to you know to win for their teams and if we predict something now it will inevitably be wrong so the one thing we can say we've got a series now\nAnd uh it's fun Tom Goldman thanks

Scott Simon\nLast week federal prosecutors unsealed a criminal complaint which described efforts by the Russian backed Internet research agency to use Twitter budge to influence Americans in a wide variety of controversial topics including issues raised in sports\nAndrew beaten sports reporter for the wall Street Journal is written about the impact rushing trolls have had on the controversy over players shouldn't deal during the plane of the national anthem just beaten joins us from New York Thanks so much for being with us\nThanks so much for having me on why was this Internet research agency\nThanks so much for having me on why was this Internet research agency interested in whether football players took a near not during the plane or the anthem well\nAt first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at we're sowing discord this\nIssue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets but it's not just\nPeople that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain\nWhat did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency well\nWhat we found was these tweets had gone all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement\nThen we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen\nPresident Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan\nOr is which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University who helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA sailing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that break down wonder how that influenced the conversation\n... so it it it wasn't director achieving a certain result just to to stir things up apparently\nAnd the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraught\nContentious issue and also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to try to track to this debate [noise]\nUh I gather a lot of these accounts have been closed right yeah so the accounts from this study have been closed but you know what we see with these it sometimes seems to be a game of whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up\nAnd one of the interesting notes that the ... and professors had was that these are closed but they're monitoring new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations and they're continuing to weigh in\nOn controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charge moment and then that's the type of things\nColin Kaepernick which again became a charged moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue to weigh in Andrew beaten in the wall Street Journal thanks so much for being

Scott Simon negative campaign ads have become just about as much a part of the season is pumpkin spice in the world series\nJoining us now to talk about some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael friends who teaches political science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political ed these days it's not negative am I just watching the wrong spaces\n[laughter] well it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pit\nThe policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those together you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition yeah\nUh have you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV\nThat are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen but one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is\nSo as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ads on line\n[noise] yes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tends to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content on line\nThere's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter singer of the season aren't you\n[laughter] uh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as essentially being\nConnected to terrorist organizations\nAnd that kind of explicit attack is not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been sent out to a number of people and and questions being raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric in public discourse these days do draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and the fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nYeah this is a tough one to decipher because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between boats\nI think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is at an all time high political advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say it as a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television have to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes and so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle but you are also speaking to a middle the set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic in those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael Franz boat in college who is co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure and brown weekend edition Sunday Lulu

what a game unbelievable I I watched all of it well kind of all of that I I watched um [noise] you know there were some times maybe ... fourteen through Seventeen when I took a little does here and there but in general it was absolutely riveting and and stunning\nEighteenth pictures used including by by the way Clayton Kurdish arguably the best picture on the field although not last night as a pinch hitter he didn't even throw the ball a does is anybody left to throw the game tonight\n[laughter] well the Dodgers have named the starting pitcher rich hill after the game Red Sox manager Alex ... still hadn't decided who he's starting later today and game for he had used up pretty much everyone is part of his when now philosophy and that includes\nNathan you've all these Scott six innings and relief he threw just shy of a hundred pitches\nHe was brilliant and of course max Muncie ruined it for him and the Dodgers Walker bealer we got to say dealer dealers [laughter] if I got he was a brilliant this was two games you know literally was tonight any games\nAnd for the first game Walker Mueller was the star uh he threw seven innings he was given the ball and has to basically save\nThe

neighborhood um we are kind of thing at an intersection at pretty rainy and cold and\nNeighborhood uh Pittsburgh which is a traditionally Jewish neighborhood um we are kind of standing at an intersection it's pretty rainy and cold and there are a lot of police cars a lot of ambulances\nUm and there are members of the community some are crying summer not really sure what's happening and then you know you see people who haven't heard anything about this so far who are on a morning Walker morning run and then they see these police cars and they're not not quite sure what's happening\n[noise] do do we know anything about the density of the victims at this point\n[noise] um we have not been briefed police have yet to do a another update with us at ... the last I heard which was about an hour ago um they had a suspect in custody they were not commenting on victims but there were ...\n... and there's still a morning for residents with the neighborhood to shelter in place which would suggest that they they're not your altogether shirt and that it's just this one person they open toasted it wasn't true\nYeah that's what I Would assume too I mean we don't have any information about that but the the police are asking members of the community to\nStay inside um this happened at a synagogue is just a couple of blocks away from where we are now um I've been told that you know usually on a on a Saturday morning like this or fifty or sixty people who might come to a worship\nThere and um so it's it's it's right in our neighborhood rate here so we're not quite sure what's going to happen\nThis is a famous neighborhood in Pittsburgh has been for some time isn't it\nYeah it is this world here in this world will neighborhood um is is traditionally a of a Jewish neighborhood neighborhood here and\nI was told by I'm a member of the community who's the head of the Jewish Federation of greater Pittsburgh that over fifty percent of Jewish residents live here I live in this concentrated neighborhood it's a beautiful neighborhood big\nBrick houses I'm a Jewish community center is a couple blocks away and so this is a really important part of the Jewish community and that's part of Pennsylvania\nAnd we will we will turn our listeners\nPart of the Jewish community and that's part of ...\nAnd we will we will tell our listeners we are aware of the fact that there are a multiple numbers that are being reported on various social media platforms and in fact uh\nUh some social media platforms who purport to know the identity of the person who is in custody we do not report that until we can certify that as a fact uh and and so it was Lucy I'm sure you're aware of that but officials\nHave not for him that identity of you have they\nCrack at the gym\nOr um the I Know you and other members of the media going to be on the scene it must be hard to get to gain access but I gather that police and and perhaps the mayor will be having a press conference right\nYes there are represented from the police department here governor well uh it's actually also here and I'm told that I'm the mayor if you're obviously but I'm told that either a politician and lawmakers from the area are making their way here to offer as much help and support as possible\nLucy Perkins of one of our member stations W E essay in Pittsburgh thanks so much for

chilling events a school shooting range church bombings in this week along thankfully no one's harm bomb threats\nSo much harder than others to have fun with the news Oh yes but we know that we have a particular role or handling all that stuff\nThat's your job and we know that what our audience wants is for us to make them feel a little better and if that takes a ignoring the bad stuff and focusing on the goofy them will do that if there is something goofy about the bad stuff will highlight that\nAll I can say is the worst of the news and sometimes it's been very bad\nThe more we feel an obligation to step up to the plate and really bring the silly [noise] you've had so many um famous gas including of course of a president of United States to two presidents of the yeah we had the rock Obama before he became president but I'm taking credit for it because he hasn't spoken to me since [laughter]\nAnd the second president the second president was Bill Clinton who appear to host president say that's right and one of the things I have loved to be able to do obviously again to can compare and contrast your job and the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues of the day their positions they're inside\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human beings and I take some pride in that if we can get somebody like more recently John Case it for example and we can show the audience that he's actually very funny guy can tell a story\nThen sure people will go on and they'll think what they think about John Case but they might also have those opinions but now they apply them to a human being I Love bill Curtis yeah how could you not and I miss Carl Kasell\nWe all you've had some great partners I haven't I've been blessed and I have stood on the shoulders are next to the shoulders of giants as everyone knows are not only was Carl Kasell original judge and

sense of humor gosh yes yes and he runs a little shall we say salacious I Believe is the public radio word will use and every now and then our audience gets a glimpse of that but my favorite thing is when off air he'll let loose with the profanity\nAnd it is stunning to hear that voice using that language\nOh my gosh you can it can boil the hair right off the it was quite fun\nWe go who richer the music the music of course was written by BJ Lederman what a coincidence coincidence ours do did you ask him what the heck that noise is at the beginning of our theme almost as if\nHe's starting to the

at is expected to Samantha conservative majority on the court\nNPR's Ron Elving joined just run thanks so much for being with us good morning Scott now we could both named conservative justices Souter Stevens black men Kennedy who issued who joined a liberal and progressive is on the court\nBut uh this confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh could have impact for generations could\nOh yes we assumed the current lineup of five justices who were appointed by three Republican presidents to named Bush out to by Donald Trump will be around for some time\nAnd this will be the first time that the court has five members were alumni of the federalist society who it's been which has been growing for some of the court for years and a swelling presence on the federal bench at its lower levels and with the Trump Administration and White House counsel Don McGahn or they have truly come into their own\n... what do we need to know about\nThe federalist society especially is they're going to be um more prominent than ever and us life\nOr the group got started at a couple of law schools in the early Nineteen eighties it was a pushback by students in Google's legal scholars are people who are convinced that the court had become too liberal to inclined to read the constitution to accommodate the outlook and philosophy of a few justices with big ideas about social and political

were raised in the way they were raised against Brett Kavanaugh\nBut Mitt terms are more often driven by anger than satisfaction and right now polls show a lot of women and younger voters are unhappy with Kavanaugh and even many Republican women are unhappy with their party and that could also be a big factor in the midterms\nNow it's interesting to me you point to anger and that certainly

Georgia's Megan thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you were at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations of sexual assault by Christian blessing for it now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter]\nUm what's that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes I don't\nThink so I think well I mean yes and no right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes\nOr perhaps not as often as we'd like um I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with the as it than look to possible\nThat they should confirm me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote\nYou know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all information out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrat\nOne first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also you need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate that says the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal some people say it wasn't\nA I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true and then I had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative by not providing she had basically choose the crowd I wasn't aware of the fact because she was well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she told and sort of two thousand Seventeen to those and they tend to should\nPeople there basically to his of cooperation were her therapists notes which would seem to say look she talked about this all they're not we have another name in two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph\nAnd she would not provide the therapists notes\nTo the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear\nBut the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her you know and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen foot\n... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's ... Christian bushy Ford a sincere a book that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating\nA book that she couldn't let a church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support right a judge\nNow the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and there's an inherently difficult crime because you know some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated to consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible um and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in this neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy in being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews for Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you don't inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh has gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved from people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth\nUm it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it's it's way worse than\nBeing put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it it's way worse than what ... making the cardinals thanks so much think you can do to\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from thousands of pages of financial documents\nThe president called the article quote a hit piece with us now to talk about some of the allegations is Tim O'Brien he's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course is executive editor Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat's easily the head of this one I don't think that's a news though\nI think the nuts and bolts that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent\nTo protect the family's vast wealth for about a billion dollars or so in in wealth\nTo keep it in the family to keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump tasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid\nInheritance and gift taxes or in other words the trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred and instead they they paid around fifty million or so\nWhen when Donald Trump has said over the years I built with I built myself\nWhen Donald Trump percent over the years I built that I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing for low to middle income people\nAnd uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co signed a loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that the times really flashed that out with a lot of new numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really late ... and that story so that's another\nImportant theme of the story which is the president is set on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] is there anything that you did you can recognize and that may be people going over the story now can recognize this distinctly illegal\nYeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when ... and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they used and appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests that that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called an odd little company was essentially a shell company called all county that the Trump family used to inflate\nCompany called all county that the Trump family used to inflate how much they were spending on equipment and supplies for their\nArmada of buildings so they could then pocket the differential themselves rather than pay income tax on it all of that stuff is possibly highly fraudulent the trick is the statute of limitations has passed on much of it\nSo it most they may may end up with civil penalties on this but I I suspect that's not what bothers the president the most about what I think really will get under his skin about this is that it it knocks down this idea that he pulled himself up by his own bootstraps\nAnd he he earned his living on his own rather than being someone who was born on third base and said he hit a triple which was essentially the

reached their final judgment\nDecisions as early as\nRepublican Jeff Flake of Arizona who will bring about the weeklong delaying the confirmation process to allow for additional investigation by the FBI and accusations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh fellow Republicans reluctantly agreed that the delay\nInhale the FBI secret report as an exoneration Democrats called the investigation incomplete and unfair\nLet the confirmation process for judge Kavanaugh be recorded as a sorry epilogue to the brazen theft\nOf Justice Scalia's seat\nThat was Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer of

been indicated\nAlso I mean Donald Trump got sixty eight point five percent of the presidential vote in West Virginia in twenty sixteen can the argument being made that senator mentioned is just reflect in the Democratic we'll express for other people of West Virginia\nI I Do think that he is the poll showed that cabin uh people mostly most people at the party Kevin here however um I think he did it entirely politically because he's up for re election in thirty days and he he is under fifty percent of the polls right now so I think I think he did it to play the Republican base\nYeah well but when you choose a politician to being a politician or the that's not much of a surprise visit I mean he's running for reelection\nYeah of course and I did that to him yesterday on\nThursday we want to tell us about those meetings because you were you you met with him I guess for two hours on Thursday right\nYeah we did so we had a group of women who sat in his office on Monday and they were actually arrested a hit about nine women arrested they sat there for like ten hours listening to him they had a conference call with him on Monday that didn't really go out on Thursday we had a group of about fifty go up to D.C and we met with him on a two separate occasions\nThursday we had a group of about fifty go up to D.C and we met with him on a two separate occasions the first one we had

believe that Joe mansion cares for West Virginia I just don't think that's reflected in this decision\nDoes you're going to continue if a judge Kavanaugh is confirmed brothers do\nOur fight does continue so uh as far as the Senate go we it he kind of knew that he had us he kind of had to because the other options Patrick Morrisey has done terrible thing for West Virginia he's a big proponent of the opioid crisis that\nAnd so he kind of nearly doesn't believe in opioid addiction\nHe doesn't but he was a lobbyist for big pharmaceutical and West Virginia I he's our current attorney general and he's just terrible he's got Trump's endorsement and that he's just a bad guy and I think he knows the Democrat\n... camp though this is old your opinion with me underscore this is my\n... do of course this is my opinion yes of course um so yeah I think he believes that that he's still going to have the Democrat though and that he wants to get the Republicans as well well it does continue yeah\nSo we're working on um we're working at a state wide to change things just got a constitutional amendment on the ballot to ban abortion and Joe Manchin side we all have to get out and vote against that which we are doing\nWell it it it sounds as if you have accepted senator mansions vote for what it is and and still support among a great many issues and I I've gone to tell you this this sounds very civilized and democratic to me\nAnd I'm trying to play the long game I reluctantly at the port has because I think the I think Morsi's worst choice mansion does still support us on the AC

a culture where they think it's okay I Am trying to like give these girls and boys the voice to say like this is not OK I'm knocking tolerate in\nWomen aren't tolerating it either and the results are measurable this year sexual harassment reports to the EEOC or equal Employment Opportunity commission have gone up twelve percent\nShouldn't have gone up twelve percent that's after years of remaining

much lawyers can do of the thousands of sexual harassment reports that come in only a fraction get funded for legal help\nSome people are coming to us you know two years after this has happened to them for five years after this has happened to ten years after this has happened to them\nBecause they never felt comfortable coming forward before and the way the law is you have to report or bring a case within a certain amount of time so some of those women are out of time some of those women who are coming forward are independent contractors and unless you live in certain states you're not\nSomeone who are coming forward are independent contractors and unless you live in certain states you're not covered by discrimination law and so it's a matter of people coming forward and we

since two thousand four when the red Sox to the miraculous comeback coming back from three games down\nAnd obviously the red Sox and the Yankees for the first time in their history both when a hundred games in the same season and last night was a battle I was there and it was it was one of those types of games where it looked like a blow out the red Sox are up five nothing and then all of a sudden here come the Yankees simply because this is exactly what these teams are the red Sox have the better starting pitching\nThe Yankees have the better relief pitching the red Sox relief pitching really almost gave it up to ... Yankees had chances in sixth inning bases loaded basis lives in the seventh inning\nAnd if this is what it's going to be for the next four games I think we're in for a classic\nUh Houston Astros put the crunch on Cleveland's seven to two court club or a great pitcher God's clue or a club at you like this grows a lot\nI think the Astros a but my my motto Scott and all of this is that okay the red Sox won a hundred and they gave me the Yankees won a hundred games\nBut the actual still won a hundred hundred and two hundred and three games and they're still the defending champions and to me you're the champs until somebody beat you and I think they're the best team top to bottom of the best team in the line of the best team\nWith the best combination of relief pitching and starting pitching and they're scary and all of a sudden they're starting to look like\nChampions again even though for a lot\nSudden they're starting to look like champions again even though for a lot of ... that a lot of a lot of the season they weren't quite into it but then that good that they can sort of flip the switch and they seem to have done that\nBut what about the Dodgers they too straight shut outs against the Atlanta Braves\nAnd yeah this is interesting because nobody seemed to be any good in the national league this year nobody seemed to really take control let's not forget your cubs who I picked to go to the world series had the best record in the national league on Sunday and they were out of the playoffs by Tuesday night\nAnd you won't let me forget that but go ahead now I'm just saying that it's it's a crazy here and and we're talking about the brewers as well suddenly the brewers got shut out last night so all of a sudden you're starting to see all these teams begin to really play their best baseball\nAnd let's not forget we talk about the champs being champs until you knock them out while the Dodgers have the national league champs they went to\nThe seventh game of the world series last year I listen to the Astros so maybe the Dodgers are the team that's going to start getting warm at the right time as well but I can tell you one thing Scott you may not want to hear this although maybe not I don't think you have a problem with that I\nKinda like with the Milwaukee Brewers are doing and they've got the rocks already on the ropes merit to that and maybe you go to Colorado and things change but I I really like Milwaukee and the Dodgers I think this is just going to be great all of it's really good\nFinally we need to mention a twenty games suspension or in hockey Tom Wilson other cap shit Oscar sunkist or the blues on his Blind Side ... yeah NHL seems to be reacting to to head concussion more\nNow they're not reacting a they don't seem to be reacting they're reacting in there essentially sending the message that Tom Wilson to dirty player it's not just the fact that he had some 'cause in in drilled them in the head it's also that this is his fifth is his fourth suspension in the last hundred and five games so they have concluded that this guy when he gets on the ice is out\nThe last hundred and five games so they have concluded that this guy when he gets on the ice is out there to hurt people and the one of the things we always talk about with football is the danger but the thing we don't talk about is that hockey is just as dangerous and

Elving joined just run thanks so much for being with us good morning but now we could both named conservative justices Souter Stevens black men Kennedy who issued who joined a liberal and progressive is on the court\nBut uh this confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh could have impact for generations could\nYes we assumed the current lineup of five justices who were appointed by three Republican presidents to named to Bush and now to by Donald Trump will be around for some time\nAnd this will be the first time that the court has five members were alumni of the federalist society who it's been which has been a growing force in the court for years and a swelling\nA growing force on the court for years and a swelling presence on the federal bench is lower levels and with the Trump Administration and White House counsel Don McGahn or they have truly come into their own ... what do we need to know about the federalist society\nEspecially as they are going to be um more prominent than ever in us life\nOf the group got started at a couple of law schools in the early Nineteen eighties it was a pushback by students in Google's legal scholars\nAre people who are convinced that the court had become too liberal to inclined to read the constitution to accommodate the outlook and philosophy of a few justices with big ideas about social and political justice\nMembers of the society of indicated a desire to revisit some of the landmark decisions of the past two generations\nAsking the question of whether or not the basis for those decisions was in the constitution or whether it was being supplied by somebody's interpretation of the constitution and let let's underscore there's nothing remotely secretive about this right\nAnd not a secret society at all and they've been quite public about their campaign and about their influence within the Republican Party\nAnd about their desire to revisit things like the privacy concept in roe versus Wade that legalized abortion or even the one person one vote concept that required state legislative districts to have equal population\nUm if Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation is the the the combination of of decades of organizing um are Republicans energized get out to the polls about a month from now or do many feel mission accomplished\nThere could be both a feeling of accomplishment ended up feeling of\nCould be both a feeling of accomplishment and a feeling of opportunity to press further and some resentment over the confirmation process and some of the accusations that were raised in the way they were raised against Brett Kavanaugh\nBut midterms are more often driven by anger than satisfaction and right now polls show a lot of women and younger voters are unhappy with Kavanaugh and even many Republican women are unhappy with their party and that could also be a big factor in the midterms I'm\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from universal pictures presenting the new film first men from Damien ...

Kavanaugh seems to be on a clear path to be confirmed for the Supreme Court\nBut the battle is become a flashpoint following allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school Meghan ... column is for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views [laughter] which we will come and she joined just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause and the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian balls before now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter]\nUm what's that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes\nDon't think so I think well I mean yes and now right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like\nBecause that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like um I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with as it than look to possible that they should confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote\nYou know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the sins of the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal and people say it wasn't\nA I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true and I had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative by not providing she had basically choose the crowd I wasn't aware of that because she was in well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she told and sort of two thousand Seventeen to those and they tend to should\nPeople there basically to because of cooperation were her therapist notes which would seem to say look she talked about this all they're not we have another name in two thousand twelve and the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about it\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee\n'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear but the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her you know and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen foot\n... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's ... Christian buzz you forward a sincere\nA book that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support right a judge\nNow the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we had been grappling with for a very long time and as an inherently difficult crime because you know some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated\nTo consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible um and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in this neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy and being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews Republicans kept saying presumed innocent ... uh and\nJob interviews Republicans kept saying presumed innocent ... ah until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved from people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth [noise]\nUm it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it's it's way worse than what ...\nMaking the colonel thanks so much think you can do to\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from thousands of pages of financial documents the president called the article quote a hit piece with us now to talk about some of the allegations is Tim O'Brien he's author of Trump nation\nThe art of being the Donald and of course he's executive editor Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat's easily the head of this one I don't think that's a news though\nI think the nuts and bolts that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent to protect the family\nOthers which were dubious impossibly fraudulent to protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so and in wealth\nTo keep it in the family\nTo keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump tasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid\nInheritance and gift taxes or in other words the trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred and instead they they paid around fifty million or so\n... when when Donald Trump ... over the years I built with I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people and uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that if ... hadn't co signed a loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that\nThe times really flashed that out with a lot of new numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really late ... and that story so that's another\nImportant theme of the story which is the president is at on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\nIs there any\nIt's hundreds of millions of dollars\nIs there anything that you did you can recognize and that maybe people are going over the story now can recognize this distinctly illegal\nYeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when ... and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they used and appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests that that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called an odd little company was essentially a shell company called all county that the Trump family used to inflate how much they were spending on equipment and supplies for their\nArmada of buildings so they could then pocket the differential themselves rather than pay income tax on it all of that stuff is possibly highly fraudulent the trick is the statute of limitations has passed on much of it\nSo at most they may may end up with civil penalties on this but I I suspect that's not what bothers the president the most about what I think really will get under his skin about this is that it it knocks down this idea that he pulled himself up by his own bootstraps and he he earned his living on his own\nRather than being someone who was born on third base and said he hit a triple which is essentially the story he's been putting out there for a long time\nTickets at Ari teeth theater dot org [noise]\n\nTrials later with these

being made that senator mantra news just reflected in the Democratic we'll express for other people of West Virginia\nI I Do think that he is the poll showed that mostly most people supported cabinet here however um I think he did it entirely politically because he's up for re election in thirty days and he he is under fifty percent of the polls right now so I think I think he did it to play the Republican base\nYeah we'll but when you choose a politician to being a politician is though that's not much of a surprise visit I mean he's running for reelection\nYeah of course and I did do that to him yesterday or on Thursday\nWe want to tell us about those meetings because you were you you met with him I guess for two hours on Thursday right\nYeah we did so we had a group of women who sat in his office on Monday and they were actually arrested a\nHit about nine women arrested they sat there for like ten hours listening to him they had a conference call with him on Monday\nThat didn't really go well so on Thursday we had a group of about fifty go up to D.C and we met with him on a two separate occasions the first one we had probably about twenty twenty women there and twenty women

but Brett Kavanaugh looks to be headed to the U.S Supreme Court\nJudging from official announcements and from a procedural vote yesterday Senate Republicans have secured the votes they need to confirm it at is expected just a mentor conservative majority on the court\nNPR's Ron Elving joined just run thanks so much for being with us good morning Scott now we could both named conservative justices Souter Stevens black men Kennedy who he issued who joined a liberal and progressive is on the court\nBut uh this confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh could have impact generations could\nOh yes we assumed the current lineup of five justices who were appointed by three Republican presidents to named Bush out to by Donald Trump will be around for some time\nAnd this will be the first time that the court has five members were alumni of the federalist society who it's been er which has been growing for some of the court for years and a swelling presence on the federal bench at its lower levels and with the Trump Administration and White House counsel Don McGahn or they have truly come into their own\n... what do we need to know about\nThe federalist society especially is they're going to be um more prominent than ever and us life\nOr the group got started at a couple of law schools in the early Nineteen eighties it was a pushback by students and Google's legal scholars are people who are convinced that the court had become too liberal to inclined to read the constitution to accommodate the outlook and philosophy of a few justices with big ideas about social\nSo the above few justices with big ideas about social and political justice members of the society have indicated a desire to revisit some of the landmark decisions of the past two generations\nAsking the question of whether or not the basis for those decisions was in the constitution or whether it was being supplied by somebody's interpretation of the constitution and let let's underscored there's nothing remotely secretive about this right\nAnd not a secret society at all and they've been quite public about their campaign and about their influence within the Republican Party\nAnd about their desire to revisit things like the privacy concept in roe versus Wade that legalized abortion or even the one person one vote concept that required state legislative districts to have equal population um if Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation\nIs the the the combination of of decades of organizing um are Republicans energized get out to the polls about a month from now or do many feel mission accomplished\nThere could be both a feeling of accomplishment ended up feeling of opportunity to press further and some resentment over the ... confirmation process and some of the accusations that were raised in the way they were raised against Brett Kavanaugh\nBut Mitt terms are more often driven by anger than satisfaction and right now polls show a lot of women and younger voters are unhappy with Kavanaugh and even many Republican women are unhappy with their party and that could also be a big factor in the midterms\nI'm now it's interesting to me you point to anger and that certainly reflected in in the surveys

Blasey Ford in high school Megan McConnell columnist for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views [laughter] which we will ... enjoy just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you were at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations of sexual assault by Christian policy forward now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter]\nUm what was that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes\nDon't think so I think well I mean yes and no right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes\nOr perhaps not as often as we'd like um I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with the as it than to possible\nThat they should confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote\nYou know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise] um and\nIt needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise] um and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the city did the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal some people say it wasn't a I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true and then it had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative\nBy not providing she had basically two pieces of the crowd and I wasn't aware of that as well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she told and sort of two thousand Seventeen two dozen Eighteen but should\nPeople there basically to his cooperation were her therapists notes which would seem to say look she talked about this other not we have another name and two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee\n'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear but the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contact with the committee for her and provided letters but all they said was she\n[noise] who contacted the committee for her and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen foot\n... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's ... Christian bushy Ford a sincere\nA book that she couldn't let a church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support right a judge\nNow the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and there's an inherently difficult crime because you know some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated to consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible um and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in the U.S [laughter] neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy in being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews for Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you don't inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible\nGone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved\nFrom people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth [noise] um it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it it's way worse than what ...\nMaking the cardinals thanks so much think you can do to\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from thousands of pages of financial documents the president called the article quote a hit piece with us now to talk about some of the allegations is Tim O'Brien he's author of Trump nation\nThe art of being the Donald and of course is executive editor Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat's easily the head of this one I don't think that's a news though I think the nuts and bolts that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump\nUsed a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent\nTo protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so in in wealth\nTo keep it in the family\nKeep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump\nTasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid inheritance and gift taxes or in other words the trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars\n... should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred and instead they they paid around fifty million or so\nWhen when Donald Trump ... over the years I built with I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people and uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that\nThe times really flashed that out with a lot of new numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really pretty barren that story so that's another\nImportant theme of the story which is the president is that on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n... is there anything that you did you can recognize that maybe people going over the story now can recognize this distinctly illegal\nYeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when ... and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they used an appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate and everything\nThe building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests that that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called an odd little company was essentially a shell company called all county that the Trump family used to inflate how much they were spending on equipment and supplies for their\nArmada of buildings so they could then pocket the differential themselves rather than pay income tax on it all of that stuff is possibly highly fraudulent the trick is the statute of limitations has passed on much of it\nSo it most they may may end up with civil penalties on this but I I suspect that's not what bothers the president the most about what I think really will get under his skin about this is that it it knocks down this idea that he pull themselves up by his own bootstraps\nAnd he he earned his living on his own rather than being someone who was born on third base and said he hit a triple which is essentially the story he's been putting out there for a long time\nShowing and creating works of art gets

Nina\nHi Lulu this has been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non partisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues\nWell I think they'll all suck it up he'll suck it up they'll suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court [noise]\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do with the Constitution's says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but justice is Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were Princeton on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial of being neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment than we left that\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that\nEyes are on the Supreme Court well\nI guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term sometimes you can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether\nThe employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex\nCovers gay and lesbian employees just as Kevin out of places Justice Anthony Kennedy who had been the courts swing vote when Kennedy announced his retirement and June you called at the end of the world as we know it uh so what does the court's new worlds look like\nI'm closely contested cases you will see a\nCourt that is more conservative than we've seen in this country probably four Seventy years or so\nAnd that has consequences way beyond abortion and gay rights and even gun rights it has consequences for employment rights for the environment for the ability of the federal government to regulate\nFor the way the power is allocated in the federal government whether the president has more and more power or not\nNPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg thank you need us so much

know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that\nThe my race was a relevant the word that the judge used was assimilate treat you as was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you were you're of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought in trans racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAre so to then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody\nElse how's that different what what are the challenges that you face because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied at you with your parents\nFirst of all I wouldn't have occurred to me to say this is racism even um despite those things that were happening were definitely racism like there were slurs and they're\nLike there were slurs and there were pulled back eyes and there were like sing song chance\nAnd beyond that you know there was this additional layer of separation between my experience as a Korean American and my parents experience as white

let's begin this hour with Molly ball she's a political analyst and time magazine's national political correspondent he Molly Hi so the Republicans and the president are trying to portray the Democrat to sort of weapon I think the me too movement for political gain\nDemocrats as sort of weaponized the me too movement for political gain and on the left many see the Republican Party now as the party of sexual assault supporters uh with Roy Moore in Alabama President Trump on tape saying he has sexually assaulted women and now ... Supreme Court justice where does this leave\nThe country well like a week ago when a Senator Jeff flake made his extraordinary stand a stalling the nomination for a week in order to let the FBI investigate what he said was this is ripping our country apart\nAnd that is really how it has felt at ... the whole episode has been sort of an ice pick into our nations rise wounds if that's not to grow to be an analogy\nI thought you know I think people were already angry but the outpouring of anger that you saw over this nomination triggered by the nomination I think signifies just how unsettled a lot of these questions are and how emotional they are for so many people as you said on on on both sides uh uh\nUh left that was already I quite exercised particularly ... particularly women uh\nAnd uh on the on the right you know you had Republicans who might have been feeling discouraged at the relative inaction of the Congress or the Republicans were on the ballot this year their inability to give the president some of the things that he has wanted to accomplish\nAnd this is sort of a shot in the arm to them or as you said a big win for the president\nYet the midterm elections are less than a month away and President Trump has this a victory to brag about along with the lowest unemployment numbers and fifty years of for weeks we've been hearing a predictions of a blue wave but our polling shows that the gap is closing is the wind up the president's back now and the Republicans\nDo I think I have no idea\nThe president's back now and the Republicans do I think I have no idea frankly [laughter]\nIt's close to an election it's it's hard to tell what is signal and what his noise whether you're talking about polling are just sort of the national sentiment all the signs have been pointing in the direction of a very strong year for the Democrats you do have Republicans seeing this as a potential\nA last minute surge for them uh but it is still a month away and that is frankly still a lot of time for things to move around\nI ... and the trajectory is still rather remarkably as you said a those statistics are very good for the party in power usually a president with this kind of economic strength\nIs pulling quite high and yet the president is quite unpopular and that has rubbed off on the Republican Party and we have seen Republicans are really struggling to

Kavanaugh's reputation when CSI grams diatribe during the hearing on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations sum this up\nBest I Would never do to them what you've done to this guy this is the most an

Detrow NPR News the Capitol\nWe're joined now by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about what she expects to see from justice Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina Hi Lulu this has been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non\nAnd the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non partisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues\nWell I think they'll all suck it up hill suck it up bill suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court [noise]\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do with the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have\nTo figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but justice is Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were Princeton on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial and neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment than we left that\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for example future this term maybe\nFiled for the short term for example future this term maybe even next term\nSometimes you can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether the employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based\nOn sex covers gay and lesbian employees just as Kevin on a places Justice Anthony Kennedy who had been the courts swing vote when Kennedy announced his retirement in June you called at the end of the world as we know it uh so what does the court's new worlds look like\nI'm closely contested cases you will see a\nCourt that is more conservative than we've seen in this country probably four Seventy years or so\nAnd that has consequences way beyond abortion and gay rights and even gun rights it has consequences for employment rights for the environment for the

Totenberg thinking you know so very much thank you my\nName's Nicole Chung was born into a Korean immigrant family and then adopted by a white couple when she\nWas an infant her parents always described her adoption as a kind of divine Providence how it was attributed to God or to state you know as if it were meant to be made it harder for me to question um the mythology of our family and how it's\nAnd um the mythology of our family and how it came to be because the story was all I\nKnew and it was so important to all of us as an adult ... did start to ask questions in a new memoir all you can ever know she writes about her search for her birth family and her Korean identity growing up in a mostly white town Oregon she says her parents didn't really talk about race\nI think it was something that my family\nDidn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that\nThe my race was relevant the word that the judge used was assimilate treat you as was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you were you were of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought in trans racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAre so to then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody\nElse how's that different what what are the challenges that you face because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied at you with your parents first of all\nWouldn't have occurred to me to say this is racism even um despite those things that were happening were definitely racism like there were slurs and there were pulled back eyes and there were like sing song chance\nAnd beyond that you know there was this additional layer of separation between my experience as a Korean American and my parents' experience as white Americans I really remember feeling as though\nAs white Americans I really remember feeling as though I Can't tell them like it will hurt them I have to protect them from this knowledge and if I tell them they might not understand anyway because they're white\n\n\nOn trial Snyder with these headlines\nPresident Trump is calling Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court a tremendous victory and at last

seen any evidence to back up his claim that the show is dead just the persistent question if he's still alive where Izzie\n... what is the Saudis and saying well\nThe Saudis are basically denying everything except the fact that they show you did come into the constantly Tuesday Afternoon\nOr the Saudi press agency quotes officials saying he left the consulate Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin

invited Reuters reporters in showed them around there was no sign of ... he said that constantly has multiple exits but why would show the lead by another exit if he knew his fiance was waiting out

consulate were somehow involved he also says he doesn't believe the Saudi claims that there is no camera footage of the show ... either inside or leaving the council\nAlright two questions in the

questions and a reporter asked him what message she had for the women out there who were devastated feeling devastated by this result and President Trump said that he didn't think there were any women like that women\nI think that's sort of [noise]\nFeel we're anywhere is wrong\nA lot of women that are shrewd way from Memphis that's\nAn echo of something that he said at a rally last\nWeek a in Mississippi a rally where he turned on Christine Blasey Ford and and really went after her and attacked her for her lapses in memory and Trump said on the plane yesterday that he believed that turn that rally really helped push Brett Kavanaugh over the finish line\nAnd that's something that's being echoed in talking points across the Republican spectrum tickets to the rally of this isn't your first Trump rally and we've heard so much about how important the Supreme Court is to rank and file Republicans was that have had in the crowd with these values notably happier and more satisfied than Trump's crowds pre Kevin\nWell they definitely seemed to be in a good mood but here's something that I found really fascinating when President Trump talked about Kavanaugh they cheered when President Trump talked about how terrible the Democrats are they went ... miles uh here is just\nAre they went wild here is just an example of one of the many things that President Trump said\nHand Rogers

S. where NPR's Jackie Northam reports Washington is pushing back\nThe U.S is unquestionably the leader in advanced technology think artificial intelligence robotics sophisticated weaponry it's what's helped give the country a national security edge\nThat something China has recognized and one's in on says James Lewis a specialist in China and technology at the center for Strategic and International Studies\nThe Chinese figured out the technology is key to ... an hour and the source of technology is still the west for China so how do they get their hands on that western technology\nThree years ago Beijing unveiled it's made in China twenty twenty five strategy which calls for the country to become a world leader in advanced technologies including artificial intelligence AI\nAs part of that China is forming global partnerships pumping massive resources into tech firms at home in Europe and here in the U.S\nSay they're very systematic very long term in their approach and it's very well funded\nMichael Brown is with the Pentagon's defense innovation unit in Silicon valley he says there's serious concern in Washington that China is acquiring\nSince they're serious concern in Washington that China is acquiring too much sensitive us technology and transferring it back home\nThey don't play by the same rules that we do so a cyber theft is on the table industrial espionage was on the table which can include recruiting key talent a networking events that are sponsored by the Chinese government working with us universities\nJust last week Bloomberg reported to us was investigating whether China allegedly infiltrated the Pentagon and major companies such as apple and Amazon by building spy chips into server mother boards and mother boards were manufactured in China that companies denied the allegations\nBut there are other ways China is making inroads to capture American innovation [noise]\nThere's a quiet leafy part is Silicon Valley called Sunnyvale and a lot of the tech giants have a presence here there's Amazon labs linked in Yahoo and coming up now to a Google complex and I can actually see some of the workers city a picnic tables and enjoying the fine weather\nJust behind the Google complex is a Chinese company called ... and it's ... arrival\nBy do is China's largest Internet search provider it open this innovation center here in Silicon valley with a focus on self driving vehicles and other Chinese tech powerhouses Alibaba ten cent\nAway also have their own research and development centers here instead of buying an existing us business the Chinese tech giants come in and build a new company from the ground up these moves are called\nAnd build a new company from the ground up these moves are called Greenfield investments and they hire away a lot of us workers says the C.

Thirteen hundred rounds of funding for us start ups with at least one Chinese investor over the past eight years\nIs very common for Chinese firms to have some sort of ties to the government it might just be because they have to answer to the government of party leaders back at home and the first the state some level of control\nLike shingles says this has become a concern and national security

that\nVenture capital and other minority investments provide Chinese investors access potentially sensitive technologies particularly ones that are in a sense an early stage where us governments

investor has ever ask I mind for confidential technical information\nRight now we have to see what it's me and my co founder of Americans\nDecades funding for firms like Nicholson's was through the

with us but have a great capability that we would all benefit from\nThis alternate funding is one way Washington is trying to counter Chinese investment\nThe Trump Administration has also been aggressive in blocking several large mergers and acquisitions of us tech companies by Chinese firms\nAnd Congress is beefing up laws on the books aimed at protecting us technology from foreign governments it will allow closer scrutiny of all sorts of Chinese inroads in the tech sector says Mario ... a trained lawyer was Kirkland analysis\nI think some deals where there are Chinese investors

Supreme Court justice where does this leave the country\nWell a week ago when a Senator Jeff flake made his extraordinary stand a stalling the nomination for a week in order to let the FBI investigate what he said was this is ripping our country apart\nAnd that is really how it has felt that ... the whole episode has been sort of an ice pick into our nations rise wounds if that's not to grow to be an analogy\nI you thought you know I think people were already angry but the outpouring of anger that you saw over this nomination triggered by the nomination I think signifies just how unsettled\nA

on the on the right you know you had Republicans who might have been feeling discouraged at the rally\nMight have been feeling discouraged at the relative inaction of the Congress or the Republicans were on the ballot this year their inability to give the president some of the things that he has wanted to accomplish and this is sort of a shot in the arm to them or as you said a big win for the president\nYet the midterm elections are less than a month's away and President Trump has this a victory to brag about along with the lowest unemployment numbers and fifty years of for weeks we've been hearing a predictions of a blue wave but our polling shows that the gap is closing is the wind up the president's back now and the Republicans do\nI think I have no idea frankly [laughter] this close to an election\nIt's it's hard to tell what it is signal and what his noise whether you're talking about polling are just sort of the national sentiment all the signs have been pointing in the direction of a very strong year for the Democrats you do have Republicans seeing this as a potential\nA last minute surge for them uh but it is still a month away and that is frankly still a lot of time for things to move around\nI ... and the trajectory is still rather remarkably as you said a those statistics are very good for the party in power usually a president with this kind of economic strength\nIs pulling quite high and yet the president is quite unpopular and that has rubbed off on the Republican Party and we have seen Republicans are really struggling to regain the upper hand and

Fischer did\nI appreciate professor Ford sincere testimony I Believe she has experienced a traumatic event that no woman should have to endure there is no evidence though that judge Kavanaugh was the perpetrator\nThe Senate checked awful lot of other legislative business as a confirmation fight play out an even pass some sweeping bipartisan governing bells\nBut while they differ on the root cause what became a toxic confirmation fight lawmakers from both parties are worried about its lasting damage Republican Lisa Murkowski spoke to that issue explained why she was the lone Republican opposing cabinet\nAs a legislative branch [noise] we have an obligation to moral obligation to do better than it\nRight now both parties are ceding with anger just before the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh Schumer

about the confirmation when they're casting ballots Scott Detrow NPR News the Capitol\nAnd we're joined now by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about what she expects to see from justice Kevin ... and the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina\nHi Lulu this has been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a nonpartisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues\nWell I think they'll all suck it up hill suck it up they'll suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do with the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have\nTo figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but just this is Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were Princeton on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nAn incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial and neutral and of not being\nAnd uh being fair and impartial and neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment\nThan we left that um this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for example future this term maybe even next term sometimes you can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether\nThe employment section of the federal civil rights laws

white couple when she was an infant her parents always described her adoption as a kind of divine Providence\nHow it was attributed to God or to say you know if it were meant to be made it harder for me to question um the mythology of our family and how it came to be because the story was all I knew and it was so important to all of us\nAs an adult ... did start to ask questions\nA new memoir all you can ever know she writes about her search for her birth family and her Korean identity growing up in a mostly white town Oregon she says her parents didn't really talk about race\nThink it was something that my family didn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that\nThe my race was a relevant the word that the judge used was assimilate to choose was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you are you're of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought and trans racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAre so to then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody else\nDidn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody else how's that different what what are the challenges you face because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied out you with your parents\nFirst of all I wouldn't have occurred to me to say this is racism even um despite those things that were happening were definitely racism like there were slurs and there were pulled back eyes and there were like sing song chance\nAnd beyond that you know there was this additional layer of separation between my experience as a

in Pittsburgh the suspicious packages sent to critics of President Trump so let's take a breath for a moment and take stock are we getting it\nFor a moment and take stock are we getting it\nGetting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us how are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to us all\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric thing also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed\nOr we'll Schachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and ... is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her\nShe says she sees a direct line between a politician's words and bombs in the mail\nWe want to look back actually to the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nWere in that campaign we saw the rhetoric being used to attack certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the elections\nNow we came back from the precipice turning the presidential campaign but now here we're at that\nPrecipice again and it's a similar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo peas position on health care\n[noise] definitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords it was a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election\nThe nation attack after the very tough twenty ten election where the hot issue is the Affordable CARE Act so we've now seen three instances in which elected officials are targeted physically after a period of ... political rhetoric\nThere is a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back even to the founders uh we've had moments of turmoil and thinking of you know white supremacists in the Nineteen sixties the weather underground in the seventies [noise] what sets this moment apart in your view\n[noise] the phenomena we're seeing post twenty sixteen hasn't been seen in modern political history\nWhich is once the election was over\nPeople ordinary people Americans who voted for Trump continued to demonize and hate Hillary voters and vice versa and that's still going on today two years later the national Institute has actually had calls from major U.S corporations we're product innovation teams\nThat have not come back to the same level of productivity since the ... this is a very different phenomena it's like a virus in our society that is different and new [noise]\nI mean I Want to turn to you now I'm the Kevin of Central Americans many of them seeking asylum ... has been in the news is you know\nUm you have actually researched how language informs social discussions and perceptions are in the context of immigration so you are looking at how the way we discuss certain groups the way this political language gets processed\nWe discuss certain groups the way this political language gets processed by people actually has a real effect on how we as individuals view an entire group of people\nAbsolutely yeah so in in one reason study with Renee floors who the sociologist at the University of Chicago we found that white Americans\nOverwhelmingly associate undocumented immigrants with criminality and of course this is actually unfounded all the research points to the exact opposite but when the president of the United states is constantly tweeting about the many criminals and terrorists and rape is coming from Mexico and Central America it's\nNot hard to guess what is driving the stereotype\nI think one of the most interesting things that your study shows is the people who are anti Trump in general also absorb this language and associated undocumented immigrants with criminality\nYeah we were really surprised by that finding um and we actually we ... we hypothesized we would find something different that you know we have we are living in these um echo chambers where we're consuming very different news and media and we thought that that would be reflected in the types of ideas and stereotypes that that a liberal versus conservatives held and yet\nA

heroin was a big city problem but no longer in the recent NPR poll about half of rural Americans said the opioid problem in their communities has worsened in the last five years\nNow ... agrees a few years ago he was elected sheriff of ... county he toward the jails and saw that is\nVery very sick very very sick people because detox and from heroin is like having the worst possible stomach virus you can have people burned out there you know they're just they're just suffering\nThe county jail had become a de facto detox center at any given time around half the inmates were withdrawing from heroin it was a dangerous and expensive situation\nIt took becoming the sheriff to see the impacts inside the jail with heroin abuse to see the impacts in the community across the entire county for me to realize that we had we had to change a lot about what we're doing\nSo they did last year ... county where I stand what is located declared the opioid epidemic a life threatening emergency now they're responding to the opioid epidemic as if it were a natural disaster the same way they'd mobilized to respond to a landslide or flu pandemic\nSnow how much county is the first county in the

goals are really long term I mean they're going to take years decades ... is also the spokesperson for this group\nShe says the key is to be realistic\nSo she set an objective for yourself to just end

special coverage from NPR News I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro we're watching a press conference is about to start in Pittsburgh this morning\nEleven people are dead at the tree of life synagogue in that city six people were injured suspected gunman Robert Ballard is in custody the department of justice is investigating it\nAs a hate crime will be joining the press conference live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon is here to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning Hi Lulu\nOh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims\nWell what we know is that eleven people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told none of them were children um and also that's six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as the day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals memorial services I Will be hearing more about those in the days to come as well\nYeah this alleged shooter has been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime\nIt is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue or the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media and he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the death of those eleven people and\nFacing twenty nine federal charges and the death of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the mode of how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened well authorities\nSay the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was a it as a religious service was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\n[noise] put this into context for us so there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern\nRight I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um well it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil in eleven people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all\nThis mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in decades\nYeah and we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this ... and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning right um I went to the scene this morning it was\nRight um I went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue to the police tape um\nAs far as I could could go and and you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun laying flowers memorials\nI'm just at the edge of the there's sort of a ... a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner and and this is you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and\nUh people are grappling as they as they do and and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were vigils last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding\nWhat are they mention there will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a this of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opened its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like this happen so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um\nAnd and so uh that's just one small thing that can be\nAnd you and so that's just one small thing the communities doing to try to help Stanley's a Jewish and otherwise throughout this community in Pittsburgh a pope with what's happened here\nThis tragedy that's happened again and again around this country um has happened here and and the people are trying to make sense of it yeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n\n\nA incredibly moving and somber um what has been the response from elected officials so far\nWell it depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American Life\nUm something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside the Santa God the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage with the shooter and several of them were shot in the process\nAnd the president also suggested that perhaps bringing back the death penalty would help deter such attacks\nWorth noting that the death penalty is still on the books and in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a couple of decades since it was carried out I'm at the same time you know there are several other states where there'd been mass shootings in recent years thinking\nSame time you know there are several other states where there'd been mass shootings in recent years think of Texas that actively carry out that's at sentences but unless the president is is calling for that to be more of the conversation\nAnd obviously President Trump has a personal relationship with the Jewish faith or his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime\nRate and and he you know he and the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a ... and said that this is he said essentially that this was a you know sick thing to do 'em so he's he's certainly called it out I'm\nA ... of course that you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that when you walk\nAround Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it or what are they saying about um why this might have happened well\nI I think in these situations and and I I've not been on the ground here in Pittsburgh too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now I'm three this is my third and just the past year or so\nUm people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there's a there's a search for why after the Las Vegas shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motive for a crime so they can prosecute investigate and so that they can\nTo the motive for a crime so they can prosecute and investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce that there is also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community\nAnd in this case there are as we've said indications that suggest that um the shooter had anti Semitic an anti immigrant uh motives\nThat tells us something about why this might have happened again that's still under investigation but uh it is being

in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation\nWell are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested a so that's ah the perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources\nMake all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge on CNN has reported citing a source\nThat a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet that any other help are we getting a picture of how he became this extreme [noise]\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen he had a very troubled life lots of arrests\nBut he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a\nSoccer and body building and nightlife\nAnd then two years ago all this anger or in a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he is we know lived in a van he hung out sort of on the southern edge of a Fort Lauderdale in Parkland community that had that horrific school shooting this year\nAnd it's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the northwest edge of a\nUh Fort Lauderdale and say I began making all

rappers\nBut she said that he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nWould start talking about Sandler he loves Hitler Hitler and we should go back to that site with Hitler\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre we thank you so much thank you living\nIn these last few weeks before the midterm elections we've been having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity politics\nAnd when we talk about identity and politics weed and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by ... Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program\nThank you for having me so\nWe often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voter though the teen of voters are any racial minority they're presented as a model with black voters think this election\n... they're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters but when we talk about white voters we rarely mentioned their race at all unless it's a story about race\nWe talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so\nI have to eat it frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of\nThat statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does not accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people [noise]\nI I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this leading up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election what we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because\nWe did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because\nBy ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue where that issue and in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack and so by and instead\nFocusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why but our invoking it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so there is also I think speaks to\nThe very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you were a person of color we got legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago\nBut why voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and when everyone knows\nWhen we were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously is the most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also the sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media\nThere's also this sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair so how did those two things than fit when you're trying to discuss some of these racial divisions in this country\n[noise] one I Would clearly argue we're all biased I think the way that we covered the election showed that biased to be very glaring clear because we were ignoring miserably with voters on the ground were saying right ... voters on the ground where say\nNo I haven't lost my job or I don't know anyone who's also a job to Hispanic but I Want them to build that wall anyway because they're coming here and they're changing our country like they were saying exactly how they felt and we're like no no they don't know what they're talking about ... ...\nWe're broadcasting from the University of Nevada Reno this was eighty eight point seven or Ninety One point seven tell you when our Reno Ninety One point five K.

Trump so let's take a breath for a moment and take stock\nAre we getting it getting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us how are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to us all\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric thing also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed\nSchachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and Carolyn Lucas Meyer is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her\nShe says she sees a direct line between a politician's words and bombs in the mail\nWe want to look back actually to the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nWere in that campaign we saw the rhetoric being used to attack certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the election\nNow we came back from that precipice during the presidential campaign\nBut now here we're at that precipice again\nAnd it's similar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting republic\nAttack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo peas position on health care [noise]\nDefinitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords it was a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election where the hot issue is the Affordable CARE Act\nSo we've now seen three instances in which elected officials are targeted physically after a period of ... political rhetoric\n[noise] there is a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back even to the founders uh we've had moments of turmoil I'm thinking of you know white supremacist in the Nineteen sixties the weather underground in the seventies [noise]\nWhat sets this moment apart in your view [noise]\nThe phenomena are we seeing post twenty sixteen hasn't been seen in modern political history\nWhich is once the election was over\nPeople ordinary people Americans who voted for Trump continued to demonize and hate Hillary voters and vice versa and that's still going on today two years later the national Institute has actually had calls from major U.S corporations we have product innovation teams\nThat have not come back to the same level of productivity since the ... this is

mail this is a fraud political moment and here to help us make sense of it as NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson good morning thanks for having me [noise]\nSo obviously I'm a terrible news out of Pittsburgh we got the names of those who I'm actually were killed by this in this attack\nI'm actually were killed by this in this attack\nYeah let's just make a few things clear this was the worst anti Semitic attacking us history it occurred just days after the largest\nAssassination attempt on political leaders in this case all Democrats and targets of the president's in us history and we're not going to have the big debate about whether extreme rhetoric including some of the president's rhetoric\nHelped insight this but the president has made a lot of unifying statements he said these acts were evil he has also\nGone on to campaign and hold rallies kind of partisan politics as usual although he said that he's going to try to tone it down a little bit and he did but just before a rally in Illinois over the weekend he had this to say about his tone\nI Would like to be able to have its own that I have because I feel very strongly about it\nAnd I'd have a much different tone frankly if the press was\nEven handed Russia was fair I'd have a much different tone all the time\nSo in other words the press is still at fault but as I said we're going to have a big debate about whether some of the president's words helped create the climate for these kinds of attacks he's not responsible for the acts of crazy people\nBut there's what the president says and then there's what people here you know the shooter in Pittsburgh\nA posted on social media that Jews were funding the caravan Donald Trump has tweeted without evidence that George Soros was funding the caravan he talks about global is a lot and in the right wing media like bright\nGlobal is a lot and in the right wing media like Breitbart the Daily Caller global list is a synonym for Jew\n... this is a president who has not really embrace the role of United and chief\nNo he doesn't believe in that other presidents have seen their role as sort of the moral leader of the nation but he doesn't believe in that I don't think he'll change he's over Seventy years old and this kind of extreme rhetoric has worked for him he believes it energizes his base\nHis closing argument in this election is based on race and fear of crime fear of immigration and it's kind of a social media business model you know the algorithms that YouTube and and other social media organizations know that more extreme content keeps viewers\nOn longer and this is what the president feels works for his base and that he might tone it down a little bit but I don't think he's going to give it up\nAs you know mid term elections are just over a week away well the events of this past week affect the elections and if so how\nI think for the most part the fundamentals of this election are set they've been very stable with the landscape for Senate races leaning towards Republicans in the house the trend seems to be leading towards Democrats I think the biggest way this might affect\nThe elections is that it crowds out talk about politics the president has complained about this he said Republicans were honor roll we had momentum now all the media wants to talk about are these in quotes bombs\nSo that might be the biggest effect\nNPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson ... thank you so much thank you\nThis morning we've been talking about the shooting at the tree of life cynical but this past week\nAbout the shooting at the tree of life cynical but this past week also saw\nFourteen package bombs sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and that has been arrested in that case she's or say Iraq is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on this story we turn to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida at the morning\nIt's MORNING with the [noise] All right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWhere we expect say opt to go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces\nAnd then we expect a that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will ah it seems will be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation\nWell are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested\nA so that's a the perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources make all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge on CNN has reported citing a source\nThat a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet that any other help are we getting a picture of how he became this extreme\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen you had a very troubled life lots of arrests\nBut he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and bodybuilding night life and then two years ago all this anger a in a political anger starts coming out in in ...\nGr a in a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he is we know lived in a van hung out sort of on the southern edge of a Fort Lauderdale in Parkland community that had that horrific school shooting this year\nIt's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale\nAnd say I begin making all these attacks\nAgainst David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog on Twitter saying he was a fraud you didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros\nUh the financier who's been in the news so much lately and in Soros in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail\nI understand you've spoken with coworkers including one who was in that town [noise] [noise] yeah\n... was a manager at the new river pizza I Will say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said that he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nWhat satellites that left me last Hitler Hitler and we should go back to that site with Hitler\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre we thank you so much thank you lose the leading up to the midterms is election season we've been looking at what voters will find on their ballots the governor's races the different kinds of ballot measures well we just got today and one more Sunday before election day so it's time to look at\nWell we just got today and one more Sunday before election day so it's time to look at the two biggies house and Senate well do the Senate first and we'll do it with NPR lead political editor and medical to narrow good morning to medical good morning ...\nA third of the seats in the senator up as the constitution requires Democrats were facing some tough mass but then we started hearing about a blue wave how's that water looking\nWell look the blue wave is certainly real but it's more likely to be in the house then in the Senate and that's because in the Senate there are a lot more uh seats that are held by Democrats in red or states that are up you have the worst landscape since the direct election of senators\nIn Nineteen fourteen for either party that's because you have twenty six Democrats that are defending seats and just nine Republicans so will the Republicans pick up seats and\nIt's very possible in fact a you know some handicappers are looking at a potential a best case scenario for Democrats being net even right now it's fifty one forty nine in the Senate\nAnd a more likely scenario something like two to three seats lost from when I talk to Democrats at the beginning of the cycle and through this cycle they were hoping to sort of be able to hold serve so that they could have a better landscape and twenty Eighteen where they could go on all sides\nThe best target for Democrats is in Nevada with Dean Heller and Heller is actually started to do a lot better a lot of those Republican a defense is a lot of those those Senate seats or Arizona Tennessee Texas Nevada they all started to try and a little bit more Republican in recent weeks while Democrats like Heidi Heitkamp\nA are not looking so good Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Democrats are really really hoping that in Indiana Joe Donnelly can hold that John ...\nReally hoping that in Indiana Joe Donnelly can hold that Jon Tester in Montana can hold and that Joe Manchin of West Virginia can to I'm going to have to bring up Florida because that's where I'm from uh what are you seeing there it's such an

conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity politics\nAnd when we talk about identity and politics wheat and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by a nickel Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me [noise]\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters are Latino voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters\n... but when we talk about white voters we rarely mentioned their race at all unless it's a story about race we talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true yeah\nAnd and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so I've\nThey're all in some sense right white is the default so\nI have to eat it frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of\nThat statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also just a accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\n[noise] what are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people\n[noise] well I I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this leading up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because\nBy ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue or that issue and in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack and so by and instead\nFocusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nWay politicians may not explicitly say white but our invoking it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics Oh absolutely\nThe words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this also I think speaks to\nThe very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you were a person of color we got legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago\nBut white voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and when everyone knows when\nWe were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously that most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also this sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair\nSo how did those two things then sent when you're trying to discuss some of these racial um divisions in this country\n[noise] one I Would clearly argue we're all biased\nI think the way that we covered the election showed that biased to be very glaring clear\nBecause we were ignoring literally where voters on the ground were saying right ... voters on the ground where say no I haven't lost my job or I don't know anyone who's also a job to Hispanic but I Want them to build that wall anyway because they're coming here and they're changing our country like they were saying exactly how they felt\nAnd we were like no no they don't know what they're talking about ... ... it's it's\nEconomic anxiety so that's biased but also when we talk about fairness is it fair is it accurate to say you're talking about suburban voters if in fact you were only talking about\nSay you're talking about suburban voters if in fact you were only talking about a segment of those voters were white to me that is not fair it's not fair to all of the people in a country that at this point is about forty percent non white who we are rendering invisible and our coverage\nNicole Anna Jones of the New York times magazine thank you so much thank you very much for

have steadily declined since deporting the country more than two weeks ago\nSome of dropped out some state in Mexico and others have been deported she reports many have landed back in the place where

Kahn NPR News San Pedro Sula Honduras\nWell now going to take a look at this moment when things are feeling frankly scary the shooting in Pittsburgh the suspicious packages sent to critics of President Trump so let's take a breath for a moment and take stock are we getting it\nGetting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us how are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to us all\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric and also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed\nOr we only Schachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and ... is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her\nShe says she sees a direct line between a politician's words and bombs in the mail\nWe want to look back actually to the twenty sixteen presidential campaign that\nWere in that campaign we saw the rhetoric being used to attack certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the election\nNow we came back from the precipice during the presidential campaign\nBut now here we're at the precipice again\nAnd it's similar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo peas position on healthcare\nAbout the geo peas position on health care [noise]\nDefinitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords it was a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election where the hot issue is the Affordable CARE Act\nSo we've now seen three instances in which elected officials are targeted physically after a period of ... political rhetoric [noise]\nThere is a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back even to the founders oh we've had moments of turmoil I'm thinking of you know white supremacist in the Nineteen sixties the weather underground in the seventies [noise]\nWhat sets this moment apart in your view [noise]\nThe phenomena we're seeing post twenty sixteen hasn't been seen in modern political history\nWhich is once the election was over\nPeople ordinary people Americans who voted for Trump continued to demonize and hate Hillary voters and vice versa and that's still going on today two years later the national Institute has actually had calls for major U.S corporations we have product innovation teams\nThat have not come back to the same level of productivity since the ... this is a very different phenomena it's like a virus in our society that is different and new [noise]\nMean I Want to turn to you now I'm the Kevin of Central Americans many of them seeking asylum ... has been in the news is you know um you live actually\n... has been in the news is you know I'm you've actually researched how language informs social discussions and perceptions are in the context of immigration a so you are looking at how\nThe way we discuss certain groups the way this political language gets processed by people actually has a real effect\nOn how we as individuals view an entire group of people absolutely yeah so in\nIn one recent study with Renee floors he's a sociologist at the University of Chicago we found that\nWhite Americans overwhelmingly associate undocumented immigrants with criminality and of course this is actually unfounded all the research points to the exact opposite but when the president of the United states is constantly tweeting about the many criminals and terrorists and rape is coming from Mexico and Central America\nIt's not hard to guess what is driving the stereotype\nI think one of the most interesting things that your study shows is the people who are anti Trump in general also absorb this language and associated undocumented immigrants with criminality\nYeah we were really surprised by that finding um and we actually we ... we hypothesized we would find something different that you know we have we are living in these um echo chambers wherever consuming very different news and media and we thought that that would be reflected in the types of ideas and stereotypes that that a liberal versus conservative held and yet\n\nI'm Louis ... only what these headlines the suspect in a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue forty six year old Robert Bowers faces twenty nine

senior advisors none of them ... ... for a policy that's gone terribly wrong the Saudis now admit that there's a standing order to bring dissidents back to the kingdom by force if necessary\nBut the

thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ... tale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi or explanation by the president of how much of this damage limiting exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both\nHow much of this damage limiting exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both\nWashington and ... we're trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response to it let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council\nSecond lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well or to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a better sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis the end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to ... the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid unborn society\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries to a\nPoint of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept the Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections are and then then\nJust killed and in Turkey that Mr Putin's denial of it a lecture and interference in our own elections are and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president of the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests\nAnd we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the in the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral\nValue of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just to expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work together to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments of that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can\nFind ways to put pressure on the Saudis that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we've ... top two weeks is unacceptable even colder thank you thank you\nSo during for profit is it new you probably remember hatred mercenaries from grade school lessons on America's Revolutionary War\nBut American mercenaries working for foreign powers that something that ... been looking into his investigative reporter for buzzfeed news and joins us in our studios thanks so much for being with us like you wire us retired special forces which is what you're talking about during restoration such demand\nFor the last Seventeen years seals special forces and other parts of the U.S government have X\nThis is an other parts of the U.S government have excelled at this modern style of warfare at uh the sort of counterterrorism specialty they kick indoors they go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented yeah\nYou're right in the article that said the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects show of the changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people and uh we don't often like to use the word assassination button that is what it is mhm but\nYour investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries\nI see no there's not many other names for them the N. word it definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed or by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in Aden in twenty Fifteen\nThese special forces and and see veterans Navy SEAL veterans' day deployed on a mission to kill the leader of the eight and branch of al Islam\nAnd all this law is that right is a very important political party in Yemen as soon as long as the party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group nonetheless the UAE e as we writes hired this company to kill this local political leader does he\nAnd Saudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebel\nSaudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us support now you you should just in the story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was reservists and he was a seal reservists he he was at that level of of command of one of the the nation's best most highly trained and he was still you know technically he had his top secret clearance sources told us even when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know\nI guess I Am among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal that you are citizens couldn't do that there are laws that govern whether the U.S whether you as\nIndividuals can service officers can enlist in foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nOr you've seen how Americans have served in the French ah well I've I've mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces\nAnd these are not ... a lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during World War II sure right yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries\nBut I I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you can join a foreign military just for the money now and and by the way this doesn't apply to people who join ISIS or the Taliban or somebody with fights against the u._s. or or a U.S ally that really is against the law that is against the law ... this is a buzzfeed\nStory not an NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it um is this an anecdote or a trend\nIs this an anomaly it's the real key I Believe this is a potentially a trend or they're the only ones who've done this or the other countries who try it's um are there other Americans other than the ones and\nIt's um are there other Americans other than the ones and other Americans who believe you've uncovered yet right is this happening in in theaters around the world I'm gonna keep on looking at it and\nI've had the honor of interviewing several X. special forces over the years who are working as Secret Service agents or running for office why would they want to continue to risk their lives and do this kind of work\nWell there's several reasons one is there's a lot of money involved but\nThey also argue they believe this is part of the war on terror but their argument is look the way he is close to the United states the UAE he's doing U.S policy the U.S has not spoken out against the war in Yemen we fuel airplanes we sell them bombs we sell them guns we train them we can do to train them\nTheir argument is they're doing what the you you know basically the U.S U.S foreign policy anyway\nSo they they suggest you which patriotism yes his era must an investigative

of addiction can be just about any face\nAn obituary that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touched many readers this week it included a photo of smiling face of metal Lynch in there with her toddler son Aden who was grinning from its perch on her back that photo shoot a good day for Maddie\nBut she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old introduction continental highschool party a drug took hold of her life\nShe was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\nMetal and Lynch in near died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kato Neal wrote that obituary in joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Burlington thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me\nFirst we're we're sorry thank you\nFirst we're [noise] we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be\nAn actress and star and Broadway musicals and she really had the voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew and loved and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate based painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using\nInjecting heroine she tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Matty\nThis past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um\nThe case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nDrove more than one program I gathered\nYeah she tried many [noise]\nWhat made you ... or\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lived and sit and not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted now um we carry the hope for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronouncing there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications that help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nI also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier to recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one phase of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about Matty with her son in her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nUnderstand there's going to be a service for ... some day there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWell through song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a a video of Matty singing Bonnie rate song she's just sitting at the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now and I think we'll have more of that kind of sharing on Sunday\nWhat bunny rich on man [noise] I Can't make you love me\nIndeed I don't know\nNeal wrote about her sister Maddy Lynch in there and the Vermont were seven days thank

fight with Fifteen men\nAny child in any school yard in the world could see through that story Scott but it wasn't concocted to be believed any more than the earlier versions of the story the Saudis have now abandoned\nIts intended simply to be told and accepted as a pretext for continuing business as usual and that's less about oil these days and it's about billions of dollars in arms sales President Trump made that clear this week while\nHe was seated with executives from a number of us arms makers who are selling those weapons to Saudi Arabia the president has made it clear this journalist was not a U.S citizen and that this is not the president's focus right now what is focused\nBut president made that clear this week by spelling out his agenda like a shopping list\nIt made that clear this week by spelling out his agenda like a shopping list he said this election this fall is about Kavanaugh the caravan law and order and common sense\nAnd the president and other Republicans have been treating Brett Kavanaugh as a martyr even though he was in fact confirmed and is in fact on the Supreme Court now\nThe caravan is that group of several thousand refugees from Central America who have been stopped at the border of Guatemala and Mexico far from the United states but they wanted to be coming to the United states so the president is using them to symbolize the immigration he wants to stop\nAs for law and order that's the phrase is oldest states' rights and of course we all want the rule of law applied equally to all but the phrase has also been used\nAs code for resistance to social change and common sense is another familiar phrase a recently used as a political cultural by the Tea Party\nAs you mentioned round the care of and it's been a feature of

those are the polls have tightened in recent days having thing\nSome of the polls have tightened and for a variety of reasons among them that this is October and that's what the polls usually do in

doesn't\nSometimes that means a close election\nSometimes it doesn't but the more lightly attached voters in either party tend to come home in October and that's been especially true of Republicans in

enlist in resident of the Fletcher School says President Trump has been eager to showcase his Saudi ties\nTrump has no artifice about him so he's quite up front about this sort of transactional

Saudi Arabia Israel not only as an ally but as a customer\nWhat I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty million dollars worth of things and a hundred and ten million dollars

of them royals ... for a policy that's gone terribly wrong the Saudis now admit that there's a standing order to bring dissidents back to the kingdom by force if necessary\nBut the account lays the blame on the senior security officials who went beyond the order they killed this dissident journalist they covered up the murder why did the Saudi leadership failed to confirm his death earlier\nBad news travels slowly to the top is that one Saudi defender put it on Twitter these latest accounts distance the top leadership and especially the powerful crown prince but there are so many questions left to be answered\nOne of the biggest right in front of us whereas Mr ... indeed\nThe Saudi account says that his body was handed over to a local Turk for disposal Turkish authorities I have been

G died while visiting the Saudi conflict in Turkey on October second\nAfter weeks of denials they say some kind of fight broke out shortly after Mr ... who lived in Virginia and wrote columns for the Washington Post arrived at the embassy that day to complete paperwork for his marriage\nPresident Trump reacted yesterday and called it a very sad thing\nHe did not criticized the Saudis and be done gone Jay was with the president on the campaign swing out west and joins us now Don thanks for being with us my pleasure and let's begin with the president's first comments or after Saturday's the Saudis announced a it confirmed\nThe obvious that Mr show jihad died or in their custody he at the at the embassy and placed on both\nThe president was asked about it will turn an air force base\nWell I think it's a good first step it's a big said it's a lot of people a lot of people involved and I think it's a great first step\n[noise] um a lot of people in Trump's referring to the Eighteen arrested related to uh to the fight that the Saudis say resulted in ... what else did you say on the topic\nHe he took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called the showed used at the unacceptable but also right away scot he pivoted to the contracts the Saudis have with U.S companies like Boeing and General Dynamics and\nAnd as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment\nWhere the hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be ...\nWhere the hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response bought\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work which means six hundred thousand jobs\nAnd it's got just briefly the president uses those numbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to fact checks as is the number of jobs analysts say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that Jamal ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting a given given up quickly in the past\nHe has leveled very blunt criticism of other us allies are closer allies Canada Germany over trade and the like eh not so with the Saudis now all\nOf this comes up its president is campaigning for Republicans in a number of Senate races that are considered too close to call in Montana Arizona he'll be in Nevada later today what does the president talk about how does he present his argument at his rallies\nHe is really trying to get the ace his hardest core supporters to make sure they turn out so he's talking about still the battle the confirmed justice Brett Kavanaugh calls Democrats who protested cabinet Kavanaugh in unhinged angry mob and I can tell you the rally crowds love that language\nOr any talks about the that that caravan that large group of refugees mostly from Honduras at currently heading north toward the U.S border and lots of TV coverage of it and the president clearly sees it as a politic\nAnd lots of TV coverage of it and the president clearly sees it as a political gift just before the election this is from his rally in Arizona last night\nDemocratic victory in November would be a bright flashing invitation every trafficker smuggler drug dealer and the illegal alien on the planet come on and come on and ah\nSo that's the vibe at these rallies in in Trump's orbit even on a day when the news is about the confirmation of the death of your mouth ...\nAnd here's John ... thanks very much for being with us thank you got\nThe Trump Administration has had a muted response so far to the death of your mouth to show gee we turn now to even adult or he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now head of the Chicago Council on global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey as\nThe empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership that Trump bathroom thanks so much for being with us cloud to be here based on all of your experience does the Saudi explanation of how Mr ... died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damaged limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ... when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi or explanation by the president of how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both\nWashington and we were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual\nBut we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow should the U.S response to let let me Ventura pasta\nCitizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response to let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies at first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council\nSecond lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to ... the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is the is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid an foreign society's\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries um to\nA point of value and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president ah seems to be more inclined to accept the Saudi explanation of how a journalist is killed in in Turkey that Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections are and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president of the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we do with them it is not the\nEarlier that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we do with them it is not the only factor we have other interests and we want to maintain does interest but at the very least in the\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments a that would have real leverage over the Saudis\nThe president keeps them talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we've seen\nTop two weeks is unacceptable uber gold or thank you thank you\nInstead of depressed 'cause we've got a new ad campaign to encourage tourism or at least not disappoint those who do come to visit

the Vermont weekly seven days touched many readers this week\nIt included a photo of a smiling face of metal to Lynch in there with her toddler son Aden was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo shoot a good day for muddy but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old when production ... high school party a drug too cold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\nMetal and Lynch in mere died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her\nSister Kato Neal wrote that obituary and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Burlington thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me first we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing I she wanted to be\nAn actress and star and Broadway musicals and she really had the voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew in lived and then there was that a Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe had a long time to run it\nBut what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate based painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using\nInjecting heroine she tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Maddie\nThis past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we're all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um\nDisappeared again drove more than one program are gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of this in Europe which were\nKnow it never really occurred to me not to share ... addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lift and to to not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted now um we carry the hope for them and our hope also now lives with\nAnd our hope also now lives with policymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronouncing there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for a highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications that help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one phase of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about a Matty with her son and her ... in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\n[noise] understand there's going to be a service for ... there is yeah or were you and your family\nMatty on Sunday there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWhile through song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a a video of Matty singing Bonnie rate songs he's just sitting at the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction recovery and family members and not spend a huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now and I think we'll have more is that kind of sharing on Sunday\nWhat

but President Trump's priorities often reflect his interest as senior editor and correspondent NPR's Ron Elving can tell us Ron thanks so much for being with us\nGood to be with he's got let's begin to of course with the president's reaction to the Saudi explanation as it stands now it's been in several different places for the past couple of weeks for the death of ... or the president calls it credible lodge and Congress don't\nSaudis say he was killed in a fist fight with Fifteen men\nAny child in any school yard in the world could see through that story Scott but it wasn't concocted to be believed any more than the earlier versions of the story the Saudis have now abandoned its intended simply to be told and accepted as a pretext for continuing business as usual\nAnd that's less about oil these days and it's about billions of dollars in arms sales President Trump made that clear this week while\nHe was seated with the executives from a number of us arms makers who are selling those weapons to Saudi Arabia the president has made it clear this journalist was not a U.S citizen and that this is not the president's focus right now what is focused\nBut president made that clear this week by spelling out is gender like a shopping list he said this election this fall is about Kavanaugh the caravan law and order and common sense\nAnd a president and other Republicans have been treating Brett Kavanaugh as a martyr even though he was in fact confirmed and is in fact on the Supreme Court now the caravan is that group of several thousand refugees from Central America who have been stopped at the border of Guatemala and Mexico far from the United states but they wanted to\nGo far from the United states but they wanted to be coming to the United states so the president is using them to symbolize the immigration he wants to stop as for law and order that's the phrase is older states rights and of course we all want the rule of law applied equally to all but the phrase has also been used\nAs code for resistance to social change and common sense is another familiar phrase a recently used as a political cultural\nBy the Tea Party as you mentioned round the caravans been a feature of the the rallies that President Trump has been addressing but\nHe's also threatened to withhold some foreign aid over it has me yes the stopping the caravan and the threat of\nWithheld assistance is substituting right now for the border wall which the president has made the symbol of his immigration policy and much more and which so far he has not been able to build\nAll be noted uh it does seem those at the polls have tightened in recent days I haven't they yes\nSome of the polls have tightened down for a variety of reasons among them that this is October and that's what the polls usually do in the month before an election especially if we've seen one party or the other getting well ahead in the early fall in October that lead shrinks sometimes that means a close election\nSometimes it doesn't but the more lightly attached voters in either party tend to come home in October and that's been especially true of Republicans in recent years\nSupport

...\nAnd for his death it's only a first step president wants to gather more information before deciding how to respond to members of Congress have called for sanctions on the Saudis so far the administration's appeared reluctant to do anything that could jeopardize its close ties with the kingdom NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nIt took the Saudis two and a half weeks to craft their account of ... death and throughout that period the Trump Administration bent over backwards to give the Saudis space\nThis week secretary of state Mike Pompeo paid what was on his face at least a friendly visit three on for talks with both the king and crown prince Pompeo told reporters on his return to the U.S the Saudis are too important a partner to dismiss the relationship overnight\nWe have a long strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n... is right about that for decades us presidents from both parties who felt the need to do business with the salaries but while some did so quietly even at times reluctantly enlist in residence at the Fletcher School says President Trump has been eager to showcase his Saudi ties\nTrump has no artifice about him so he's quite up front about this sort of transactional relationship in a way that other presidents might have been somewhat more embarrassed or inhibit it to speak about\nAll this week when the president was asked about ... case he emphasized Saudi Arabia Israel not only as an ally but as a customer\nWhat I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of things and a hundred and ten million dollars worth of military those are the biggest orders in the history of this country\nTrump exaggerates those dollar figures but the Saudis are big spenders especially in the United states the kingdom as pledged forty five billion dollars to help it\nStates the kingdom is pledged forty five billion dollars to help bankroll tech companies like ... than lucid motors Saudi money also flows to American universities such as Harvard in Georgetown and foreign policy think tanks here in Washington\nEven before the Saudis acknowledged ... death some recipients were trying to distance themselves from the kingdom's money but it's not easy says Rachel process and author of the book sicker than oil America's uneasy partnership with Saudi Arabia\nThey invest in long term goals they invest in real estate they've been lately investing in a lot of our high tech companies they're investing and institutions in art museums they have a lot of money to spread around\nFor decades Bronson says both us and the Saudis encourage those commercials ties as a kind of mutual insurance policy to keep both oil and defense dollars flowing\nDuring the Cold War of the two countries teamed up against the Soviet Union and more recently they've partnered to fight terrorism although the Saudi record on that front is mixed former President Obama took a step back from the Saudis as part of his diplomatic overture to Iran but Bronson says Trump has embraced the kingdom more tightly than ever\nThe Trump Administration has put all of their ... and they've been very very public about that\nTrump has sided with Saudi Arabia and its regional fight with cutter and encourage the very public romance between his son in law Jared Kushner and the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin selmont\nAs the president said yesterday before the Saudis acknowledged ... death that makes it tough for Trump to crack down now say maybe as many great\nIs that is why this is so\nAs as well this is so\nSad but\nBronson says Saudi Arabia was all ready backsliding on its pledges of modernization which is part of what made ... so critical\nWhich I'm On a show he represented for many of us was this belief in managed change in Saudi Arabia which is very slow he could be patient and he he expected to be patient about when he didn't expect with the reversal that he was seeing with ... in some

chance this year you've got a game seven you haven't been to the world series since Nineteen eighty two\nAnd of course the Dodgers have a chance to go to the world series back to back so this is what

it's overdue when they make I Can't wait till it does happen so you can take another\nUnnecessary barrier and and and put it away because I think that the and the NBA has been the progressive lead the NBA has been the one that has been better on on protests the NBA's been better in terms of having\nFemale referees the NBA's been better with my colleague doors work on the broadcast and so the next step is to have a female head coach and it's really not that big a deal for the rest of us because if you actually live in\nIt's really not that big a deal for the rest of us because if you actually live in society we've all had female bosses at some point but in that we do here I Want to know yes [laughter] I Know and in in that sport it's a big deal in professional sports in the the male dominated game\nAnd also let's not forget that that ESPN actually put\nThe you know we have two women on the broadcast now for football you've got Hannah and had a storm and Andrea Kramer\nBoth doing

I don't like it I hate it I think it's terrible I disagree I understand the reason why people do it why they think it's a big deal\nAnd I I get it I don't like it because I think that it imbalances the game to the land of the giants we know that these players are now seven feet tall is six eleven or whatever we know they can serve a hundred and forty five miles an hour\nAnd that they it just becomes a serving contest but you have to play defense and if you can't play defense then the game gets shifted toward the tall guys and so we never had this conversation with with when players were were six feet under so my advice to those guys just break\nA Howard thank you you're in San Francisco or their commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the Mexico City Olympics and of course that's

understand that decision because you had to wear a lot of different factors didn't hear\n[noise] yeah so we knew that there was a really high possibility that three ... we would give this child HIV

was getting really sick had been admitted to ICU had needed to be ventilated\nAnd we were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV what did the parents children\n[noise] so the parents were saying to us\nWhy ... nights where well controlled well HIV positive people we take a medication every day\nWhy wouldn't you consider us so they were sick need that to wish from the parents and the mom particularly who was the Darnah that she could be in Darnah and we had to consider that very carefully 'cause we have to make sure that we promote sending harms the autonomy of our patients as far as possible\nSo it was interesting that in this case it was very much motivated by a request from the very brave sets of parents who wanted to save the life of their child\nGoing through juice in this uh this case the more people know about it we'll look contribute something to lifting the stigma they try to be in so many countries around the world\nWould like to her so you know HIV stigma is an extremely complicated thing and it's it's a multifaceted so for us in South Africa although we have this very well integrated national um aids treatment program HIV is still very stigmatized\nAnd one of the things we would really hope to show through what we've done here is that if you're an HIV positive person and you're on your medication you living in normal life then that should preclude you from being an organ donor it shouldn't stop you for having those\nYou from being an organ donor it shouldn't stop you for having those options that HIV negative people would have\nAnd we hope that by showing that HIV positive people can do this that that would help to reduce the stigma to some extent but this is just one case and it's going to take a lot more than one case to make a serious dent in HIV stigma\nThat carried Etheridge medical bioethicist at Vince Donald Gordon medical center in Johannesburg thanks so much for being with us thank you

Gonyea was with the president on the campaign twin out west and joins us now Don thanks for being with us my pleasure and let's begin with the president's first comments or after Saudis the Saudis announced a confirmed\nThe obvious mister show jihad died\nOr in their custody the president was asked about it will turn an air force base\nWell I think it's a good first step but it's a big step to a lot of people a lot of people involved it I think it's a great first step\n[noise] um a lot of people Trump's referring to the tune of ...\nI'm a lot of people in Trump's referring to the Eighteen arrested related to uh to the fight that the Saudis say resulted in ... what\nElse did you say on the topic\nWell he he took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called cause showed used at the unacceptable but also right away scot he pivoted to the contracts the Saudis have with U.S companies like Boeing and General Dynamics and\nAnd as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment\nWorth a hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response bought\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution a cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work which means six hundred thousand jobs\nAnd it's got just briefly the president uses those numbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to fact checks as is the number of jobs analysts say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that Jamal ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting uh give given up quickly in the past\nHe has leveled very blunt criticism of other us allies are closer allies Canada Germany over trade and the like eh not so with the Saudis now all of this comes up its\nPresident is campaigning for Republicans in a number of Senate races that are considered

Democrats who protested cabinet Kavanaugh an unhinged\nAngry mob and I can tell you the rally crowds love that language\nOr any talks about the that that caravan that large group of refugees mostly from Honduras at currently heading north toward the U.S border and lots of TV coverage of it and the president clearly sees it as a political gift just before the election this is from his rally in Arizona last night\nDemocratic victory in November would be a bright flashing invitation every trafficker smuggler drug dealer and the illegal alien on the planet come on and come on and ah\nSo that's the vibe at these rallies in in Trump's orbit even on a day when the news is about the confirmation of the death of a ...\nAnd here's John ... thanks very much for being with us thank you got\nThe Trump Administration has had a muted response so far to the death of Jamal controlled gee\nWe turn now to even adult or he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now head of the Chicago Council\nOn global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey is the empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership ... thanks so much for being with us glad to be based on all of your experience does the Saudi explanation of how Mr ... died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damage limitation exercise rather than they kind of complete thorough and transparent\nYou know I think uh this sounds like a damaged limitation exercise\nRather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ... when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president or how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both Washington and we were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual\nBut we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response to let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies at first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior\nIn the U.N Security council secondly to work with our allies particularly the Brits\nAnd the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a better sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is the is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid an foreign society's\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries um to a point of value and that is not the most effective way to do\nOh yes the export of democracy to foreign countries to a\nPoint of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we do with them it does not the only factor we have other interests are and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arm shipments a that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that\nDo not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we're getting from top two weeks is unacceptable uber gold or thank you thank you\nInstead of your brats 'cause

Simon\nWe've learned over the past few years the opioid crisis that the face of addiction can be just about any face\nAn obituary that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touched many readers this week it included a photo of smiling face of metal Lynch in there with her toddler son Aden who was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo shoot a good day for Maddie but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old introduction cotton at a high school party a drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\nMetal and Lynch in near died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kato Neal wrote that obituary and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Burlington thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me first we're we're sorry thank you\nWhat can you tell us about your sister\nThank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be\nAn actress and star and Broadway musicals and she really had the voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew and loved and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate based painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using\nInjecting heroine she tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Matty\nThis past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again for drug ... more than ...\nOut and she sort of um\nDisappeared again drove more than one program I gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of this and you're a bridge or\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lived and certain not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted now um we carried out for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronouncing there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly
