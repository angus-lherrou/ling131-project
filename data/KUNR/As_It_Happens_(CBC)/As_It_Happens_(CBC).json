happening anywhere but\nYou know obviously being a representative of this community\nAnd being a person who is of this community raising my children in the community um\nIt's gut wrenching it's gut wrenching I\nI I just can't imagine that anyone would do this and\nWe did receive it to the official package in our office and my staff\nWho is trained to\nBe able to recognize a wet when we get a suspicious package it exactly the right thing followed the procedures and guy and you know obviously when\nYou you have a suspicion package from the rocket then you have back who has who has handled it on and you realize that that\nThere is potential danger it's on\nIt's it's frightening night nightmarish\nIt's it's frightening nightmares and die\nOne of the things that I Know I'm going to make sure that I Do\nIs that it is is so back and I said on the appropriations subcommittee that guy that that handle the procedures in funding for these things\nWe have to make sure that we\nEven more screening and protection\nFor the people that are helping us do our job that\nAnd certainly have to ask you this but I'm ... can you tell me what you learned about what happened to your brother Nick at night in March and how he was killed\nSo the Hoover driver had only been in Toronto I Believe for four days or so so he didn't really know anything really was so he he gets on the highway but he's going eastbound instead of West bound you\nCan even really know attraction to you on so he gets off it's been a huge turned around to start going west on the Gardner and uh they're coming up with a turn off to the airport and his uh phone a lot of its cradle onto the floor\nAnd he pulled over set aside the highway\nBut he didn't fully pull over he was still partially in the last play the traffic and he Richard this phone and then when you re entered the highway without really properly speeding up or checking as mayor at the same time there was a BMW\nDealt with is changing lanes from the central him to the right lane and that driver admitted that he was a\nHe said he was taking the time on his phone I mean who knows if that's true or not but he was looking at his phone\nWhile changing lanes and the damned dog Schreiber rear ended the river and it was exactly the point where my little brother was sitting in the class so my little brother side of the car took out all of the impact and uh ... not cause was broken and he was basically\nKilled instantly thankfully his uh\nIt was basically killed into my thankfully his uh his girlfriend Monica I'm was only moderately injured\nSo sorry what what training to do you drive or had\nA nothing in twenty sixteen when city council was meeting to decide on what regulations there should be for a ride truck drivers what they ended up doing was just getting rid of safety training for\nNot just assure drivers a taxi drivers as well they lower the bar for everyone it was just incredibly reckless in stupid decision as a direct reluctant to death I think because this tribe or I don't think could have passed a the most basic safety safety test\nHe was just so incompetent and ah he had no business transferring the public at all so um we're looking for is just some bare minimum of safety training some safety attracts you to see that someone actually has a competent and safe driver before they're allowed to pick up members of the public because when you call it Hoover you don't\nIt's it's a complete stranger who's coming to pick you up you don't know how safe are are confident they are\nOr earlier this month Hoover candidate said that they think the technology they already have a good job of sensing a driver skill on the road and then its customers lodge safety concerns about driving the company will investigate what do you think about those measures\nThat completely ridiculous I mean it's the passengers are doing the safety testing for river if it drivers on faith and confidence and I guess he or she will pay a passengers for awhile give them an said fries and and the passengers will alert Hoover are raised a tribe or poorly I mean I'm sure this a driver would have actually been weeded out that way but in the meantime the public\nWould have actually been weeded out that way but in the meantime the public's being put at risk\nEven experience drivers sometimes do really stupid things how can you be that the extra safety training would have prevented the kind of accident that your brother was killed and\nI mean yeah accidents absolutely happen all the time in this case if you could have been some freak accident if you had done everything that would be understandable but the level of incompetence and the recklessness there's just extreme and we can't we kept preventive react to that from happening\nWe can take simple commonsense measures to reduce the likelihood of things like a ... and\nYou and your family even launched a petition to convince the city of Toronto that new bridge drivers require safety training um how hopeful are you that that will happen\nCautiously optimistic that common sense will prevail the whole um idea to completely got rid of safety training for\nAll the drivers and ... it was so shortsighted and naive I think it was just a bunch of a middle aged guys who wanted to see 'em like they were with the times and I do as someone who works in talk myself I Do just\nBecause it's new and flashy doesn't mean we don't need fifty training those rules were there for a very good reason\nPatrick just isn't it terrible year for you and your family with with the loss of your brother Nick how are you how are you all doing now\n[noise] um it's been yeah it's been horrible because uh the baby of the family he was a eight years younger than my sister and I and uh he was really one of all of us who really likes loves loves those\nOne of all of us really like love life most and lived up to the fullest had he was also just sort of conscious as we were all together is the last weekend before the accident and I actually took a metal he was very hard drive and\nI took him out in the car that you could talk to who he was so different cautious he was he was driving so slowly he was ... years and years after like Alex like to relax\nAnd uh for someone so conscientious and so a caring about there's three killed in this way just makes it all the more frustrating and five\nPatch again and again I'm Sorry I'm and thank you so much for speaking with the oh no problem with our father\nPatrick Cameron is Nick cameras older brother Nick was killed last march while traveling in a new ... the driver of that Hoover was handed a careless driving traffic sign yesterday in connection with the next ...\nNext parents Cheryl hawks in the late bill Kamron or

Philadelphia's city council has made up its mind ... last night it passed a resolution to welcome and owner these soft uncontroversial new mask off of the Philadelphia fliers here's a clip\nOf

Philadelphia fliers and\nBy the end of the resolution [noise]\nFifty year old girl born on the fire season ticket holders through second that alright\nMoving probably sick at all in favor say aye those oppose us having that ... [noise] uh\n...\nOr [noise]\nThe ugly [noise]\nGreedy is the Philadelphia players first ever mascot he is not a traditional mascot he's fine but he's also horrifying and because of that he has divided fans and the people around the world\nThey were human created and designed gritty he lives in West grove Pennsylvania but today we reached Mr Raymond in the villages Florida [noise]\nRaymond what was it like to hear a city council page\nMr Raymond what was it like to hear a city council pay tribute to gritty\nWell I'll tell you it's um this whole thing has been somewhat of a surprise when it reached a a different level of deaths of all if you will in terms of the acknowledgement and the acceptance because going in certainly\nUh we were preparing for it to not be accepted in any way shape or form in in terms of British Rule out and did not only that it did come in negative very early in the short twenty four hours at a completely reversed and now suddenly\nA gritty is a phenomenon and it's it's not something that anybody myself for the flyers explains expected\nWhy were you expecting such a negative reaction well have you ever been to Philadelphia [laughter]\nHuge bill I'm not sure who you're insulting [laughter] why on I'm going to take a I'm going to take a pedal bike [laughter]\nAre fans are are very very discriminating in terms they had great knowledge about each sport um and they don't like any fooling around you know they want to get to it they want to win so they when you throw some marketing at them they sense that this is some you know the way to get people to love the flyers\nUm they're against it in in Philadelphia it's been tough fans they do not like you know the furry creatures however the fanatic [noise]\nA kind of slipped under the radar back in Nineteen Seventy eight has become one of the best known mascots in sports\nThis is the Philly fanatic um for the for the Phillies baseball team\nCorrect and and he's probably recognize as one of the best mascots and all sports [noise] um and and I was the performer for this an addict\n[noise] um and and I was the performer for this unethical and he was Nineteen Seventy eight so they were frightened too but I can that day you could come out and that they just let the attic come out one night than say anything about him and he got a lot of positive response but today's world\nMake an announcement that this is going to get the flyers mascot an organization who never really liked mascots and we're clear that they weren't going to have a mascot\nIt they knew ways and we're going to say that the negativity was going to come first um and I think the reason why it worked was they they embraced that they knew it was coming and then when it came they embrace it and had fun with it and and that flip the switch\nNow you you you mentioned you know being outside and of course you're protests have taken outside of the Vatican and the Senate what kind of reaction did you get there there are just ten percent of the ...\nWhat kind of reaction did you get there\nThere are just ten percent of the participants are women within the Senate hall so on the day that the Senate began we had a witness outside the Senate gates and to call for women to vote within within the Senate hall basic they called the bishop that name and say we see what you're doing a near closing the door and making decisions without us\nSo we were able to peacefully protest outside the Senate hall I'm also praying of or twenty five minutes before the Roman police came and I'm asked us to stop basically I was held for simply by my arm and everyone was forced show identification\n... what about the reaction from the crowds were there any was there any reaction from pass or ... or ... people observing\nNotably two pilots from Ireland came and greeted us and and took our materials the fact that women cannot vote in a meeting in two thousand Eighteen is it's pretty absurd to most people so we got a lot of support from people walking by\nNow Pope Francis has promised to put more women and leadership roles and after five years there are only six women in you know what can be defined as leadership roles at the Vatican what more would you like from him\nWell there are things that he could do immediately and he could appoint women took the position of leadership I'm across the Vatican today that conditions that don't require ordination\nNow there's been a lot of criticism of Pope Francis a boat how slow he has been to understand the sex abuse issue within the Catholic Church and how he said the right things but has has has been very slow to act\nI'm there hasn't been as much public criticism towards him about women do you think he gets the issue\nWomen do you think he gets the issue of of why women should be included in in the Catholic Church and given leadership positions\nMany of us are calling for quality and are not satisfied by the slow progress at his papacy to bring women into\nYou know substantial leadership position mhm but do you think you get to you know I\nI really hope that he is able to meet with men who are called to be precise as the pastor I Know that he you know would respond to them with a a generous heart and they hope that he has a man of conversion\nYeah no I understand that that's what you hope I guess what I'm trying to ask you is do you think that Pope Francis is a Catholic leader who can grasp uh why it's necessary in two thousand and Eighteen to fully include women\nUm I guess we'll have to see so far he hasn't made any moves to include women in substantial voting positions or made tremendous steps towards women in the position so I mean five years in a lot of us are\nYou know tired of waiting um but I I I Do think that it ... it takes time for change to happen but you know why I Do think that uh he has a lot to learn can microwave thanks so much for speaking with me thank you\n... is the executive director of the

Littman has visited\nSeals Charles ... Lippmann has visited east Arlen more than a dozen times for his research Mr letting in is a conservation biologist with the U.S national\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration or NOAA we reached him in Honolulu\nMr Clinton and what do you know about how Easter Island looks right now\nUh looks very different than it did just a couple of weeks ago it's a all that remains of it is a small maybe fifty meter a San bar barely sitting above the ocean surface\nYour before the hurricane rolled over at what did the island looked like then\n[noise] pretty standard ...\nSmall Sandy Island a represents the northwestern one island it was about eleven actors in two meters above sea level covered with a bit of vegetation but basically teeming with wildlife thousands of birds hundreds of green sea turtles that used it for nesting and I'm a couple of dozen endangered monk seals that would use it for popping habitat\nDid people lived there where you live at any point\nNo so the northwest Hawaiian Islands is a is a national monument or large national park um and so the only people that would ever be up there where researchers and we usually had people that would be up there between the month of April in August\nYou know it's part in Hawaii a French forget shoals were there any other islands affected by this hurricane earlier this month\nYeah so French radio shows itself has has about seven pilots of a very sizes they're\nSome of the estimates that we've heard as the storm surge was probably about five meters all of the island or maybe two to three meters high so obviously every island was over washed it's just east was sitting at the probably the most exposed part of that the the show and and suffered the brunt of the damage\nNow and someone who is down ...\nAnd and suffered the brunt of the damage\nYou know and someone who is done research on this island what were your concerns when you learn that it had been wiped off and that\n[noise] it just a really really like many of these islets a a really really important habitat for a lot of animals in the middle of the ocean so for green sea turtles they're threatened\nNinety six percent of the population breeds at French for your shoulder ... souls this island with fifty percent of that nesting habitat so it's it's a pretty significant loss for turtles\nAnd for among feels it's about thirty percent of their population um pups their head for trade is also\nThe first question for us as did we lose animals and we don't think we did because it was so late in the season so they probably weather the storm it's next year when they come back to ... poor to nest um you know how are they going to respond to that loss of habitat and are they going to move to another place to to have their offspring\nIs is that a difficult thing for them to do to to switch there's sort of their annual um roots are habits\nUm they're you know thankfully wildlife is is pretty adaptable so we think that though a monk seals for sure um but we're pretty confident that the the turtles will\nGo back to east island realize that you know the probably tried to haul out and and see that it's not their figure out that it's not good habitat and they will move on but we will have our teams up they're monitoring and and then making sure that everything is is okay\nWhat is entailed into monitoring I mean are you going to send a team to to another island to watch them there are when when one of the next step", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "year": "2018", "city": "Reno", "day": "27", "locations":

also we were very fortunate to have publicly available data from the very day long term ecological research program\nAnd many many field biologist had contributed to that database of\nBird abundances frog abundances all over the past Thirty years so we we looked at those and they told the story of the upper levels of the food Web there wasn't de to decline significant decline and birds in the frogs\nAnd uh in parallel with the decline in their food\n[noise] it just I guess they knew the way to register how how consequential you research is is that scientists who have read it they were responding to what you published are in shock that this is around the world and extremely disturbing a research report that you have\nReleased and and it ... and Lucy this everywhere we're seeing declines of all kinds of\nAnimals and and ... the food chain why is it so much more significant in spite of Puerto Rico well\nThat's a great question you know I like insects are declining globally um frogs\nHad been crashing and going extinct for the past Fifteen to Twenty years\nThat's thought to be primarily a fungus infection but the consequences\nI think are so somewhat unexpected of our study in that if it's replicated and we'd need more data keep telling everyone that but it's true on these are complex systems we just did a little kid or rain forest um their indicators and in Mexico in the tropical forest\nTrue um these are complex systems we just did a little kid a rain forest um their indicators and in Mexico on the tropical dry forests that Andres than I studied before\nThat a similar declines of insects as occurring but we need more data um so the implications however are truly frightening because this has been overlooked central a phenomenon that has\nProfound implications for the future of tropical rain forest\nIf the insects are found to be decreasing and other tropical forests and we are getting the effects on the food Web that we noticed in Puerto Rico then that is a major major another major negative\nComponent for the future\nOf by a diversity and the preservation of of systems um I think it was unexpected it's a\nIt's a rather unknown effect in tropical rain forest because people don't measure insects in them like that's just been true I think they just take it for granted it's the tropics they're warm they're doing fine may be logging um in some cases now pesticides would have an effect but not this kind of\nExtreme collapse\nAnd so why why why do you think is happening in ... yes well\nTen years ago actually colleagues of our our as a ... um they predicted that tropical insects would be exquisitely sensitive\nTo increases in temperature and that was counter intuitive for many biologists including myself because just think oh wait a second they evolved in hot arguments how they're going to be\nAffected by a couple of degrees of warning but they showed that tropical insects have a very narrow range of thermal tolerance\nFor that was their predictions is borne out many laboratory experience parents but Andre ... and I went down to Puerto Rico to see if it was truly happening in the tropical rain forest and as far as we can tell the story chewy predictions had been borne out\nThe story chewy predictions have been born out\nBad I it's just devastating to have this News I'm glad you went there and fight back this research

here as part of what you had to say\nJust by the turbulent\nTheater fight surrounding his nomination my fervent how is that Brett Kavanaugh\nWill work ... less than the divisions in the Supreme Court so that we had far fewer five four decisions and so that the public confidence in our judiciary\nAs our highest court is reduced or\nMr President I Will vote chicken for judge Kavanaugh\nWas Senator Susan Collins speaking earlier today democratic Senator Joe Manchin also declared he would vote confirmed judge Kavanaugh as he explained his decision to reporters he was drowned out by protesters\nAnd I looked at me and I make a decision based on what you see that at a photo investigation by the it was from I sat there was a lot\nOf people that I was concerned about how they said what they say how they did a\nDemocratic Senator Joe Manchin\nDemocratic Senator Joe Manchin Gen ... is a senior ... politics reporter for huff post we reached her in Washington DC\nBut they have suggested that they want to deport Hassan to Syria\nIf they did proceed with the charges that he would stay and remind wouldn't be so they would uh they they wanted to vote\nYeah if if they had pursued the criminal charges strangely it would've been better for 'em because um he we would have had time to try and figure out how to protect him\nWhat would happen to him if he was deported in Syria he what what does he believe would occur\nWhile he would definitely be imprisoned because he is wanted because he does not complete who's mandatory military service he has very clearly you know state and\nBecause he does not complete who's mandatory military service he has very clearly you know stayed into objections to the civil war that's happening in Syria\nAnd he has been quite critical of the Assad regime which means that he would just may be imprisoned probable that he would be tortured it could be even worse\nYou and others have been trying to stop this deportation and in fact try to bring him to Canada for all of these months and he has been in the airport so what happened to your efforts\nWell waste a map okay Shane a call to sponsor Hassan to come to Canada we raised over twenty thousand dollars\nSupport that sponsorship application we worked to find a fulltime job so he has a job offer which includes housing in Whistler British Columbia\nHe has for a close family members here in Canada so we had asked me to meeting government to expedite the process in time for that application and to date today have been not able or willing to do that\nIn his status of his file at this point the sun has been accepted to Canada is that right\nHints application has been approved to quote what all that means is that when we submitted it it was reviewed by a immigration a refugee inches and shipped Canada and approved yet so popular thing at that point it was sent overseas to the high commission of\nAh Canada in Singapore for processing the standard like the type of parts of sitting there is twenty three to twenty six months\nHe has said that he is willing to sit in the airport for twenty three months of that is what it takes right\nYeah that's what he said we are grateful that they have permitted him to be there for the last seven months and he was only able to survive to the generosity of airline employees who provided him with airline meal it came to the point where Malaysia felt that she could\nNeal it came to the point where Malaysia felt that she could no longer be in the airport\nYou know when we spoke with him back in April he talked about you and your efforts to help him I I just wanted to play a bit of that clip or where he talks about what you've done for him\nThey made me believe again and again when they ought to just a group of volunteers amazing people no matter what consequences will be quite ... ... or ... or ... these people are in there I'm grateful for as long as I was doing last\nThat was his own a concert talking about what you and the other Canadians have done for him\n[noise] and it's heartbreaking I you know I have never met a fun but I feel that I Know him I mean we we've gone through a lot together we've spoken on the phone recharged video compensation he has a nickname for me\nI feel like he's my son and his mother has reached out to me a and his sister to you know thank me for what I'm doing but I just I'm very scared right now but I'm also hopeful I Believe in our government I I'm just praying and hoping that they will be that\nOne of the things that um the Malaysian immigration chief said about arresting ... is that he's shamed Malaysia because of how much publicity he got that he was making these little videos and the people I was following him on Twitter about what it's like\nTo live in the airport acts of kindness acts of cruelty that he was subjected to what would it actually take at this point to go to safety\nOne signature from minister integration he just needs a what's called a temporary rent is permanent\nOne signature from minister of immigration he just needs a what's called a temporary ratcheted permanent that the minister Kenny shoes for someone who is in a ... situation which would permit Hassan to fly immediately to Canada where he could\nWait here while his sponsorship ... the process\nAnd without that signature what happens he could die it it's very it's very\nReal it's a so outside of our daily existence you know I'm a\nCanadian mom never thought that I Would be\nIn a position where I Am fighting for some of like I'm just thinking the Canadian government to step in it would be so easy we have raised on the twenty thousand dollars\nWe have six thousand signatures on a petition asking the minister of immigration to allow us to come to counter documents a fulltime job here he had for family members of the new Canada he has thousands and thousands of volunteers who are ready to welcome him they integrate them into Canadian society and uh\nI just don't understand why we can't help is young now\nCooper appreciate speaking with you and we will it will keep in touch and we'll see what happens\nThank you and I really appreciate your interest in support of Bye bye bye\nGloria Cooper is one of the group of Canadians that has been trying to help us on Oakland are come to Canada since April we reach ms Cooper in Venice\n\n\n[noise]\nYou have likely seen something like this on a map before there is a place usually an island that is small and\nQuite geographically far from the focal piece of land the center of the map and so they put this little island in a box and shifted closer to the focal point it's completely inaccurate geographically speaking but it's convenient and it makes everything just nice and come back from a design perspective\nYou've also probably spend a little to no time questioning the existence of those boxes unless you're a ... or you were from Shetland for some residents that Scottish archipelago those map boxes have been a point of frustration\nBut this week a new rule came into place that freeze their home from that two dimensional confinement\nBy banning government bodies in Scotland from putting Shetland in a box on maps the rule was proposed by Shetland politician ... Scott we reached Mr Scott in lurk Shetland\n... why did you want to get Shetland out of the box\nThe many government publications ... on\nA on the other ways in which shepherd has it'd be exhibited over the years has usually had the islands placed on a map in a book in the incorrect geographical position\nOn many islanders if not all of the island does feel pretty upset by that on were fed up with the irritation know being in the wrong place so some comments you legislation was a available earlier this year and I was able to move um some changes to that legislation\nAvailable earlier this year and I was able to move um some changes to that legislation so as to make sure that in future a shepherd dies you say has nothing to box but then it's correct position\nNow is it just because they didn't that people don't like it could hog refers I can ... is there a reason for putting in a box\nI guess the reason is there were two hundred miles across a north of all the mainland and therefore I correct pasta\nHas to have a favorite to see the north sea and the way um I don't have a problem with that because we live on islands we depend on ... we have a huge crushing industry that to you that depends on of a pristine marine environment\nThat we have the oil industry all around us as well in all the industrial mechanisms that depend on the oil use the sea so it seems to be a bit strange to have to see is part of the ... that's a reality of where we are\nTalking to a posted this band said that is not had Shetland shouldn't be there would be no new details they actually use these boxes to avoid map sitter mostly water and that you do lose so much when you have to I have to expand\nThe map that large you know I'd have shut Lyndon then\nWell hey hold my ... leaves hold them I mean they\nAre we live we live I think it's time that we were put in the right place not\nFly them does believe that it's not just my items but I think also I look throughout the world have the same a view of the use of the view these things are going\nI think it's a terribly kind of city centric come um central but as we say in the central belt constitutes which is that at ... at the center of the universe and everywhere else should just be lucky to be somewhere in the in the vicinity of I think we in check and take the view is\nAbout time that we must stop on instead of looking at it from the center I'm we looked at it from where we live that would make a change in the modern digital world we live and\nSo what you're talking to you can put Shetland in the middle and played ...\nSome change in the digital world we live in\nOkay so what you're talking to you can put Shetland in the middle and put what Great Britain in a box\nNot only was it courageous to talk about especially within her own culture and religion to talk about what had happened to her from a sexual point of view because of the taboo issues\nNot about one relevant to her it was about literally saving hook people I mean it was remarkable to meet her and her strength in her ... year Colyer determination to get these things done on behalf of hurt people and to be that voice\nYou know when he had been working on it since the I guess with international in ...\nDon on behalf of ... people and to be that voice you know when he had been working on it since the\nI guess there was International Women's day in twenty sixteen with my first question to Justin Trudeau on that day in question period asking him to create a special program to bring you the girls and women to safety in Canada and but it became apparent\nWhen ... came to Canada She heard what we were doing and she came to Canada and then it was undeniable no one could look at her and said no we don't want\nTo help the government created a program and\nShe thought she never imagined that this would have happened but she's become really a heroine to her own people into people all over the world\nI wanted to ask you about that voice that person coming into parliament and the effect it had she was what she was in the gallery when there's a ... was debated ...\nShe was sitting with my husband holding and [laughter] and where do you think it's so hard he said he will never forget when she was and that's the only time she cried I spend time with her listening\nAnd I remember that I wanted to break down so many times and I thought how could I how could I cried\nWhen she doesn't and I just held at all in and as soon as she left the house I just broke down but she was so strong I just couldn't imagine where does she find that strength I kept thinking to myself and then when we knew it was very emotional when you\nWhen parliament voted in favor chicken down and she almost physically [noise]\nMy hope for her but she won't kill and then she will find some time to heal herself I just I Want her to be happy I knew she can you know into he all and find a normal life\nOne of the significant things among all the other things you've just itemize did she did for you know the women and girls for people is the awareness she brought to the world\nThe awareness she brought to the world about rape and sexual assault as a crime of war as a weapon of war they were finally prosecutions about this and the war crimes tribunals loser board champions does\nThe recognition that these aren't just things that happened at some individual goes too far these are organized campaigns to destroy communities and cultures through destroying their young women so do you think that that is ultimately what she's brought to the world\nShe has no doubt about that and exactly what you say that rape is just a symptom of a war it's just a side effect then it just wore dirty enough and complicated and these things just happen when they don't just happen because the truth as\nRape is used as a tool of war particularly when you think of ethnic cleansing but what happened to be as eating when it was exactly that when we talk about women peace and security it shouldn't be talked about you know over here in the sand box I you know this isn't just a gender issue that we had to be you\nKnow to the subtext of a of a particular discussion around the peace process you know it should be at the center of the discussion because it's at the center of what is a big part of warfare I think what she's done his remarkable I look at her and I think\nMy goodness for someone her agent for what she went through to be able to rise up and be that folks person it's just it's remarkable\nI don't know if you've had a chance to speak with an audio ... have you talked to her he reached out to\nHer I did I Know right away in London Simon I thought the b._b._c. headline a little earlier than Canadians did and I just want\nTo think of let out a big help of glee and central know right away telling your how incredibly proud of him or her and all of us every one is and that she was just so well preserved\nAnd all of that everyone is going to cheat it just so out there I'm sure she getting many many messages like that from around the world\nReally appreciate speaking with you thank you\nThank you Keli because you buy at night\n[noise] Ron Ambrose is of course former interim leader of the conservative party we reached her in London, UK and later on in the program we're going to look back at carols twenty twelve

Jason Van Dyke shot ... McDonald sixteen times\nHe said he was afraid of the Seventeen year old because he was holding a knife but when footage of the incident was finally released its Van Dyke storey fell apart because for one thing even after the Seventeen year old had fallen to the street the officer continued to shoot him\nWell today a jury found Jason Van Dyke guilty of second degree murder in the shooting of liquid McDonald it is the first time in nearly fifty years at a Chicago police officer has been convicted for an on duty shooting\nAfter that verdict people outside the courthouse celebrated and chanted justice for ... Jamal Greene was there we reached Mr ...\nChanted justice for ... Jamal Greene was there we reach Mr green in Chicago\nIs to green what was the reaction outside when the verdict came down\nWhile we were relieved that he was found guilty on a second degree murder as well as each count of aggravated battery I'm mad that he wasn't you know convicted of an officer and misconduct because of course he still has an appeal\nBut we really bad a statement was made today to officers all across the country is that you can't continue being a judge jury and executioner\n... when you say relieved did you think it would go the other way\nWhile you know ... if you look in America\nWhen officers go on trial they always get off the majority of them get off you know you rarely see officers actually getting convicted so it was do we expect it you know we we were expecting a not guilty verdict respected him to go home expecting them to put on another\nA police uniform [noise] I'm In the end of the day we are glad that that did not happen\nSay when you say that there there have been I guess I'm thinking about what happened and to a police officer in Dallas who was sentenced to prison in the summer for murder and ah there have been some other cases Oklahoma New York city so\nDo you think is the tide tuning or are these cases said I didn't to changing because humans are a lot of their their shootings that didn't go this way\nNow know about trying to we've got a lot of work that they're okay we can't stop now we've got to make sure that the criminal justice system works we've got to make sure that we have good state's attorney said good attorney general sense um [noise]\nPeople that are well make up the criminal justice system to be fair you know we need a judge's set off the bars you know we don't have many a black or Hispanic judges and the and the cook county and and as a Cook County courts\nDon't have many a black or Hispanic judges and the and the cook county and and as a Cook County court you know we have to make sure the criminal the criminal justice system is made up of people who\nCare to do what's right and the two we have that and we don't have anything um we just have small when along the way but we we kinda got lucky\nWhen do you think it was about the evidence that convinced the jury\nWhile you know I think that\nYou know the fact that no other officer to stars a weapon and he got out of his car with them six seconds and he was already firing round the fact that he lived on the stand\nAnd acted like the wind was coming towards him play 'cause park showing no remorse\nReally acted like everything they feel is right you know they look at those witnesses a witness testimony helped as well so I mean I think that he did horrible on the stand in the state to turn to rip them apart I Want to give the state's attorney um\nBanks are bad and uh you know I appreciate the great work that they have done to this place um because I think that they've done it a job um and they looked at the end the jury looked at all of that evidence and looked at a\n... Jason Van Dyke testimony which now is that we're hearing that a few jury said that that was why they decided he was guilty\nOr maybe it wasn't good for him to take the stand\nHis testimony was ... was that this way to defend his guilt that the video itself can you describe the video and the effect it had on his years in in the ... and like likelihood\nI mean if you look at the video and you see you see someone that shot fall to the ground and you see air smoke\nWhen you see you see someone that shot fall to the ground and you see air smoke\nAre more bullets and I think the video is very ... I think the jury thought so as well is that why would you keep shooting I think if he didn't shot shoot the Koran as many times\nIt's possible he could have got off the shot and shot him one time he possibly could have gotten off I had a very a small charge 'em but I think it was the fact that he kept shooting those sixteen ... why would you keep shooting him", "year": "2018", "show_name": "As It
