Cynthia says they think it comes down to money\nThere's no question you know that the the guy that make the notion of having a guy by the end my care effect that all of us in terms of tourism\nIt's the lifeblood of the island\nSome tourism it's the lifeblood of the island I reach out to the Puerto Rico tourism association and talk to the organizations president and CEO Clarissa Jimenez about how much ... affected the island\nIt was a huge in fact\nThere is the remembers when the CDC first issued warnings about the ... in Puerto Rico into thousands sixteen\nThe number they weren't even were really really high and scary I we had lots of cancellations you know there was a\nThe perception that you would do that here and you would get the virus I mean because that was what was portrayed you know those huge percentages of the population and getting the virus\nTourists stayed away and the island lost one hundred million dollars and that she says shouldn't have happened\nOh let me see how they say so their realities that a lot of hype was created\nAfter Hurricane Maria the government wanted to build back the tourism economy as quickly as possible and doctors I talked with believed that meant getting rid of the ...\n...\nKnows the league it is still in rent and so she's found a way to restart testing of pregnant women\nFor ... and I feel this is so important to be able to identify because most of their patients will have seek out do not have any symptoms ... and they think they might be at risk for these things and\nCarmen did an end run around Puerto Rico's health department she teamed up with the CDC to provide free testing for pregnant women it's the only program like it on the island\nTesting for pregnant women it's the only program like it on the island\nSo that we're starting to think I ... and you have written\nOn the first day back in the spring eight women had their blood drawn including Melissa\nIt's always been a concern\nBecause I think people sick with the that it\nDid you know when the hurricane started that you are right now I found out that I was struggling with this why now but [noise] stunk\nColumbia baby Maria not call his name [laughter] that that I think that name Lindsay eliminated from their birth registry the now while here in\nThe new testing continued through the summer and it's still going today doctors say the first results are in and even though it's a small sample there alarming nine percent of women are testing positive and that's almost with the rate was at the height of the epidemic\nSign the semi researcher I'm not running for anybody because we'll see Sean therefore I kind of on any name Wendy evidence dance me to say\nAnd the evidence is telling Carmen ... is a very real danger today for pregnant women and babies in Puerto Rico around twenty six thousand women will give birth this year so far fewer than three hundred have been tested for ...\nI'd be no situation for one I'm thirty six years I've been blessed oh bean brain sent for they burst of so many babies and I continue that the first thing I Will might ask my baby I think he's uh\nTell you that the first thing that we might ask my baby I think it's a it's anti calling their sense that we need to do it we need to the day right dean Martin\nAnd\nThat story was from Beth Murphy at the ground truth project she's the director of films there and also has a short film coming out about this story\nAnd we check with the CDC about seeking Puerto Rico one of the epidemiology told us that the risk of\nGetting Z can now is less than during the outbreak a couple of years ago but the\nVirus will always be there and people need to protect themselves from Skittles and sexual transmission to avoid\nGetting infected ... ... ... ... ... ... in a moment we hit back to the mainland Houston, Texas where a year after Hurricane Harvey people who are using a government program to pay for housing or getting the door shut in their faces and you're

Pam does this work today and why she's trying so hard for Denise in Cook County Illinois where Denise from rejecting someone just because they have a section ... voucher is considered discrimination and it's illegal\nIt's also a legal and a handful of states including Massachusetts Oregon and New Jersey [noise]\nA few years ago Austin, Texas passed an ordinance like this but a few months later the state legislature overturned it and lawmakers went even further they ban any other city in Texas from doing the same thing\nBasically Texas landlords are allowed to discriminate against people with section ... vouchers and they can't be punished for it [noise]\nIn Texas was one of the first states in the country to pass a law like this and twenty Fifteen Indiana did to the same year the needs to know about the law when she moved here\nYour daughter the she understand that some people don't take vouchers and some people do take altered so she got that what she she gets back to a certain extent but I don't know how to understand the uh [noise]\nThe discrimination all part of it [noise]\nI don't want her to feel stereotype because of a voucher [noise]\nOf a voucher [noise]\nDenise was really hoping to use her voucher and one of two suburban ZIP codes both majority white very low poverty better schools [noise]\nPut out of a Seventeen thousand families that get vouchers from the Houston housing authority we found that only thirty six were living in those in post so what's going on here why are so many landlord unwilling to take out in Texas\nBut I don't think there's the ... section eight is a discriminatory too\nLittle this is Stacey Hi he's on the board of the Houston apartment association and he supports that Texas law that lets landlords they notice section eight\nAfter it passed housing advocacy group sued they said this is racial discrimination in disguise my colleague Edgar Walter interviewed Stacey on earlier this year and brought this up\nThere have been all these lawsuits have alleging that discrimination against voucher holders what do you say to that\nOr an disagree with that but I think that that the voucher users in many situations you know they choose to live for their support group for their family is where transportation where their job is\nWe spoke to more than a dozen voucher holders and none of them told us that Andrew told Stacey ... about Denise\nShe just heard from dozens and dozens of landlords you know like sorry we just don't accept section eight is discrimination or ... or stereotyping at least part of what's at issue\nThe books it's reflective of because everyone has to deal with you very stringent fair housing requirements all across this country\nTold Edgar there are plenty of legitimate reasons Texas landlords don't take vouchers the section eight program is run by government agencies that don't have enough staff and they are known to cut checks late Stacy says this kinda hurts\nThat don't have enough staff and they are known to cut checks late Stacy says this can hurt a landlords bottom line and they shouldn't be forced to deal with it but he did have a suggestion for Denise\n... through for this lady or would have ... the cold to people in this course\nNest quest we'd\nHeard that name a lot during our reporting the bureaucracy affectionate is so bad Houston officials created an entirely new nonprofit last year to help deal with it and didn't want us to see if ness quest could really help people like Denise so I'll let him take it from here\nHere's how nest quest works they find landlords in areas with high rated schools who don't take vouchers then they make a pitch\nWhat does family with a voucher live here and we'll deal with the government for you\nOn time rental payments those are automatic\nWe also secure all the utilities for the Internet ... does not have to do anything this Isabel Lopez executive director of nest quest and we also guarantee that the climate will maintain renters insurance in the unit [noise] um and then upon move out we are willing to foot the bill for any damages\nWhen Isabelle took this job that's caused title one point two million dollar grant to spend\nThe goal helps three hundred and fifty families with children moved to neighborhoods with top rated schools\nI was extremely optimistic easy like I don't see anybody saying no to that and the first time we actually had it hard talking to the landlord and was honestly it was really discouraging\nDoes the fact that under less close the landlords have very little financial risk and yet there's still so cautious of the program does that suggest that there's but there's still a lot of discrimination going on\nBut there's still a lot of discrimination going on\nThat's exactly what that suggests and I hate to say that but it I mean it is a reality of what it is right now\nI'm ... they have this guarantee that everything will work like that everything's going to take get taken care of and it still that hesitation that I don't want to warn when someone who's on section eight\nAs a mid October only Seventeen families with vouchers are renting places ... help\nFive of them are staying in poverty is managed by the company Stacey hunt works for that sort of thirty eight thousand units his company managers in the Houston area\nFive out of thirty eight thousand I talked to you about this you know it seems like cold comfort to somebody like Denise\nWhere it's real like certain room when bill to the day I mean we're we're ... the industry's Troy and\nIn July three months after we first met Denise she was still looking for a place in her voucher was about to expire the deadline came and went\nBut I couldn't get in touch with her and told me Denise was really stressed out and needed some space than a few weeks later I get a Facebook invite for Pam she's holding this women's empowerment conference around the anniversary of the hurricane it's called\nI Survived it and Denise is going to be there sooner early September I drive down to Houston to this little church not far from his office [noise]\nEasy it is\nI Walk inside and I see Pam at the front of the sanctuary gripping a microphone and piecing back and forth\nThe Pam at the front of the sanctuary gripping a microphone and pacing back and forth there is about a dozen people sitting in the pews dressed in their Sunday Best despite the Houston humidity hands got the crowd going\nThink about how [noise]\nMaybe somebody\nOther after her sermon I catch up with pastor Pam can you just tell me a little bit what does this weekend\nAbout survivor is\nThe anniversary of the Harvey you know the one year after Harvey people displaced people still going through things brings survivors together and share this story\nThe morning is packed with prayer and personal testimony is Denise gets up and talks about her struggles to find housing in a new city when we break for brunch I finally get a chance to ask her if she found an apartment she says yes\nAnd how do you like it just the way I thought if\nIt's a cell phone my head right now I won't complain a diplomatic way of putting it [noise]\nIs mine Denise was not able to find a diverse mixed income neighborhood she was looking for when she left Chicago more than twenty percent of her new neighbors live below the poverty line and almost all of them are black or Hispanic and as for the apartment\nThey really almost look like the project from Scott as it ain't nothing but a group of people hang on a fixed income then hauled in one area ...\nThe high school her daughter goes to now got to be reading this year last year it got an F.

talking about his son\nYeah his son Prince Albert has been locked up for seven years what's it like for your family to have him be a way for so long\nAs it was very very you know [noise]\nJust Raj if you're in the yard [noise]\nHard to explain when you're gone\nOn display [noise] when I turned him every every\nConrad and his family are torn apart not just because princes in jail but because he's in jail for so long\nWill what did he do to get locked away for a long period of time\nIt's not so much what he did out the main reason he's still in jail is Louisiana's three strikes law it's called the habitual offender statue and usually you don't hear about it until someone's charged for some minor crime like stealing a flight of sodas\nAnd the district attorney or chief prosecutor Leon can is arrow uses the law to hammer them busy\nBernard noble has served four years of his more than Thirteen year sentence for carrying less than three grams of marijuana\nLouisiana has one of the strongest repeat offender laws in the U.S and in New Orleans that could know put a man in prison for a possible Twenty years to life for stealing candy bars Kobe Brian\nWarren Beatty monitored or\nI've never met Conrad son prince in person but we talk on the phone might say that again\n\nYeah princes on a gel that's over five hours from New Orleans where he's from the phone is in this one huge noisy room where he also sleeps and nice and spends his days along\nWith over a hundred other men we've been talking for months one day prince caught me when I was really stressed out [laughter]\n\n... my hair down did you say [laughter]\n\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nYou said he's looked at it because of the ... explain that well\nPrince was arrested a few times for drug charges which means he's known as a multiple offender or habitual offender and this law can now be applied to him here's how it works the more times you commit a felony the harsher and harsher punishment gets\nAnd regular here's a seven years and years of feels like an attorney\nWorked for tennis arrow right after he was first elected I asked him how often the da's office used the habitual offender statue back then\nHow often the da's office used the habitual offender statue back then\nWhen I was in Ninety nine point nine percent of the time I mean it was just there was a standard that was as even\nLower her office for lack of a better way of describing a that was the way it was\nSo basically any time that you could use that that too often are statutes it was the policy of the da's office in Orleans Parish to use it\nCertainly I Can't think of an instance where we didn't do that\nOne way to think about the habitual offender statute is as a tool like a ranch or hammer something prosecutors can pull out of their tool box when they need it but it's like do you tend to zero never puts this tool away it's always in his hand for every possible case\nThere's is mines that are the more before we locked up in the more time that we give people the more we want to stop the crime problem punished fine as long as ... you know harsh sentences or under turns\nNew Orleans public defender Danny ... says Ken is there is office still uses the ritual offender statue all the time and that makes guilt or innocence almost irrelevant instead it's all about a defendant's past their record\nIt's the first thing you're looking at the start of every analysis of case every way you talk to your client has started every way you talk to the prosecutor and to the judge it's even a consideration for the prosecutors making bail arguments or even from the moments\nOf your arrested part of the core of the case\nI also spoke to senior judge weren't leans parish criminal court Arthur hunter it was the middle of summer when it was over a hundred degrees outside he wasn't wearing a judge's robe instead black polo shirt black pants given the heat I had to tease him about it\nOr right this is a life\nHeat I had to tease him about it\nAll right this is a life like this is a lot of heavy but\nHe said over his blaring air conditioner the judge's job is kind of like our rafts between the defense and the prosecution asked judge hunter what he thinks of\nThis law takes away the prom or the functions of a judge\nWas used to fashion a census that's appropriate specifically for that particular person\nBecause when district attorney's use the habitual offender statute judges no longer decide how long the person will sit behind bars or under what conditions instead mandatory sentences kicking the judge has\nNo choice if I have someone with mental health issues or drug abuse issues I wanted that treatment asked to compose it'd be part of the sentence with the ... on the twenty twenty five years that will be there\nNo taxes they twenty twenty five thousand a year for someone just to go away in ... [noise]\nI also went to another city that's really comparable to New Orleans to find out what their da da da da da da and New Orleans or about the same and some of their demographics around half white half black\nTheir da ... is really comparable to for starters he's from New Orleans just like Leon cannons arrow\nAre losing a shark and Russia oh you do you're going to talk so I'll be going on ...\nStreet Hillary more attended a private Catholic high school which actually played sports against Ghana there it was private Catholic high school but they are white men both have been da ...\nIs there it was private Catholic high school but they are white men both have been da for a decade\nYou know for me is just another statutes another tool that we could possibly use\nDa more saved this law for when someone is really dangerous\nThe bottom line of everything or there's public safety can you serve certainly with no trauma Jew or does publish if you really demand ...\nAnd the ten years he's been da ... office has used this law sixty six times now let's talk about what ... does in New Orleans he wouldn't tell me but I got a hold of court data\nAnd the same ten years Kennedy era has used the same law more than two thousand six hundred times and\n\nI shared this number with the da and his spokesman denied it the da's office only started keeping data on the habitual offender statue in twenty sixteen so I asked them to look at the core data I have\nI never heard back and an email the DEA spokesman said the office uses the law judiciously against people who quote resist rehabilitation and choose instead to commit more so many crimes against more innocent victims\nThe reason these two da's act so different is because every da ... discretion to charge people the way they want to the bottom line is if prints have been prosecuted for drug possession in east Baton Rouge or almost anywhere else in Louisiana and he'd likely be home already\n[noise]\nFrom what you're saying it's like ... has the power to selectively enforce the law\nIn a way I mean do you do take an oath to uphold the law and Ken is there are always emphasizes this oh his duty now\nAnd Ken as always emphasizes this oh his duty not his discretion like here at this other city council meeting where he's defending how he prosecutes marijuana crimes\nI'd be remiss if I had what I consider to be a profitable case and simply said I'm not going to prosecutors because I just don't agree with the law that's really not my call that's what you guys do you make the decision whether or not that should be the law or not\nAnd if if it is a law I think I ever responsibility to prosecute it if the facts in fact support that\nIn other words I don't make the laws adjust enforce them or as we sing and New Orleans [noise]\n\n[noise] oh\nThe ... line is I'm just doing my job why does he doing his job so differently than any other da in Louisiana\nBecause the New Orleans when it comes to the habitual offender statute that's how it's done and this man just hearing from a very squeaky chair can explain why\nMy name is Ken ... than I\n... I call\nA criminal law specialist\nAnd I heard that really you go by Becky\nMay be a Jew gee we're big you would do a ... a ...\nYou know this is my ... my war room [laughter]\nIt's next to his kitchen and full of paper stacked by his computer taped to the walls this is where biggie works he's been studying the law for decades and back in the Senate\nIs where biggie works he's been studying the law for decades and back in the seventies he saw this law which had been around for a really long time basically come back from the dead because the law the multiple bell which is one of its many names\nNobody was doing this but when Harry counting came into office\nWe'll we'll we'll ... we'll wait a minute you did did you just say Harry Cohn exists the jazz singer no that's a junior [noise]\nThis was his dad Harry ... senior\nWhen Harry ... came into office he use multiple below two shows toughness so she'll society that he's going to put people in jail for the rest of their lives\nKind of was the da of New Orleans for Thirty years and kind of a tough on crime trailblazer\nHe first ran in Nineteen Seventy three and promised to use the habitual offender statue much more aggressively here's one of his newspaper ads\nAs district attorney Eric comic budget to use the powers of hers offer to help her image or your system but time and time again returns habitual offenders to continue their uninhibited crimes against decent citizen [noise]\nThis was the Nineteen seventies and crime is urging all over the country people were scared\nSounds like kind of played on that ... so he brought this law back from when ... when does it start\nWell the first mentioned I found in Louisiana is from Eighteen thirty three\nIf any first shot a third time be convicted of any crime you shall be considered as armed forces I envy him isn't that a labor for live\nThrough this whole story I I've been thinking about how race\nSo this whole story I I've been thinking about how race is connected to all of this and and that line unfit for society I mean it it just sounds like something right out of the races handbook right\nYeah I I talked to a historian about that John barred studies the history of incarceration in Louisiana at Tulane University\nI think the fact that ... really came in their own as part of this intensely racialized mass incarceration undoubtedly speaks to imagining the conflict as scary African American man\nThe kind of man who can never be rehabilitated an penitentiary\nAnd for people who couldn't be transformed it it would become a place for storage for forced labor forced labor wow\nAnd this leads us right back to a biggie before he became an expert on the law he fought in the Vietnam War where he also picked up a drug habit and when he returned home to Louisiana biggie killed a man and a botched robbery something he attributes to his addiction and untreated post traumatic stress\nNone it's behind the scenes part of verbal ... negotiations between prosecutors and defense attorneys\nAnd remember in these cases ... officially charges the habitual offender statute his prosecutors just say they will if the defendant doesn't plead guilty so all traces of the law just disappear\nSo we don't even know how many people were talking about here\nRight we know Ken is there a used a lot in over two thousand six hundred cases but that number is just the tip of the iceberg [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nOf course Ken is there refused to be interviewed for this story\nWhich is frustrating because he's an elected official but he did offer a statement about princes case\nHere a few parts that stood out to me Mr Albert voluntarily entered into a ... agreement and received a legal sense under Louisiana law if he believed himself not guilty he could've exercised his constitutional right to stand trial then Kennedy era said\nMy hope is that Mr Albert will apply himself toward programs by which to better himself and eradicate his substance abuse issues while in prison\n\nAfter I requested to interview ... he was moved from one jail to another to begin a drug program I asked him if this was the first time in his seven years locked up that he'd been in a program to treat addiction our connection wasn't great\n[noise] when did you do the first one [noise]\nTo lose so that was like six years and years\n[noise]\nTo limit so that was like six years into your sentence\n[noise]\nPrint said it took awhile for him to enter a program because they didn't really have programs [noise]\n\nJust wasting time sitting in one dormitory with a hundred and twenty people doing nothing\nAnd seven years he's got three to go has anything changed for you\nA lot of fame must love zone one goose being away from those I'm trying to move to treat the way you want to move to ... one of them are too many of them were you know\n...\nA few times now printed asked me to give a message to his oldest son prince junior these calls are expensive and his

R. ... this is review um outlets and [noise]\nWith telling a story today with ... Abrams she reports on criminal justice in ... city that infamous for the extremely high rate of incarceration evils the pod cast on prisoners have have my friends so where are we starting\nWell I like to dance so let's start at this club near my house it's called the prime example\n[noise] that's\nConrad Albert yang he's the DJ but he is also getting down swings hips clapping he's wearing a flat tangled type cap kind old men where\nConrad sixty sex but he hopped up on his chair to here over the ... and see how people are dead music\nLooking\nConrad works as a security guard as well as a DJ he used to be in the navy and then the merchant Marines he's the son named print\nOr did you\nTone\nReally changes when he's talking about his book yeah his son Prince Albert has been locked up for seven years what's it like for your family to have him be a way for so long\nAs it was very very move you know [noise]\nJust Raj if you're in the yard [noise]\nOn to explain when George Zimmerman Aaron recruit\nConrad and his family are torn apart not just because princes in jail but because he's in jail for so long\nWill what did he do to get locked away for a long period of time\nNot so much what he did out the main reason he's still in jail is Louisiana's three strikes law it's called the habitual offender statue and usually don't hear about it until someone's charged for some minor crime like stealing a flight of sodas and the district attorney or chief prosecutor\nSome minor crime like stealing a flood of sodas and the district attorney or chief prosecutor Leon Kenneth Arrow uses the law to hammer them\nBusy Bernard noble has served four years of his more than Thirteen year sentence for carrying less than three grams of marijuana\nLouisiana has one of the strongest repeat offender laws to us and in New Orleans that could know put a man in prison for a possible Twenty years to life for stealing candy bars Kobe Brian\nWarren monitored or\nI've never met Conrad son prince in person but we talk on the phone when you say that again yeah\nPrince isn't a gel that's over five hours from New Orleans where he's from the phone is in this one huge noisy room where he also sleeps and beef and spends his days along with over a hundred other men we've been talking for months one day prince caught me when I was really stressed out\n[laughter]\n... my hair down did you say [laughter]\n[laughter]\nYou said he's looked at it because of the ... explain that well\nWas arrested a few times for drug charges which means he's known as a multiple offender or habitual offender and this law can now be applied to him here's how it works the more times you commit a felony the harsher and harsher punishment gets\nBut I did talk to a bunch of people from all different sides of the courtroom the first person used to work for Ken is arrow as an assistant prosecutor Gregory Thompson to how long were you a da\nAnd regular here's a seven years but in the years of job like an attorney\nThompson worked for Ken is zero right after he was first elected I asked him how often the da's office used the habitual offender statue back then\nWhen I was going on and on point I'm not going to the time I mean it was just some of the standard was even\nLower her job offers for lack of a better way of describing the other was when it was\nSo basically anytime that you could use that that too often or statute it was the policy of the da's office in Orleans Parish to use it\nCertainly I Can't think of an instance where we didn't do that\nOne way to think about the habitual offender statue is as a tool like a ranch\nOne way to think about the habitual offender statute is as a tool like a ranch or hammer something prosecutors can pull out of their tool box when they need it but it's like do you tend to zero never puts this tool away it's always in his hand for every possible case\nThere's is mines that are the more before we lock up in the more time that we give people the more we want to stop the crime problem is fine as long as ... you know harsh sentences or under turns\nNew Orleans public defender Danny ... says Ken is there is office still uses the ritual offender statue all the time and that makes guilt or innocence almost irrelevant instead it's all about a defendant's past their record\nIt's the first thing you're looking at the start of every analysis of case every way you talk to your quiet as just started very way you talk to the prosecutor and to the judge it's even the considerations with the prosecutors making bail arguments or even from the moments of your arrested part of the core of the case\nI also spoke to senior judge weren't leans parish criminal court Arthur hunter it was the middle of summer when it was over a hundred degrees outside he wasn't wearing a judge's robe instead black polo shirt black pants given the heat I had to tease him about it was this little light black\nOr right this is the life life is a lot of heavy but\nHe said over his blaring air conditioner the judge's job is kind of like our rafts between the defense and the prosecution asked judge hunter what he thinks of\nThis law it's actually pose a problem with a function of a judge which is to fashion the senses that support is just simply for that particular person\nWhen district attorney's use that had the chill offender statute judges\nBecause when district attorney's use the habitual offender statute judges no longer decide how long a person will sit behind bars or under what conditions instead mandatory sentences kicking the judge has\nNo choice if I have someone with mental health issues or drug abuse issues I wanted\nTreatment aspect to conform to be part of the census with the ... on the twenty twenty five years that will be there no taxes think twenty twenty five thousand a year for someone just go away and said [noise]\nI also went to another city that's really comparable to New Orleans to find out what their da Da Nang demon it's away just up the Mississippi River the populations of east Baton Rouge parish and New Orleans or about the same and some of their demographics around half white half black\nTheir da ... is really comparable to for starters he's from New Orleans just like Leon cannons arrow\nI Lived in Chicago house or oh you did you ever talk so I'll be going on ... street\nHillary more attended a private Catholic high school which actually played sports again scan is there it was private Catholic highschool both are white men both have been da for a decade\nYou know for me I was with him as just another statutes another tool that we could possibly use\nDa Morsi's this law for when someone is really dangerous\nThe bottom line of everything there's public safety can you sort of certainly with no charm a Jew or does public safety really demand ...\nThe ten years he's been da ... office has used this law sixty six times now let's talk about what ...\nThis law sixty six times now let's talk about what da Kenneth Arrow does in New Orleans he wouldn't tell me but I got a hold of court data and the same ten years Ken is zero has used the same law more than two thousand six hundred times [laughter]\n[noise]\nI shared this number what the da and his spokesman denied it the da's office only started keeping data on habitual offender statue in twenty sixteen so I asked them to look at the core data I have\nI never heard back in an email the DEA spokesman said their office uses the law judiciously against people who quote resist rehabilitation and shoes instead to commit more so many crimes against more innocent victims [noise]\nThe reason these two da's act so different is because every da ... discretion to charge people the way they want to the bottom line is if prints have been prosecuted for drug possession in east Baton Rouge or almost anywhere else in Louisiana and he'd likely be home already\n[noise]\nFrom what you're saying it sounds like ... has the power to selectively enforce the law\nIn a way I mean do you do take an oath to uphold the law and Ken is there are always emphasizes this oh his duty not his discretion like here at this other city council meeting where he's defending how he prosecutes marijuana crimes\nI'd be remiss if I had what I consider to be profitable case and simply said I'm not going to prosecute is because I just don't agree with the law\nThat's really not my called that's where you guys do you make the decision whether or not that should be the law or not and if if it is the law I think I ever responsibility to prosecute\nThe law I think I ever responsibility to prosecute it if the facts in fact support that\nIn other words I don't make the laws adjust enforce them or as we sing and New Orleans [noise]\n\n\nKennedy arose line is I'm just doing my job why is he doing his job so differently than any other da in Louisiana\nBecause the New Orleans when it comes to the habitual offender statute that's how it's done and\nThis man just hearing from a very squeaky chair can explain why my name is Ken Israel's than I\n... I call a criminal law specialist and I heard that really you go by Becky\nMay be a Jew gee we're big you would do a ... a ...\nYou know this is monitored them among war room [laughter]\nIt's next to his kitchen and full of paper stuck by his computer taped to the walls this is where biggie works he's been studying the law for decades and back in the seventies he saw this law which had been around for a really long time basically come back from the dead\n... calls the law the multiple bell which is one of its many names\nNobody was doing this but when Harry can it can do all those\nWho wait wait wait wait wait a minute to the ... he was just a hairy comic the jazz singer\nNo that's a junior [noise]\nThis was his dad Harry ... senior\nTo show is tough on this issue of society that he's going to put people in jail for the rest of the day that\nKind of was the da of New Orleans for Thirty years and kind of a tough on crime trailblazer he first ran in Nineteen Seventy three and promised to use the habitual offender statue much more aggressively here's one of his newspaper ads\nAs district attorney Eric comic punch to use the powers was offered to help her image or your system but time and time again returns habitual offenders to continue their uninhibited crimes against decency this [noise]\nThis was the Nineteen seventies and crime is urging all over the country people were scared\nSounds like kinda played on that for you so he brought this law back from when ... when does it start\nWell the first mentioned I found in Louisiana is from Eighteen thirty three\nIf any person shot a third ... be convicted of any right to be shall be considered as on its own society\nAnd be imprisoned that hobby labor for live\nThrough this whole story I I've been thinking about how race is connected to all of this and and that line unfit for society I mean it it just sounds like something right out of the races handbook right\nYeah I I talked to a historian about that John ... studies the history of incarceration in Louisiana at Tulane University\nI think the fact that ... center last really came in their own as part of this intensely racialized mass incarceration undoubtedly speaks to the ... the conflict as scary African American that\nThe kind of man who can never be rehabilitated an penitentiary\nAnd for people who couldn't be\nAnd then the penitentiary and for people who couldn't be transformed it it would become a place for storage for forced labor force labor wow\nNone it's behind the scenes part of verbal ... between prosecutors and defense attorneys\nAnd remember in these cases the d._a. never officially charges the habitual offender statute his prosecutors just say they will if the defendant doesn't plead guilty so all traces of the law just disappear\nSo we don't even know how many people were talking about here\nRight we know Ken is there a used a lot in over two thousand six hundred cases\nTalking about here right we know Ken is there a used a lot in over two thousand six hundred cases but that number is just the tip of the iceberg [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nOf course Ken is there refused to be interviewed for this story\nWhich is frustrating because he's an elected official\nBut he did offer a statement about princes case\nHere a few parts that stood out to me Mr Albert voluntarily entered into a ... agreement and received a legal sense under Louisiana law if he believed himself not guilty he could've exercised his constitutional right to stand trial then Kennedy said\nMy hope is that Mr Albert will apply himself toward programs by which to better himself and eradicate his substance abuse issues while in prison\n\nAfter I requested to interview ... he was moved from one jail to another to begin a drug program I asked him if this was the first time in his seven years locked up that he'd been in a program to treat addiction our connection was in great\n[noise] when did you do the first one [noise]\nTo loom a that was like six years into your sentence [noise]\n\nFriends said it took awhile for him to enter a program because they didn't really have programs [noise]\n\nJust wasting time sitting in one dormitory with a hundred and twenty people doing nothing\nAnd seven years he's got three to go has anything changed for you\nThe same\nGo has anything changed for you\nA lot of strange must love or money is being away from those of you drink moon retrieved or were you all remember we've been\nOne of them are too many of them were you know ...\nA few times now prince has asked me to give a message to his oldest son prince junior these jobs are expensive and his son can't always afford them anyway prince asks me to tell us on he misses him and then he says tell him I Love him and I do [noise]\n\nThinks ...

us she had no idea she'd been purged although she didn't seem completely surprised she says she hasn't been a regular voter but she's thinking about turning out in November to support Stacey Abrams for governor always aware of the things that you back and Reverend ponders office angel it gives him the news about his aunt\nShe still lives within the county but she's been removed from the voter list and she had no idea\n... that's interesting is she was never notify or anything\nShe doesn't recall ever getting anything from election officials\n[noise] well I think we need to get down to the bottom of because if it happened to her\nTo bring them she she ... she says it just confirms his view that voter suppression is happening\nIt almost give people do the mindset that business is a privilege not a right and so now anything that has approved which has to get permission and so if you don't do our way we won't give you permission to use his privilege\nSays he'll take is on to re register\nWe will give you permission to use his privilege\nHe says he'll take is on to re register so she can vote in the governor's race [noise]\n\n\nWe analyze all the people purged in Georgia just last year and we found that about a hundred thousand vermouth for not voting and not responding to notices\nNow we don't know how it breaks down by race\nBut if you add in other obstacles like a voter id law enclosed polling places all this could tip a close race for governor when it comes to the purges Stacey Abrams and other Democrats said there's this illusion\nLet people register all the way to election day at least Seventeen states have same day registration but not in Georgia Brian Kemp opposes it and same with other Republicans\nIn states where you have the same day registration it leads to irrational voting Brian Robinson is a Republican strategist I meet him in the marble halls of Georgia State house\nBrands he's voting as a write in to privilege so he disagrees with Reverend ponder who says voting is outright period Brian sings registering ahead of an election is important because it shows someone's educated and engaged enough to deserve to vote\nYou want people who have been following the election to some degree uh who knows what the issues are and what the candidates stand for I don't believe in the same day registration because I Do think is that a magistrate of headache because I Do think it distorts the electorate abet a John how does it distorted the electorate [noise]\nI don't know how you describe it frankly I'm at a loss on on that bought it\nFrankly I'm at a loss all all that but if you don't know an October the first so there's a presidential election or a gubernatorial election and uh the first two weeks of November you're not an informed voter\nBrian argues purging people for not voting isn't taking anything from them because they're not voters\nLike it if the presidential election and in fact two presidential elections don't get you out I don't know what is going to take to get you out and I don't care what color you are what your partisanship is I think that's fair standard\nBrian looks at the governor's race like this it's all about who shows up at the polls camp wins it the racial breakdown of voters days about where it's been in recent elections Abrams wins by getting more people of color to the polls\nBoth probably need to win over some voters who haven't made up their minds but finding those types of voters could be really tough\nYou have to polarized angry tribes going at each other you look at the falling today there's almost no one decided [noise]\n\nThat story from Johnny Kauffman of public radio station W. A. V. E. in as little poodle from a PM reports [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] when it comes to voting something else distinguishes Georgia from most other states it's voting machines are easy targets for computer hackers was what you were doing here even technically hacking\nI Would not counted as hacking or what was it then [noise] it was it was browsing the Web site that's coming\nIs hacking or what was it then [noise] it was it was browsing the Web site that's coming up next on reveal\n[noise] [noise]\n\nYeah\nThis is reveal uncanny you in our public radio ... things for spending some time with us this afternoon or bringing new great programs into the evening weekend all things considered is up next and then music till midnight\nYeah\nCan you win our get support from our town presenting complex in from ...\nThe innovative dance company reinvent the artist damp through a groundbreaking mix of style it's an art town experience it's tomorrow night at the pioneer center and tickets are available online at pioneer center dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nFrom the center for investigative reporting in P. R. X is is is revealed lets up till now we've been talking about all the barriers\nTo prevent people from stepping into a voting booth on election day like getting to the polling station in finding out your name is on the list [noise]\nBut even if you get into the booth your vote might not be properly counted [noise] Georgia is one of five states that rely solely\nOn touch screen voting machines with no paper audit trail cyber experts warned about these machines for years\nCyber experts have warned about these machines for years and recently so as President Trump\nOne of the things we're learning is it's always good it's old fashioned but it's always good to have a paper\nBackup system of voting it's called paper not\nHighly complex computers paper\nThere's a real cause for concern special counsel Robert Mueller has indicted twelve Russian agents for ... to target county Web sites in Georgia a lot of security experts are worried that when it comes to heckling Georgia is one of the most vulnerable states in the country but are the people in charge of election they're actually listen\nReveals by Duncan picks up the story [noise]\nYeah so uh right now I'm like in the machine in Logan lamb has a voting machine in his living room [noise] this is what one looks like on the inside so here's where the memory cards [noise]\nLogan is a cyber security researcher in Atlanta his specialty is finding new ways to break into wireless networks and new ways to keep the bad guys out\nThe touch screen voting machines he has is the kind Georgia uses edits polling places the machine it's bulky and book shaped with the big screen it looks kind of like a cross between a Nintendo and the Bible Logan boots it up\nSo it was actually touch ... glitter and then it's decompress being the image\nIs the one funny thing I've been wanting to do is pull off that full time at the beginning\nUse that as Irene came to this is a direct recording electronic machine or DRA it doesn't produce any sort of voter verified paper audit trail for Logan and other cyber security tightened that's a major red flag in fact\nFor Logan and other cybersecurity type that's a major red flag\nIn fact dear he's had been criticized by technologist basically since they were installed across the country in the early two thousand one alternative to these machines as paper ballots and in recent years more and more people are pushing to start using them again\nLike last march at a Senate intelligence committee hearing on election security Ron Wyden a Democrat from Oregon had some questions for homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nYou wanted to get her official position on electronic voting machines\nAnd I'd like to get your views for the record\nOf whether you believe the continued use of paperless voting machines in this country threatens our national security and the department is now prepared to recommend paper ballots\nAnd so Yes sir if there is no way to audit the election that is absolutely a national security concern why didn't look satisfied and you now told us that the status quo is a national security threat\nHe studies the arteries and their vulnerability that says the problem with George's system is that unlike a lot of other states it's all interconnected like a giant tree\nHe told me the secretary of state's office is the roots your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads\nSo really it can inject information or inject basically now we're a virus into any part of the tree the way it is set up is that that virus could get transmitted to every other part of the tree\nLong after Logan downloaded all that data a second time some election integrity groups filed a complaint against Brian Kemp for violating Georgians constitutional rights to have their ballots counted correctly\nThey asked Georgia to switch to paper ballots before the November midterms\nThere was a hearing in September in federal court in Atlanta it was grueling took all day you at cyber experts on one side explaining why Georgia's system is so vulnerable one of them even hacked a voting machine right there in the courtroom\nOn the other side were ... people\nMachine right there in the courtroom\nOn the other side we're camps people telling the cyber experts hey you don't understand how Georgia system works a few days after the hearing\nA federal judge deciding again adopting paper ballots over electronic wind for the midterm elections\nJudge any Totenberg filed an order in favor of Brian ... she wrote that switching to paper ballots just weeks before an election would create total chaos but she also spent dozens and dozens of pages validating the testimony of cyber experts and scolding the state\nI'm going to read just a little bit from the order\nQuote the court is gravely concerned about the state's pace in responding to the serious vulnerabilities of its voting system by the way throughout the hearing camps team tried to paint the cyber experts as out of state elites judge Totenberg was having none of that\nPacking she wrote is here to stay and quote defendants will failed to address that reality if they'd demean as paranoia the research based findings of national\nCyber security engineers an expert [noise] so that's where we are Georgia's barreling towards mid terms with the vulnerable systems and machines but very few people trust Kennesaw state is no longer handling elections now the secretary of state's office does\nThe people I talked to say that change won't really make much of a difference they say if a hacker\nGot the info Logan got back in twenty sixteen they could still use it to disenfranchise voters in twenty eight teams and it's worth noting here just how much judge Totenberg is ruined resembles the logic Kennesaw state right after Logan first email that we know are elections are vulnerable but we can't fix them because the elections are so soon\nBefore Logan I parted ways I asked him a question let me ask you this how sure are you that somebody didn't beat you\nI asked him a question let me ask you this how sure are you that somebody didn't beat you to this [laughter] uh there's there's not really a way of knowing at this point huh I mean still to this day I'm very concerned [noise]\nReveals by don't get brought us that story\n\nEarlier this year Brian Kemp said was to commission that'll look at options for policing the curb voting system by twenty twenty oh in the other four states heading into the midterms they used to touch screen machines with no paper audit trail or New Jersey Delaware South Carolina in Louisiana [noise]\n\n\n\nFear of voter fraud is driving a lot of efforts to restrict access to voting around the country but where is that fear coming from that's next on reveal from the center for investigative reporting and tea or\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to reveal on K U when our public radio and we need your help we remember

R. dot org and one schedule that pick up when it works best for you thanks for considering a donation to the nonprofit station can you went on [noise]\n\n\nFrom the center for investigative reporting in P. R. ... this is reveal a mail it today we've been talking about voter suppression in fear of voter fraud\nPeople are worried about it in part because of what President Trump has been seeing\nIn many places like California the same person votes many times you probably heard about that they always like to say oh that's a conspiracy if they're not a conspiracy theorist Alex millions and millions of people lose claims\nHave been totally the bar but one of the people who got those theories going was a Kansas lawyer who's waged a long running campaign against what he calls voter fraud his name is Kris Kobach he's the Kansas secretary of state\nAnd while that's typically a pretty sleepy office he's a household name in his home state even used to have a weekly radio show\nThe the ACLU worst nightmare\n'cause he knows the constitution terrified to keep them from making trouble for any of it is Kris\nKobach spin a loyal Trump supporter from the beginning Trump appointed him to run his so called election integrity commission it was disbanded less than a year after it was started without accomplishing anything Peggy Lowe of Casey you are in Kansas City has been covering Kobach for years\nThey pay half so Kobach is from a small state population wise but\nHey yeah so Kobach is from a small state population was but he has this big national profile in conservative circles how did that happen\nSo Kobach is a longtime anti immigration crusader he drafted in Arizona law that basically gave law enforcement a lot more authority to stop people in question them about their immigration status it was called the papers please law that's dating back to about twenty ten\nAnd since then he's been aligned with white nationalist groups who backed that effort and that's when he got on the radar of the Southern Poverty Law Center who now calls Kobach the lawyer for America's native his movement\nSince then his anti immigration crusade has morphed into this campaign against what he calls massive voter fraud Kobach claims that illegal aliens that's a term he loves to use our voting in great numbers and this fraud could be swinging elections\nBut way we know that that is not true\nThat is right now I could through a bunch of little zeroes in percentages at you here but\nAccording to the Brennan Center for justice it would be harder for an American to be struck by lightning than to impersonate another voter but that doesn't stop Kobach he's a leader in the fight against this well it's a major problem\n[noise]\nYou interview Kobach last summer what was the looking person\nYou know come what makes a really good politician he's good looking he's charming he's really articulate but as a reporter he is also just maddening he will tell you that even your question is inaccurate he will fight chew on every term and you guys have said it would be the failed her\nEvery term and he said it would be they use the\nLine as an actor and it's not off line than you will throw all these studies and statistics that you which many of these studies have been debunked by academics but he's still uses them\nIt's like talking to Kris Kobach is arguing with your high school debate coach\nYou know you're talking to a guy who really wants you to lose the argument\nAnd I think he's really respected in some circles because he has a very impressive resume he has degrees from Harvard Yale University of Oxford and then he also has this other big help it's a tool called the interstate cross check system\nIt's a massive voter tracking program under Kobach agreed to include more than half of the total voter registrations\nIn the U.S okay so how\nDoes this thing work so about two dozen states are enrolled in this cross check program it's free\nThey share information between states keeping the voter registration rolls clean states don't want these duplicate voter registrations and most often this happens when people move so out when you moved from Florida California\nDid you call the secretary of state in Florida\n[laughter] no I did not that's okay then because you actually weren't breaking the law here's a deal it's not illegal to be registered to vote in two states\nThat said it is illegal to vote in the same election into different stage so Kobach uses cross strict system to go after voter fraud\nThis is where ... signed in using cross check Kobach persuaded the Kansas Legislature to give him the power to prosecute these cases by himself so he\nGive him the power to prosecute these cases by himself so he doesn't have to turn them over to the attorney general's office like the way it's done and all these other states\nOkay so all of a sudden Kris Kobach has the power of a prosecutor what's he doing with it\nWell so far he's turned up nine cases of this alleged voter fraud he's prosecuted them as felonies and they mostly played it down to misdemeanors", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Reveal", "city": "Reno",

[noise] in Spanish I mean\nWhen I was at work I showed up at their offices again and again I\nMean the problem is I mean I've been to this office many times now in person and also called who is in the\nFinally I tracked down the assistant secretary of health Dr Concepcion can notice long ago\nWe meet in the hallway of the convention center where she's speaking at a press conference about a new lunch program and just like the doctor said she's quick to give me the government's official line ... that the crisis is over so far\nWe are not defecting new cases\nAh the guy on our faith epidemiology\nDon't expect\nTo have cases right\nI asked her why the health department had stopped testing pregnant women physique this is what every doctor I spoke to told me she says that's not true that the health department is performing the test and has been since just a few weeks after the hurricane\nThey're ... we tried to make sure ah samples collected all over the line where ... percent but I Love ... in the department of health and went with people and\nLevel that thirty in the mental health on one with the people on this uh\nTo the CDC not what I thought he seen the states because our love what I thought ... was damaged\nI checked with the CDC and they told me that never happened the health department never since ... samples to Atlanta for analysis but doctor can notice is adamant that the testing is back on\nWhere I'm not going to get on the ... female there's little follow up on the couple of things um first of the testing of pregnant women the OBGYNs that I was talking with\nThey didn't seem to think they had a clear mandate from the health department to be testing or that there was a way to get those test results back\nThen Monday ... she blames the doctors for dropping the ball they're stationed in rabbit offices um we don't have that close contact with them to make sure they do did they think they should um\nDon't you know and it's also tells me that women tend to be tested but I find out later that testing is no longer free women now have to pay one hundred dollars and the other thing is last year the government said the crisis was over so why would a woman even ask for the test\n\nAnd then I asked for something else when we'll all that data on developmental delays in ... babies be released\nI think uh there will be some information released\nThis is the kind of answer I get from doctor to known as an almost everything we talk about she's hard to pin down and by the end of the conversation\nShe is hard to pin down and by the end of the conversation she tells me that she needs to get permission from her boss but health secretary before she can share any more details\nIt's not that I can talk to anybody openly without being authorized because we want to have\nThe correct message\n\nAfter we part ways I'm left standing in that convention center hallway and starts to become clear to me is that the health department doesn't want to talk about the ... with me or even their own top secret doctors several doctors told me they stopped hearing from the health department altogether\n\n\nIn that silence doctors like Carmen ... and Cynthia Garcia started wondering why why was it so important for the government to make the you could go away ... Cynthia says they think it comes down to money\nThere's no question you know that the guy that make the notion of having a guy by the end my care effect that all of us in terms of tourism\nTourism it's the lifeblood of the island I reach out to the Puerto Rico tourism association and talk to the organizations president and CEO Clarissa Jimenez about how much ... affected the island\nIt was a huge in fact\nThere is the remembers when the CDC first issued warnings about the ... in Puerto Rico into thousands sixteen\nThe numbers they weren't even were really really high and scary and we had lots of cancellations and you know there was a perception that you would that here and you would get the virus thing because that was what was portrayed you know those who\nThat was what was portrayed you know those huge percentages of the organization and getting the virus\nTourists stayed away and the island lost one hundred million dollars and that she says shouldn't have happened\nA long run I say so the reality is that a lot of hype was created\nAfter Hurricane Maria the government wanted to build back the tourism economy as quickly as possible and doctors I talked with believed that meant getting rid of the ...\n...\nNo the league it is still in rent so she's found a way to restart testing of pregnant women\nFor ... and I feel this is so important to be able to identify because most of their patients who have seek out do not have any symptoms ... and they have said that they might be at risk for these things and\nCarmen did an end run around Puerto Rico's health department she teamed up with the CDC to provide free testing for pregnant women it's the only program like it on the island\nSo many south where I think I think today and you have written\nOn the first day back in the spring eight women had their blood drawn including Melissa it's always been a concern\nBecause I think people sick with these guys\nDid you know when the hurricane started that you are right now I found out I was struggling with this why now but stunned\nCall Maria calling his name [laughter]\nThat that I think that's name Lindsay eliminated from their birth\nThat I think that's name Lindsay eliminated from their birth rate you know while here [laughter] in\nThe new testing continued through the summer and it's still going today doctors say the first results are in and even though it's a small sample there alarming nine percent of women are testing positive and that's almost with the rate was at the height of the epidemic\nOn this time the semi researcher I'm not running for anybody because we'll see Sean therefore I kind of an eye on any day Wendy evidence dance me to say no\nAnd the evidence is telling Carmen ... is a very real danger today for pregnant women and babies in Puerto Rico around twenty six thousand women will give birth this year so far fewer than three hundred have been tested for the ...\nI'd be no situation for [noise] when I'm thirty six years and I've been blessed are being\n... for the birth of so many babies and I got to tell you that the first thing I Will might ask my baby I think he's a each ... said we need to do it and we need to the right thing\nAnd [noise] and\nThat story was from best Murphy of the ground truth project she's the director of films there and also has a short film coming out and about the story and we check with the CDC about seeking Puerto Rico\nOne of the epidemiology told us that the risk of getting the good now is less than during the upbringing a couple of years ago but the virus will always be that people need to protect themselves from mosquitoes and sexual transmission to avoid getting infected\nPeople need to protect themselves from mosquitoes and sexual transmission to avoid getting infected by\n...

us from rejecting someone just because they have a section ... voucher is considered discrimination and it's illegal\nIt's also a legal and a handful of states including Massachusetts Oregon in New Jersey [noise]\nA few years ago Austin, Texas passed an ordinance like this but a few months later the state legislature overturned it and lawmakers went even further they ban any other city in Texas from doing the same thing\nBasically Texas landlords are allowed to discriminate against people with section ... vouchers and they can be punished for it [noise]\nIn Texas was one of the first states in the country to pass a law like this and twenty Fifteen Indiana did to the same year the needs to know about the law when she moved here\nDoes your daughter the she understand that some people don't

this is Stacey hunt he's on the board of the Houston apartment association and he supports that Texas law that less landlords they noticed section eight after it passed housing advocacy group sued they said this is racial discrimination in disguise my colleague Edgar Walters interviewed Stacy ... earlier this year and brought this up\nThere have been all these lawsuits have alleging that discrimination against voucher holders what do you say to that\nOr an disagree with that but I think the the the voucher users in many situations you know they choose to live where their support group for their families were transportation where the job is\nWe spoke to more than a dozen Dr holders and none of them told us that Andrew told Stacey ... about Denise\nShould just heard from dozens and dozens of landlords you know like sorry we just don't accept section eight is discrimination or ... or stereotyping at least part of what's at issue\nThe books it's reflective of because everyone has to deal with view very stringent fair housing requirements all across this country\nStacey told Edgar there are plenty of legitimate reasons Texas landlords don't take vouchers the section eight program is run by government agencies that don't have enough staff and they are known to cut checks late Stacy says this can hurt a landlords bottom line and they shouldn't be forced to deal with it but he did have a suggestion for Denise\n... through for this lady or would have ... to ... to people in this course\nNest quest we'd\nHeard that name a lot during our reporting the bureaucracy

willing to fit the bill for any damage it\nWhen Isabelle took this job that's caused title one point two million dollar grant to spend\nThe goal helps three hundred and fifty families with children moved to neighborhoods with top rated schools\nI was extremely optimistic easy like I don't see anybody saying no today and the first time we actually had his heart talking to landlords and was honestly it was really discouraging does\nThe fact that under less close that landlords have very little financial risk and yet there's still so cautious of the program does that suggest that there's that there's still a lot of discrimination going on\nThat's exactly what that suggests and I hate to say that but it I mean it is a reality of what it is right now I'm ... they have this guarantee\nThat everything will work like that everything's going to take get taken care of and it's still that hesitation that I don't want to work with someone who's on section ...\nAs the mid
