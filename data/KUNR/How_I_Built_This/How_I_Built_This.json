didn't even know what that was called is called the vertical cutter mixture I learned and\nAnd then that led to some guy that had a piece of manufacturing equipment that low and behold was the exact thing that I needed that the the ... and that's how it all kind of piece together yeah\nAnd and by the way you could raise some money now and raise the name of it and read any okay I wrote a story I wrote a business plan my dad helped me write a business plan I had a few friends and family interested and\nI was going to launch in fall of two thousand two and that got delayed until April of two thousand three and during that time all of my interested friends and family\nBacked up they because they got called the face it was yeah it was just getting to late so would you do\nWell I had to had

much money did you decide that you needed to raise\nI think we came up to the amount because I had to print packaging\nI think we came up with the amount because I had to print packaging and we had five flavors that I was watching\nWith and there was a minimum print run of all of those and I actually printed\nI'm at this company in Minnesota and I remember it costing somewhere around ... you know a hundred a hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nBut how did you then find the stores to to buy and then ...\nWell let me let me backtrack to where it when I was working at whole foods before he

stony field are almost broke their basically running on fumes and they're trying to bring in more money by just finding a few more stores to sell their yogurt\nIn those days is a whole foods didn't exist yet but the holy grail for natural products was a little three store chain called bread and circus which eventually became part of hope and they had one store in Cambridge and prospects drink and you know we were selling now to Jim Lewis market basket just as now I'm Talking July of eighty four\nAnd um and we were desperately trying to get down there because we knew that if we could crack bread and circus every other little natural foods co up in New England would then take us in\nAnd we kept going down there and and they said no no no we've already got you know a hippie yogurt made by somebody in Vermont to in their TPP with their wet go you know they didn't need another you know organic yogurt from some crazy people in the hamster [laughter] ... what you guys do\nSo in July of eighty four I had my thirtieth birthday at the farm and my I had\nOld ultimate Frisbee team um come up to visit me most of whom lived in Cambridge as you might imagine and um I said look it's wonderful you've outcome if you want to give me a really good birthday present\nI said look it's wonderful you've outcome if you want to give me a really good birthday present good under bread and circus I'm prospects in Cambridge and asked\nFor my yoga that was on a Sunday on Wednesday Mary Carol Skinner the buyer bread and circus called and said Garry I don't know what's going on but demand is suddenly gone through the roof\nWere getting all kinds of requests for yoga get it when when you can you get it in there well I got in my car and I made the first delivered that afternoon [noise] um about a month later we were her number one selling yogurt\nOr she took us in the other two bread and circuses and off we went but it was my Frisbee team I mean you know that's what it takes I you know I always say we can ship the yogurt three thousand miles his last Eighteen Inches that makes all the difference to get people's mouths and then they're going to ask\nFor an end run around the time you\nMeet Meg he would become your wife right\nYeah so a month after that fateful meeting with bread and circus we had our summer no ... in northeastern farming association covers and I I as it turned out I was the keynote speaker and uh right after I finished my speech this very adorable\nOr organic farmer from New Jersey who is running her own nonprofit farm down there I waited patiently to ask me a question well that turned out to be what is now my thirty one year wife Meg and her mom had been the deputy commissioner of agriculture for New York state\nSo she had a kind of an ag orientation um\nAt one point she kind of whisper to me that she'd be okay with a if I needed some money with lending me some well of course that needed money so she loaned us a fifty thousand dollars huh\nI started raising and I I got to a ...\nFifty thousand dollars [laughter] I started raising and I got to about two Seventy five three hundred ...\nA sort of a month or so later she said well I think we can increase so she increase to a hundred and eventually I got across the finish line got the five hundred ... you know venture capitalists are the reason they want\nWhat they called F enough money first friends and family money mhm as 'cause they know that you might as an entrepreneur if things get rough you you might just get up and walk away if it's you know some Harvard MBA with with with a tie\nBut if it's your mother's money huh yeah yeah and so we worked for our moms which must have been pretty stressful\nOh yeah you know what happened in this farmhouse I always had payroll on Thursday mornings\nAt and but at this point it was a half a million dollar business and I never had cash in the bank that night before payroll never just this is became our way of life and so uh thinking Meg was a sleep in our bedroom\nWhich was about fifty feet from my office I Would on many occasions tip toe over\nTo the office to call my mother in law to have a chance to see if I could borrow another thirty five hundred and\nTwenty five hundred to make ends meet and eventually make got onto this and one night I heard the click click a call waiting on my mother in law is on and make was calling from the house to say mom don't do this what your wife was telling her mom not to lend you money for the business right because right well because she didn't have\nConfidence and then they were looking she's living in a nightmare me she saw\nHow crazy it was I mean we had chimney fires we had the well pump would go out that\nThe power would I mean we are on the hilltop farm a long way from anywhere was makes\nThe power would I mean we are on the hilltop farm a long way\nFrom anywhere was make ... percent ditch this thing that's bag it I mean or or did she gives it sounds like maybe she didn't believe in it well she had no reason to believe in it it was insane but why did you believe in did you think that means you are you are what two three years into this thing\nAnd it not only are you making money you are in that big that big time\nYeah [noise] well I'll say this I'm Meg or you know fortunately loved me even more fortunately probably love the yogurt and we're nowhere else to go [noise]\n\nYou know she had given up her job down on her farm in New Jersey and signed on to this crazy them enterprise but here's where the story if I Know that you think it couldn't get worse but\nAs as a Lily Tomlin says it ... it ... it it got a lot worse before it got worse okay what happened what happened well so now I'm going to jump a year and a half\nWe've now expanded the plant were buying milk from ten or twelve farms wow and we have maxed out this little farm there is no you cannot squeeze another drop of yogurt out of this place\nSo presumably you are looking to to work with another factory\nRight so spring of eighty six we are out of capacity we contracted with a little dairy in western Massachusetts Greenfield mass we were desperate we did not do any of this financial due diligence one would normally do what happen for us was\nTheir bank went in and put 'em in the chapter seven padlocked to play locked it up wait a minute your production comes to a halt I
