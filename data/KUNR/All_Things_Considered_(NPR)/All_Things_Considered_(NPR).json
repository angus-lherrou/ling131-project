going to start the program with Pittsburgh Mayor Bill but you know Mr Mann thank you so much for talking with us\nIt's my pleasure and of course I Want to offer my deepest condolences to you and to members of the city and the community and you've just last eleven people and how are you holding up and how is the city holding up\nUm it's difficult uh our hearts are broken collectively in Pittsburgh is a community is small a Pittsburgh is a small city and what happens to one part of it affects all of us\nWe'd ask the number of people to describe this community to us and I'm like you to describe it to us what is what a squirrel hill all about\nWell it's um I live five blocks from where are the event took place um it's the most diverse neighborhood and all of western Pennsylvania and it's I'm a very tight knit community that is the historic\nA base of Pittsburgh's Jewish community for over one hundred years\nUnfortunately um events like this are no longer rare in American Life and I wondered when you have seen other communities face something like that\nYou have seen other communities face something like this\nHas it been running through your mind like what would I Do in the situation I mean as you first got the call this the first calls were coming into this with this event is taking place I find myself wondering like what were you thinking and how'd you how'd you thought to yourself who I think that you would have to face something like that\nSo I have a um strategy with my chief of staff on weekends or if he calls I I'm may not pick up on the first time but if he ever calls back\nTwo times all know that it is something that is a crisis it was the first time he's ever had to do that\nAnd during that period I realized that something was very very wrong\nOf within five minutes he was at my house and\nWe were on the scene I'm within five minutes of that so I'm looking at different cities of course there's always tried to learn from other cities and uh one of the examples and I\nHad the opportunity to talk to them era Walsh today was Boston in the Boston Marathon and I'm trying to realize how to get not only the strategy of the police in public safety but also communications\nAnd you know obviously this is early days and you're still dealing with the immediate aftermath and there are many there were going to be some really difficult\n[noise]

I I was just\n... and I heard you read into an aunt who was visiting with her niece and they also had a personal connection to the area\nThat's right I talked to Lisa flesh or Jackson enter nice Eli Fleischer who's sixteen uh Lisa has a lot of friends and family and has for many years around the neighborhood of the synagogue and she spent a lot of time there as a child\nI don't even know what to think I mean I this is my grandmother's backyard my grandmother is no longer with us but I mean I I spend a lot of time in a synagogue this is where I went through my family belong [noise] I'm just I'm horrified\nAnd I hope that we could make some some changes it's not just an attack on the Jewish people but it's an attack on\nOn everybody in his community and recover strong and we're going to make it through\nAnd I said she was with her niece who's sixteen Eli they both you know this has many generations with his family have ties to this neighborhood they brought up\nBut the family have ties to this neighborhood they brought a bouquet of flowers to lay down at one of the memorials\nWell I wouldn't have\nHad tree of life so I Know a lot of people there and I feel like it's only right to show up and give support to the families that were\nSo what did they make of all of this and the fact that this has been called a hate crime\nOh I just heard so much sadness so much shock as you always hear in these situations and and we said the the aunt\nShe mentioned President Trump's rhetoric she she feels that he's partly responsible for sort of heated political climate in the country and rising anti Semitism that's been reported she also expressed a lot of frustration with violence and with the nation's gun laws\nI think it's not about being definitely need to have ... so we definitely don't need to have you know security guard at our schools at our temples at our church is\nShouldn't have to I mean some are we supposed to go like everyone's saying how you know thoughts and prayers ought to this but where we go to press on even safe so how are we supposed to do that that's the main question I think here in Reno\nWelfare you've also been getting reaction from other places in the city today and so we're going to hear more from you later in the program so thanks so much\nYeah thanks taxing and ...\nPittsburgh faith communities took time during worship services today to acknowledge the tragedy at the tree of life synagogue the ... United Methodist church across town open their Sunday services to an interfaith group of worshipers\nAnd the church sanctuary there were eleven white roses displayed at the front one for each of the people killed in yesterday's attack and during the service each name was read out loud and candles were let in their memory a pastor Russell should show Lugar said he that he held a ...\nMemory a pastor wrestle ... said he that he held a special service to show his congregation support for the Jewish community and their time of need\nOur intent was to express our solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters are ... those who were killed ah to offer prayers\nUm but as I mentioned in my my sermons also find our voice\nYou know we often say that we offer our prayers and thoughts and that is funny but we must do more\nWe must put those prayers into action we must give them all age and with our boys and with our actions we can ensure that this hatred is not the new American way you can not be\nDo you have a sense that there are some people who might have been afraid to come out today I guess yeah\nBecause we are and open and affirming congregation um some people are afraid to put to target on her back on\nMy open and affirming you mean that everything every once in a while because everyone is welcome is actually right everyone is welcome and and normally welcome but to be celebrated what was the attendance like today was it more than you expected we had a couple of\nAh folks from the Jewish community come at the beginning and to offer their words of Thanksgiving they did not state to worship but they did come and to say thank you for doing this you know it makes a difference\nI think if I ask you don't seem rattled by this maybe you are on the inside but you know this community is not that far from here and I didn't have to wonder you I mean you hear you\nDaughter my youngest daughter carried into for roses in on\nPolice officers that were injured her husband is a police officer and ...\nRendered her husband is a police officer and was directly involved in yesterday's events because he was a police officer in white whole nuts were the ... a perpetrator lives so it was very frightening pros personally um\nBut I I Try to uh luggage the urge\nTo give me the ... that I Need\nI I Do not fear for myself I guess if I'm honest I fear for my my children my grandchildren\nBut yet I can allow hatred to intimidate me ...\nWe also met lore has she is the nursery attendant at the church responsible for caring for the congregations littlest members during worship and for her yesterday as a tax on the synagogue where a baby naming ceremony was beef was being held in the presence of children hit very close to home\nWell this church has recently kind of been coming up with plans what to do in case of a situation like that of course is the nursery attendant that has always been something that's been on my mind to start here because I'm responsible for\nEight or nine children at a time and how I Would evacuating from the building or hide them in a situation if it were to come down to it\nSo I was running through my head penance plans that I've come up for\nYears really and is that what occurred to you yesterday when you heard about what happened where you thinking okay what would I Do in that situation\nI grew up post Columbine so as a child um even in first grade we had drills even back then of what to do if there was an active shooter in the school and my whole life I grew up in public school constantly hearing about stuff like that Sandy Hook happened when I was in high school or things like\nDuring about stuff like that tiny how it happened when I was in high school or things like that just always kind of was in the back of my mind is kind of a shadow that I guess a lot of American Kids are growing up with these days\nI don't know whether to be happy or sad you know that you have that somehow it hurts me to think that you have to think about that instead of thinking about what's fun games to play\nYeah it's not it's not a plan anyone wants to have but it's become a reality that you to be in that situation not have thought of something or to be in that situation and to have you know you you are the last protection for those children and that's what you have to be thinking about\nWe also met a father and son Otis and Matthew ... who were in attendance at the special services today an owner said his own life experiences allow him to feel empathy for Pittsburgh Jewish community\nAnd African American ... we know about how these things are there is the wrong people reserve neighborhoods or people to look at your front of\nA thermometer field are you should be there because a year off of your color\nMassey what about you I get the sense that just resonated with you even though it wasn't this particular attack was directed at\nYou and I just can you just described why that is\nI remember I was looking at the news was yesterday and I thought about reminder says I'm gay and Orlando resonated with me\nI'm also walk in the south Carolina she resident in me because it was people who are religious and they got killed because their their religious and this residents with me because it's it's ... American right to worship\nHow we want to worship when we want to worship in peace\nWant to worship when we want to worship in peace and for someone to come in and just murder them for for ... for loving the same God that they love is is it's just unbelievable to me\nIt helped being here today to helping in China Today so\nWe're altogether morning and it really allowed me to lift up my English and say you know just put it on God's hands\nAnd it gave me hope because as pastor Russell was speaking the sunshine started the shining it's been cloudy all day in Pittsburgh the sun was shining and I I felt like that was God's telling me that you know\nDetails on line at U.

E. S. A. in Pittsburgh and not far from here thousands are gathering to remember the eleventh people who are shot to death at a local synagogue\nThe Jewish community center is leading the community gathering held at soldiers and sailors memorial hall and open Pennsylvania\nFaith leaders and politicians from ... from throughout Pennsylvania and beyond have gathered in a packed auditorium NPR's Quil Lawrence has outside of the community service now and he's been talking to members of the Pittsburgh community all day will welcome thank you so much for talking to us\nThank you it sounds like a huge gathering there today what is it like at this event\nYeah there's a beautiful hall and saw the auditorium and in the backdrop is ... Abraham Lincoln's entire Gettysburg Address\nUm I just stepped away at the beginning there was a a Baptist choir and African American Baptist choir singing I mean this is an event hosted by the Jewish community but it was a clear symbol of the of the whole Pittsburgh community standing in solidarity and the music was beautiful and ...\nWhole Pittsburgh community standing in solidarity and the music was beautiful and really soothing to many in the crowd there were people weeping including reporters\nUm I'd say they're maybe three thousand people inside and as I left to come out and speak with you I had to pass through another three thousand people sitting outside in what's now very chilly rain listening to the same service over over speakers\n... sounds lovely now um you also spent some time uh in squirrel hill the neighborhood with this attack occurred what was the mood there [noise]\nYeah I mean people were out and scroll hill trying to kind of have their normal life in a way of farmers markets are people going to Sunday services and you can see the diversity of the communities notably Jewish but it's really a bit of everything\nThey were trying to be normal but they're also trying to explain this I spoke to a woman coming out of the sixth president Presbyterian Church Brittany story and she's in eighth grade English teacher she just friday took her students to the Holocaust museum in Washington DC here's what she said\nI came today that\nWaiting patients and now I say I think I'm going to let them read articles on these articles that I Want to sit and talk of the class and just giving them a space a process\nAnd what they thought they were really moved by family meant the Holocaust and weak\nAnd people were saying that you know in a little town like this you'd never think can happen but in today's America they realized it can happen anywhere\nAnd and to that point this is a a a a smallish city and the victims of the shooting were identified this morning and people are probably just finding out that they may known someone who was affected how are people absorbing this yeah it's another\nMine who was affected how are people absorbing this\nYeah it's another wave of shocked to hear the names I I rented to Dan Franco he's the he's the state represented Pennsylvania state representative from this district he went to Hebrew school at the tree of life when he was eleven years old and he knew a two the two brothers who were killed David in Cecil Rosenthal here's what he said\n[noise] and they were really special Sweden or who are known for many years and whenever I go to a tree of life for a bar mitzvah or a wedding or\nSome kind of occasions to them are always in the\nIn the sanctuary\nHe talked about you know centuries of anti Semitism but more recently an up tick of hate speech in this country\n... and now finally Quil what what is next what what are people saying is next\nI felt like people run this sorrow this sort of cycle of sorrow and then pride in the solidarity that community showing\nAnd then there's rage that a man could come here with an assault rifle and massacre eleven people in twenty minutes while they were praying most of these people were old enough to be grandparents but\nThe community is trying to take action they say they want to do something they said he talk about guns they talk about trying to tone down their rhetoric in this country and many of them talked about the upcoming elections in and wanting to be active\nThat is NPR's Quil Lawrence ... thank you thank you and as you\nJust heard we've been talking quite a bit today about how people are mourning and how they're trying to make sense of this tragedy but it's not just adults who are trying to make sense of yesterday's shooting and tragedies like this\nThat are unfortunately all too common a lot of people are thinking about their children and how to talk to them about tragedies like this NPR's Sarah McCammon has been reporting on that story and she's back with\nLike this NPR's Sarah McCammon has been reporting on that story and she's back with us in Studio ... thanks so much for coming back and doing this sort of thing and I understand you're actually covered a lot of these shootings and this is something that is really on people's minds\nAnd fortunately I've covered several of these now and my career as a journalist and you know anytime there isn't a senseless act of violence especially especially these mass shootings it's it's hard to explain it to children especially for people in the area and the community affected\nAh it's impossible for kids not to hear about it right in the news and their their friends and neighbors are talking about it even if they're not directly involved in a tragedy I found a lot of people struggle with how to talk to their children how to explain things and not terrified them\nSo you do we mentioned earlier that you went to the synagogue neighborhood outside the synagogue you also when the other places tell us about that\nActually went over to the children's museum here in Pittsburgh it's a pretty famous really really great one actually and\nUh they have opened it up to the public for free this week Monday through friday or they want to place for families to to go and feel safe and comfortable they say\nAnd today was a pretty normal busy day at the museum and and uh staffers were thinking about ways to to reach out to families today too I met a woman named Jesse live and she was hanging out with her family and she said something I've been hearing repeatedly and talking to people in Pittsburgh today\nThat you hear it happening everywhere but you never really think it's happening here\nShe says she's not sure how to broach the subject with her two kids ages four and six we're from Canada so\nIt was very new to us living here for the last year or more prominently\nAlarming across the room at least\nAlarming across the room Alisa\nHoffman was also unsure what to tell her two kids ages six and three about what they're seeing in the news\nIt's hard to [noise]\nPut it into a contract where they understand um [noise]\nYou know so we haven't really talked about it yeah I have to think about how we well Hofmann\nGrew up in the Pittsburgh area and was back here to visit family and like so many here she has ties to the Senate\n[noise] a lot of my\nFriends had by bar mitzvah that tree of life I have\nAttendance Sunday school because my best friend growing up was Jewish and that's where she went so it's just really [noise]\nPricing upsetting disappointing that that\nPeople get these busting their head and and do it [noise]\nYou know and I think that they [noise]\nI think that they can't but they actually\nDevon ... runs the make shop a play and craft area for the kids she says the museum staff\nHas been grappling with how to help children and their parents during this scary time [noise]\nSo today it's hard to be at work\nKnow that we are the helpers here and we are the ones offering support for those families and children while we are also struggling with our own feeling but the way that I'm looking at it is\nYou know we are part of a community together as a tool and I'm being\nWith the community right now deals are important and powerful for me too\nFeels are important and powerful for me to still says today's plant originally focused on Halloween\nBut after the shooting she switched things up and encourage the kids to build models at houses and buildings and other familiar places they care about places that make Pittsburgh home Sarah McCammon NPR News Pittsburgh\n... thank you for that and finally today I reached out to an old friend to give us one more perspective on yesterday's shooting David trip and we used to work together in Washington DC now he is executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post Gazette\nHe lives just three blocks from the tree of life synagogue and he's published too powerful pieces one for his own paper and another for the New York times and he's with us now from his office at the ... and it's good to hear your voice\nThank you President Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and set the hatred must stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign of rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd here's our usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership or here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today I think the president has\nMore of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country and she's she's basically arguing that\nThe president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media uh\nAnd she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this is who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nReally seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the console learn cheap or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is or when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren\nWhere he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using this belittling nickname for her\nShe says oh God I Can't do it she doesn't have any Indian blood I Am more than she does that I have none\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling you must be without evidence in many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics argue is that going out to people so personally\nAnd not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the midterm what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\n... it's very hard to tell A People's views of Trump or as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so\nYou really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of course is that maybe some lukewarm vote supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents could get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White House

sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nAs well as an order from President Trump last week when he said the group of migrants from Central America moving toward that border poses a national security threat here's air force general ... who's in charge of northern command\nReno border security as national security and the U.S military will eventually be these capability to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom ... says something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border right is this fifty two hundred active duty on top of those exist in two thousand\nJust goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duties which was transportation aerial surveillance are kind of ...\nTroops are providing support duty such as transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing and the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities and these additional five thousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role again no law enforcement activity no interacting with migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first still they'll do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas ... a barrier is more razor wire fencing a crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agents used more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter there's also a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so\nThese soldiers were also builds camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all legal there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders and the U.S this is this is all legit\nAt well that that's what the officials say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties ah there were only to support role again and the policy come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen seventies and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used in former Confederate States in that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed well some of them will be armed\nMy grants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would be carrying arms or any others are we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay the precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty trips to the U.S Mexico border uh I don't recall the\nPresident for sending active duty troops have been some sit in the past and again in a support role\nIn this case uh you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot these troops who are doing everything again from constructing camps flying border patrol agents\nSo yet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks\nEven lawyers in public affairs staff and uh again general are shown as he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the same number of troops now in Iraq and right and maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside and again he said a border security is national security\n[noise] All right That's NPR's Tom Bowman getting us up to speed on the latest developments at the Pentagon thank you

about the problem that affects the state and who's area and and um the ball you can I ask\nRelationships like that or the benefit of incumbency most challengers have to convince voters that they'll

policymakers have been very successful in recent years the evidence lowest\nThe makers have been very successful in recent years the evidence low inflation and extremely low unemployment but the fed success has also undermine one of the basic theories that has relied on to understand the economy and how inflation and unemployment are related it's called the Phillips curve NPR's John Ydstie explains\nFor many years that Philips curve accurately predicted that when the unemployment rate was low inflation heated up but these days jobs are very plentiful yet inflation remains very low that's got some people writing the obituary for the Philips curve if you put it in a murder mystery\nFramework who killed the Philips curve it was the fed the kill themselves or\nSome Federal Reserve Schumer from James Bullard president of the St Louis Federal Reserve bank who we spoke to about a week ago and what was the murder weapon well Bullard says it was the feds long persistent focus on keeping inflation low and stable\nThe fed has been much more mindful about targeting inflation in the last Twenty years and because of that we have lower inflation more stable inflation and so there isn't much of a relationship anymore between labor market performance and inflation\n... says the Philips curve isn't working but rumors of its death maybe exaggerated\nIt certainly still invoked during the debates within the fed about whether to raise interest rates some policymakers argue that with unemployment so low right now the fed should be raising interest rates are much more rapidly to head off inflation\nFederal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is taking a gradual approach here he is earlier this\nKing a gradual approach here he is earlier this month in an interview on the PBS

see when they're looking at what\nThe filters curve could just be resting but with the help of his sleeping pill in the form of slow wage growth says former fed economist and going\nTo dismantle way in which low rates of unemployment lead to inflation is by increasing wages\nAnd wage growth in the U.S has been sluggish which is part of the reason inflation is staying low\nWhat is the Philips curve is dead or just resting its long slumber has been useful for the fed says on who's now a professor at Hamilton College\nUs economies extended period of stable inflation and falling unemployment has allowed the fed to raise interest rates gradually and to pause after every rate hike to see how the economy response Owen thinks fed officials are fine with that situation\nIf you ask the fed do you want low and stable inflation or do you want really rapid inflation because that would confirm your beliefs about how the economy works I have to believe that most of the people at the fed would

Washington\nAnd I'm Ari Shapiro hosting today from Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor the national unemployment rate is lower than it's been in half a century three point seven percent that's a huge turn around here in Michigan the rate was close to Fifteen Percent during the crash\nA decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy we wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their have through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant\nSo we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof it was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM's shut it down in two thousand ten it's odd standing here\nIt's emotional yeah I'm sure it is it's crazy what is the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear today\nA sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on a freeway on the way here and yeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed Don Skidmore was president of the local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a dark and scary and you know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody like losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and step son the has the each of them have taken since then reflect larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall\nA buyout [noise]\nNow at age sixty helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburbs beautiful here too yeah very elevated you rise a lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often\nAround the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry the days are over them good old days are over\n... between the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nI'm not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people and all these great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck workplace\nPolicies that eighty so you're good\nToday Don green is a nurse at an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scribes\nLittle bit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nThey after she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy\nAs auto industry jobs went away the health care field group and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really going to be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to dawn when the plant close did the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the upheaval that was going on in your professional life\nYeah I Would say because um I at that point was used to being independent used\nI at that point was used to being independent\nUsed to being able to ... to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that wasn't there anymore I felt like I had to depend on him I think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about her work family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet\nI'm not going to say that percentage of them\nIn and it gives me kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoy your life after that\nBut I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don green son Peyton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot Peyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift at willow run when he was Eighteen you have that job for about three years\nIt was like a tease really you know I feel I can kind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and doing all those you can just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired and just live a normal life but that was not the case\nBut that was not the case\nAs you say when it went down the drain a little bit\nPeyton has struggled since he left willow run he's been in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and came back he just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts there he's doing seasonal Halloween were\nThrows out running [laughter]\nThose are fireworks going off overhead at wired nights hair haunted thrilled Peyton runs around in a full body costume all night with seaweed dripping off a snack all to face [noise]\nSo a decade after the economic crash each of these three family members has a job they're all making less money than they did willow run\nAnd what about the plant itself it seems like a fantasy world or something in an area the current owners invited us to take a tour along with Don Skidmore who was one of the last people to leave when it closed down this is his first time inside the gate since that\nDay [noise] drove him six hurting freeway Lou entering\nOur tour guide is Jeff ... he's chief technical officer at the American Center for mobility the site formerly known as willow run is now a place where people test autonomous vehicles driverless cars Don Skidmore seems shaken revisiting has passed\nI don't know if you remember this this little circle Dr ... office buildings right there so we\nWe left that are like that\nWe left that\nWe liked the trees like the leaves on the street it's kinda cool kind of eerie and whoa [laughter]\nYou know I remember when it was real it's like two worlds overlapping past and present we pull up to what used to be the front entrance to the plant it's now cut off from the public Skidmore gets out of the car he stands on the ground where he used to lead union members picketing traffic jams fog in our in\nOur [laughter] now stars are driving by himself and crazy world\nA big sign like a billboard looms over his head the GM logo is long gone but on the cross bar underneath and faded black paint you can barely make out the ghost\nOf another logo United Auto workers and the name of the union chapter that Skidmore represented local seven thirty five\nThis is NPR News\nThe investigation continues into the suspicious

V. we've seen dramatic images of this caravan moving up through Mexico it's still hundreds of miles away so why are tensions rising now\nWill the fears really suppressing reality the size of the Honduran Caribbean has reportedly dropped by half from some seven thousand thirty five hundred now and expected to fall even more the farther north of gifts but that hasn't stopped all the overheated talk coming out of Washington\nLet me just to give you a flavor or listen to this exchange between Fox News anchor Martha ... column and homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen that was on TV last night\nIs there any scenario under which if people forced their way across the border they could be shot at\nWe do not have any intention right now to people and they will be apprehended however a ... officer an ancient cat at their own personal safety extraordinarily seriously they didn't have the ability of course to defend themselves\nJohn how is this intense rhetoric playing out at the U.S Mexico border\nSo today I spoke with the mayor of Columbus New Mexico a Sikh you'll cello cities right on the border across from Columbus Mexico he said an armed militia from Florida is already camped out west of town patrolling private range land he got a call from another militia\nWest of town patrolling private ranch land he got a call from another militia leaders from South Carolina earlier in the week he said quote if you need help with the illegals coming across you let me know and will be there the militia leader reportedly said if were fired on will shoot back solace told him I'm thanks but no thanks we're fine with the border patrol ...\nWe've heard about growing numbers of migrant families trying to cross the border and the caravan that we've been talking about is not even arrived jet or tell us about why the numbers are growing right now\nThere has been a record number of families with children turning themselves into federal agents either\nAt the ports of entry or shortly after crossing the border illegally the Trump Administration released numbers earlier this week and they really are startling in July agents arrested about Ninety two hundred family members traveling together in September that number sort of more than sixteen thousand apprehensions that's an eighty percent increase\nThat's a huge growth how our border agents handling that\nSo a border patrol agent in South Texas told me every day they're arresting four to five hundred immigrants just in his station mostly adults with small kids asking for asylum\nImmigration says their detention facilities are not big enough to handle these crowds so they have to release them with a notice to appear in the already back logged immigration court\nThis week immigration and Customs Enforcement put a new policy into effect ice will no longer help immigrants with travel arrangements to a destination in the interior\nAnd that leads thousands of families stranded in these border towns and the nonprofits that helped them are overwhelmed immigrant aid groups up and down the border overflowing summer paying thousands of dollars a night on motel rooms for immigrants with nowhere else to go critics claim the government is just dumping immigrants in the streets making the crisis\nThe government is just dumping immigrants in the streets making the crisis look worse [noise]\nPresident Trump says he has plans to deploy the military to the border to stop the caravan whenever it might arrived can you give us any more details about\nThat right the Pentagon said today defense secretary Jim Mattis plans to sign deployment orders this weekend for up to eight hundred active duty troops to be in place on the border by early next week\nThe White House has floated the idea of an executive order that would shut down the border to the Central American immigrants and denied them the ability to seek asylum that would be an extraordinary moved us recognizes the right of asylum in federal and international law\nBut we saw that this president attempted what he attempted with the travel ban and then he'll give his government emergency powers when he's worried about immigrants coming to our borders NPR's John Burnett speaking with us from Texas Thanks John\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nGood afternoon it's five forty four I'm Michelle Rivera with

became that thirty six said in a union\nThey became a traditional holiday and Eighteen Ninety One and an official state holiday a few decades later for many years the official celebration was held in Reno\nBut in Nineteen thirty eight a group of service organizations banded together to move the entire event to the state capital of Carson City where it's organizers were determined to keep it non political historical pageant in a series of speeches were held on the Capitol Grounds with one stipulation no one who is running for office was allowed to speak\nThat didn't stop candidates from appearing in the parade however and especially in election years writing the route has become a political mainstay providing candidates with a chance to connect with the public and enjoy some free media coverage\nAbout a week before election day guy farmer worked for and about his gaming control born in the mid sixties when he led to support to grant Sawyer who was campaigning for a third term

news we're talking here about sexual abuse we're finally starting to hear from women and some men who've experienced this far more rare though are stories from people who have witnessed sexual abuse and stayed silent about it\nDon ... was in high school when he attended a party\nAnd he says he saw a young woman being raped through a window that was in Nineteen sixty nine and over the Next Fifty years palm Marines says he didn't do anything about it but the guilt stayed with him and after talking to his wife and sons about it he decided to write about it for the Washington Post\nAnd Don ... is with us now from his home in the Pittsburgh area Mr primary thanks so much for talking with us thank you you wrote this piece after Christine Blasey Ford testify about what she says that now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both in high school is that what made you want to write this piece after all these years\nYes that's what motivated me I Want\nYou want to write this piece after all these years yes that's what motivated me I watched her testimony\nAnd I thought it was genuine you know I felt she was really telling the truth plus uh the things that she forgot wore the same things I forgot you know so I said well I'm going to just write something that my experience which was very similar I did something that I said in the article I committed a crime and I did\n[noise] you know what you wrote is hard to read and you know for some people it's gonna be hard to hear about this so this is where again I'm going to say that for some people if this is too much to listen to them you know take a minute and step away from it but I'm going to ask you to recount for me what it is that you said that you saw and you were at a party right\nYeah let me start by saying this was an unusual\nEvent for me because I never went to parties never and so I I don't even know why I went I I didn't know anybody that all of a sudden a kids came upstairs and said hey go outside and look through the basement window\nTo about ten of us went out there and I happened to be right in front of the window and I'm watching and as soon as I look through the window I see a a girl just lying on a sofa she looked like she was passed out\nAnd so the kid went down and he looks up to us any waves to us and he starts smiling and then he starts to take her genes off\nAnd then he he he took her panties off and then he he pulled on his pants and he went on top of her and as soon as he did that he was starting to have sex with her she kind of came to and started hitting him on the shoulders he jumped up right away\nAnd all of us at ... at that window was outside\nWe all just started\nAnd all of us at ... at that window was outside\nWe all just started to run\nYou also write that you and other boys with the party started touching another young woman who was\nAlso passed out on the on a bad but then you you left\nYet this was later maybe twenty minutes to thirty minutes\nLater a\nWas laying on the bed and uh what one kid was doing was when the lights were out everybody was touching her he would turn the lights on and everybody would pretend like they weren't touching her and they probably did this four or five times I touched her leg at one point and and that was all I did but uh it was enough\nYou know you wrote about why you think that the girls would never have said anything about this they would have been blamed and shame they would have been told it's your\nFault [noise] but you never said anything either why do you think that is\nA you know I I think I wanted to forget about it and plus later on it was just just plain guilty you when you're guilty about something and I was guilty and I admitted in in any article uh you you don't want to tell anyone\nOne of the things about your piece that I think struck a lot of us was that you said I wanted to tell the story because I Believe it's time for men to tell the truth about the ways they've abused women and what our role has been in creating a culture that tolerates this we've all seen things we've all heard other men talk and you wrote about a couple of examples where you just heard\nPeople say these crazy things and you know nobody did anything and why do you have a sense like why do you think that is that why do you think this has been tolerated so long I I\nI I don't know why we've kept quiet\nA quote from somebody some man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder\nThe man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder instead of admitting you committed a sexual assault\nAnd uh I I Can't say I don't I don't know I I I really don't know why men have been silent on this issue but I think men should be part of the me too movement I think we should come forward and uh talk about what we've seen what we've done I think that should be part of it [noise]\nHow did your family take it when you told them\n[noise] [noise] well [laughter] let let me tell you when I originally told my wife I told her just the rape part that I witnessed I did not tell her my\nParticipation she didn't know that for this article came out ... let me just say it's a it was tough for her to say let me tell you but everything's okay now everything's good and how did you explain that to your boys well\nJust I was truthful with them and uh they were very receptive on their dad you know that can you know we we kinda can't do too much wrong in the in the eyes of our kids\nAre they both told me that my two older boys they don't think it would happen now and he said everybody at that window would have had their phones al videotaping it that's what they told me\nBut that doesn't mean it wouldn't have had what are they saying they yeah I mean but in that sense that kid wouldn't have done it because you wouldn't have wanted to be\nOn film you say well we film everything you know what they would kind of alluding to\nWell how do you feel now but you got it off your chest\nYou know [laughter] and I have mixed feelings I'll be honest there there are days when I regret it and then the other day\nI'll be honest here or there are days when I regret\nIt and then there are days that\nI'm Glad I did you know my\nKids showed me some comments on Twitter from people some women have said it's about time someone ... it's almost as if I was the first guy to admit this a lot of women ah said ah they were glad I did it they felt better about themselves a few women who have been actually a\nSalted who wrote notes to me said that they made them feel better and so that made me feel kind of good you know\nYour piece was very moving and I one of the things I think I was like every paragraph of it I could call it but the fact that you think about these women I mean now and you wonder\nWhat happened to them like how this affected their lives I mean if if you could say anything to them if by some miracle they were listening [laughter] what would you what would you say the only thing I can say is I'm Sorry I didn't help\nUh you know few women had called me a hero but no I wasn't I Would have been a hero if I were to help these women then but I didn't do it Don ... thank you so much for talking with us thank you\nIn recent years that have been many disturbing stories involving male athletes and the women in their lives

think frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an algae beauty woman being a first generation American being a veteran I think you know in in so many of those identities\nI think we just had to stop making assumptions that people are going to carry I water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race\nWants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time Montanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government um we actually had a ballot initiative on our\nPrimary ballads that would've uh regulated we're trans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities um and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYou know the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades and the way it relates to algae\nHas changed in the last few decades in the way it relates to algae to Q. people do think that shapes your experience\nYet this is Gina I mean most certainly\nUm I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I've got some wonderful fellow than and turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan\nPave the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my age and so um [laughter]\nI I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term process\nI think what it says is this is a long term process\nThe Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do you think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican\nThan it was no I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans he's asked for our advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is\nIt's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. T. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there\nUm were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman and especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way to\nThe Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we think of all the overall national landscape for future LTV tiki candidates as well do you know\nYeah I mean I can tell you or you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what Amelia discussed which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with it so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nYou know one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just want to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper than we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene and Amelia do as well\nTo those young people that are falling behind us I Want to thank\nThree of you for joining us today Dan in is is running for reelection to the state Senate in New Hampshire and Gina Ortiz Jones is running for Congress in Texas and the million mark ... is running for state legislature in Montana\n... is running for Congress in Texas and the million mark ... is running for state legislature in Montana it was great talking with all of you pleasure pleasure to speak with all of you as well [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\n\nI'm moving a is a sales executive of war crimes\nShe lost her family and for a time her freedom she found the courage to speak out about the atrocities against her now she has won a Nobel Peace prize a conversation with not ...\nFor the latest on the search for Jamal to show tomorrow on MORNING EDITION from NPR News [noise]\nIt's coming up for this morning for nine right here on K U when are\nWe get support from first independent bank committed to providing business lending solutions and response of service first independent bank banking on accountability information that first independence and the dot com a division of western alliance bank and member F.

midterm votes\nOr the big concerns that we have as a family is making sure that there continues to be coverage for previous conditions\nDemocratic Senator Claire McCaskill who's in a tough battle for

Wesleyan University says healthcare dominates congressional campaign it out pacing jobs taxes and immigration\nDemocrats had been laser focused on health care this year\nIs the mirror image of what we saw in past election cycles one fellow says Republicans ran a blitzkrieg of ads attacking Obamacare while Democrats said largely quiet\nRegardless that's how Americans feel about the Affordable CARE Act there are provisions at it that are very popular once it became clear that those visions are in trouble I think that has sort of changed the landscape of how politicians will talk about it that cycle\nDemocrats are determined to protect those popular provisions if they win one or both houses of Congress in November on the other hand if Republicans keep control they could take another run at repealing Obamacare\nVice president Jessica Anderson of the conservative group heritage action says that could happen during the lame duck session even of Republicans lose in November\nMany Republicans want the ability to finish the job they've campaigned on this for over eight years\nNo matter which party controls Congress next year Anderson says the Trump Administration will likely keep trying to chip away at Obamacare for example the administration has already relax regulations allowing stripped down insurance policies with reduced coverage\nThe president will still be in office in his administration will still be active in trying to find places to roll back harmful rag\nBut Democrats might be able to put the brakes on some of those efforts if they win a majority in November Drew Altman has the Kaiser Family foundation and healthcare research organization what you're\nTo see is much greater and even fears over so\nOr and even fears over side of the

you're listening to KU when our eighty eight point seven on the way at the top of the hour we're marketplace\nUp next the upcoming ballot includes questions six and initiative that would mandate the increase of production of energy from renewable energy sources in Nevada\nI reporter ... spoke with you on our associate professor of chemical engineering Charles core and now to talk about the state of renewable energy here in Nevada\nThings first can you tell me a little about the history of renewable energy in Nevada and what its current state is currently in the state\nSomething like I'm going to guess what's around sixty percent or so of our electrical power is generated from\nPower is generated from natural gas a little bit more from um coal we still have a little bit of coal here and the remainder is around twenty percent or so it was from a renewable so one form or another\nIf question six passes the renewable energy portfolio will be increased to fifty percent by twenty thirty what are the current standards right now\nSo the renewable portfolio standard um has changed quite a few times and each time a legislature meet every two years they seem to want to tweak it a little bit the the big picture has not changed uh the the expectation is that all energy produced in the state by the year twenty twenty five twenty five percent of that\nWill be produced from renewables or a combination of renewables an energy efficiency right now\nOr the standard for the year twenty Eighteen is twenty percent and we should be up to twenty five percent or in the next seven years\nHow much renewable energy desk Nevada produce as of today um and where does that energy go does it stay here in Nevada or dead as they get outsourced to states like California\nOr it it's in the neighborhood of several million\nI'm megawatt hours or I'm Sorry several million kilowatt hours a lot of the power that's produced in this state is exported in fact a lot of the recent solar farms that have come on line up come on line to provide renewable energy to other states with their own renewable portfolio is especially in California\nHow do we compare to other states when it comes to renewable energy do we have a better environment for renewable energy projects is it a worst environment\nI'm In for renewable energy projects is it a worst environment\nI I think it was around Nineteen Ninety seven or when we passed our first renewable portfolio standard Nevada was had a head of the country we were we had the number one leading a expectations for renewable energy\nAh right now are sort of in the middle of the pack because a bunch of other states have caught up with us\nNow I'm In terms of natural resources anybody who lives here knows that we've got an awful lot of sun uh we've got more son available than any other state in the country so the potential to produce a solar power is quite high and it's I'm certainly lots of room for growth\nWhat effects would cue six passing have won Nevada both energy wise and health wise or what's your professional opinion if the renewable portfolio standard increases to fifty percent that would be pretty exciting\nIn terms of the um the amount of greenhouse gases that at well in terms of reducing the impacts\nThat we as a society have in a releasing greenhouse gases that the impacts can range from production nitrogen oxides and ozone to ... a release of other kinds of particulates a or certainly the environmental impacts are pretty severe at the source of the fossil fuels\nOr whether it's by fracking or some other extraction method certainly those kind of practices probably are will have inevitably have to change a as a society continues to grow and evolve and we will continue to invest in cleaner technologies\nDr Cornell thank

considered from NPR News\nWhen most people make a mistake they say\nI'm Sorry but what should accompany do when it makes a mistake a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith hosted the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nYou did this like really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nThe study was partnered with over so we look at we focus on the Ninety five percent pile of lightness all the most extreme ... most late rides there's about five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and its broader we tested different kinds of apologies and we found that the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues by one to two percent\nOf the wrong kind of apology could decreased revenue so I went to two percent which we tested apologies and involved with the commitments to do better or or not what we thought about a commitment to do better in the future it's it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology and we found that basically two or three months later these commitments you've been in the future\nBasically two or three months later these commitments to do better in the future actually backfired against the company I'm In part because you might commit to depend on the future and then the vitamins oh we didn't do better because then maybe maybe for some of them they had another bad experience and that as a result those those people punished but more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever had a good effect I'm\nNot in our data um [noise] so [laughter] I think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect ... or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet it seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brains that it works on script singer sticks and so you know entering a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripts and risks triggering her brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what what ... what were the apologies that really worked for ... like what was the magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones that sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or was there are certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the best language but we found that there is no statistical difference between the different language to his money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that she might may have backfired a bit was a message that sort of committed to do more in the future\nAbout ... ... it was a message to sort of committed to be more in the future\nDo you think dislike carries over into personal relationships things I Am so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for dinners ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know she was a box of chocolates right or you're the you're the owners and flowers oh eight flowers and candy things always take\nOn a whole new significance um does it hasn't changed the way like you apologize [laughter]\nWhen people thought always wanted to ask you this question Murphy do I'm curious I think the main ways change with that because all my friends and my family and know that I study apologies than they would always are might be skeptical whenever I Apologize so I have to like go an extra mile to sort of sound like earnest and since you're in the morsel because people are always was like oh you're just not be with your paper\n[noise] no apologies for telling you that was professor Benjamin Hope speaking

conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nWhen they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices\nOfficer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that\nSo just to parse the SAT there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister 'cause right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation of less chaotic going forward\nWhile I think the federal government has to\nThat would make the situation less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which has taken a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\n... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nThe state of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state the rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened\nNPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing he rode out the storm in his home several blocks from the beach\nThe garage doors shaking it was like somebody's trying to get in and the inside door was shaking I knew the rough had gone at that point because everything was shaking I thought just hang in there and I save everything was going to be okay for\nLast doors windows part of his roof but his home is largely intact the same can't be said for many other residents Mexico beaches Mayer says Seventy five percent of the town is gone the storm surge washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the ...\nHas gone the storm surge washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the coastal road high winds lifted off roofs and knocked down walls quite a few gates is the former head of FEMA and a longtime urgency management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities in the panhandle\nIn many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nThey just as a part of Florida that's what I call it the old Florida is not a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction this is all the generational of Florida families many of them or just said that Trump folks to fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade in Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nSeveral years later Florida revised it's state wide building code John ... to Reno a structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that is sort of a goes down as you go further north and Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes on the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction you'd only withstand wind speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm as local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter\nDavid provide is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Florida he's part of a team that's been the weekend on the panhandle gathering data on Michael's impact\nWe thought were damage to pretty much all types of construction\nBut the weekend on the panhandle gathering data on Michael's impact\nWhat we saw there was damage to pretty much all types of construction all types of materials and all types of housing what was not damaged houses that were well engineered\nFormer FEMA ahead Craig ... gate has long believed the wind speed standards along Florida's panhandle were too low he says when policymakers develop them they left out information about a powerful hurricanes that hit the area in the nineteenth century before accurate record keeping\nAnd if you had that store back in and out particularly yet Michael back in is going to force a much higher when load warm it or the coast well in land based on those two storms\nFlorida's building commission is now in the process of revising the state code and as a wedding recommendations from the University of Florida team led by David provide ... says understanding how to build resilience structures is just the first step\nWe know what can be done it has been proven that the researchers there it is a way that a computer cheese willing to adopt it or not\nRealtors home builders the insurance industry and many others will have a voice as Florida considers how to prepare the panhandle for the next storm like hurricane Michael ... NPR News Mm Mm Mm Mm\nMm Mm\nThis is NPR News but I felt shot I still\nFeel shy hundreds of thousands of veterans who've received less than honorable discharges had been denied VA benefits\nIf you have the man because of that pie DSD you act out you should not when eligibility for word you were veterans benefits that that's what's been happening\nLast year the VA finally offered to treat these veterans that are they doing enough on the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News in the beginning it forward tomorrow\nI'm K. U. N. I.\n[noise] getting a Cold War tomorrow okay you went on\n[noise] this is Reno public radio K. U. N. R. it's almost four thirty and national news is coming up in just a moment when our serves the following translator communities in Nevada suffering the translator\nYesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she is a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered\nGreat thanks for having me\nWhy do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and illusion of diversity and I'd love to see admissions policies change not to have racing it\nNo Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from a list of factors that Harvard is considering when it assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it raises sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but oftentimes the factory that decision is based on\nI think Harvard is saying that they don't do that but once and for fair admissions has been showing in court the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents learn missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use the personal rating to artificially keep their numbers lower although there is going higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans\nThe group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI don't think that that's true at all clearly affirmative action has failed and at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how formative action policies are impacting different communities\n[noise] I'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally Chen said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial it was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead\nMerit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\nSo I think that a lot of admissions processes should be based on just married\nBut I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important but I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at net in the context of race but again like I said\nMarried in the context as economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nGrades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to realizing admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty because when we focus on something like race I think it\nCreates a sort of division in sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWon't tell me about ... thank you so much for talking with us today Thanks for having me she's a junior at Harvard

she was lieutenant governor and took over for former Governor Terry Branstad when he became US ambassador to China last year Reynolds towns a budget surplus of one hundred and twenty seven million

a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Herrera which is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from the floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of the total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures in Greenland that was a real shocker\nSimilar minerals structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland where even more ancient two hundred million years older and they'd been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes\nThat should have destroyed any signs of life you know my thought was boy someone should fall hotel MIT [laughter] her wits and some colleagues did follow up\nAnd now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils\nA deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like or lack of a better word they ... they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist at NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they use the proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life\nShe says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nIt a point and it's only going from the happen you know on at nine and a lot on on\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take hold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils so far relatively\nFew scientists have studied these rocks that means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word Nell Greenfieldboyce NPR News\nLast word Nell Greenfieldboyce NPR News [noise]\nAnd you're listening to NPR News\n\nI'm told

nevertheless if there's no deal a tool\nIt will be quite bad and the parts of the company will take a very big ...\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the

certain types of medicines\nOnce you ... a place where there are ... for the moment you can have she's running for miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile keys things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages certainly in more distant parts from the port so pretty serious sets us in our series of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be well\nThe treasury UK treasuries made an estimate says what would happen in the medium to miss Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock could cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy and red tape at the borders and that without to business costs\nWould make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because if you have less access to the European market the potential for targets as well so the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years\nUK economy would be about eight percent smaller than it otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big hit as akin to sort of an aircraft\nGradually losing hide you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but I have a time person would be a poor taste and otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe if the u._k. leaves without a deal\nWell for the rest of your this has always been something that you're a skeptic some person of clung to the idea that Europe wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because a person as a major destination for European exposed so they will be an effect on all manner of European produces whether it's a mud and they won produces in France cop produces in German\nWhether it's um and they won produces in France cop produces in Germany\nUm you name it they ... they will be effective because you pay off the breaks it will become the biggest single export destinations for all the all the European Union countries but the point is an asymmetric shock waltz it's true that the other European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's a lot to be honest I I mean we all quite at the Y. yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's not a couple of months ago the differences between the two sides and not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere was another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister does a deal in Brussels she then has to sell it to have very divided policy back in London and I think actually negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the positive then negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my ... still despite all the negative noises around as the common sense will prevail and that will be a deal at the end of the day\nGeorge Parker is a political editor of the Financial Times thanks for joining us as always a

say\nI'm Sorry but what she had a company do when it makes him mistake a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nLike really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nSo the study was partnered with Hoover so we look we focus on the Ninety five percent pile of lightness all the most extreme ... most late rides there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and its rider we tested different kinds of apologies and we found that the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues by one to two percent\nOf the wrong kind of apology could decrease the revenues that went to two percent which we attempted apologies and involved with the commitments to do better or or not what we saw was that a commitment to do better the future it it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology\nAnd we found that basically two or three months later these commitments have you been in the future actually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to do about the future and then the ... vote lead into better cars than maybe it's maybe for some of them they had another bad experience and that as a result the those people punished you but more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever have a good effect I'm\nIn our data um [noise] so [laughter]\nI think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect\nSort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet still seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brains sort of works on script singer sticks and so you know entering a relationship with the company was sort of like the same sort of scripts and risks triggering her brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what were the what would the apologies that really worked for ... like what was the magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones who sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or was there are certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the best language but we found that there was no statistical difference between the different languages his money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that actually might may ... bit was the message is sort of committed to do more in the future\nDo you think this like carries over into personal relationships thing that I'm so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know here's a box of chocolates right or here's your editors and flowers flowers and candy and he's always take\nOn a whole new significance um does it hasn't changed the way like you apologize [laughter]\nPeople don't always wanted to ask you this question how they do I was curious\nThe main ways change with that because all my friends and my family know that I study apologies than they would always are might be skeptical\nA study apologies than they would always ... I might be skeptical whenever I Apologize so I have to like go an extra mile to sort of sound like earnest and sincerely morsel because people are always was like oh you're just doing that because of

according to a recent poll Republican congresswoman Mia Love and Democrat McAdams or in a dead heat NPR's Scott Detrow reports\nIn this year of deep partisan splits it's almost jarring\nReports in this year's deep partisan splits almost jarring to hear Democrat Ben McAdams answer this question about President Trump view of the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise] you know I think mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump for sure on immigration policy health care and other friends\nBut he is a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year\nNear where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for this country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package who invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and former state senator knows that well other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides he's got no choice Republicans have a Thirteen point advantage in this district\nThe votes I Need to win this election I've gotten twice before to see to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to change I'm going to be the same person or as a member of Congress and I've been as mayor\nHe's also got to convince them to dump Mia Love a two term congresswoman who got immediate national attention by being the first ever black woman elected to Congress as a Republican\nLove is conservative but running in a tight race she repeatedly friends herself as a pragmatist going into Washington I Know exactly when working when I build\nRelationships on both sides of the aisle love is aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act she was also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump\nMost notably on immigration where she helped force a floor\nShe's criticized Trump most notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program and when she publicly scolded him for using a slower to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration\nAs a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegation that stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and it worked with him when he has done something right Republicans occasionally\nChiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years that's something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing of vote for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact McAdams says he would not vote for ... to be speaker\nNow my opponent maybe not even say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this turns over and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keep his independence and Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the houses because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people for whom party does not come first or the solutions comes first\nDemocrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like Adams but many of the candidates and the swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift\nThey're calling for single payer health care or impeachment so if election night goes well for the party the next big question is how the return of more moderates ships party dining\nThe next big question is how the return of more moderates ships party dynamics especially if they're the ones responsible for Democrats winning back power that Detrow NPR News Salt

North ridge and the perception that quake insurance isn't over priced luxury at best many companies simply stopped writing policies after getting stung with nearly twenty billion in Northridge payouts

numbers\nNow I mentioned the Mexican position they're saying that only migrants with valid paperwork or going to be allowed to cross into Mexico what counts as valid paperwork in this case\nWell the main thing is a passport to get into Mexico you need your passport\nYou need a visa or whatever people were comes along with that\nThe people in the Caribbean just do not have that uh so it's very

opened and closed\nMark ... as a former CEO of Sears Canada he now teaches at Columbia Business school he told me some malls will actually benefit from all the Sears stores shutting down\nThere are triple lays or super regionals as they refer to\nWho are booming who\nAre receiving the news of Sears demise or near demise with glee because if Sears is still doing business in in their facility\nThey're happy to take the space back these are malls with four five six acres in some cases\nThat are fully tentative and they're only limitation is available parking\nSo they're losing one anchor store but they've got others American what would they do it to share space\nWell they're likely to break it up and turn it into other specialty retail or add to their experiential opportunity in the form of added food offerings things of that sort of ... and then there are B and C moles and these are smaller these tend to be older\nIn many cases they've already lost his ears and the

space and add a food court or something\nThey can do it on paper but they can manage it financially because the malls volume has declined to the extent that there is no financial viability left\nWhen you talk about the triple a malls that are thriving or those congregated in a certain part of the country is there a certain type store type layout that is working for them to pay me a little bit more of a picture of what those look like\nThey're dispersed throughout the United states they straddle urban population center and heavily populated affluent suburban community\nSo they're typically the biggest shiny is penny in the marketplace in virtually every major population centers throughout the United states there is one and in some cases two of these AAA sensors that are doing fine they're fully tended to they've got lots of footsteps\nThey're still sought out as destinations by customers\nIt sounds as though you're describing a landscape in which some malls are disappearing some malls are thriving but all of them are being re imagined as in what way is where it would be willing to anchor store be as important as it was a generation ago people rethinking outdoor versus indoor spaces what trends are you seeing\nAll the eggers store was typically a department store and the department stores genre is for the most part on its way out but now several things have happened first of all the apparel an accessory trends have declined\nUh customers are spending an enormous amount of disposable income on tech and on experiential opportunities rather than on amassing wardrobe sort of a close and the whole\nAmassing wardrobe sort of a close\nAnd the whole idea that over large box will act as the draw for a mall is probably outmoded as well and many of the triple a malls or so to speak the anchor tenant as somewhat like the apple store my\nWhich doesn't occupy a traditional acres space but draws an enormous amount of traffic into the center [noise]\nDo you go shopping malls regularly no fly\nWhen I was a gainfully employed in the business I did that two and three times a week everywhere in the United states and Canada but frankly um they're they're less and less
