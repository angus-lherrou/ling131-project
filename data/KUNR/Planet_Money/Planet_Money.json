of milk related economics\nIt started in the pantheon of milk related economic disasters there is one that rises above the rest and Andy had her ringside seats to it\nThis is one of those slow moving train wrecks that you can see coming from a mile away\nIt was Nineteen Seventy six Jimmy Carter was running for president and he started floating this idea\nAlthough I Am appalled by the bombing of\nA bomb on our way\nOne of the ways Carter proposed giving farmers and equal break was to raise the price of milk by about six cents per gallon which was kind of a lot at the time\nYeah it's really it was on the edge of that it was a big enough number that it sounded like one of these campaign promises that you really didn't expect they would actually fulfill\nSo a campaign promise that's what we call those you know there you go\nThis was not just political pandering there is an argument that our country has to be able to produce its own food 'cause if our farmers go out of business and we become reliant on other countries for food then that is a kind of national security risk\nAnd it's our country has a tradition of programs to help farmers but what do you need to talk of its new does it it's one thing to provide stability is another to step into the market in a big way maybe the wrong time because playing with price controls he's playing with fire\nNevertheless when Carter got elected he goes all in\nThe retail price of milk was going up more than six cents a gallon to is going up because the government is\nAnd you you hear of it and he likes back your forehead oh boy here we go\nIt was pretty hard to predict that we'd get as bad as God but every instinct I had said\nAs a God but every instinct I had said ooh this is ... is going to work out so well\nAnd welcome to Planet Money I'm Karen Duffin and I'm Kenny Malone today on the show the story of what happened when the president of the United states decided he was going to help America's farmers by buying milk lots of ... it is a case study in what happens when price controls\nRuns both feet into the realities of the market there will be a cave in Kansas City a van down by the river\nAnd a touching exchange

Americans for the arts\nThe idea was that if you give this food to people who suffer from food insecurity then maybe it is going to go to somebody who wasn't going to buy cheese anyway so you're not hurting the market as much but the problem\nAndy says was that a lot of this was not easy to give away cheese there were forty pound block than five hundred pound barrels\nSo you can imagine you know you don't just kind of rules on one of these barrels down a seventh avenue in New York City and say anybody want some cheese with then you just have a big knife yeah there you go to help yourself\nSo instead the cheddar cheese was processed that helps that keep longer and then it was repackaged in two and five pound like bricks\nAnd then it was repackaged in two and five pound like\nBricks and this is what people will remember as government cheese because when government starts to give away hundreds of millions of pounds of cheese people notice\nThe great change give away began today in California San Francisco was one of three cities in which needy people lined up to get the surplus\nThis footage is amazing style massive crowds of people being handed wrecks that or she is and it's the most of the government packaging you will ever see just like brown cardboard and some black USDA stamps on it and he's\nA state official estimated three hundred thousand people will get a taste of

military mess halls\nFor a lot of people who grew up in the Nineteen seventies and eighties you cannot overstate how influential government cheese became [noise] fact\nMany listeners may remember Saturday Night live match fully has played by Chris Farley the world's worst motivational speaker\nOf any government cheese and\nGovernment cheese starts to show up in all kinds of popular culture\nA short story by Junot Diaz clear the government cheese from the refrigerator if the girl's government she's also shows up in tons of\nSongs that government we thought we would go and get a like a blood system was something that she\nMay be government cheese that most\nGM maybe government she says most surreal moment came on a television show where Martha Stewart cook stuff with the\nGovernment she\nBecame a symbol of a crappy government handout and to be fair was process cheese kind of like a brick um Velveeta but remember the raw ingredients word grade aged cheddar cheese some of it personally certified by Bob ... rock\nIt was ten times better than bill I hate the bell vetoes okay it's got it's OK okay we're we're not here to not run my own drove either but I'll tell you the the government process move was ten times a hundred times better than it was some of it almost feels like natural cheddar I mean it was really really good product\nThis is why there is also a community of people who are still obsessed with government cheese Internet chat boards trying to find something comparable restaurants claiming they have a recipe for it\nAt one point Donny Walberg of the new kids on the block said quote there's nothing like it the way it melts for a hamburger there is nothing better [noise]\nParents doing the dance ... doing the dance straight but here is why government cheese has become a kind of terrible of how government intervention in markets can have this like butterfly effect in Nineteen Seventy six Jimmy Carter got on the stage and said something seemingly innocuous\nBut I haven't given bombers way\nAnd then within five years the government was spending billions of dollars filling caves with cheese that they could\nBillions of dollars filling caves with cheese that they could not get rid of fast enough well\nI think there's there's a two basic lessons\nAgain economist Andy ... which\nOne is it's really hard to balance what you want to do socially or politically with what you can get away with economically the second lesson is you got to pay attention to the unintended consequences because they can come back and bite you in budget hard\nEven if that bite just looks like some delicious cheese\n[laughter] I mean that was the unintended consequences it was fun but the bite came in terms of how much it cost for that I rented very very expensive she's been to\nThe government cheese caves started to empty out the guaranteed milk price which had been going up automatically every six months was eventually frozen but that does not mean the government had fix the problem\nAnd the thing about price controls is that once you start then they are really really hard to unwind\nSo we have a you know the cement surplus and now you have the political problem how do we how do we get this cat out of the tree\nThe government asked the economists including ... to figure out how it could get out of the cheese buying business without devastating the farmers they were trying to help in the first place\nThis is a basic supply and demand problem the government was demanding an unnatural amount of milk and so farmers were supplying an unnatural amount of milk\nOne part of the solution then was two jet Li get that milk supply down\nTo persuade farmers to produce less we literally paid them money to stop producing milk\nThat did some good and then on the other\nPaid them money to stop producing milk\nThat did some good and then on the other side the government tried to replace some of their artificial demand for milk with new real demand for milk\nLike hey people of America wouldn't you like to drink more milk [laughter]\nWe took a small amount of money from every dairy farmer collected on every ... years old and we created the national dairy board but\nThis is what it was a you know the got milk and the ... mustache and all those kind of iconic programs that we remember\nThat is right Jimmy Carter's campaign promise to help farmers in Nineteen Seventy six not only gave US government cheese but also milk mustaches\nWith a few other programs and sometimes things eventually got under control and the government put the milk support program on a kind of permanent suspension so these days if the government wants to help farmers what you'll generally here about our direct subsidies as opposed to ... cheese yes the the government has tended\nTo stay away from buying cheese of solution that is until last July\nThe White House is coming to the eight of farmers hurt by its own hardline trade policies the Trump Administration says today it will make an estimated twelve billion dollars in government assistance available\nThe Trump Administration announced that in order to help farmers being hurt by Trump's tariffs the government may be making some food purchases again and then in August we learned some of the details there's currently about eighty five million dollars earmarked to buy dairy and distributed to places like\nSchools and food banks not to be fair that's probably not enough to start filling caves with skin but there is a chance that the government maybe didn't\nThere is a chance that the government maybe in the business of government [noise] to the cheesecake [noise]\nBut he's episode was produced by electing or with ... they found in hand reign of color are supervising

I'll be like in the grocery store and all have like an avocado and the onion and a a bottle of\nWater oh that's high stakes you're dropping out of the Cato you're buying that thing yeah yeah\nThe story of how Tommy started fighting fake reviews begins around two thousand six\nTommy was in college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at the time he was Nineteen and it was a bit of a gym rat at his peak he could bench press around two hundred and forty\nPounds one day time he was hanging out with a friend when he says hey you want the rest of this\nPretty workout pre workout that's like a powdered stimulant you're supposed to take before you hit the gym\nAnd it just gives you crazy energy and you can lift more and longer and harder um you know at least those are the claims just to be clear this is not a steroid and case that's what you're thinking Tommy is very against using those anyways\n... friend is really not happy with the stuff that he purchased and he says the Tommy I paid sixty bucks for it and it gives me such bad stomach issues that I it's ruining my work out to you know counter productive\nIf you're not familiar with the supplement world it's not a the most tightly regulated world and on top of that back in two thousand and six more and more folks were starting to buy things on line like supplement\nThe gears in my head started turning and I started looking up several interviews and I I couldn't find anything that was legit I mean it was all just written by the manufacturer they could just\nComment on paternity he could build an online review side but body builders give honest feedback about the supplements they're putting into their bodies\nOkay so for this product we see that over the course of five days this product got Seventy eight percent of their reviews and on top of that the reviews from those high volume days gave the product a four point nine star rating on average the\nAt a four point nine star rating on average these views of those five days pretty suspicious especially when you look at the reviews from those five days compared to the average views they weigh more positive\nTime he says the reviews for these cables raised a few other red flags as well there was a one issue with words that were being used over and over again in the reviews of it so the phrase repetition basically what we do is we we built a gigantic list of all of the\nPhrases that are used in the reviews that or you know three words or more um and then we\nGo after them is able to filter out normal phrases that would show up all the time for example it was the and this way the algorithm can look at weird phrases that you would not expect to be repeated for example\nThe court is very tough and doesn't bend like the chords do but that's probably a good thing that's not you know that you shouldn't see that in more than one review but for here we see it in three reviews [noise] uh yeah\nAnd and in seven reviews someone wrote it's easy to get it back onto the court and to use again ah I don't know what it means for seven people feel that way [laughter]\nWell seven people also say they performed at their duty with honor and respect and there is the correct ... [laughter]\nYeah so Tommy software ran about a dozen different tests than I fall on cable reviews and his reports it out and it just aggravating\nUh so it went from a four star out of five with a hundred and Seventy seven reviews on Amazon and the adjusted rating on review Mehta is one point seven stars after ten reviews which is another\nOne point seven stars after ten reviews\nWhich is another way of saying Tommy side only trust at six percent of the reviews and the trustworthy reviews say actually these cables that crap\nThomas's generally speaking cable like this are exactly the kind of product that winds up cluttered with suspicious reviews\nAnything with like low manufacturing costs and high margins I'm so like what yeah yeah I phoned cables backup batteries screen protectors phone cases weight loss pills to stop\nWe of course reached out to Amazon and about this\nAnd they declined to go on tape but they are familiar with Tommy website they send us an extensive statement about it have you met itself admits that they do not have the fifty states you could do this one is like a you know non weightlifter\nOh okay I'm review itself admits that they do not have the data to know or even stay with high confidence whether a review is fake according to one\nAmazon is saying it's not necessarily different from what Tommy told us about his own website he totally admits that his site is looking for patterns of unusual behavior and there's a possibility that real reviews get flagged as a natural\nFire Amazon that as a problem we have hundreds of millions of reviews on Amazon and of that total less than one percent are inauthentic Amazon also told us that it's investing in its own system to catch fake reviewers\nIn other words Amazon saying there's not a problem but we're working on it and this makes me like I Wonder a little bit how much should I trust the big sites like Amazon are actually going to go out of their way to fix\nThis science complicate it right because these e commerce sites they make money\nSo it's complicated right because these e commerce sites they make money when they sound more products right like it doesn't matter if it's a positive Ficre view if someone buys a product that's good for the site but that that might come a time where there was just too many fake they'd be sure like there's a tipping point where [noise]\nEnough trust is lost that we all just give up yes on Internet shopping\nAnd we'll go back to a friend's child France should we won't go back to our fan from Brenda rate [laughter] well\nThere is a point where it's just that for all of them and we have to go back to talking to her friends again you have to call your mom shopping advice at yes what you pay your youth is among [noise]\n\n\nToday's show was produced by next mountain editor is Bryant or staff or supervising producer Alex gold mark who told me to tell you we could use refuse to print money wise view but please don't get no real reviews like I'm Kenny Malone and I'm healthy ... thanks for listening [noise]\n\nThat was the best story ever all kind of real review Guy Raz [noise] absolutely absolutely OK okay to tell us what's coming up next on how it goes to ...\nComing up we're going to be an entrepreneur who liked him\nComing up we're going to need an entrepreneur who like to run his restaurant chain or a little differently we\nWere making ... finished quest side we buy the spinach frozen we didn't have a way to\nTo get rid of the water and somebody came up with the idea well let's let's buy a dozen clubs dryers ... but but the Spanish and the clothes dryer that will dissipate the water was a great idea until one day we blew the top off the or the ... ended up with spinach in all three thousand square feet of the production space\nFrom NPR Kauai belt that show and then and it made her entrepreneur ... story the movement\nGuy rise and on the show how writers have built a bakery called ...\nAnd then get them being that bill\nBigger restaurant chain\nStick around after the break it's how I built this from NPR you are listening to Planet Money on K U when our public radio for northern Nevada Andy Stern California I'm Tom struggle\nEmitted an affordable housing shortage some of the motels are being torn down in Reno's downtown court or\nAnd many residents are being displaced seniors on fixed incomes families and casino workers who are living in motels as a last resort fear what will happen to them when their options for shelter continue to dwindle\nKatie when ours partnering with our tone Reno to present some of their stories this love journalism event is on Thursday November first from five to seven PM at the desert\nThis love journalism event is on Thursday November first from five to seven PM at the desert rosy and learn more at K.

things\nSo just you know I'll be like in the grocery store and I'll have like an avocado and the onion and a a bottle of water\nThat's high stakes dropping off Cato you're buying that thing yeah yeah\nThe story of how Tommy started fighting fake reviews begins around two thousand six Tommy was in college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at the time he was Nineteen\nAnd it was a bit of a gym rat at his peak he could bench press around two hundred and forty pounds one day Tommy was hanging out with a friend when he says hey you want the rest of this pre workout pre workout it's like a powdered stimulant you're supposed to take before you hit the gym and it just gives you crazy\nThat's like a powdered stimulant you're supposed to take before you hit the gym and it just gives you crazy energy and you can lift Moran longer and harder um you know at least those are the claims just to be clear this is not a steroid and case that's what you're thinking Tommy is very against using those anyways\n... friend is really not happy with the stuff that he purchased and he says the Tommy I paid sixty bucks for it and it gives me such bad stomach issues that I it's ruining my work out to you know counter productive\nIf you're not familiar with the supplement world it's not a the most tightly regulated world and on top of that back in two thousand and six more and more folks were starting to buy things on line like supplement\nThe gears in my head started turning and I started looking up several interviews and I I couldn't find anything that was legit I mean it was all just written by the manufacturer they could just\nComment on paternity he could build an online review side but body builders give honest feedback about the supplements they're putting into their bodies\nReviews over those five days pretty suspicious especially when you look at the reviews from those five days compared to the average people use their way more positive\nTime he says the reviews for these cables raised a few other red flags as well there was a one issue with words that were being used over and over again in the reviews of it\nSo the phrase repetition basically what we do is we we built a gigantic list of all of the phrases that are used in the reviews that or you know three words or more um and then we\nAfter them is able to filter out normal phrases that would show up all the time for example\n... is able to filter out normal phrases they would show up all the time for example it was the and this way the algorithm can look at weird phrases that you would not expect to be repeated for example\nThe court is very tough and doesn't bend like the chords do but that's probably a good thing that's not you know that you shouldn't see that in more than one review but for here we see it in three reviews [noise]\nUm yeah and and in seven reviews someone wrote it's easy to get it back onto the cord and to use again ah I don't know what it means seven people feel that way\n[laughter] well seven people also say they performed at their duty with honor and respect and there is the correct versus [laughter] yeah\nSo Tommy software vent about a dozen different tests than I Am phone cable reviews and his reports it out and it just it invading\nA so it went from a four star out of five with a hundred and Seventy seven reviews on Amazon and the adjusted rating on review Mehta is one point seven stars after ten reviews\nWhich is another way of saying Tommy side only trust it six percent of the reviews and that trust way the reviews say actually these cables that crap\nThomas's generally speaking cable like this are exactly the kind of product that winds up cluttered with suspicious reviews\nAnything with like low manufacturing costs and high margins I'm so like what yeah yeah I phoned cables backup batteries screen protectors phone cases weight loss pills test\nWe of course reached out to Amazon about this\nThey declined to go on tape but\nCourse reached out to Amazon and about this and they declined to go on tape but they are familiar with Tommy's website they send us an extensive statement about it\nHave you met itself admit that they do not have\nThe fifty states you could do this one is like a you know non weightlifter\nOh okay I'm review itself admits that they do not have the data to know or even say with high confidence whether a review is fake according to\nWhat Amazon is saying it's not necessarily different from what Tommy told us about his own website he totally admits that his site is looking for patterns of unusual behavior and there's a possibility that real reviews get flagged as a natural\nFor Amazon that as a problem we have hundreds of millions of reviews on Amazon and of that total less than one percent are inauthentic Amazon also told us that it's investing in its own system to catch fake reviewers\nIn other words Amazon saying there's not a problem but we're working on it and this makes me like I Wonder a little bit how much should I trust the big sites like Amazon or actually going to go out of their way to fix this\nSuch complicate it right because these e commerce sites they make money when they sound more products\nRight like it doesn't matter if it's a positive fake review if someone buys a product that's good for the site but that that might come a time where there is just too many fake ... sure like there's a tipping point where [noise]\nEnough trust is lost that we all just give up\nOn the Internet shopping and we'll go back to France chocolate chip [laughter] we won't go back to our fan from way to go to ... right [laughter] well there is a point where it's just that all of us and we have to go back\nThat column and we have to go back to talking to her friends again you have to call your mom shopping advice at yes when she was ... years and is among [noise]\n[noise]\n\nToday's show was produced by next mountain editor is Bryant or staff or a supervisor is Alex gold mark who told me to tell you we could use refuse to spend the money likes reviews but please don't get no real reviews like I'm Kenny Malone and I'm healthy ... thanks for things [noise]\n\nThat was the best story ever all time is that a real review Guy Raz absolutely absolutely OK okay to tell us what's coming up next on how I built this\nWell Kenny coming up we're going to meet an entrepreneur who like to run his restaurant chain known a little differently\nWe were making spinach croissant we buy the spinach frozen we didn't have a way to\nTo get rid of the water and somebody came up with the idea well let's let's buy a dozen clubs dryers that will put the spin and the clothes dryer that will just to see the water was a great idea until one day we blew the top off the or the drier ended up with spinach and all three thousand square feet of the production space\nFrom NPR how I built this show and that made her entrepreneur\nBill to innovators entrepreneur ideal story the movement\nGuy rise and they show how runner's build the bakery called ...\nAnd then to being bad and build an\nBigger restaurant chain\nStick around after the break it's how I built this from

that household name like say Howard Scholten\nBut you could argue that what Howard Schultz did for coffee Ron shake did for cheddar broccoli soup or the icy I go geez bagel\nBecause like Howard Ron wasn't just focused on a product he was interested in creating a space a place where people could hang out for a long time maybe even have a PTA meeting or social gathering and really linger over that bagel or a couple of soup [noise]\nThis is the famous third place concept that both Howard Schultz and Ron shake wanted to tap into and that's how ... became one of the fastest\nGrowing restaurant chains in the world and in fact if you invested the seven thousand dollars in an era stock in Nineteen Ninety nine you'd be sitting on more than half a million dollars by two thousand Seventeen\nNow the thing is if you met Ron shake say in high school is just not the pad and you'd have predicted foreign Ron wasn't even interested in business his\nPassion was politics as parents were raging liberals and Ron grew up going to rallies and volunteering on campaigns all over New Jersey [noise]\nEventually went to Clark University where naturally he majored in politics\nWhen Ted Clark university where naturally he majored in politics was quickly elected to student government\nAnd that could have been Ron's life except for one day when something happened to Iran and a group of friends something kind of small but something that when you look back on it and\nProbably changed his entire life\nYes so we we were in a local convenience store called store twenty four across the street from the main entrance to the car campus and they accused us of shoplifting and toss this out ... could\nWe mentioned being rowdy or need a wilderness no we were\nShopping but after I came back to campus\nAnd I was in my dorm room with a couple of friends who I said you know why are we shopping there how can they treated like this where which supports that store so what do we ... we can do we can do this ourselves we can have our own convenience store and I said you know this isn't going to be that hard let's do it and we approach the university they weren't so keen on this",
