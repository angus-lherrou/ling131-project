four months\nIt was itchy and like read the like poison\nShe made the trek to see a dermatologist at Stanford and she suspected Winston was allergic to something in the skin cream she was prescribed maybe her shampoo\nI started going back over my whole life and all the things that I had reacted to live bomb neo spore and\nThe doctor suggested coming back for a comprehensive skin allergy test bans are pain\nCall a phony um they tested her for a hundred and Nineteen settlement usually found in beauty products Basset trace in some aerosol they put ... into a tiny plastic capsule then they drew a grid on when since back in magic marker\nSo that they know what substances going where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it Winston left then came back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nOut Winston was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to

thirty five dollars and that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nI just did the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patients being left with to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she hated that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of

money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'd be worth it for ... five star hotel maybe not\nOr they're reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive to Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah [laughter] you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nAt a sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nNo the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead\nCompete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so with everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally\nFor references Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks [noise]\nSupport for NPR health coverage comes from

first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about but he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and the union for the restoration of national pride\nAnd I think that it helps explain why both not a defeated the workers' party candidate for them to a dashing so comprehensively I should say the most amount of himself insist the survival of the democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out part of the constitution to report has about the need for the future presidents\nAnd to reporters about the need for the future president to respect to the judge had to remind him and and people that people really do about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they he's a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's essentially shoe but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and how the fed the remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes oh they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an on corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not his home in ...\nHe's rainy on that he's going to do a good job\nI don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe that I think he really but\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him is his promise to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said that does have a game plan to do that when\nHe wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready\nPeople hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high murder rate yet the prospect of more guns and more police violence also concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a than a quarter a senior last night which is a sprawling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... powder or a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are especially the poor people than men\nMost of the people are especially the poor people than minority\nOkay so both concern and excitement over Brazil's new president NPR's Philip Reeves reporting on that election in Rio thanks You're welcome\nNow we have more of a social media site where the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect reportedly posted anti Semitic attacks\nBefore walking into the tree of life synagogue with for weapons Robert Bowers apparently got fired up with words he reportedly used gab which calls itself an alternative to Twitter and its popular among the far right Here's NPR's Jasmine Garsd\nGap is a site that proudly promotes free speech and posted it lets anyone say anything but it's been controversial critics have called it a home for anti Semite and white nationalist\nRobert Bowers was a user before allegedly going on a killing spree he posted about the Hebrew immigrant aid society\nA group that supports refugees he said the group quote likes to bring invaders that kill our people I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw your optics ongoing in Andrew torn about is the CEO of gab in an interview with NPR he defended the platform\nI I don't know you see a direct threat in there\nAnd I don't what what would you expect it to do with those like that where you you you want us to just venture anybody that's been afraid I'm going in that what you're proposing here well I run again I'm very ... and here's the thing he answered the bad feet or hate speech however you want to define that\nIs more speech and always will be\nWhen this online free speech become a threat this isn't the first time the issue has come up in social media just last week it came to light the man accused of sending explosive devices to ...\nTo light that the men accused of sending explosive devices to prominent Democrats in the media had a history of threatening tweets\nTour but says gab follows strict rules including no threats she says she created gap because he saw no room for conservative points of view on social media take Twitter\nOn earth thousands upon thousands of people calling for someone to kill Donald Trump thing they're going to kill Ronald Trump\nExpressing hate for white people towards Christian towards minorities who may on now keep weren't Donald Trump a bailout hate to be spewed at certain groups and certain people\nSo where is the line between free speech and inciting violence\nI think the line as we're free speech become a threat\nKelly McBride is a senior vice president at the Poynter Institute for media studies she says poor by is prioritizing free speech above all other constitutional values\nAnd that is not necessarily what our constitutional famers intended right they didn't want the government curbing free speech\nNor did they want citizens to be responsible with their speech she says last year Google band jobs up apple rejected and Microsoft terminated its agreement with it last month\nJust in the last twenty four hours at least two Web hosting platforms have suspended gab CEO Andrew ... is not\nBacking down we're not going anywhere ... says gab\nCondemns the shooting but he thinks it's now being targeted unfairly over the weekend the social media site was filled with anger some of it

came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back\nI didn't have any needle stuck in me I had no scalpel stuck in me I had

choices\nBut ... says that's still really high the math just doesn't add up ... says the customary charged for this test is thirty five dollars and that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nI just did the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of this entire bill and only slightly more than this patient as being left with to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she hated that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano oh and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases and that grand piano\nWinston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'll be worth it for ... five star hotel maybe not\nOr they're reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple\nSo ... we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive through Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for a partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test at\nA sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it there is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I was part of\nThe reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospitals systems in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so with everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means\n... says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy tests\nOh how could expense who could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area\nI mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally\nFor references\nDr Elisabeth

right [noise]\n\nThere were celebrations outside his home in Rio de Janeiro the continued deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he will take office\nOn the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves who was reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusion can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and the union for the restoration of national pride\nI don't think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively I should say the most amount of himself insist the survival dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out part of the constitution to report is about the need for the future presidents who respects to judge had to remind him and the people the people\nTo respect to the judge had to remind him and and people that people really do about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they he's a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and how the fed the remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes oh they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an an corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not at home in ...\nHe's rainy on as he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe that I think he's really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said does he have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready\nPeople hit David off sick of robberies and the sky high murder rate yet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a than a cold or senior last night which is a Sperling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... power to a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are especially the poor people than minority\nOkay so both

had reacted to lip bomb near ...\nThe doctor suggested coming back for a comprehensive skin allergy test\nBends or pain call a phony um\nThey tested her for a hundred and Nineteen settlement usually

then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it when it's been left and then came back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to have answers but then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back I didn't have any needles stuck in me I had no scalpel stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nA

expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nI just did the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of this entire bill and only slightly more than this patient as being left with to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she did that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano oh and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases and that grand piano\nWinston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'll be worth it for a lobby the fitting a five star hotel maybe not\nOr that reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such\nA closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive to Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby a buck forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test [noise]\nUh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is the kind of test\nAt a sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advising you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it there's much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I was part of\nThe reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place\nTo live well no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurance look at what's usual and customary so if everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and\nAsk what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expense who could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test\nIs normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally\nFor references Dr

U. when ours ... thanks for joining me happy to be here\nHow can you what can you tell us about the debate between Jacky Rosen and Dean Heller what was the tone like\nYou know I think the nicest way I saw described a was has the\nThink I Would call a brutal and vicious to be honest the over the hour long debate both Rosen in Hillary tax covered the Detroit be attacked each other's records\nThey lobbed accusations back and forth they interrupted one another uh regularly speaking over one another out a few occasions even laughed at each other's answers um I I think it's fair to say the spirit of the debate did well to keep with in sync with the tone of the election that this far\nA it was negative in many ways personal\nUm so uh what about Heller what were his key points\nYou know looking at a Dean Heller uh I I think senator ... or how really outperformed his opponent when he was talking about his experience at a seniority\nOr our did his level best to emphasize his record over the course of the last twelve years and both the house in the Senate or he talked about the number of bills he's passed he he his recent rank he knows the fifth most by\nBill he's passed he he his recent ranking as the fifth most bipartisan member of the Senate and the senator or talked about his seniority or as a boom for the state of the whole I mean objectively Rosen is doesn't have the most experienced she's a freshman congresswoman and doesn't the naturally doesn't have the largest record\nThat being said how are also highlighted his ability to ally himself with the president however was not a fan of the president prior to the twenty sixteen election however in the nearly two years since taking office\nHe's developed a relationship with Trump in whether you like them or not a relationship with the president is a useful thing\nNow talking about a congresswoman Rosen a ... you know it was the topic of the first you know health care was a major topic per debate\nAnd I think that's where congresswoman released a scored the most points throughout the debate time and again she used the topic to highlight senator ... votes to read his last the last year of repeal effort\nOr he off she often referred to tell her last year in office as well as rubber stamp for the president she's also wrote repeated the refrain refrain that she's challenged the Republican or to really tell why he broke his promise quote unquote\nTo demand and when he promised to protect healthcare what about some of the other major issues that came out\nI I think the clearest demonstration on the differences between the two came up during the question on gun control reform in weather background checks should be expanded the private sales\nAnd transfers in Rosen says she supported expanding background checks to include private sales and restricting the sale things like bump stocks you know Heller countered with by reiterating his support for the second amendment\nNow on the topic of federal lands Heller highlighted his work to open veal and land to do more development arguing that it would ease the state's housing shortages will pass\nTo to more development arguing that it would ease the state's housing shortages will possibly creating more economic growth in rural areas rose and on the other hand disagree by arguing that public lands were already a major ... for the state and that there are large source of revenue and the current state\nSo you've mentioned that you know debate was pretty testy you was there any common ground between the two you know I think\nThese two did everything they could to distance to distance themselves from one another hour or something I found interesting is that veterans issues has come up a lot in this election in particular and I mean it makes sense there's a there's a lot of military installations in Nevada therefore there's a lot of veterans in this state\nAnd both candidates did talk a lot about what they would promise to get done or what if they were sent back to Washington so do you think this debate changed anybody's mind\nAnd you know I really can't say we're we're going to get some voter turnout numbers here in the next few days with early voting maybe we'll see um some sort of difference\nDreaming on line that can you win our dot org that can you in our public radio apple or by telling your smart speaker to

U. when ours Paul ... thanks for joining me happened to be here what can you tell us about the debate between\nWhen ours Paul ... thanks for joining me happened to be here can you tell us about the debate between Jackie rose and ... what was the tone like\nI think the nicest way I saw somebody described the debate was testy uh I think I Would call it honestly I I think I'd call it brutal and vicious\nOver the hour long debate both Rosen in Heller attack each other's record they lobbed accusations back and forth they interrupted one another regularly speaking over each other on a few occasions even laughed or should they should have laughed at each other's answers\nAnd I think it's fair to say the spirit of the debate did well in keeping in sync with the tone of the election thus far it was negative and in many ways personal\nSo what were some of the issues that were raised over the debates I Know we've heard a lot about health care over the last few months I'm sure that came up\nYou're absolutely right in fact it was the first topic are brought up and I think that's where congresswoman Rosen really scored most for her points throughout the debate a time and again she's the topic to highlight senator Heller votes during the last repeal effort\nOften referring to how his promise to keep fighting for protections for people with preexisting conditions and also being a rubber stamp for President Trump she even challenge tell her to explain his votes of yours who had spoken to the Senate or personally about his promise\nOff and on the town of ... town I don't know why you ... why for slashing protections in cash and why and want to her past yeah\nWhat about Dean Heller what where his key points\nI think senator Heller really outperformed his opponent was on his experience in seniority Heller did his level best to emphasize his record over the course of the last twelve years in both the house and the Senate he talked about the number abilities past his recent Rincon is the fifth most bipartisan center senator and his\nHis recent ranking of the fifth most bipartisan center senator and his seniority in the Senate as a boon to the state as a whole I I mean objectively Rosen doesn't have that experience she's a freshman congresswoman to naturally wouldn't have a huge record that being said hell are also highlighted his ability to ally themselves with the president\nHoward says he wasn't a huge fan of the president prior to the twenty sixteen election however in the nearly two years since taking office the senator has developed a relationship with the president and here's what the Senate or how to say about that\nYeah we had our ... will continue to have our trip indifference asked me the first to tell you I don't agree with everything he says but I Do agree with most of what he does has been incredible and this ... this economy he's done a great job with our veterans he's been great with our military has doing a thing of job on trains\nAre trained as wants to leave this country for this guy is moving in this country for if I had as a way it should go back to Obama and take this country [noise]\nYou know whether you like them or not or a relationship with the president of the useful thing and Heller is trying to make the most out of it what were some of the other major issues that came out\nThink the clearest demonstration of the differences between the two of these came up during the question on gun control reform and whether background checks should be expanded the private sales and transfers Rosen said she supported expanding background checks to include those private sales wall so restricting things like bump stocks Heller countered by reiterating his support for the second amendment\nNow on the topic from federal lands Heller highlighted his work to open below below inland more development arguing that would ease the state's housing shortages or possibly creating more economic growth in rural areas rose in this time disagree by saying that you know tourism\nRosen or this time disagree by saying that you know tourism uses that that ... that ... and about and that it's a huge draw for the state\nSo obviously there is a lot of points of contention was there any common ground between the two\nYou know I I think these two did everything in their power to distance themselves from one another however something I found I found interesting this entire cycle is that veterans issues have come up a lot in the selection of particular\nAnd I mean it makes sense the Vita is home to quite a few military installations around the state which means a lot of veterans here and both candidates have promised to do more for veterans moving forward now again the politics of the day also means",

social codes that requires women to remain silent out of the shades of their views is to which they had been subjected to\nYears ago as ... street fighters enslaved fell\nThe four years ago Islamic state fighters enslaved thousands of women and girls in Iraq many were repeatedly raped and sexually abused in other words\nNot humor odd was one of those women she was only Twenty one years old at the time and from a tiny but ancient religious minority group the ...\n... people that they are very it\nDid just on a simple life they they can they can leave we any group in Iraq in even hand but em they are they're very ... these people when they do yeah they just want\nTo live in in peace and fixing\nTo feel safe I talked to an audience brought in NPR's Washington studios earlier this week it was her first full interview since she won the Nobel Peace prize with the help of an interpreter she spoke mostly in ... which is her native language about what she now hopes to achieve\nUm um diminution um we have set it over and over\nThat it's important for us the justice is done out of the six thousand years ET women who were abducted by ISIS we hope to see at least one ISIS number who did this to one me as a woman to be punished for the crimes they committed against gives me the women and we hope to see them in court in public\nIt is easy to see winning the Nobel Peace prize as a kind of combination or end of a person's career you've you've done what you set out to do in your case at twenty four years old that is clearly not true you clearly feel like you have a lot left to do what is next\nFeel like you have a lot left to do what is next for you after winning the prize\nAnd I'm twenty five to twenty five ... and ...\nAfter I delivered our method and we have as a community

the word what do you feel every day or what chemicals to showed him ah\nYou know like I said what makes us feel good at least is that we are delivering a peaceful massive die we are not delivering a message to hurt anyone when I meet with students and the presidents and anyone I speak about what happened to us and I deliver my message with a clear conscience that I advocate for people\nOur half hour interview not humor odd seemed at times pretty shattered but also strong she says that strength comes from her UCD identity she calls the rape of using the women and the murder of UCD men including many people in her own family a genocide she wants to these atrocities to be classified as war crimes\nShe wants these atrocities to be classified as war crimes but even after winning the Nobel Peace prize she's not sure if that's going to happen and she sometimes finds herself frustrated\n... sometimes I feel that my message has not been clearly heard what that is not my fault because I feel like too much is going on in terms of woman being victims and it's not the first time and certainly it's not the last time\nAnd perhaps every year a woman someplace in the world or groups of woman or thousands will be victims of sexual violence or terrorist groups and so I feel like this is not new to people and it's not going to be the last time and people have become numb to this kind of news\nI'm your mother your mother was killed by the Islamic state and I wonder when you think about her now\nWhat do you think she would think about everything that you've done what do you think

point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lower\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad I'll go\nOn the streets selling herself I don't live in years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there should be no girl on the streets when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's ... more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me I'm particularly it's fun to recoup the mile or hugging incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that it's in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the story level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually but ... that are making a difference\nSo who is Katie ... why did she starts\nSo who is Katie my like why did she start this organization\nKitty mother's a woman from New Jersey who had along background in doing various forms of\nYeah of community help and volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on an evangelical internship and then from there she continued their relationship with the country and she started ... first registered in two thousand and eight\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management ditching\nKnowing ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this wasn't incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia was an evening Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental in the starting up of disorganization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nEm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nAnd he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\nCan you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nWas heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person\nHeavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what he was doing\nWell that's something that we ask ... and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my lawyer had an intimate relationship with him but she's conceded in an interview\nBut that same year in twenty eleven there was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't didn't really get it\nAnd then my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that the he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that he had HIV right\nIt was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died on us\nEllen Johnson Sirleaf and then also the local local donor community I think I'm a local community or the sense of\nA lot of people that are feeling that something is going wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has not just a a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case\nUm um they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we heard was a process for credits in these organizations have we help them accountable they're looking into whether

after winning the Nobel Peace prize she's not sure if that's going to happen and she sometimes finds herself frustrated\n... sometimes I feel that my message has not been clearly heard what that is not my fault because I feel like too much is going on in terms of women being victims and it's not the first time and certainly it's not the last time\nAnd perhaps every year a woman's someplace in

Nevada assemblyman James Oscar sitting in the Republican primary\nHustle it's such a face off against Democrat Les sir I'm going off in the general but with the news of hops death yes desk today there are questions about what happens when a candidate dies before the election K. U. when our news director Michel ... sat down with senior political reporter Paul Bulger to discuss what will happen in the next\nPolitical process Paul puff\nWas running for state assembly and district thirty six tell us a little bit about that race\nYou know so I think it's fair to say that Hoffman's ways this year when he was able to unseat incumbent Republican assemblyman James Oscar sent in last June's primary\nOne of the biggest issues in that campaign was Oscar some support for the creation of commerce tax and twenty fifth came with district thirty six being so conservative many voters saw that as an unconscionable and he was supposed to face Democrat leaves Romanoff in the general election\nAnd so what happens now does his name actually still appear on the ballot\nHappens now of his name actually still up here on the ballot\nYes it absolutely does a so under Nevada revised statutes candidate to die after the fourth friday in July must remain on the ballot in addition to all requires at the county clerk's office post signs and every polling place within the district of learning voters to the candidates that\nPart of the reason is because ballots have already been printed also there's just not enough time for another candidate to step in and take his place could Elaine what happens if he wins so here's what's going to get interesting in a bit complicated\nThan about a constitutional requires that if there's a vacancy for any legislative position than the decision on who replaces the lawmaker is left up to the county commission\nNow there's some rules state law dictates that whoever replaces haw laughter come from the same political party but that since eighty thirty six isn't just in one county commissioners for nine Clark and Lincoln counties will all get a say on who replaces him how is that even work\nWell if if off when the the the three county commissions will meet to vote on who they support for the office\nThan the commission chairs we'll get together and convened to vote on which are the possible three candidates will be selected here's where it's getting a tricky those three counties don't get an equal vote the size of their vote is based on how many people from each county live within the district\nSo there's roughly forty four thousand voters and district thirty six two thirds of them live in a county or car county has about a third and Lincoln county has just about one percent so that means whoever night county select from the scenario is very likely going to be the next assembly person for district\nScenario is very likely going to be the next assembly person for district thirty six\nEverything we've been talking about up to this point has been hypothetical I mean at the end of the day will people and district thirty six actually vote for a dead person on the ballot\nAt this point it's very likely and for reasons for that is that part of the state is very Republican Republicans outnumber Democrats almost two to one in a normal year a GOP candidate would walk away with a win almost every single time but this is anything but a normal election year\nSo far this election has been pretty unpopular he won the primary but he wasn't getting support you'd see from other candidates top of the candidates like lax on Dean Heller have done their best to distance themselves from the buffalo owner of the very caucus the off was trying to get into the assembly Republicans refused to endorse him\nIn addition to the allegations of sexual assault against them from former bravo workers puff had a tough row to hoe unloaded otherwise an easy win for Republicans\nSo all of that being said it's possible that Republicans who would otherwise not voted for Hamas will vote for him simply because we can't serve and that could open the doors for somebody like James Oscars and to reclaim the\nOne other aspect to consider here is that half was involved in another race blind

founder is an American woman named Katie ... she has thousands of social media followers\nThey're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lower\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad a girl\nOn the streets selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there should be no girl on the streets when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff\nHelping were victimized they were raped by a man who is a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's ... more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its undercut the mile or had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the story level really engage with hearts bubble make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually but taking a small steps are making a difference\nSo who is Katie mylar why did she start this organization\nKatie my there's a woman from New Jersey who had along background in doing various forms of yeah community help and volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on a an evangelical internship\nAnd then from there to continue their relationship with the country and she started up which are the first registered in two thousand and eight\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow in ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this was an incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia are demanding Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental in the starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nEm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante group which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the area of West point where he operated he was well liked\nAnd he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\nCan you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way to keep using these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what he was doing\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my I had an intimate relationship with them but she's conceded in an interview\nBut that same year in twenty eleven there was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who [noise]\nJohnson's ex wife who\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't didn't really get it\nAnd then my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think is rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that but he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that he had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports and to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nHim or potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually we're going to bring a case they were re tested and one of them tested positive\nIt's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says\nYou know where are your schools were the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if for organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to this abuse that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nIt is for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had in the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points that organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nIn Liberia still a lousy organization to operate schools there\nWell the the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm a local community had the sense of a lot of people had a feeling that something had gone wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on\nOn the government has not just a a full investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case\nUm and they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we heard was a process for credit thing these organizations have we hold them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed and the school\nThat we Finley young for pro public I talking to Rachel Martin since his story was published Katie my lawyer has temporarily stepped down a CEO of more than me this is NPR News\nAs soon as the

Jackie rose and he ... news director Michel ... sat down with our senior political reporter Paul\n... news directing Michele Kelemen sat down with our senior political reporter poker\nHall thanks for joining me so much for the nature of this Senate race between Halloran brothers and it's it's garnering a lot of attention now why is everyone watching rain\nThe main reason is that Democrats see that they have a fairly decent shot at taking control the Senate and the best way to do that is by an sitting Dean Heller\nHow was the only Republican up for reelection this year in a state that Hillary Clinton won in twenty sixteen he's been widely seen as the most vulnerable GOP senator in the country and to be honest his full throated supporter of president Donald Trump's agenda\nHas not made him a lot of friends in places like Clark County which is heavily democratic devout is also true battleground state now in twenty fourteen but I don't want all red and twenty sixteen it went all blue this year who knows point in the state isn't it tore asleep at\nThe polling we do have shows that it's a very tight race in Egypt don't get that in many places around the country\nWe've heard a lot about health care and this year I'm can we actually stopping just break that down a little bit uh what is actually at stake in the health care debate in this election\nI think if you talk to Democrats they'd tell you that everything is at stake in the health care debate now ... and boy have they made that their campaign issue this year the Democrats have use everything at their disposal to criticize Dean Heller for his flip flopping on a series of votes last year\nUh looking to repeal and replace the Affordable CARE Act to be fair I think it's important if we if we rehash a little bit of history during that so the debates last year however voted against straight up repeal effort\nOr ... as a matter of fact you might have seen ads with him standing next to the governor Brian Sandoval\nYou might have seen ads with him standing next to governor Brian Sandoval talking about his opposition to repeal effort at that point the biggest point of contention with her appeal process was that it would effectively ended Medicaid expansion here in Nevada\nBut when the Medicaid expansion aspect of that program was removed from the repeal effort\nHow I became much more amenable to a piece of legislation you may remember called the skinny repeal it ultimately failed but how we are supported it he also supported the tax cut bill passed by Congress later that year which actually ended the individual mandate\nNow that's a lot to follow and it's not easy to unpack all of it in a single thirty second ad\nBut Rosen has been tacking how we are on the issue for months to combat that however is doing his best to alert voters to his efforts to save one of those popular portions of the health care law requiring insurance companies continue to cover pre existing conditions\nAnd what are some of the major issues that are facing in that\nYeah so health care is taking the spotlight there are your typical issue debate that seemed to always come up\nImmigration is one of them however has voiced support for immigration reform but I have not gotten into too many specifics\n... and rose and has been highly critical the administration's policy on the budget ... voted for the massive tax cuts last year\nBut also criticized lawmakers Washington for spending too much Rosen has characterized the cuts as a massive give away for the rich on his website Heller says the he has oppose efforts by quote unquote the extreme left in Congress to limit law abiding citizens the right to bear arms\nRosen has actually called for increased gun control in the past\nHe says those have been a particularly negative race between erupts\nThis has also been a particularly negative race between Republicans and the Democrats why has it taken that negative town\nYeah if you open your mailbox watched TV for more than five minutes watching online video in the last month or two\nYou have very likely been inundated with campaign material and it's particularly bad for non partisans

Indus challenger democratic congresswoman Jackie rose any he when our news director Michel Gilman sat down with our senior political reporter Paul Bulger\nPaul thanks for joining me so let's talk about the nature of this Senate race between Halloran rose and it's it's garnering a lot of attention why is everyone watching this race\nThe main reason is that Democrats see that they have a fairly decent shot at taking control the Senate and the best way to do that is by an sitting Dean Heller\nHow was the only Republican up for reelection this year in a state that Hillary Clinton won in twenty sixteen he's been widely seen as the most vulnerable GOP senator and the country and to be honest has full throated supporter of president Donald Trump's agenda\nHas not made him a lot of friends in places like Clark County which is heavily democratic about is also true battleground state now in twenty fourteen but I don't want all red and twenty sixteen it went all blue\nThis year who knows point in the state is notoriously bad but what point do we do have shows that it's a very tight race and you just don't get that in many places around the country\nWe've heard a lot about health care this year I'm can we actually stop and just break that down a little bit of what is actually at stake in the health care debate in this election\nI think if you're talking to Democrats they tell you that everything is at stake in the health care debate now ... and boy have they made that their campaign issue this year Democrats have use everything at their disposal the courts\nDemocrats have use everything at their disposal to criticize Dean Heller for his flip flopping on a series of votes last year uh looking to repeal and replace the Affordable CARE Act to be fair I think it's important if we if we rehash a little bit of history during that set a debate last year however voted against straight up repeal effort\nOr ... as a matter of fact you might have seen ads with him standing next to governor Brian Sandoval talking about his opposition to repeal effort at that point the biggest point of contention with her appeal process was that it would effectively ended Medicaid expansion hearing about it\nBut when the Medicaid expansion aspect of that program was removed from the repeal effort\nHowever became much more amenable to a piece of legislation you may remember called the skinny repeal it ultimately failed but Heller supported it he also supported the tax cut bill passed by Congress later that year which actually ended the individual mandate\nNow that's a lot to follow and it's not easy to unpack all of it in a single thirty second ad\nBut Rosen has been tacking how we're on the issue for months to combat that however is doing his best to emerge voters to his efforts to save one of those popular portions of the health care law requiring insurance companies continue to cover pre existing conditions\nAnd what are some of the major issues that are facing in that\nYeah so well health care is taking the spotlight there all your typical issued debate that seemed to always come up\nImmigration is one of them however has voiced support for immigration reform but I have not gotten into too many specifics ... and rose and has been highly critical the administration's policies on the budget Howard has voted for the massive tax cuts last year but also criticized lawmakers Washington for spending too much\nWashington for spending too much Rosen has characterized the cut the mass of give away for the rich on his website Heller says that he has oppose efforts by quote unquote the extreme left in Congress to limit law abiding citizens the right to bear arms Rosen has actually called Fort increase gun control in the past\nHe says those have been a particularly negative race between Republicans and the Democrats why has it taken back negative town\nYeah if you open your mailbox watch TV for more than five minutes watching online video in the last month or two you have very likely been inundated with campaign materials and it's particularly bad for nonpartisan here in the state and for part of the reason for that is all the money that's been pouring in\nLast quarter and a lot of September Jacky Rosen was able to raise more than seven million dollars", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Reno", "day": "18",

good morning the u._s. stock market looks ready to recover some of yesterday's dramatic losses when Wall Street opens this morning most Asian markets were down overnight the Nikkei hangs saying but the Shanghai stock exchange was stable which was unexpected because\nChina stock market has fallen thirty percent since January and its currency is falling to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years NPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob\nYou more into our thirty percent drop for China's stock markets sounds pretty darn bad what's going on [noise]\nJohn is calling me has been lagging for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt Sparling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble\nSparling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble and through all of this Beijing's making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from an economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in China stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have\nAs big an impact on the economy like if the dog the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is editor weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\n[noise] well it's interesting hearing well is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make experts cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nChina is doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having\nAre these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a kind of speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chains to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost\nNPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks shop ...\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change\nSilicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes blocks chained the technology behind crypto currency like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year

plunging so what is it\nA lot chain or distributed electric technology really references a larger system of technology\nElectric technology really references a larger system of technology [noise]\nOkay [noise] think of it like ... ... is like an accounting book everyone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank but instead on the computers of everyone on the block chain\nTransparency is its main advantage tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer to endings human trafficking and now even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nBall gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he's still makes the grand tech world pitches he's the CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\n... is a black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credit systems the total number of carbon possible to MIT is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting and go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNow the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch we want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy\nBecause he's a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution the things that fixed\nIs that it's just there's a quick and easy solution\nThat things that fix climate change are going to be really hard\nLike getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute the call I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things and these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nIs watching could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees the company is planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mocking a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially can kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually more important to make the entirety of the problem something then solvable\nWith a clock ticking on climate change ... there's no time to waste sorting facts from high\nRent PR News I'm Sam Harnett [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nThe Democratic nominee for

Nevada to increase the state's renewable portfolio standards to fifty percent by the year twenty thirty are senior political reporter Paul do gr sat down with students reporter Paolo chef at us to discuss the details of the ballot initiative\nPoets just jump right in what is a renewable portfolio standard so renewable portfolio standards are a pretty complex concept to wrap your head around there's actually a journalist in this state or he's Riley Snyder he works for the Nevada independent and he's worked a lot with complex energy issues like this or he can probably explain it better than I can\nSo in our area is basically a a credit managed system for more to kind of like a cap and trade program where uh\nSo in our area is basically a a credit managed system similar to kind of like a cap and trade program where a honorable energy production has given up certain credit and the state requires that electric utilities to the end of the energy\nUm obtain a certain amount of credits as a percentage of the energy they generate every year basically it's just a a measuring stick a or noble energy production\nSo what's the history of Nevada for renewable portfolio standards you know what are they looked like\nNevada RPGs was established in Nineteen Ninety seven the original goal was six percent which was pretty attainable\nIn fact it was so easy that they more than doubled that goal to Fifteen Percent in two thousand and one lawmakers last amended the RPGs in two thousand nine which required energy providers do supply twenty five percent of their energy from renewable energy sources by twenty twenty five\nYou mention them for two thousand nine was the last time lawmakers made a change has there been any other effort to increase that are PS since then\nYeah actually in two thousand Seventeen to state legislature sent a bill to governor Sandoval\nWhich would have increased their requirements to forty percent by twenty thirty\nSanibel actually vetoed that bill saying it was pretty much are due to the fact that they might be deregulating the energy market\nReferring to question three which is also on the ballot who are in the major supporters of questions six so the question actually originated out of Tom stiers camp he's a big democratic donor based out of California you actually founded the organization that proposed this initiative along the same lines congresswoman Dena Titus is one of the major democratic supporters\nAcross party lines former Republican state senator and current Nevada gaming commission member Randall talents and has also voiced his support of the question\nWhat is there any opposition to questions six I haven't seen a whole lot of\nBut is there any opposition to questions six I haven't seen a whole lot of news on this at least at this point\nYeah there's actually a small group that calls for themselves the coalition of energy users are there in opposition to keepsakes they have a number of high profile Nevada and Republicans attached to this campaign like into the wrong connect\nAnd state senator Don stepson while they have a website a group of members and the name they've yet to make any contributions are expenditures for ads opposing ...\nWhat does questions six relationship with questions three they're both about energy they're both on the ballot this this election you know are they related or they completely separate\nQuestion three would essentially deregulate the energy market prohibiting electrical utilities namely envy energy from establishing monopolies\nCue three has been painted asking ... by state Democrats like gubernatorial candidate Steve's is alive\nCongresswoman Dena Titus they both express their concern that cute three would undermine and in danger in Nevada as clean energy future on the other hand backers of cute three argue that raising renewable portfolio standards would place unnecessary regulations on upcoming energy providers which would slow their Ruth\nIf both questions pass which is a possibility\nIt'll be interesting to see how they interact with each other\nOr the supporters of questions six people who've back to place on the ballot or they at all concerned that there's going to be confusion over between questions fixing question three\nI think there's definitely a concern I have seen a lot of people go out there and talk about the differences between cute three and queue six mainly because they're both energy initiatives so it'll be interesting to see how voters reactors\nThat was K. you when I was ...\nIt'll be

anti abortion rights groups students for life is a former evangelical who converted to Catholicism she says she's heard this argument before and doesn't think most conservative Christian voters will buy it because of how they view abortion\nThere are certainly a lot of issues that Christian care about when they go to vote by the end of the day we know that there is a human rights atrocity happening inside of our country and I trust any is abortion\nHowever the issues are framed poster Robin Jones of the public religion research Institute says moving white evangelicals away from the G O P would be an uphill battle\nYeah once you have several generations that are voting eighty percent Republican I'm it's less what they're doing that because of one particular issue and more than it has become in many ways a kind of tribal identity that's just inextricably tied to evangelical identity I think that that is the tie that binds much more than any single issue\nThe common good is trying

day yesterday the Dow was trading up about point eight percent this hour\nBut I don't think the market volatility we've been seeing in the past couple of weeks is not over NPR's Yuki Noguchi joins us now to discuss some of these markets swings can morning ... good morning oh All right so it has been a choppy October yesterday markets closed down and the Dow innocent pie basically erased all their gains for the year what has been going on\nIt's because investors are conflicted and one of their biggest\nIt's because investors are conflicted and one of their biggest underlying concerns is the global economy you know how the trade war will play out and how higher terrorists might effects it might affect U.S companies um you're starting to see some of that already a\nCaterpillar which makes farm equipment and three M which is a huge conglomerate that makes everything from sponges to car parts\nAh this we talked about how that's starting to affect their bottom line now on the plus side the economy and labor market are and\nHave been chugging along so there are no clear indications that that's going to hit a wall or some companies are beating expectations and although interest rates are heading up there still historically low\nAll right so some good factors some bad factors one of those sectors that's been hardest hit in recent days is the tech sector yesterday the NASDAQ which is made up of a lot of tech stocks I had one of the worst days in seven years and this morning we should say it is trading up but what is going on in the technology sector\n[noise] ... well the technology sector has been on an even steadier and stronger Bull Run in recent years I'm apple this summer a you might recall became the first company to reach a trillion dollars and market value so basically ... tech stocks have already risen very high end of a lot\nFurther to fall a and when you have a ... few companies talking as you saw this week about week sales or miss profits\nUm that makes investors nervous that perhaps those stocks are overvalued and you know tech is a great example actually of how the volatility kind of spreads around the world yesterday you had some us tech firms including Texas Instruments and AT and T. reporting some weaker earnings which then prompted you\nEighteen T reporting some weaker earnings which then prompted you Asian tech stocks including Sony and Sampson to fall overnight\nBut then by the morning you had stronger results out of European tech firms in some U.S companies including Microsoft Twitter this morning and that's helping shore up some of those losses so it kind of good contagion they're eating nerve wracking though to see the markets lose like six hundred points in a day\nAnd analysts say this could continue for a while really quickly why is that\nIt's largely because we don't have clarity on some of the questions that I outlined at the outset where's the global economy had it how much of a trade war is going to affect companies um\nAnd until investors feel they have a clearer picture on that you are likely to see strong reactions to any kind of news that could be interpreted as a significant development and we'll get another chance a later today with Amazon and Google's alphabet reporting their earnings NPR's Yuki Noguchi thanks so much thinking well\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change\nSilicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes block chain the technology behind crypto currency like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station ... has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in

an accounting book everyone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank but instead on the computers of everyone on the block chain\nTransparency is its main advantage tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block chain to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer to ending human trafficking and now even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nBall gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he's still makes the grand tech world pitches he's the CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\n... is a black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credit systems the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting end to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment and then the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch\nYou want to make the whole climate change problem just\nMeaning the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy because he's a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution\nThat things that fix climate change are going to be really hard\nLike getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute because it before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things and these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nIs watching could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees the company is planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine rock and a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially can kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually more important to make the entirety of the problem something that's helpful\nWith a clock ticking on climate change ... there's no time to waste sorting facts from high\nThis is NPR News\nThe Democratic nominee for governor in Illinois has contributed more money to his own campaign any

reports they're asking conservative Christians to think differently about issues like abortion it sounds a little bit like a church service\n[noise]\nAnd a bit like a campaign rally you murdered says

care about when they go to vote by the end of the day we know that they're human rights atrocity happening inside of our country and I trust any is abortion\nHowever the issues are framed poster Robin Jones of the public religion research Institute says moving white evangelicals away from the GOP would be an uphill battle\nYeah once you have several generations that are voting eighty percent Republican I'm it's less that they're doing that because of one particular issue and more than it has become in many ways a kind of tribal identity that's just inextricably tied to evangelical

I'm from New Orleans Louisiana how did the U.S views Saudi Arabia before oil was saying thank you\nBasically there was no view before oil was a thing a Saudi Arabia as we know it was became a country in Nineteen thirty to the very next year and find in agreement with standard oil of California to form aramco the Arabian American oil company which is now owned by the Saudi state\nAnd that happened even before it was clear how oil rich the country would be\nThe leader for a unified the country and started a relationship with the U.S was Abdul ... even out he had forty five sons Steve and all the king's since his death\nIn Nineteen fifty three of them one of those sons the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman we've been hearing so much about lately would be the first of the next generation if he becomes king\nThe next question is whether us being so close to the Saudis can get them to do anything\nI was out of the south from Upton, Massachusetts how much influence as the United states have over Saudi Arabia's foreign policy\nI'd say the question is more how much the U.S has chosen to exert a the biggest case in point at the moment is the civil war in Yemen where the Saudis have been accused the bombing civilians and closing off access to a humanitarian aid so that now there's an enormous food crisis taking place but because Iran is involved with the factions\nIs involved with the facts and the Saudis are fighting the United states has sided with the Saudis but there's ... and Congress which showed up in the last defense bill of trying to protect civilians\nAnd there's talk of sanctioning Saudi Arabia in some way because of the journalist killing as well ... thanks as always good to talk to you stay in commentator Cokie Roberts you can ask Cokie your questions about our
