French horn but you know eventually she came around and\nYou know she's been really supportive of me my entire family has been really supportive of me and you know they've suffered through many I'm late nights of very loud practicing so I'm really grateful for that and\nI'm very priests and your and your mom was you know right you know because the the the quintessential sound of a joke\nWhy why is a trombone yeah I mean he had it right from the first got but I'm Glad she's glad she's into it I Love the trombone Carl I don't know how your parents feel about you're taking on the trombone but they sure love vinyl records yes they\nA my actually my parents met um my dad was huge and ... into collecting vinyl my mom was too but uh there were at a social gathering at college and um my my dad looks over and there's this there's this girl looking through his eye\nMy my dad looks over and there's this there's this girl looking through his final and first he freaked out because he was collecting that in his favorite thing and then it was like what it's like I'm going to go and talk to her um and so now our our entire living room is sort of turned into this big library of vinyl records that my dad is sort of turned into as he calls it the listening room\nUm and yeah so it's it's quite literally been the the center of our household you guys reverse in the listening rooms sometimes\nI guess redo my sometimes get in the way that all that final trying to get everything has quite a challenge [laughter] Jonah you have a very deep and profound reason for choosing jumped on um yeah I really liked to fly the thing that's really the best\nReally is makes the most expressive no bras instrument I I think that's unquestioned roughly ... your family saved a bone rangers concert from disaster they showed\nIt well back then it was my first week of being in the ... I was the newest member and so we had a gig\nI grandpa votes at Chicago Illinois and I was going to fight it that I got that we're going to get to perform these guys here\nAnd then all of a sudden it started pouring rain though it was just\nThe one it was horrible and we were we were afraid that no one was going to show up because they moved on to a tiny ten so we won't we won't get wet and those I barely like four or five people into and we thought and the one was going to show up and it's all like I have to pay back to the songs like supposedly we were going to call the other day\nBut also thought in my family\nBut all of a sudden my family or friends show up to the performance and it's just like\nWithin a split second it turned into just a sweet little elderly couple in our coach Tim Reardon sitting in the back um to them this huge caravan of ... showing up and that sort of English show and ... there was just like this monsoon is rather going on and so it made it a little bit more

[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nWhich is the second bird feeders monitored by your boss and the sick of contradict used by Nikolai\nPublished dean performed worse by Maxine park Thirteen Years old or piano from Hanover New Hampshire mixing you tackle that music was such great confidence but when you were younger you say that you were afraid of the spotlight\nYeah so my first aside all I was playing Yankee Doodle with my mom and it was a ... and I was playing the melody park on the top register of the piano and I'm On the plane they come from it on the bottom register\nUm but I thought the audience is too close so I wanted my mom to play the bottom part of the top part says that she could hide me from the audience that I could just play in the back [noise]\nUm yeah that didn't work out too well but [laughter]\nBut uh your mom is also somebody who's contributed some a great thing I Wish somebody said this to me a long ago\nA social psychologist and she taught you something that helps you quite a bit as a young pianist when you were more nervous\nYeah so my mom used to tell me a lot when I was little don't compare yourself to other people because you'll never be happy with how you do you're just trying to do better than somebody else all the time um so I Can't remember this is the word no social comparison\nUm and that's really helped me a lot with piano especially because when I go up to play or even to practice I'm thinking about what do I want to do to improve my past self not trying to improve basis\nProve my past self not trying to improve based on somebody else or something like that [noise] um and also when I perform I can just go up there and have fun because I'm not really worried about doing better than something or having a stern outcome so I can just have fun\nSo strong was and we should learn from them that's beautiful or your parents are both avid amateur pianist and there was a joke about what you have to do to be a member of your family\nYeah so my parents met in college and my dad is playing the ship had any minor concerto um and my mom was also playing that concerto at the time so she came over to talk to them and at first he thought that he was impressing her just like plaintiff he's turned out she was much better than us and he was um [laughter] but um\n[noise] so there's a joke in my family that you have to play one of the two Chopin concerto is either the F ... fighter because they both play both of those can chair does um and so I'm not a member of the family yet but I'm working on it which one are you working on I'm working on that flight and my favorite\nToo [noise] so your parents are very strong musicians but neither of them chose to pursue music as a career I also know you love math and science so where do you think you'll end up\nWell I guess I don't really know right now one of the things that my parents have kind of taught me is that you don't have to play piano professionally in order to still love it and enjoy it\nI'm so definitely still want to keep playing piano and enjoying it when I get older um but I think it really depends a lot on like the people you meet because I've met a lot of mentors who've changed my perspective and the things that I wanted to do so I don't know maybe I Will become a professional pianist or maybe not really for it\nThat's for sure Maxine it was such a pleasure hearing you and I hope we get to you again sometime give thanks vaccine\nYou're you again sometime yeah thanks Maxine\nBack and forth or even a half or [noise]\nBack on stage with me

it might last for five years but Julius had extraordinary ties to the greater string community and of course his work with strings students he was the violin professor at was legendary here so we're just so lucky that that legend lived on much beyond five years\nIt's just an amazing thing so described the process to me you know how many kids apply every year\nThis year we had an all time record broken we received over two hundred applications so each year it's been growing and I believe that there are a number of reasons word of mouth happy contestants happy parents extraordinary performances\nTestings happy parents extraordinary performances that come out of this plus the supportive audiences here in the ... community\nA young person will apply anywhere between the middle of October to our February first deadline and then those applications go through two rounds of screening here in Kalamazoo it's an anonymous process\nItself we take this year's numbers as an example those two hundred applicants were whittled down to the twelve semi finalists\nThat we heard today how is that even possible I mean you know just you know the proof is in the pudding of course the twelve that I heard today we're more artist than competitors I think\nUh so what does that process like do I do have a hair splitting moments you know getting them down from two hundred or is it fairly obvious I mean the the level must be astronomical at\nThis I think the level is astronomical and I'm always grateful that I Am not the person making those decisions are screeners who do remain anonymous they are well versed in the literature and the profession or in the field is like\nA there are multiple screeners at each level they listen very carefully they proceed with great integrity that is you can imagine there are some really tough calls said at the end\nAnd what it would win a kid's apply until how old can they be uh\nOur rules call for them to be age Nineteen or under as of January\nFirst of the competition here [noise] so the kids you work with are very much eligible to appear on from the top as a matter of fact this year there's a large overlap yes there is a huge overlap and I think that's\nOverlap yes there is a huge overlap and I think that's what brought us together and we've noticed that overlap over the years that alumni of from the top also end up being alumni of the stall bird it's a wonderful connection and of course the missions are so similar to what we've\nHad a wonderful or you've had a wonderful legacy on from the top with all the kids we always send to shut up to the ... for your support and ah the knowledge of this great great talent so thanks for talking with me in the best of luck with this year's competition well thank you and

addition to living in Montana in Washington we also spent time in France and most recently we've been living in India\nWow so you've learned to accommodate all sorts of costumes and cultures in your life in India you also had to accommodate the monkeys [laughter] hurry [laughter]\nOh my goodness I Am terrified of monkeys they're all over the hillside um where are you still live and uh gosh they've been in my kitchen in classrooms um you know there's even bars on the practice room we chose to keep them out\nBut I think the most memorable experience I've had to think he's was on the way to rehearsal one day\nI I ran into a troop of about thirty recess monkeys and I was running a little late so I I couldn't go around them and I decided to go through them and said\nAnd uh that was that was a mistake there's like three cardinal rules or when you encounter monkeys one is don't make eye contact the other is don't share your teeth and the third is don't get between them and their food\nAnd I broke the third one because they they were\nThey were uh they knocked over some supposedly a monkey prove garbage bans and so I was like picking my way through all of this food debris you know trying to avoid them I went around this motorcycle trying to put like a barrier between me and the monkeys and instead it was used as a launching point for one of them to jump off of an onto my back [laughter]\nAnd so I ended up running [laughter]\nAnd so I ended up running running to the school you know it's one case and monkey bouncing behind me screaming my ... my ...\nShould have taken your horn out because as you know music suits to Savage beast\nOh they tend to avoid my horn I don't know you up to you to decide whether they have good taste or bad [laughter]\nAlways a critic I guess well the monkeys would have loved his performance on positive as we all did great on a plane with your lives with best of luck St Elizabeth posted into an Eighteen year old French horn player

composers and we're going to continue that tradition now or would you introduce the teenage composer whose music we're going to hear next\nYes we're delighted to welcome to buffalo Ethan try him in for the buffalo premier his piece welcome\nEthan or we're going to hear a short piece of yours called Saturn's rings tell everybody about the workers ration you came up with in order to evoke that image\nLarge part of my thinking in this piece was trying to trace sound physically throughout\nPeace was trying to trace sound physically throughout the orchestra as pitches are passed around in a way that sort of mimics the orbiting Saturn's rings around the planet\nThe other thing I was thinking was trying to make each part really comfortable for the player who's playing it and in the program back in Los Angeles that I'm In the Los Angeles philharmonic composers fellowship program\nProfessional musicians from the Los Angeles philharmonic come and speak to us about their instruments and they tell us all sorts of things that\nThey like to play that they don't like to play that we should stay away from as composers things that make their life needlessly difficult or things that a function really naturally on their instruments so that's something I tried to think about\nGreat knowledge to catch up on Joanne anything to add about ... piece\nJust that we're delighted to add another new piece to our repertoire Ethan and we hope to see more of you in play other pieces as well\nThis is a beautifully concentrated miniature this peace let's give this a spin so to speak this is Saturn's rings by Ethan trimester\n\n\n\nOoh [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nPlease you're thinking [noise]\n\nRumble Ethan I I understand it's one of your first or casual pieces and it just sounds so masterful the way you command in various different colors of the orchestra and I could hear that\nIntense sort of standing around\nIntense sort of sending around in in terms of Saturn's rings the sound of the notes from one section of the orchestra studio they're really quite a brilliant concept of in the great tradition of composers just starting out\nI Know you started playing piano initially your first couple of pieces were in the style of famous composer so who're you emulating\nWhen I first started writing my own compositions I was playing a lot of uh WC and Gershwin 'em and sort of by happenstance but actually just because I was accidentally plagiarize and my competitions would incorporate um elements of their work um until\nWeeks after writing it I listen to a piece that I wrote and go oh that's directly from you know this piece or that these and sort of\nBy conglomeration of all there's different styles I started emerging with my own\nYeah well it it's ... ... of course you know the the way we learn I mean I I guess without stealing the notes for instance you can hear record in the orchestra and like the way that its position with the flu to soon and
