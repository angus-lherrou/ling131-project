A. R. A. good morning\nTom of weather updated for you we've got some rain out there as we talked about a few\nMinutes ago and you've been mentioning a and also the threat of thunder and sure enough on radar now\nOr the last twenty minutes or so starting to see some ah thunderstorms down in the central Connecticut coast down towards old Lyme a and just around New Haven and they're moving northeast so\nUh we will have as a threat of a a thunderstorm this morning again not trivial without talking about anything heavy with high winds or anything but uh some Bob morning thunder and for getting thunderstorms any time in October is not too typical and getting it in the morning is a kind of unusual to do a little unusual this morning again not everyone but\nGetting it in the morning is a kind of unusual to so little unusual this morning again not everyone will get it but uh I'd say through about twelve o'clock because the threat of a few showers and again we'll watch that area under storms with a with for some people since they're probably sleeping in from being up last night maybe the thunderstorm Tom will be there wake up call the\nWhite [laughter] around eight or nine o'clock\nYeah there you know there were some people out there that are still sleeping away ... a sleep it off as it were All right we're going to reach the mid fifties this afternoon a wins will turn southwest of West is going to start to dry out as I said good news tonight clear falling down to forty ... issues of heavy freezes this week now\nWe're going to catch up obviously over the coming weeks and months but\nAfter getting two or three doses of freezing temperatures over the last couple of weeks this week will be mostly above freezing a high tomorrow about fifty so I'm going to the sunshine tomorrow a nice day with blue skies almost all the\nUpper East side of the northwest Ohio fifty and then again\nThe good news for Halloween at least at this point in terms of whether\nIt is not going to be cold is not going to be snowing on Halloween which it has done in the past rarely but it has snowed on Halloween we've also had nor'easter is on Halloween we've had always does on Halloween we've had very warm temperatures on Halloween and Tom we're going to be somewhere right in the middle about sixty or high on Halloween Wednesday\nAnd then a Thursday we're going to feature of the sixties mid sixties I think the warmest afternoon of the week is going to be Thursday before another weather system of stronger one moves and I think the rough weather this week is going to be on friday with rain heavy at times or some gusty winds and even the chance of thunderstorms then so\nFriday may be although not the exact same set up friday maybe similar to what we had on Saturday a potential strong winds will monitor that that could linger into early Saturday right now I'm a picking the or the ... for the weekend Sunday with sun shining\nRight now I'm a ... the uh the pick for the weekend Sunday when sunshine and temperatures back down to the upper forties cooler uh\nProbably forty below fifty somewhere around and\nTalk before we accept the clocks back next week and we have these dark mornings now\nI think you'd agree out looking outside of the street lights are still on you know we are uh you know ... by what six forty seven or ... whatever the time is and we're still dark out the other son will not come up officially today obviously we're not going to see it come up with seven for the team the sun will be rising this morning\nAnd so the kids at the school buses wanting this is talk about this every year\nSince they changed the times of setting the clocks back\nWe used to set the clocks back earlier than we do now so because of this the the small window of opportunity as the price we pay would delaying those those late afternoon ... afternoon situations are these dark mornings\nSo you want to be very careful this morning to 'em or not you personally but everyone listening ah with the outside of the bus stops or anyone walking sidewalks the trains and dumped on how to borrow\nA the only our again not even severely seven o'clock but it's still fairly dark out there so you want to be careful make sure you have your lights on either going to be really really through about eight eight thirty this morning and again or perhaps the wake up call for some with a thunderstorm so\nI kind of an interesting morning time to get a eating that wakeup call with thunder if you're still sleep it off\nAnd then also uh the fact that we have these dark mornings when we set the clocks back one our next weekend this upcoming weekend costs a reminder it's the weekend before the election\nOnce we do that then we'll have writer times for a little while in the morning but will also have a sunset next Sunday this upcoming Sunday sunset time will be a quarter of five in the late afternoon\nWell I Know what that is that's you know make sure those headlines aren't clean\nWell I Know what that is that's you know make sure those headlines are clean and you know when you're driving on the roads are the same like on yes the changing of the clocks moving them back the hour is wide November fourth the number\nOf whatever Sunday at two AM officially is so are we going to the fourth of July I Am okay or as a as as they say when you go to sleep so you don't ... I used to do something [laughter] yeah when you go that used\nTo wake up or that they they love to get to sleep till they go to sleep on on the Saturday it's always been a Saturday you know two am Sunday ... go to sleep Saturday Night but they've set the alarm at two AM to wake up so they could set the clock back and then go back to sleep\nBut like what are you crazy you know it's ridiculous the joke thing they like to know what they say if you do it at two AM will come on you don't have to do it to a gym that's why they tell you you know when I ... unless you forget do it before you go to sleep\nSo you don't have to set an alarm to wake up and get lousy sleep so you can turn the clock back and then go back to sleep\nAnd locally as you know a route one can get a little congested into a traffic not looking too bad here\nIn the local area we are at a ... about a minute to go before our top of the hour break and then we will have our first guest of the day Edinburgh firefighter Paul Jake's he's also the legislative aide to the union here and he's got some great news for you and a\nSort of things going on in the schools so a poll Jake's always nice to have a firefighter in Studio ... what what do we say good morning ... now make sure we get you're on the right my cars that you power\nThere yes it is good morning I'm thinking of having a few are losing ...\nW.

open house a self ... uh where we started talking about this show and um it was a great event open to Republican all the families and kids and everyone really enjoyed it\nBut we go into the schools are similar to ... uh it's called safe student awareness of fire education and we go into the schools in ah teach fire safety tips are at all levels and even to the seniors as well okay\nWe're talking about the open house you had do they ever enjoy going down there I have some grand kids that were there but the the the kids love the fact that\nThey can get on to the to the fire engines they take you around and show you how they work and I saw you spraying the whole is with the kids how exciting is that for the young people to to see\nReally up close what you folks do\nAll the kids love it I mean they they get to come in and as you said take part in what we do every day or you know and\nAs far as kids or you know they come in and have a great time and and just imagine having that feeling every day coming to work that's that's pretty much do we feel we come to work you know we have the best job in the world to us and uh really enjoy it so getting to share that experience with the other kids is a really good\nYou hold on I think every day that you don't have to go out and battle a five alarm warehouse fire or you know having or something like happened in ...\nI've alarm warehouse fire or you know having a something like happened in North of or I guess over the weekend there was a house fire there\nA where um the I guess it was a faulty a furnace and the basement with some smoke damaged but nobody was injured I'm Talking to us a little bit about uh\nYou know how you started as a firefighter why did you want to get into this business and what does it take in the way of education to begin a firefighter career\n[noise] no I as far as getting on the ah the job Massachusetts or for civil service department such as ... or if you take social service test and they give that every two years\nAnd then you uh get on the list on today's age we've come to wear a paramedics are are are the norm and really a need to have that level if you are one of a better shot at getting on 'cause a lot of places are hiring paramedics absolutely\n... being a paramedic or having that training is certainly a good ... for getting on a fire fire department basically absolutely okay my guest is Paul Jay Z and how long have you on the fire here\nUh almost twenty five years down so any finance ... while\nIn I'm sure you've enjoyed every minute of it has there ever been any I mean what is the most dangerous situations you occurred over the years that you can remember\nI mean uh you know it's it's been it's been a great career a look forward to a continuing it you know and and see what happens on the future brings you never know what you can expect every day uh it's different a different scenario everyday you never know what's gonna happen [noise] um it's been a lot of a tragic events in ...\nUh that we've had to respond to um you know some of the big ones that people may recognize you know such as a fire goes you know lots of let ah the gas explosion on George Street a lot\nAh the gas explosion on George Street a lot\nOf a lot of car accidents or even earlier a couple of this week and last week up on the highway and you know some tragic incidents there are so uh it's um it's definitely a team effort or we do our job together or we do our job\nMy best we can serve the public and are really glad you know like you said earlier we don't you know you don't want these things to happen and that's one of the reasons going into the schools doing fire prevention and trying to teach the youth safety tips so as they get older and they can prevent these things from happening\nBut with human error in accidents or you know that's part of what keeps our job going or fire\nSafety chips I'm going into the schools um I I was that taught do you go in and just talk to kids about here's what could happen we're in October [noise]\nDo you have a fireplace uh what's your heating system like uh how's the wiring how is that information\nI'm given to the children and how how do they reacted give us a little idea of how that process happens with the with the students on all levels\nIt's a there's many different ways um what we're doing right now is because of fiber venture month um but we can go in throughout the year and give individual classroom instruction so we can do that too we meet with the schools in the school department and the\nAnd get those set up but what we're doing right now is kind of on a I'm\nA a presentation level where like grades K wanting to get together as one group and then grades three and four get together as one group and we uh\nWe meet with all of them so it can imagine all those kids in those grade levels like stuck in four or five hundred kids some times in one one setting a which is you know it it's great I mean it's very energizing the kids really like it\nAnd uh we have a short a talk in the beginning\nUh we have a video a presentation than after we talk about the video different things\n[noise] uh we have a

you know and you have a lot of questions but there's more stories and they're all what ifs so it's it's really good it's it's great and screen now you mentioned\nCrawl\nIn or if they're small so the kids learn that if there is a fire or they're in their bedroom and smoke is starting to build up get low on the ground and try to get themselves out of that situation correct\nAbsolutely you know they

two zero one nine three\nAgain some heavy shower is not moving through no nothing like we had the last week\nBut certainly some rumbles have thunder and lightning within the next hour in the ... area\nAnd then a few more scattered showers through about twelve o'clock and then I expect the sun or to be coming up writer as the afternoon progress as mid fifties not bad temperature wise or then we'd dry up tonight with clear skies well becoming clear down around forty not a bad day to tomorrow all kinds of sunshine in fact northwest wins breezy\nAbout Fifteen twenty miles an hour high about

wind's turned southwest are probably somewhere around fifty five in the late afternoon early evening and then the first day of November\nI Will get into the middle sixties with sunshine breezy conditions are next chance of a rain event after this morning looks to be friday\nThat one could contain some heavy downpours as we continue with this overall a rather wet weather pattern intersperse

driving cars you know there are things called trains buses subways even taxis movers in lists for heaven's sakes [noise]\nUm but if you think your commute is tough now wow wow just wait until every car on the road is computer programmed\nTo follow the rules while wow\nMillions millions and millions of cars program to drive like our own beloved Tom Rath pretty\nYou think it takes you a long time to get somewhere now just wait in a recent survey by M. I. T. the Massachusetts Institute of technology who I used to be a big fan of but MIT or might be the world leaders and artificial intelligence yeah\nA according or in a recent survey by M. I.

knock down our door and we invited you when we get to know you and while it was what a great person [laughter] for the city council I thought I'm\nAnd you're now nine months in tune\nYou out with her and so I still very much for like a political newcomer so I appreciate this opportunity to go on here and I introduced myself a little bit\nWell I one of the things that we that I wanted to do for a long time to talk about leadership leadership in general not you know specifics 'cause this there is something that we can learn there that will make us better leader is whether it's in our families or\nIn our community or you know\nAt our church or whatever um that are followers to 'em so you know there's some skills to some knowledge that goes with it and I thought you would your three deployments to Iraq\nOnly two ... went to Afghanistan one term Iraq and went to Afghanistan and how old are your kids then\nUm they weren't around when I was in Iraq and um but then my oldest was four when I was over in Afghanistan and uh it is interesting so I left him at home with\nAnd I stand in a\nIt is interesting so I I left him at home with mom for ... for about a year and when she potty trained them and\n[laughter] it may be a little piece of is yeah his childhood I bought you felt that you had to do to go and serve the country\nIt was really a choice necessarily um I I definitely felt obligated to re enlist time and again it and\nLook at my military service and my decision to join the Army National guard is one of the best decisions I've made my life for a while it's it's taught me a lot and it's in the Army National guard is just the you know the one weekend about two weeks during the summer it's sort of thing\nIn Philly we're way for Eighteen months to go to Iraq or a year to go to Afghanistan and all of that but normally it's it's a part time thing um and it's really fascinating to sort of be working at a civilian job as a as a as a software guy and then found a way to go\nBe an intelligence analyst and have meetings with all sorts of interesting people\nDirections you [laughter] and nor Mrs lay their two completely different worlds\nYeah um but it's also I Am very proud of of that service that I've done it and I I I met my wife and the army and like the joke that you learn how to drive in Iraq\n[laughter] was she in the army she if she wasn't she she was over in Iraq with us and no should understand no apps absolutely are very much on a\nYou you have um a wonderful Facebook page and and I seen taking your oldest son to climb mount Washington ... ... you know so I Would say that's a that's an example the family leadership okay you know you and your wife lead your family\nAnd is able to family leadership okay you know you and your wife lead your family you're near a natural leaders in that role one parent um all kinds of leadership though I'm Talking about a far Italian leadership and I'm Sorry ... leadership if you ever thought about that\nI I don't know the difference but I Know um if somebody\nTells you to do something a force of the ... in ... years ago for all day and you're supposed to obey you're not going to do that to your full potential in ... and whatnot as opposed to was it in ...\nI ... you know like ... parents if we've been around children we know a lot of our children we love children then we're you know we read up on how to be a good parent and and we just bring all those skills to the floor for that task well it's a\nPort in anything you do as much as possible has meaning and you have you ever ... and all those things yeah absolutely yeah\nYeah but a mindful late to do that that absolutely um it's here all day and then it's kind of mindless it can be\nSo in the only reason I hesitate is sometimes I'll push my kids to do something and say we're going to go do this and it's not until where at the top of mount Washington that they're like oh this was the coolest things I've ever done yeah\nWell I think that's that's that's our bar attained his leadership is like I Know these kids will come alive out there in the woods\nAnd I don't necessarily agree with that style of leadership but sometimes you have to I Choose to use that to to get my kids out on the adventures of any sort of I I think those\nEd ventures of any sort of I I think those those life experiences are incredibly important\nWhen you are the authority when you're the parents they have limited knowledge so a certain amount of authoritarian leadership is is I Would imagine appropriate I never thought of that before [laughter]\nWhy not give it a try like an experiment and then later on it can be change when people like more familiarity with it I mean I I'm a raging liberal so [laughter] but I mean I can see the benefits as a\nCompromise it I did too and I was very proud of it because after that change it it I May of ... I didn't get what I wanted\nBut ultimately the overall ordinance changed passed unanimously and I was very happy that we sort of supporting came together for that matter um in that\nAnd you are doing a little bit or indirect effect on other is that you were in can\nPush and being noxious that you were going to continue to respect them even though you\nAnd I could have tried to play games and if an amendment was made\nGames and it would be\nIf an amendment was made and it was a perfect I could've been tack that aspect of it as opposed to discussing the ideas are based on the merits of the ideas from home so I thought that was important it was one of\nIt is the the one moment that I'm most proud of him so far not not necessarily passing the the ordinance itself but the way the Calderon other than work together ...\nSo what are the qualities that a person needs when they have to change their their mind or cooperate or collaborate in order to get a good decision\nWhy I've no idea [laughter]\nWhat are the I mean I I come from a ministerial background or so\nI'm thinking you have to have a certain humility I agree\nI very much agree I I think you know we can come in and say I know all the answers and I'm right and you're walking and you know that leads to what we have in Washington [laughter] now and and um you know the authoritarian mentality down there\nThat everybody that disagrees should just roll over and play dead is is poison\nI mean I think that's why city councils are great because we have to live with each other you know you we\nHave to go there on the trees are going to see\nEach other and and buy you a compromising or being flexible the next time there's something they want you know there may be more give and take\nOr at least the merits of the ideas Frank will will with two guys are ...\nGiven to different viewpoints than they were on and\nI don't mean this in terms of personality is on the city council I mean general and how we get along\nI ... in that comes with the middle of humility to like you said yeah yeah it's it's incredible\nHumility to like you said yeah yeah it's it's incredibly important yeah um I could use more of it but [laughter]\nIf you ask my wife [laughter]\n[noise] um but ... it's\nNot sure if she has ways of telling you that certainly is [laughter] I mean not in our spouses\nThat me and my spouse or my husband is is is it might get desk go hide in just about everything I Do you mean 'cause I Know he he sold fair and he's so kind and he knows how to put things in the general is way\nAnd I don't get my feelings hurt and they don't come I backed out um but I Do come to that place of humility because of the respect that we share for one another\nIt's common set of values [laughter] it is\nYou talked about the the army values of loyalty duty respect\nLoyalty Judy respect\nThe fourth one is self uh self with service which is selfless\nService so which isn't giving over of yourself to a greater benefits and then we'll come to us he will benefit others and we may not get any benefit from\nIt looking at the overall benefit as opposed to any personal gain is um\nWhat's the best thing for our as a community that you know the question that a lot of leaders would ask themselves\nAnd there was at one point or a friend of mine has suggested oh why don't you go to this event or or do this and it will be great come reelection time to to show your ... and I I ...

[noise]\nAnd welcome again to exploring mental illness everything you wanted to know but were afraid to ask I'm Derek mall and I'm here with\nCary balloon Kerry how are you doing today I'm going in conflict there carried a you know a little off um functionally depressed let's put it that way ups and downs but uh you know it's how you are it's how you come back from that stuff so I gave myself a a day\nBut you can't let yourself get you know more than one day because of the day turns into two turns into a week and it turns into a month\nSo I'm I get myself a day yesterday and you know down here and you know to these new game yeah you're trying to let people know that I'm I feel a little lost right now but that's okay and that's a natural feeling and outgoing\nI feel a little loss right now but that's okay and that's a natural feeling you're not going crazy when you feel lost it just you know mental illness you know you can control it but they're mitigating factors that happened and you've got to focus in on all your training\nI didn't want to let it get out of hand so I made up a you know I'm seeing my psychologist tomorrow so I'm trying to be very proactive at this point because I don't want to let it get any worse which I I doubt it will\nBut you know you just you do with it and um you know I'm here which is good didn't cancel so uh that's a positive thing for the day so why don't you introduce our ah I guess that you've brought in a today thank\nYou so with us today we have Dr Scott health name Dr Hudson is the medical director at ... hospital doctor how can you do want to tell us a little bit about yourself and your background with mental health\nWell it's a pleasure to be on the show when and to get a chance to meet Derek and to talk to the audience I've been a psychiatrist for about Thirty years I I keep losing count because every year it goes up a year and a as it came came to Brown University as an undergraduate than to medical school\nHere then went on to Yale University to complete my psychiatry residency program and had been residing more or less in the\nUh Rhode Island or or their southeastern Massachusetts area working in those areas so it's nice to be here talking to the audience is and and I I'm struck with Derek ...\nObservations about both where he kind of is taking his own pulse as it were on barometer kind of saying himself but I'm going to get up today and in and do this whether you want to call it a task or a source of pleasure\nBut my thoughts were that probably even by the end of just spending or however many amount of time you do the pod cast for just by nature of doing it in gauging it and participating hearing yourself hearing us I I'm going to guess that you will feel bad\nTeaching it participating hearing yourself hearing us I I'm going to guess that you will feel better because it it's going to give you a sense of purpose and and give you a sense that you continue to move forward instead of waking up in the morning thinking of yourself as just sliding back so I'm Glad to be on the show and I'm certainly glad that you\nGot out of bed and are making this happen because that make it happen for everyone here\nThat was one of the things that was important to me that you're a psychiatrist and your psychologist like I have both an out patient ... butler hospital they monitor my meds and then I have my psychologist [noise]\nThe thing is and we had touched upon this last show you your doctors don't want to see just when you're good they need to see you when you're bad to as much as I felt bad today I felt the need to tell people that you know hey I'm not doing too good today but I can still function I can still get out there\nAnd this means a lot to me so people know listen it's okay to feel bad it's just how long you let yourself feel bad which is when you get into trouble\nSo just by getting up today knowing that I had to do this and getting out you know as I was driving over here I felt already better because I was out the sun was out at the window cracked open the you know the cool air so and this is important to me 'cause I hopefully you know people can hear this and and and learn a little bit from it so\nI agree that you know sometimes I Will have patients that will say well doc I didn't want to I don't want to tell you I was feeling bad I I didn't want to feel like you weren't doing a good job as a doctor like dude it's not about it's not about me and my feelings it's about what you're experiencing so I support there when it's time to see your doctor you you you want to lay out where you are and\nAnd that doesn't mean by the way that every time now you you talked about your psychologist that\nOf course as a psychiatrist I'm also able to use medications and I think sometimes people are afraid well if I tell my psychiatrist I'm having a bad day he's going to change all my meds he's going to go up on my meds and when I tell people and and by the way some psychiatrists do but what I tell people is look\nThat's what I tell people ... by the way some psychiatrists do but what I tell people is look you're entitled to have a bad day or even a bad week it doesn't necessarily mean that we have to change medications\nOr we need to take a look at what's going on what the stresses are and then maybe a maybe medication changes need to be thought of but there may be other ways of approaching that don't include medications\nYeah my psychiatrist said I ... butler um they said the exact same thing you know they'll they'll look at my file\nAnd they will make a good judgment you know what you're having a bad week there's no reason to change the meds if there was some adverse psychological differences that they would notice and mean I've been at butler for a Twenty years and I've been with my psychologist for twenty five years\nSo and they share information which is the best thing\nSo if they're thinking about a minute change I'll tell them you know can you called that my my doctor\nAnd at least talk things over and then they come to a great conclusion and they realize you know listen you just got to get out if you functionally depressed that's better than just being depressed and staying in so I'm Glad that you're one of those doctors who realizes also that just because you have a bad day\nDoesn't mean that oh my God we got to you know up his meds\nSo our topic today is actually clinical depression and which is one of the reasons they want to get bring Dr hertz behind kick discuss further what exactly is the definition of clinical depression\nWill you know wouldn't psychiatry we we don't have the luxury of somebody coming to me as a doctor and I said well let me just send you for blood work let me just send you for an X ray will figure out what your diagnosis is\nAre and that has the knowledge to help them solve it I can really go a long way to make somebody feel like they're back on the tractor getting better ... are good but they're not the only answer\nAnd that's something that I definitely live in ... in in a few minutes says is successful treatment and and treatment models that you've seen\n'em you know I think that we encounter a lot in society that sticks that mentality whereas if I get on a regime and I feel better and better and it's done it and I'm short and so I'm going to stop my treatment because I feel better\nUm I think that when it comes to chronic illnesses you know we we continue to struggle with people who feel as though once had better they can ... their treatments become optional are are now in ... would you agree with that\nThink it's a risk most researchers believe that if you've had her first episode of depression\nThat you should be staying on that medication if you needed medication to get well and they should be saying on medication for nine months a two year a and if you've been to therapy ... therapies really helping\nYou don't turn around and say okay I'm feeling better now let me just stopped seeing a therapist you work with the therapist and you'd kind of negotiate around when would be a good time to start cutting back with treatment how will I Know when I'm feeling worse what can I Do to get better at about fifty percent of people that have a depressive episode may not have a another recurrence\nFifty percent of people that have a depressive episode may not have a another recurrent episode\nHowever if you're one of those people who've had a number of episodes than with each episode you have the chance of having a recurrence goes up and say what a certain point most doctors will say it makes sense for you to ... to be on an antidepressant medications and stay on antidepressant medications\nIn that case I agree with you sometimes people will say well now I started back on it and I'm feeling well again let me stop ah I think that's unfortunately that's that's just not how this particular illness works and I gave the example of myself\nYour listeners can't see me but I have very light skin so I'm very prone to sunburn\nIf I go out in the sun I have to wear sun block and I've got to wear a hat and I have to do that every day\nSo it is it's not like I can say to myself okay for the last month I view sun block every day I went to had every day I haven't got a bit of sunburn I'm past that now tomorrow I can go out without some block and a half you know my susceptibility getting sunburned doesn't go away just 'cause I managed to\nHave no problems with it for a while it's it's they're it's they're all the time and I need to manage it all the time and I obviously major depression is a lot different than having fair skin\nBut the point is that because you're feeling better because you've managed it doesn't mean that it's okay to withdraw the thing\nThat may be helping you feel better and healthier you need to do that under the supervision of your doctor\nYou know I I Know that I have a chemical imbalance\nAnd I think people don't realize when they get off the image cold turkey\nThere is a weaning down point that you have to adjust to you can't just get off your medicines and that's going to bring the symptoms back probably sometimes even worse and it was one time I was on seven different anxiety meds for my anxiety my panic attacks and depression I'm Down to two\nDifferent anxiety meds for my anxiety my pack up the tax and depression I'm Down to two\nBecause I have a checklist now I Know that I'm going to have them every now and then\nBut if my brain has been so trained to go through my checklist to make sure it's not a low blood sugar\nTo make sure it's not a high blood sugar to make sure it's not my heart and I go down that and by the time on them and going down that the panic or the anxiety is done in the same thing I Do with my depression okay what am I feeling what did I Do last night while I tape shows that I Would normally watch\nRight that's a sign I've been over sleeping and then I make you know I I write down in the journal I make my costs corrections\nBut but as far as getting off the meds people don't realize if you get them off cold turkey the side effects\nCould make you feel even worse\nThan what you came in for a ... average you agree with that you know you\nCan you can you have a double whammy you may have withdrawal effects that are going to feel a lot like depression and then in some cases the depression could come back and even if you choose to pay for them to get off them you still want to do that in consultation because\nYou know my my thought is\nGood for you you went from seven minutes to two and you're probably feel just as good if not better on two meds but that doesn't mean you can go from two to zero without that doctors consent because it may be that those two meds are one of those demand is the difference between being able to function and becoming suicidal\nWell it's funny that you bring that up because there was one time when I thought I was completely broken and that there was I was never going to get over this and and I know that this is going to be I'm going to have this 'til the day I die but I can still live a productive life\nBut there was one time when I said you know what to hell with all this I'm just going to get off my meds and I and I went off all my meds and that's where I first attempt at my suicide and a funny story I had was off all my meds and I started taking my pills and I had a panic attack\nOf all my meds and I started taking my pills\nAnd I had a panic attack because I was afraid I was going to die and I was just like on his right of course you idiot you're gonna die you're taking pills so I put my pills back and I will not you know I'll never do it again because I Know it was dumb thing to do I call my therapist left messages for them at four in the morning told them what I had just done\nAnd they were condemned\nTo reach out to any family or friends in the interim because I think when you're in that situation if you're a therapist isn't available you want to reach out to\nYeah I'd I'd I'd hold my mom got and woke her up I'm sure lives down the gate but total what I had done but I was laughing so she was scared but I think she had a sense that she knew that and and all my friends you know I share that with my friends and told them you know nothing is that bad where you need to do that\nAnd um I can laugh about it because it was actually really funny to me when\nAnd it saved my life because I mean here I Am having a panic attack afraid to die and I'm just like so I also called nine one one I went to the hospital I take in less than some people take for a normal dose\nSo they said you're going to be a little sleepy and the following day I went to both butler into my psychologist and they just wanna make sure I had a plan in place which I did they were very happy with everything that had gone on\nAnd I would I Would never do that again\nI'm you think about it but now it's just it's just not the it's just not for me\nWhile you're on your may underestimate the effect that people will say doc I don't think these measures are doing anything for me I still feel lousy and obviously that's not my goal my goal is for people to feel good\nBut but what they'll say is but then I stopped my meds and I realized oh my God now I remember what lousy years yeah so you're kind of have this this memory that gee even though you're thought as the Mets aren't doing anything in comparison to what life is like without them they really are helping that's important to keep in mind\nSo given that brought up a a a good point when you were talking about political ...\nKeep in mind so given that brought up a a a good point when you were talking about chemical imbalance I think we hear a lot about chemical imbalance says and I and and I think I Would like to know more Dr ... about the science behind fashion\nWell we use the phrase chemical imbalance to to help kind of get rid of the mystery of mental illness and to also understand that there is some type of biological some type of chemical foundation for our current belief system in and it's it's a model that's worked in terms of figure out how to get people well\nIs that there are certain neural chemicals in the brain neurotransmitters namely serotonin and nor up in ...\nThat are associated with people feeling relaxed in energized a calm and even free of depression\nAnd that the theory is that some people for one reason or another aren't generating enough of these feel good chemicals or they are for some reason they don't have the proper receptors in their brain to make use of them\nSo it's one way of increasing feel good chemicals is to do things that feel good\nSo people that uh exercise regularly and there's one study that showed that people with regular exercise responding just as well as a people that take an antidepressant Zoloft\nOr to their depression so exercising regularly eating proper foods having regular regimented life doing meaningful things like volunteering or more even doing exciting and engaging things like ah\nGoing skiing or sky diving you know those things can energize somebody make them feel positive and they actually can change brain chemicals we can we learn ways using therapies to alter people's brain chemicals\nOr during the depression but likewise these medications can also\n[noise] er during the depression but likewise these medications can also change brain chemicals and sometimes people want that short got that like I don't really want to die and I don't I don't want to eat well ah I Want to be you know two hundred pounds overweight and I want to sit around and watch TV all day just give me a medicine that's going to make me feel better\nOr in my experience the medicines don't work as well if you're not taking care of yourself at the same time so the brain chemicals respond to ... but they also respond to behaviors and actions of the individual\nBecause of serotonin in the endorphins will start to kick in you know make you feel even better you know when I when I'm feeling down like I walked in the park this morning and I knew I had to be up today and I decided to just take a walk to make myself feel better and to motivate myself to get here today I was outside I felt a lot better than being locked up in my apartment ... you've got to get out there and\nSome people will say well you know my depression is so bad that it prevents me from getting out there and I think that sometimes the real the real double whammy as like I Know I should be doing these things but my depression feel so bad and then I Would say basically well at that point you don't ask yourself how you feel\nDon't do a little self analysis they do I feel like walking today it's simply a matter of saying\nI have to walk you know Sunday's come and uh I have to take out the garbage because the garbage man comes on Monday I asked myself on Sunday nights I really feel like taking out the garbage tonight I I have to do it because of I don't I'm stuck with garbage for another right so you don't want to necessarily if you're trying to get in some regiment of behavioral therapy\nIt before we wrap I think that the next ... final question I have seen as mentioned Simmons seek help well it's never I mean if you're not\nSure whether you should seek help go ahead and ask a you know unless you're watching house in everything in the world makes you think that you need help\nOr in which case you should still ask for help us\nYou know I'm ... ... if your friends and your family are coming up to saying I'm worried are the first time they may say it you may just say will stop worrying but if you're hearing it from several different people or someone you love her trust\nYou know if my wife says ah Scott I think you're being a Salt Key lately you know then I'll reach out to my friend is my is my wife right or you know my right\nAnd my friend who usually say Scott your wife is always right\nAnd this is the his strategy for me staying married and happily so if you're if families and friends are saying I think there's a problem you should listen to that\nIf you are used a certain kind of way of viewing the world and it's changed significantly everything feels like it's gray or uh you can't enjoy things the way you used to or it may be signs of depression and you may have a reason you may say yeah but you know I I\nYou know I've lost a loved one or I had a recent job change and sometimes those can be normal reactions but if those normal reactions go on day in and day out and start to affect your daily ability\nTo function it's time to ask for help\nI just wanted to add to that I think also on on on that note that friends and people around if they think something's wrong and don't be afraid\nOh that friends and people around if they think something's wrong and don't be afraid to to pony intervention or do something to help these people because we had to do that with my mom she was an alcoholic\nAnd she you know you have the problem you have to know you have the problem and then finally got family friends together and got her on the street now and I think that can go with mental illness also if you're pushing somebody away you know you might want to try to help them out it's better to be safe than sorry\nSo I guess what you're saying is on the other side of it or can you do anything to help your friends who appear to be suffering from psychiatric illness and the answer's yes absolutely uh whether it's a one on one talk or to get other friends and families together um even to call\nYou know if I'm a spouse in I'm worried about my spouse or I may call the primary care doctor and I may say look\nI'm my wife's coming in for a visit next week I'm worried about these things you know the doctor I you know I said make your own decision as a doctor but I just thought it was important for you to notice and and hope and trust that the doctor will take that into consideration\nWhen does it become emergency well it becomes an emergency when someone stops taking care of themselves they're no longer able to er nurse themselves properly start losing weight\nUm they stopped eating they stopped going to work\nOne of the biggest emergencies if it's a young mother with a a baby because ah maybe getting postpartum depression and not only is the mother at risk but the baby itself is at risk\nAnd of course uh if somebody starts to get to the point where they feel like life's not worth living and feel totally hopeless and the next step is often are beginning to think of ways of taking your own life\nOr which point you should definitely get help because there is help for you\nAnd we will definitely

Sorry I didn't hear anything we live in the game but that's okay we have many more to go and we are going to take that time and I just know it and hey James what's going on in the weather I woke up came out and it is raining\nYeah renting a first real a coastal storm of the season to lay and we'll probably have anymore these over the coming months but uh this one will be rain it's not going to be snow so that's the good news I guess preventing a but yeah the rain has moved right on schedule and we're going to have a centrally all day today\nAre the heaviest or the rain or is likely to be mid morning for mid afternoon now everything is going to be going from South to North so the heaviest or the rain now on the south coast will move through the greater adult or area or through late morning and early afternoon and then a little bit lighter later in the day and so the further north you are say Europe\nOr maybe you're heading to the Boston area today it will be a little later there\nFor everything but everyone is going to get it so uh I Know you're concerned about uh the Newport\nArea right Rangel two o'clock or so a heavy rain a forty five\nAn hour wind gusts up by five o'clock though there at the winds will start to ease the house so the later in the afternoon if you're down near the south coast or the ... the storm center which right now is ah right near Salisbury, Maryland\nIt's going to be passing of rights just about over us about midnight tonight so it's going to go from Salisbury, Maryland to or the greater edible area by midnight tonight\nAnd between now that is what we have the rough weather now are there is going to be the issue with the strong winds the leaves are still on most of the trees or at least a good Seventy five eighty percent of the leaves are still on the trees so when they get beat down by the rain they act like sales in the strong winds and we're going to how likely have a lot of leaves around that initially\nLike sales in the strong winds and we're going to how likely have a lot of leaves around that initially leads to clog storm drains so if you do have a storm drain near your house or wherever you live\nIn you know oh every year I Know that rain sometimes clogs well at the clock it that's a good thing because we're going to get up to two inches of rain by tonight that means any or grains that are clogged it caused massive a big puddles in the roadways\nOr so a lot of high low planting street flooding\nAnd that also because those leaves act like sales were going to have the leaves come off the branches come off\nAnd even a few trees come down because of the very soft ground we went through this last March when we had those nor'easter is of course that was in a different situation it was certainly a lot colder and some of that with snow but bottom line we're going to have again out scattered power outages across much of the area this afternoon into this evening now again there'll be spotty and isolated\nA bit with branch actions so it'll be quick to fix as I like to say but I Do expect a ... a few power on who's it's really the luck of the draw the rule of thumb is always\nIn this situation if you live in a neighborhood there's a lot of trees going through wires that we'll have power outages the extreme example is\nDowntown Adel barrel likely will not have a power outage because there's almost no trees around to fall on the wires and think about that it does make sense now good news for tomorrow Elaine and I'll have another update right after eight o'clock a little more extensive if you want\nA cause I Know you have some stuff coming up\nTomorrow mostly cloudy a high in the mid fifties but even peaks of sun not a great sunny day all to all the time but the southwest breeze will be a ten to twenty miles an hour today uh I'd say the peak of the winds will be around forty forty five miles an hour\nAnd again that's enough would leave trees to take down the limbs much better tomorrow I wouldn't call it a beautiful day but much better tomorrow and here's the good news and again I'll have another update Elaine just after rate right now it's still looks pretty good for Wednesday Halloween uh on\nThey have to re right now it's still looks pretty good for Wednesday Halloween a on a Wednesday with temperatures in the middle fifties during the day trick or treaters late afternoon will probably facing fifty three fifty four degrees which one you think about it for the last day of October is pretty good\nWow yeah I Know because everybody's so excited about Halloween so what are you going to be for Halloween Jim\nCharlie Brown I ever ever yeah 'cause I looked like Charlie\n... uh that's really great that I just went out and I got my flow from progressive costume and quick recently so we\nHaven't had an over the years away\nOver the years have you ever been on Halloween the old woman in the shoe\n... no no no no okay okay [laughter] I don't know I I but I Know it was sort of positive thing but with you with the shoes and everything else I\nRaise right yeah and that time I get to maybe next year [laughter] go again I have to have shoes first I don't have shoes right now [laughter]\nWell\nToday thinking of that and again I'll have another update right after eight o'clock or ... more like a you know\nGood water repellent shoes and closed today 'cause\nWins the lady that could be coming sideways obviously driving the raid into you know make sure you have your lights on obviously you you see the effects\nThis morning of the late sunrise until we set the clocks back next week and we're going to have these dark mornings here we are almost seven thirty and you look outside the street lights are still on right and that's because we haven't set the clocks back yet once we do next week next weekend or\nWe will have a little bit brighter conditions in the morning for a couple of weeks but a a real dreary situation out there so you want to be very careful again the worst of at the height of the storm in the greater ... area Providence is between around nine ten o'clock and around three or four this afternoon and that means that that's when we'll have the strongest wins in the heaviest rains okay\nThe stuff we don't know about me but that's when we'll have the strongest went to the W ...\nOkay well I appreciate you do not think yours doesn't look like it's going to be a great a great day to stay indoors and a ... D jays and watch a lotta movies today right\nYeah it's definitely a good idea what's a good look quite school food is a lot about that tomorrow in a way to the rustic or just up record\nGreat Jim thank you All right guys I have a few minutes so I before I bring Julie hall and I want to read some of the things so today is the eleventh artful autumn fair\nFrom ... Saturday and Sunday ten AM to four o'clock at bricks nursery this is one of the best shows ever honest to God they have arts and crafts really beautiful flowers and things like that and that is happening today\nSo today and tomorrow and a bricks nurseries located at Kelly boulevard ten AM to four o'clock so you don't want to miss that\nAlso a Canterbury chapel harvest festival is today from eight thirty which is going to be starting soon to three o'clock and they have all kinds of oh\nMy God I listen to this they already have their frozen apple pie is ready for the holidays they have pumpkins and face decorating entertainment Russell tables\nThey have a whole bunch of craft or isn't so much more so it starts at eight thirty to three that's a harvest festival Canterbury chapel and that's located at three eighty oneself\nMain street in outer borough one other thing that Julie ... oh oh listen to this the steam punk festival is happening in Arab world today and it's free from ten AM to six rain or shine and that's a good thing and it's open to the public held in seven location some of them are the Arab world public library\nThe admiral area and dusty museum where we are [laughter] that they have a teapot racing a lot of children's activities there's so much so much going on arts and crafts and so many\nThere's so much so much going on arts and crafts and so many fun things to do you'll see people dressed in costumes and oh my God so much more so that starting today at ten AM to six o'clock you don't want to miss that and on Halloween Night\nAt five o'clock listen bring the kids down to oh my God the unlikely story bookstore in Plainfield because uh mister Kenny is going to\nUm like on the thirteenth edition of diary of a wimpy kid book the meltdown he's going to be launching Jeff can you is going to be launching his book and locally here in Plainfield on\nOctober thirty first which is Halloween I Know but take the kids there five o'clock go down there and uh get an autographed copy of it and then go trick or treating that'd be really really great so um and if I have time I will read more uh one more thing I Do want to mention before I take a break and then I'll bring\nUm just different problems basically with the way the overall management or mismanagement I guess\nProblems basically with the way the overall management or mismanagement I guess I'm going to say the word of ... Ga so I think governor Baker and the rest of the legislature um [noise]\nYou know I really try to help fix that and you know I think it's going to take a long time and it took many years to to break it I guess or get into the the bad poor shape that it's and so we just have to pick away at it\nUm one of the most important things so for us here in outer borough is we need to watch very closely when they have those meetings\nAbout changing route and dropping um stations off the line\nBecause long would ask in particular is one that actually came up and long without that that that station right there that's where all the medical facilities that right you have to be ... like you know if I could pick out any you know little piece of genius at some point in time I\nI Want to remind people that it is important to go to those meetings and it is important to listen very carefully when they do talk about changing stations especially for Apple borough\nUm a lot of the people that you see living in the towers perhaps and also\nClose by to the center here\nYou know if you take that line off of their ... what are they going to going to be stuck out here and you know with no transportation so be careful of that right exactly\nWho manages the MBTA who what governing agency so you know I it's interesting I thought that the state man it's like they don't we don't you know it's it's it's as I was reading I was ... I was trying to figure\nThat out myself I Would probably say there is some Transportation Department that does it but\nI don't I think you know in terms of the [noise]\nFrom what I can see if it was an independent agency oh no you know like an independent kind of thing so I mean I may be that and and that's something like I said I Am just now looking into that that mice\nAnd that's something like I said I Am just now\nLooking into that that myself as to what kind of went around the governor step in if it's a question I have exactly you know it's the same thing that you've seen with the with the gas unfortunately when I and the governor step into these things what should the governor step and\nYou know and I know there's some logic that keep you know government you know we don't want to look like where the government you know step right things that that they shouldn't be stepping into so those are some interesting things that I'm seeing happening lately in Massachusetts is when does the actually executive authority of the state ...\nYou know step in right right exactly\nYou know it says you're that independently owned an ... they have their own CEO and everything yeah yeah well you know what somebody's got to be accountable well for sure and I I Do know that the governor is working and stuff I Do know there is some kind of steering committee good it's an oversight board\nSee that it's coming to me thank you [laughter] know that'd be great oh my God well let's get back to um uh some of the differences between you\nAnd a representative Hawkins yeah I think one of the biggest differences that I can say is you know I have legislated here Fadel borough\nBeing on the city council I've had the experience with a couple of different budget cycles\nI've been on the planning board you know I when you when you're on the city council you have to know everything I mean what goes on in the city from a very detailed level for taxes you know things I think that really matter to people the taxes um the budget\nYou know which department you know you deal with the schools you deal with the seniors all of the department's public safety all of the things that that operation we run a city so you know if I have experience with that and I think when you move up to the next level if you're just ...\nI have experience with that and I think when you move up to the next level if you're just legislating being on the city council is a legislative branch of the city being a state rep is a legislative branch of the state uh-huh so I'm just moving I'm really just moving up to the next level\nAnd the fact that I have that bottom line experienced that detailed experience only puts me in a better position to now be at the policy level right I mean when we make policy I'm going to have already have\nAn understanding of what happens when the detail level whereas you know somebody else would have to come back down and say how does this work how does this work\nUm I'm going to have a much better advantages of doing that now given that I'm\nStill going to come back and say how does this work because one of the things I did on the council is if there was something that I didn't know I Would go to the department heads when when issues came up about healthcare things for the short I went to ... you have to go to the experts you've got to go to the experts first\nMost importantly you have to go to the people because one of the things I've found is\nWhat looks like what looks like it's working on a policy level it everybody says oh my God this is great great program to working out fine and then you're really going to ask about it then you find out you know all the bumps and warts as to how there's obstacles to\nWrite and how it affects the general public to you know and that's that's really really important I Know that um [noise]\nI'll just do side by ... and then we have to take a break but like when the high school vote came up and everything I'm senior citizens were very very concerned and I'm Stan Lee the assess er was trying to work with the seniors to to try to do a reduction in that and I was talking to other politicians regarding the um\nThe seniors and like maybe doing a delay of taxes like maybe they could um [noise]\nSome subtle of equity type of thing where the equity in their homes could be used to pay that\nSome sort of equity type of thing where the equity in their homes could be used to pay that extra tax at some point but yeah it's very sketchy and I\nI don't understand that much about it I could talk about it yeah actually I I like to see a senior tax free yeah I'm interested in the tax free cell that was great and you know boy that would be really big that would be really break\nAll

signing away she's she's she's twenty we have you ever carbon calling back in and telling us something not so good today hey Jim\nYet yeah not the best of weather today later monitoring this now for over a week we've been thinking Saturday today would be the the day of the first\nReal coastal storm of the season with moderate rain now crossing much of the area\nA if we're going to really I Can't stress enough how you got to be out driving around they're going to be as the wind picks up a leaves are going to come up a tree there'll be wet leaves which can be slippery even walking or even driving but also a again stressed that I Can't stress enough we're going to have some clocks storm drains slowly resort areas where all of a sudden a big puddle\nWe're going to have some clock storm drains so they'd be certain areas where all of a sudden a bit puddles and again the worst of this will be later this morning to most of the afternoon when we got up to forty forty five miles an hour\nOn again that could take out a few branches are and also a that means if it falls on a wire then you get a power outage again they'd be very isolated and scattered nothing close to what we have certainly last March when we had widespread\nPower outages because a lot of that was due to\nMaine lines across the area feeding into cities and towns this would be isolated\nWhere one why are in a few feet falls down and then a few houses around it might lose power that's the type of thing today again about Ninety eight percent of the area should be fine ah the big story really is going to be also not only the strong winds but also the heavy rains\nWhich with the soft ground so against just be careful of that there's a lot nicer as we go into tomorrow clouds little son temperatures in the fifties and then one more minor weather system coming in especially Monday morning so we'll probably start the week\nOr many going back to work and school Monday morning with some light rain showers around a high in the fifties and then much better weather for Tuesday with temperatures in the fifties and a pretty good uh Halloween Wednesday in terms of the weather southwest wins\nAnd we might even make a run the lane at sixty on Wednesday afternoon the last day of the month obviously and then as we start November might start as high a sixty and then turn cooler late in the week maybe some indications of another storm for next weekend but uh let's not worry too much about that at the moment\nNow my heritage and so uh what is the way they're going to be liking me like his later on my nephew is getting married young kid\nI I Know it's a tough a ... report while I Wish you'd go I'm sure it'll go well and uh have a fun time but you everyone outside would be dodging probably winds up to fifty miles an hour Newport now the worst of that would be around two o'clock and then the wins will start subsided as you get towards four or five\nThat would be around two o'clock and then the winds will start subsided and as you get towards four or five o'clock\nA and eventually the rain will probably in fact you're out this evening across much of the area seven eight o'clock a obviously a Saturday evening many people's still out I Would in about\nA will probably be seeing winds of like five ten miles an hour at most and just mostly cloudy skies with maybe a sprinkle or a touch of missed and that's about it so as bad as it's going to be a much of today\nAre much of this evening will be fairly quiet now we may be having a clean up in some areas from a branches and things but in terms of the actual whether this evening a things will dramatically quiet down as we go through I'd say seven or eight o'clock\nAh it won't completely clear out certainly but a lot quieter in the weather department by the way there was one still can you believe tropical storm in the Atlantic Oscar\nBut as we like to have fun with the names that it should be a winning an Oscar winning storm because it's going to stay out at sea it's not going to bother anyone except shipping interest so that is a good deal or in that regard minute a quick way to remember the today's sunrise laying it was at seven eleven\nIsn't that something my God so naturally we turn back the clock so yeah it would be that the clocks back yeah so it will\nBe a little lighter again in the morning so like right now or you look outside right now and it's still kinda dreary but it'll be more everything will be an hour earlier so I Will have a little more light in the early morning for a little while by the ... the sunset next Sunday a week from tomorrow will be a quarter of five\nWow mills in every year we go through this and yeah today is that\nDay is a classic example of just before we set the clocks back then ran out of having the dock\nWith today's sun sunrise was at seven eleven and with a thick cloud cover a the sun above the cloud just having a hard time so that's why\nAnd with a thick cloud cover a the sun above the cloud just having a hard time so that's why it's still a few street lights are on even at this hour after eight o'clock so I'm real nasty day today kinda dreary as you said if you don't have to be outside to kick in and watch movies or what have you\nGood luck to in Newport and have fun down there but I Will be windy or in Newport certainly as I'm sure everybody does\nUh usually when you're down near the south coast than than it is an adult but everyone is going to have a rough weather today the price we pay though although not a sunny day tomorrow a lot quieter and again just a chance of a shower\nRight thanks a lot yeah I Know it's going to be sent his team fifty mile an hour winds at two o'clock that's the way that's again yeah yeah\nBut again this is the what we deal with as opposed to getting a thunderstorm or you know like we had the other day with this with a strong winds that they may only last five or ten minutes and it's over we're going to have about a good four to five hours\nPicking in later this morning for most of the afternoon of every few minutes of having wind gusts between forty and fifty miles an hour and again the further south you are from Adel barrel down towards a safe Fall River\nNew Bedford a into temperature and also say down towards war what you're going to be in that area that's where the winds will be the highest in\nThe listening area if you're going to be up said north of here say up and maybe you're going up in the ... area or inland uh that's where they won't be quite as strong a wind but everyone is going to have to deal with\nOr at least some strong winds and heavy rains and I can't stress enough ah besides having your windshield wipers working well and the lights on or be careful of wet leaves that will be blowing around on the ground which can which was sometimes as bad as ice walking around on slippery wet leaves that's going to be the issue this afternoon\nOh that's a good point I never thought about that actually that's a good point that actually\nHad car accidents over the years blamed on wet leaves believe it or not as much as we have you know hydro planning a big puddle and you can ...\nAs much as we have you know hydro planning a big puddle Gore I wrote\nA foot wet leaves a comes in up up near the top this time of the year just before the leaves come off the trees and the closer we get to the month of November which is one of our stormy month\nThis was a classic example today where are the trees can come down easier or branches couldn't come down easier because the elites are still on the trees mhm once only wants to leave come off the trees and another few weeks then you have a you need a stronger wind\nTo knock them down because there's no leaves to act like sales so again a wealth afternoon but I'll end on this little lane is always it gets a lot nicer tomorrow\n[laughter] well I have that to look forward to and we're all staying overnight it's great to have family together you know as a fun I've gotten so you don't have rocked back in the bad weather you know that's good oh no way a very very late night that's for sure so do we all took rooms down they were going to have a\nThat oh the victim and and this is out and about with LA nice to know that she's gainfully employed [noise]\n[noise]\n\nI Love that song that's so nice like that as we thank you so much okay we're back in Studio ... with Cary below our number here five week\nTwo two two Thirteen twenty carry why don't you continue our conversation\nSo uh as I was mentioning before of having this conversation with an individual who did the first ... commitment our talk at a at a learned to cope meeting and he's an addict I'm you've been in recovery about three years and he said it was probably one of the more humbling experiences he had\nIt was hard he's like I've never been to one and I'm sitting in a room with parents and loved ones who are talking about and sharing about their struggles and it's it was very bright a very different perspective for him because he realized\nThat wait a minute\nI'm In a room of people were I was the source of their struggle not directly but you understand 'em but he also said he learned a lot from it because it allowed him to get a better perspective of what his loved ones must have gone through and it also allowed him to share his experiences\nOf hope with others and I think he he definitely\nExpressed that it helps them to stay on track ... constant reminder of you know what the consequences are not just for them himself\nOf you know what the consequences are not just for them in South but the folks around them\nRight right and I think that um it helps heal from what I've heard of what I've seen what are people that I've talked to that have been directly impacted by their children [noise]\nUm one person said you know I spent thousands and thousands of dollars on my kid and recovery and hoping that he would quote unquote get it um but then when they don't and they failed he says what am I just do he's my son\nYou know so they're always going to be there and you could just see that the the look on their faces of of they blaming themselves the parents of blaming themselves when they they really shouldn't and um it's just so hard but I was talking to someone\nEven here on air um because there was something about um the amount of drugs that are being prescribed to patients when you do have an injury or something like that and um and I'll give you a perfect example of myself\nUm I had rotator cuff surgery John on one shoulder and the prescription um and I I took two pills so actually coat on\nAnd it just I just didn't like the feeling of it at all and I put them away so six years later [noise] um [noise] I had this move in incident to house and I'm going through all my toes and getting through all the stuff and throwing out stuff and I came across that bottle and you know how much you know how many pills that\nDoctor prescribed no I'm Seventy five [noise] wow\nActually I'm not surprised and I'm actually turning those end today to the big apartment because it's like ridiculous it scares me when I see that I thought no I didn't like the way that it just numb Jew you know I just didn't like\nNo I didn't like the way that it just numb Jew you know I just didn't like the way so I guess\nThen fast forward like two years ago I had my other shoulder done and it was just four percent that's it yeah and then and I only used to and then they had extra strength Tylenol and ice lots of ice and that was it because I don't like that feeling\nSo um it's actually I Love to hear your actual\nStory because it it's a perfect example of the direction that not just the commonwealth but the the nation itself is taking when it comes to to prescribing um I think that\nThere was a lot of unfortunately a lot of trial and error with the use of opioids in prescribing I think at one point in time it was you know without the research and understanding the bigger side effects die right doctors were OK with prescribing they thought well we wouldn't want that person to feel pain right here is this something that I'm prescribing I feel comfortable doing and they\nThey can't predict when they write that prescription the susceptibility somebody has to being addicted or be using that medication and you're right\nSeventy five sixty I've heard I've heard of that a lot and one of the we had recently had a greater opioids symposium out fuller I'm In which we were honored to have\nA state rep Denise garlic who actually wrote the new opioid bill for the commonwealth that was recently signed into I'm into effect in July\nAs well as um additional state reps the mayor um my CEO Rachel and some other folks who were able to come to um talk about the different aspects of the opioid crisis now what does he feels a new field that's been introduced well\nThe new legislation it's a it's\nFocusing on how to address the opioid epidemic specifically in the commonwealth were preventative Lee and also in terms of ...\nMake Demick specifically in the commonwealth\nWere preventative Lee and also in terms of access to treatment um there's a lot of different\nUm pieces that are in play and a lot of moving parts um and a representative garlic took the opportunity to\nKind of highlight key um key factors and key changes so one of the things you mentioned before um when we first came on air and was the medication assisted treatment and that um some people call it and that's methadone Suboxone zone\nThat's that's the general name for any sort of um alternate medicine Mitt medicinal treatment to compensate for an opioid addiction\nUm and also there are medications out there to assist with on alcohol addiction as well they're on which\nIf you um take this medication and you were to drink you become violently ill so that does exist on though it seems kind of weird to think about but at the same time some folks I totally understand the premise but um [noise]\nSo one of the things is where they're just trying to expand upon the medication assisted treatment model as um something that is utilized a in a warm handoff and utilize a little bit more often in the emergency department [noise] setting and that's the impression that I got from represented garlic\nSo um we're ... instead of treating a overdose or a addiction um incident in an emergency department by just handing out somebody off to a voluntary treatment or handing them a piece of paper or should I say that says you know here are your options\nThey are going to work more with trying to initiate the medication assisted treatment in the hospitals and then warm handoff too\nThis is a treatment in the hospitals and then warm handoff\nTo a um a patient provider and the community uh-huh what is your sales right um well we don't personally prescribe um we don't we're not a medication assisted treatment a provider which means you know their clinics that are dedicated to methadone and Suboxone zone\nSo went in and they are providers we will initiate in some cases in our in our in our impatient units where we are medically necessary will initiate a prescription for medication assisted treatment but then we ensure that there's a provider that keeps that go unseen thing or a psych med right you come in\nOn say you're in psychiatric crisis you're only with us for a couple of days to a couple of weeks or so we are going to stabilize you were going to change your meds\nBut the doctor that attend a T what our hospitals are going to be your doctor throughout the year we do a warm handoff to either your current prescribe or we help find you a new a prescribe or in the community uh-huh so same thing with medication assisted treatment so we don't have a clinic but we have relationships with\nUm with providers for our patients\nThat is really great so it's a really great partnership that you have absolutely do you think that doctors have changed it a whole series of this crisis on sixty minutes recently and there was one doctor in Florida that's in prison actually because he's prescribe over six hundred and thirty two thousand pills a month\nAnd the DEA came in and said what are you doing he had a pain clinic he had several pain clinics and he was really over prescribing and people were selling drugs on the street et cetera et cetera\nSo I think that um education with the doctors they had legitimate doctors on and they said well you know what when I'm a drug rep came in we really didn't understand the addiction part of it and how powerful how powerful this drug laws\nAnd part of it and how powerful\nHow powerful this drug was he actually coat on when they first came on the market they didn't realize like the um the hyper addiction component to it versus something else you know and um so\nI think that educating the doctors to have 'em have really come into play too I think that the physicians need to be more educated about the\nAddiction I think that now because it's out there now that you know so much publicity is happening\nNow that it's out there that so many people have died because of this um doctors of being more responsible and in a less prescribing being more cautious and then and recommending like in my case you know just for ... that's all you need I think you just need that but I Want you to take these because you're going to be in severe pain which I was\nI think forty eighty dollars as something silly it's absolutely ... it's almost like they're being forced to have to\nGo in that direction to keep themselves medicated quote and quote so wow that's amazing I Know we've only got like six minutes left I Know our time has gone by bill have you have I'll have to have you come back in December because we were talking about the seasonal disorder or something\nI'll have to have you come back in December because we were talking about the seasonal disorder and the and I and people suffer from the very greatly but um you have so many things of the support groups that you're involved and I know with the police departments and\nAnd a local support groups why don't you give out some of the the locations and days so people can know and also your contact information\nOr at least so a fuller along with the ad about police department pops team that problem oriented policing team\nAnd local agencies run a we rented dropping center resource dropping center a once a month here now to borrow at five oh five north main street which is the Murray Unitarian universal is church\nAnd that's the typically the last two Wednesday of the month from five thirty eight and it's open to the community and we absolutely print promote and expect in honor anonymity from folks\nUm what is our job and then to look like it is you walk in and there's a series of resources from support groups such as learned to cope you could actually talk to a learned to cope facilitator I'm about meetings and about experiences uh we have a nor kept lodge new hope ANC\nI'm full or obviously seven hills as ... training and they've and which you can actually be trained and receive free ... um and I actually they've recently started on this but also passing out at the drop in center medication disposal bags\nSo um you know you get a bag and there's um there are a there's a disposal process where if you put the medication and the bad there is a chemical on there that breaks it down it makes it like does all of its dissolving it but it it probably disposes of it and then you just those are the bad altogether so they have that\nI'm at are dropping center besides ... training the access of different resources in treatment we also have a model\nThe knock him training the access to a different resources in treatment we also have a model where we honor if anybody's in seeking when they come to us voluntary um treatment so if someone comes to us in seeking that\nWe'll have the capacity to be able to try to at the group I'm getting treatment that night and transportation or at the very least we follow up the next day and we've ... we've helped a lot of people get services\nReally the premise is and if you think about it at the time you know it's at night right it's on a Wednesday the premise behind is we're trying to encourage folks who have no clue where to start who themselves or someone in their family or friend is struggling to get resources but not if there's a stigma or if they're Shane or fear\nYou know we ... we try to create a very warm welcoming environment and again we promote anonymity we don't we won't if you don't wanna give us your name that's fine that doesn't mind can just\nOffer you the resources um that you need\nNow are there are large groups are small groups of the individual um compassion people that are reaching out to others or\nWhat is the group setting like All right so it's really um the setting when you walk into the room there's a series of tables around the room and it's\nIt's a unity room at the church which is in the back of the church you get a little hallway\nAnd it's a very warm rooms got a little fireplace great it's a very welcoming and so you'll see the tables we have our table cloths out and some information and we have a representative behind each table who's prepared to listen and to talk to try to help in any way they can and these are volunteers that are coming on and so\nThe the setting really is individual lives you can go from table to table there's like died when he first walk in the\nDoor who someone who will talk to you kind of get an idea of what you're looking for and help to to to guide us to where you should start a specifically the dropping center does focused on mental health resources substance abuse and use resources as well as domestic violence\nMental health resources substance abuse and use resources as well as domestic violence resources so new hope is there and we have folks that are trained in safety plan\nUm and we are actually having an education piece at our November twenty eighth dropping in which a representative some new hope we're going to be doing an open community conversation at a separate room at the church during the dropping center\nOn um safety planning how to recognize domestic violence and how to get a protective order wow no one is that going to be happening so that's November twenty eighth at\nSix thirty PM at\nThe ... church so when you walk in there'll be a room or going to have the education piece but down the hallway there's the resource center so folks can pop into the resource center if they would like and check that out or not it's completely upset on okay what we're trying to do is we have all these wealthier awesome\nResources around us so it's like this is a great opportunity for us to be able to showcase I'm the education and information and free and open community setting or\nNow a with just a second ago [laughter] are of\nIf people if a parent is listening or grandparents is listening and they want their grandson or granddaughter or family member to um get some help or maybe they need some help and support can you give out a number of the that they can contact foolish someone\nFull or so for at full or um you can

immigration issue\nWas one of the major issues that he won the election on right mhm I think that's a sensitive issue for people and and rightly so I I mean I don't\nI'm\nDisagree that it's a concern\nBut\nThese thousands of people who are still maybe a thousand miles away from the border you know\n\nI worry about sending two thousand troops down there they were already five or six hundred yeah yeah well that's what I learned I actually talking about a hundred and army mornings yeah\nThe endeavor interestingly I don't know if you know about this but the Mexican government has offered asylum I Do I heard that yeah the marchers yeah I Do know that there's a new well written earlier reported yeah newly reported and supposedly\nAbout Fifteen hundred have accepted the offer because the offer comes with\nA job wow they're offering a a job for how long I don't know they do have to settle into some areas in southern Mexico yeah\nUm [noise]\nHopefully that's going to be something of a of a victory and that's going to lead to citizenship a ... as a Mexican citizen again what the details are what we do right All right but but the concept is hopeful ... exact very how her yeah\nI I

mine was extended over ... ...\nAnd yours was sudden mhm mine was extended over several years uh I I Can't remember sitting with you I don't know if you remember this or in an empty room in the old studios sharing with you what I was going through with my son\nYou remember that I don't think I Do\nFor those who are unaware my son was a an alcoholic in a drug addict and it was the kind of thing that just didn't just happen overnight it it\nIt was over a long period of time of attempting to go into rehab come out go back in come out and not happens to be one of the problems by the way with what's happening with the opioid crisis and when when we you know I worry about the fact that\nWe use the term opioid crisis and we don't really understand how serious it is\nHow right now this year in this city we've already lost twenty four young people\nLast year we lost over thirty\nIt's the numbers are just so incredible it's hard to believe and when you pick up the newspaper and wild ... this is not exclusively true and you look at the obituaries in your whatever the newspaper you read and you see someone in their twenties usually male\nTwenty three years old and died suddenly ...\nCan I I look at that and then I can almost predict unless it says that he suffered from you know so you have some terrible disease which this is by you always have their own yeah see yes but it is it is at a point now the governor\nBut it is it is at a point now the governor of of the state last week said that the opioid crisis is getting better but it's beginning to levels off a little bit\nI'm beginning to level law which means we're only ... losing hundreds and hundreds or it could be thousands of you know we would get it with the yeah the way it was growing from year to year\n\nSo when you ask the question about how I feel about that\nI feel number one that we made a bad mistake\nIn authorizing marijuana because I Know personally that's how my son started I Know from my experience in education\nAnd in my conferences and I'll never forget being at a conference of stone hill college where they brought three inmates from the house of correction in who were there because of drugs\nAnd every one of them they first thought they were addicts by this point\nEvery one of them in very ... said that the entry drug was marijuana mhm that's where it started\nAnd for people who don't think that's a problem that alcohol is absolutely alcohol is the problem people say well marijuana is not as much of a problem is alcohol and maybe if it if that were the limit that it didn't go anywhere maybe that would be true\nWhat what are the problems one of the problems with what you're saying as I hear it\nWhen we dealt with marijuana very differently than we dealt with alcohol we deal with drug addiction very we dealt with drug addiction very different one of the ... the reason we're having a level of leveling off I think is because we're all now suddenly saying wait\nThe reason we're having a level of leveling off I think is because we are all now suddenly saying wait a minute people doing marijuana\nWe can get with alcohol you could get into rehab you could get some help you could ah go to meetings when people were on drugs a week and a half ago you know go in in our lifetime\nThey had to hide it they couldn't tell anybody you know they were afraid of of of exposing their their their ... their supplier because it was it was ... it was a whole bunch of reasons that we made that we made it impossible for them to be able to get any help before they got to the\nBefore they got to the other stuff and and this is why I've always been in favor of legalizing this stuff in order to do what we're talking about here which is somebody gets to come to you\nOr me or or elected official whoever and say listen I've got a problem I'm doing heroin I'm doing whatever and they can get some help\nAnd and and and we if we legalize it we can control its its quality if you will and tax it use that money to make rehab centers et cetera so she'll get smart about it as my thought\nRather than this what we were you and I grew up with was oh no that's awful it must be I didn't know what marijuana was when I grew up you know that well known young age well I'm Talking about just\nYeah that's that's part of it and you know one of a big problem is whether that was the ... problem now and\nThis is funny you know this go so far back ... members sickle cell anemia or sickle cell anemia was a horrible problem in the black community and they were all talking about it and nobody is do anything about it and then a white\nGuy got it ... and all of a sudden there were ... yeah and what's happened\nNow the parallel I'm just saying the parallel now is that you have people now we'll see ... describes a white collar worker middle aged guy or woman wherever they are and they're addicted to opiates because their\nDoctor prescribed all kinds of stuff to them but not everyone who gets prescribed stuff who takes\nNo no I'm Talking about the people who have will have the addiction than cats are exposed to over medication\nIs a couple of weeks ago there was a symposium down at full of hospital yeah\nAnd one of the panelists at the symposium was an emergency room doctor from Brockton ... and he said ... that doctors ... of the people most to blame for the opioid crisis\nBecame Missouri because you that you had a knee replacement you had to show the pain whatever they would prescribe you and and my wife went through this you had a ...\nPain whatever they would prescribe you and and my wife went through this you had a knee replacement I couldn't believe the number of opioid painkillers\nThat the ... and was like eighty I just add a lot and I went and had a little too thing ... nothing effects and the same thing I got a prescription I brought it home and joined said to hell us as always kill the horse yeah I'll say leave and and the acts and and and the the antibiotics too\nBy the way yeah way over ... and before we go any further I Want to remind people who are listening yet that today is the day where you can take your medicine cabinet and by the way young people who are addicted go to the medicine cabinet in your house and in other people's houses\nAnd steal those painkillers those opiates mhm to sustain themselves\nToday is a drug\nElection day ... just about everywhere and well in the city of battle barrel between right now and two o'clock this afternoon\nYou can take drugs that are out of date that you don't use any longer that have been there the giant jelly used to borrow it exactly is so do everyone in favor including yourself\nTo go to your medicine cabinet pullout all tell us things do well this is the way to do it\nNow but he said well that's what he means though yeah he doesn't support him I say I take all of those and go down to the ... the police station or whatever I think this is national by ... or if you're in North that overall the north federal people who'd be collecting or wherever you are even slept ville\n[laughter] they they do they do have a police department there do you have really good one yeah she noticed the cop [laughter] today's turned away luggage same claims are has a serious\nMan I did have turned away with a gun slang claimed who has a serious serious\nPolice department at their officers yeah take take the medications and take them to the soldiers least station there's a place to deposit them get them out of circulation and then when you're\nA cop pulls you over and he's on something [laughter] you you don't often ... there was just my attempt all in the seventies I live in these commission and\nI sat although worker and I used to try to tell the parents please you know your\nKids have probably gone into because I Want to hear them talking yeah and yeah the hanging out and everything you please don't leave shrugs and yeah and and Andy here's part of the thing we tried to originally with the with the\nKids here parents talk about all they get home I Need a martini mhm mhm I had to have a drink oh I'm going to take a couple of days I'm going to go to sleep I'm gonna I mean these kids have ... have been brought up us um and they these kids now I didn't I never drank I never smoked\nI never because I was lucky enough not to have that\nSays abroad but also to see how people were enjoying themselves also I mentioned this doctor he admitted that doctors of the greatest fault for what is going on with the opioid crisis\nA new bill has just been passed that the state level\nI happen to have have had a relative\nWas hooked on these things and because his doctor wouldn't give him added it drugs he would go to a different doctor yeah you get older the emergency room and he would go with him that he could get it yeah and there was never any way to cross check that this bill that just passed once it's\nPut in place you know and it's going to take some time to do it will electronically\nOnce it's put in place you know and it's going to take some time to do it will electronically connect all of these doctors so that when someone walks in and he's looking for this they can go on their computer and say I'm Sorry\nYou're already a trail you've over the place of science that will go the other thing is that in order to get an opiate\nPrescription now\nYou have to present identification if you want to refill it you can't just go to the pharmacy and refill it like to use do you have to go back to the doctor gets script\nThat doctors can not do it with a phone call\nYou have to go with a hiccup the script and take it identify and there was a while and identify yourself up so that there are some controls being put in place that should have been there a long time ago we be because of the things we talked about that it really wasn't\nYou know that serious young recognize things happening\nThank goodness and you're out of commission to help do that I Am how well well all the ... the commission\nIs an advisory role to the man you know just as the handicapped commission yeah is advisory to them and I would urge you to get in touch with some people from the handicapped commission I Know how you feel about that have a live near a history didn't have the mind here and let people know absolute that debt commission has

Rhode Island right now I say well I don't know it's interesting the issues I think she's leading right now they're not crazy about mystifying missed the phone is a is a big Trump guy I Believe it or not\nAnd um so that's that's been troublesome\nFor him and then we have um [noise] this guy um\nTroll ... and ... there's a story about true low when he ... me and many years ago there were a couple of teenagers and they were hassling this girl or whatever and he went out and were good things changed and\nUh he hit one of the teenagers in the head with his ... he was working with the ...\nThat

that the corruption Rhode Island is massive it's nothing is any more massive anywhere else it's just so we know\nAbout it because we're related to everybody\nOh in Rhode Island does not make sense is that\nWhat you know to you know a ... view of a job in the government will say oh you need to do wow oh who sponsored\nYou Sam sponsored you huh yeah so I mean it's it's a very odd it's very odd\nFive a way to do two Thirteen twenty and I think our guest is here\nThe morning or good morning hello\nI'm Dave yes good morning Peter around high fee to how I Would just chatting about you ah thanks for calling and I appreciate it of course um first\nOf all I'm a Peters running for attorney general in the state of Rhode Island he was formerly the U.S a journey and uh when Trump came in he went out and that's how it\nIs a good sign I Know I like the red eye to eye Peter this is Donna Donna with me or show\nI like the morning voting on anything I so\nThat's how it works right I mean if Trump cut out in the present them and they just say by the way you're out of work\n[noise] yeah so typically when the White House changes hands of my party the U.S attorneys move on so my predecessor was five correct the appointed by President Bush in ... when\nPresident Obama a you\nKnow was elected I I was in the office I actually work for five as assistant us attorney and President Obama ordered me and then you're President Trump became president and appointed or not I think is the process of appointing his on his own person yes all of us are all of us to step down and and we expected that you know it was just I'm really matter of time in more than anything else\nAre you are at all concerned about the rhetoric that we hear about or did you just she'll system and the uh\nTurned above the rhetoric that we hear about a ... system and the the legal system here from our president I mean he's always jumping on me with the FBI and the CIA yeah um yeah what's it like to hear that\nWell I'm very concerned about it in fact I made a very quick trip to Nashville just over the last forty eight hours I'm to be a with a group called the former U.S attorney ... uh they're going to be back with a gentleman there are actually working the Kennedy Johnson administration as an assistant us attorney so these are all former U.S attorney some both both administrations\nAnd I remember the former U.S attorney from ah just yesterday from New Orleans Jim wet and getting up and and saying look you know\nWhether you're a Republican or Democrat\nUm you know we all have faith in the institution of the department of justice and this is the first time it's ever been challenge from the top I think that's very damaging for the country for the American people and very unwise by the president I mean the Justice Department the FBI have been institutions that this country\nHas counted on for very long time in ... in my view can continue to count on a but the president undermines is ... undermines that I Believe for his own purposes\nAnd that's very important I think that's very unfortunate\nYou know one of the things that has always been interesting to me is how they ... the Justice Department although the president of points the the head the department itself is separate right right it's weird I I Know he's laying out a little bit to\nSure so so there are ... what we would call political appointees which means you in the United states attorneys are political appointments appointed by the president\n... what's that in the Senate confirmation so my appointment had to be confirmed by the U.S Senate what everybody else so that that applies to the U.S attorneys it applies to the attorney general deputy attorney general some of the other very senior leadership in the department of justice I think it's about a ten thousand per se organist\nSome of the other very senior leadership in the department of justice I think it's about ten thousand per se organization you know we're probably talking about a couple of hundred at most maybe less than that that are appointed by the president\nIs probably less than that actually um [noise] so everyone else is a career employees they you know some some people move on other things but they have civil service protection and they're there for very long time and be the turnover in my office strings office\nYou know it was very limited I mean people would pretty much once they were able to get a job they're very competitive get you get hired there once people came there they they tended to stay until they retired for the most part do great work by but made it a career so\nYou know the department really only turns over the top and in in even among our ... us political appointees I never looked at the uh the job as a political one in fact I was like an unaffiliated voter as us attorney I didn't vote in primaries as us attorney and one of the public\nOr I Want us to the public to have no doubt that I was calling it right down the middle so you know we tried as we would say we tried to check our politics at the door or certainly the policy that the department follows the step by the president in terms of priorities for that kind of thing but the institution was respected I mean I worked for a Republican president you know I respected President Bush\nBritain erode thank you so much and good luck ... ... that by by All right\n\nI mean again I Know why\nSo much um\nMovie\nThat I did\nUm [noise]\nMaybe [noise]\nWhen you're reading died [noise]\n\n\nOur\nNew mayor on the radio 'til noon today and you are on the radio was well hello\nHow are you ...\nWell I guess what it's like you know I'm heading down a Ninety five thirty one in the fast lane blocking traffic all the way down so we think\nThere will say that in mind that again you broke up said again\nOh okay uh there's an accident on exits sorority fast lane get the one car that wall\nOr were you know where's the thirty were reciting by cell where ... ...\nAnd what a whiz exit Thirteen where is the five where now where Ninety five so there are any ya ya where where is exit thirty yet OK okay fine yup yup okay I think I think it I like very\nOkay good thank you so I'm All right thanks a lot of ways I think we have I I\nFind my way to to to Thirteen twenty yeah they've got a of\nAn accent and I guess on Ninety\nFive and a good place in Africa yeah I'm just I was trying to place at the age of thirty people a lot of times that I did traffic reports remember oh you're enjoyable that's probably why you get confused [laughter]\nBut I used to do them from a plane uh-huh and the thing is that um\nWhen when people say it's dirty and you're driving you you're not paying attention to it\nWhereas if they're just why I wanted to know where it is yeah yeah people got to slow down you know this weather between the leaves on side streets and the wind or on a Ninety five regarding the guessing is suing waters and not being able to you hit your\nYour windshield and all kinds of stuff going on you really got to slow it down yeah you got to slow down 'cause you will slide right into something as obviously happened on a Ninety five

we do have meteorologist Jim ... standing by with another update for us on a forecast gym\nWell Dharma colder than it was the other morning how about that however we're going to have a lot of bright sunshine today\nStill costs waiting for the fun to come up again but until we set the clock back in less than two weeks we're going to have these uh late sun rises again seven oh five so still about over twenty five minutes to wait for the sun to come up\nRises again seven oh five so still about over twenty five minutes to wait for the sun to come up we're about twenty minutes or so a wins today out of the last five to Fifteen miles an hour again high temperatures today upper forties to maybe briefly about fifty that's still a several degrees below average tonight a clear this evening on mostly clear some high clouds and then\nA thickening clouds late tonight or nothing to worry about oh Lowes down into the mid thirties and then we'll have clouds and some sun tomorrow tomorrow the trade off it won't be quite as coolest today I in the mid fifties but there'll be a little more of the way a clause mixed with a little son one or two quick passing showers should be low impact\nAnd then as we go into tomorrow and I bought them out in the low forties setting the stage for sun and clouds on Wednesday\nA high back up to around fifty degrees and then Thursday colder again Thursday and friday probably the two coldest stretches of days we will have this week anyway low\nForties on Thursday after starting out in the mid thirties and then twenties again friday morning could be quite similar to this one when will be well down in the twenties and many areas and then a recovering back just to the low end mid forties friday afternoon and then again a monitoring all week this situation setting up for the weekend\nI could come as early as Saturday it could be delayed until late Sunday or Monday but right now indications are as I've been thinking for the last week that anything stormy would be before Halloween so Halloween of course a week from Wednesday yeah Halloween a week from this Wednesday\nOr looks to be dry and cool probably in the fifty fifty five category during the day thirties and low\nForties at night we cannot picture most of the time the Halloween as kids growing up going out and it never was really that warm and usually wasn't all that cold either and that's exactly the time of year we are in and then after that some indications late next week as I like to go long range of at least get started\nOf some warming temperatures as we start the month of November So that'll be a good thing anything positive you can talk about for the month of November ...\nA month of November So that'll be a good thing\nAnything positive you can talk about for the month of November weather wise is a good thing\nFive fifty three the sunset today again a reminder was setting the clocks back now a week from this upcoming weekend so that means the weekend right before\nThe election I tied at seven o'clock level low tide at one o'clock and by the way the water temperatures at the beach is can you believe I still I just looked at horse neck beach temperature or snack beach here we are on the twenty second of October the water is still sixty three degrees now that has come down a few degrees from the last few weeks but still\nIf someone was not that worried too much about cold water\nOr you could easily do some swimming at some of our south coast beaches right now and in fact a there will probably be some people there much of this week because we're going to have at least doses of sunshine and if you would've jumped in sixty three that we are degree water today you would warm up above them\nYeah I can just imagine some of the people out there and they're wet suits or even not even in a wet suit speed going in there at this time of the year hey if they can get a couple of days in why not right on\nThat's it why not and again a late this week with this weekend I Will have to monitor rough seas possibly develop me or where you might not want to be in the water unless you were a great surfer will have to monitor this this will this storm that's in the Pacific yeah they're already done it a W storm in the Pacific this was the a specific\nIt's going to be I think the devastation of initially strong winds up the coast but if you know the topography of most of Mexico outside of the Yucatan it is very mountainous once you get in usually within about fifty to a hundred miles from the coast so what is going to do is going to drop devastating floods and again the only reason I'm really bringing this up making a deal of it\nIs the fact that some of the entity that may be injected into what we could get this weekend\nSo it's going to jump the mountains now this was a ... ...\nWeekend so it's going to jump the mountains now this is a positive on\nA which is a little further\nUp the coast in there in South of there is a you know ... which is a classic theory a lot of time a lot of times the love boat with sometimes go there are on the love boat show but at any rate that area is going to get devastated by initially got flooding at the coast big waves\nOr maybe somewhat similar to what Michael did in Florida a couple of weeks ago\nThen it's going to bring out heavy rains the mountains in central Mexico some of them get his highest Thirteen thousand feet\nSo what that does is a lift the air and it's going to have devastating floods mudslides I it's just not a good situation now once it jumps the mountains it comes back down as it approaches\nSouthern Texas a as a quote approaches the Rio Grande area were flattened out again and then that entity leftover because it's so initially strong could produce some heavy rains in Texas\nLouisiana all the south the Gulf Coast areas and then reform off the Carolinas or later this week and possibly into a very large ocean storm\nAnd depending on his track or could affect our weather here a big waves possibly at the coast and also some strong winds inland could take trees that will have to monitor it and I don't mean to sound dramatic but as you know like to be blunt and let everyone know that as nice as it's going to be much of this week uh the weekend\nI could be a different story so again darn good news so today we got the sunshine and yet again another one of these\nDays with the sun has essentially out all day long but we still have to wait a minute Fifteen more minutes before it comes up\nYeah I guess we can go and actually we have to ask for sure\nWe have to we can't control a mother nature or also a mother a astronomical stuff so I'll have another update coming up\nIn the ... that's for sure All right Jim thanks so much hey I talked about this um a few days ago the taste of the region we've talked about it and you've heard it some of the the ads on our program\nYou know the taste of the region we've talked about and you've heard

hundred dollars apparently the city is getting a deal from their vendor according to the documents estimating that cost a list prices for those new chairs\nOr anywhere between just after about a thousand dollars and just even about six hundred dollars\nSo the four hundred and thirty five dollar chair when the two hundred eighty eight dollars that the city will pay are actually discounts\nA fifty five percent for the council and the clerks chairs and fifty two for the administrators chairs as well now it's worth noting that with some relief of the council did not choose their

of target Twitter accounts also borrow was fired by the tech giant in two thousand Fifteen\nAnd in New York Times reports the U.S consulting firm McKinsey and company carried out research that the Saudi Government used to target dissidents\nAnd it does absolutely nothing to bring in Russia back into compliance with the treaty ah and it opens the door for Russia to deploy in greater numbers this missile of concern which is known as the nine ...\nIn greater numbers this missile of concern which is known as the nine am seven to nine if Russia wants to if this treaty has gone all the constraints on the testing the production of employment of these missiles in Europe and elsewhere will be gone and then\nTrump says ah you know if if Russia and China don't abide by the treaty or we're gonna have to build missiles of this type that kind of logic\nSimply doesn't make any any uh any sense given a few basic facts one is China wasn't party to the INS treaty\nOr the U.S and in Russia have been ah the United states doesn't need a ground launched intermediate range missiles to deal with China in fact the vice chairman of joint chiefs of staff\nLast year said explicitly we do not need such missiles to counter China and\nThe United states doesn't have any such missile in development and there's no NATO country that would accept any such ground launched cruise missile\nOr to be deployed and their their territory the last time that happened back in Nineteen eighty three there were millions of Europeans in the streets telling Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev to get rid of those those missiles so\nFor a number of reasons this is counterproductive it's dangerous and it does a opened the door\nTo the possibility of renewed nuclear competition in this area and it could threaten another important treaty the new strategic arms treaty the main treaty limiting the two sides strategic arsenals which is due to expire and twenty Twenty one if Trump imprudent don't extend it\nOne last call in Nineteen eighty seven found that when President Reagan and president Mikhail Gorbachev signed the intermediate range nuclear weapons treaty ins Reagan talked about ... the\nOf this\nAnd some of the dia the numbers of dentistry the vet vicious [noise] I'm a Soviet side over Fifteen hundred deployed war is will be removed and all round\nIntermediate range missiles including the is just one of these will be destroyed our entire comment of her she too and\nRules missiles which were his will\nDestroy the dishes missiles on both sides will also be short\nSo that's a President Reagan speaking in Nineteen eighty seven about the importance of this agreement now you spoke about the fact that I Am Russia was violating this treaty but Russia is also accused the U.S of violating the treaty or is there any truth to that\nOr Russia has said they have deep concerns about whether the United states convert\nA defense of missile interceptors that are part of the U.S missile defense architecture that are now in Romania and will be in Poland for offensive purposes so they have a a sad that that has a problem they have\nA it's a look if we look at the situation the United states as a serious concerns about Russia's compliance\nOr the Russians have concerns about us future compliance a what a really ought to happen as there should be a\nAn arrangement by which there are trends parents they visits by technical experts to examine these missiles of concern and the two sides could conceivably work out an arrangement by which are each side's concerns are are addressed and if Russia does have missiles\nThat can fly in excess of the the treaty limits or they could be a called upon to stop deployment but they haven't the two sides haven't gotten this far there have not been discussions uh\nPoint it but they haven't the two sides haven't gotten this far there have not been discussions are at the detailed expert level about how to resolve this in fact the only been to meetings on the IMF issue between us and Russian officials since Trump came into office\nI mean can you talk about how many how many ... does the United states has how many does Russia have um is this just give to the weapons\nManufacturers just no holds barred take restraints off\nWell ... you're right I mean we got to where to put all this in perspective you know even though the Cold War is over so to speak or the weapons that were created during the Cold War still exist and the the nuclear strategies and the United states and Russia had at that time are still very much in place so\nAs we sit here this morning chatting about this uh the United states deploys about one thousand four hundred warheads on long range bombers and missiles that on land and on the uh the Russians have equivalent numbers\nAbout eight hundred of those could be launched on an order from the president within about twenty minutes\nSo that means that both sides remain on hair trigger or if there is a warning of an attack\nOr the nuclear strategies call for um the immediate launch of\nEight hundred or more a nuclear warheads or in retaliation so that creates the chance for miscalculation so we have massive overkill\nOr we have a situation in which the fate of literally a hundreds of millions of people rest in in the hands of a of a small number of people specifically to a gentleman Trump and food and uh so uh we're talking about making the situation worse by removing one of the ...\nWe're talking about making the situation worse by removing one of the treaties that was negotiated in the eighties by none other than Ronald Reagan or that help end the Cold War so this does reopen the possibility of\nA a new arms race which of course would certainly benefit or the weapons contractors ah that would build or any any new weapons\nCould you give us a sense and the floor we conclude what state but the new start treaty and given indication that Trump will pull out of the ... has been opposed to that as well\nWell uh yeah Bolton before he came into office he was he wanted to pull out of the IMF treaty he has said a negative things about the new strategic arms reduction treaty\nOr so that treaty was negotiated by bronco bomb and two dollars and ten it's scheduled to expire in February five twenty Twenty one just a few days after the next in our inauguration day\nA Trump including could however agreed to extend it by five years\nAlong with the trends parents seem verification provisions that are very important um and right now John Bolton is leading an interagency review about whether to extend the treaty trash the treaty or try to renegotiate some new treaty and the the little amount of time left between now and twenty Twenty one\nSo you know if we if we look at this I enough decision I'm very worried that John Bolton is headed in the same direction with respect to the new start treaty and if that's the case we would not have legally binding limits on the world's two largest arsenals for the first time since Nineteen Seventy two [noise]\nSo it's very important for Congress or to step up a Republicans and Democrats who support the new start treaty to press a Trump to extend this treaty to buy some more time so that we can at least have these limits in place and pursue further negotiation\nSo that we can at least have these limits in place and pursue further negotiations with Russia or to further reduce the the bloated and costly arsenals of these these two\nAnd finally we just have thirty seconds but even though this is an agreement between the U.S or it was and is it actually Trump saying we're pulling out meaning we have pulled out it's also a message to China that President Trump is sending\nWell he may think so um I don't think the Chinese are particularly perturbed a you know China has most of its arsenal on ground launched missiles or with a a medium or intermediate range just has to do with geography\nUm they're under no pressure to join the IMF treaty um and uh they have a relatively small about three hundred nuclear weapons arsenals that they feel is sufficient to deter the United states so he may think he's sending a message to sign up but I don't think it's a very effective one\nMhm and what does it mean is the U.S out since Trump said they are\nWell that's a great question I mean these discussions between John Bolton and the Russians today in Moscow I think will be key\nUh it is not clear whether a Trump is actually pulling out um it may be that they're trying to threaten that the U.S will pull out of Russia doesn't do something in particular\nThat's not clear ah my Russian contacts have not yet heard anything like that our European allies have not heard anything like that but I think it's quite likely if we remain on the current track that the IMF treaty will be terminated by Donald Trump sometime in twenty Nineteen\nKimball want to thank you for being with us director the arms control association previously led the coalition to reduce nuclear dangers [laughter] this is democracy now democracy now for the war and peace in front of course we'll continue to report on the U.S Russia ins treaty when we come back change and\nRussia ins treaty when we come back change and trends policy and the part of the Trump Administration stay with us\n\n\n\nThink the concern is that we're hearing a debate about trans existence that is not being led by trans people and so much of what we're seeing is understanding of trans nest that\nReally in trenches this notion that there's some biological truth affects and something else that's ideological called gender and that really is a false dichotomy and what we're seeing is that by by\nSaying that there's something called science that's true ah interesting that the administration\nThat there's something called science that's true\nAh interesting that the administration is using science to defend all rather than they are and how science um but but the reality is that\nThat that I think what I Want people to really understand is there any things that are typically true in science so for example it maybe typically true that men have certain bodies but it's a political choice to make that definitional to say men have to have certain bodies in order to be men and I think what we have to understand is that\nThese are political choices that are part of a long legacy that is very much connected colonialism white supremacy and efforts to exclude people from participation and said we're I think is the best place to get information on transition\nI think the best place to get information on trans issue is from trans people so we can look at publications that have trans writers whether that broadly advice then a Hyundai not publication teen vogue\nThe voices of trans people have a long challenged the way this conversation has been framed in places like the New York times and you're at times the New Yorker the guardian are regularly running pieces ... attacking whether or not trans people can and should exist\nAs we begin to wrap up you are I'm Chelsea Manning's lawyer Chelsea just tweeted this weekend\nAfter almost a decade of fighting\nThrough prison the courts a hunger strike and through\nThe insurance company I finally got surgery this week she later tweeted laws don't determine our existence we determine our existence it's our weapon or shelter energy or he'll or our truth we will keep moving forward we will keep fighting existence is our only law last comment on Chelsea\nYou know I just want to say I am so proud of tells the I'm so happy to see her getting the health care that she needs I Hope other trans people also also get that health care and I just want to say to the trans community this is a terrifying time people were breaking out into tears yesterday I Know people are just\nDid he this is a terrifying time people were breaking out into tears yesterday I Know people are scared but we have a long history of resistance and we will continue to fight and we absolutely will survive well I Want to thank you very much chased strange you for joining us staff

I still very much feel like a political newcomer so I appreciate this opportunity to come on here and I introduced myself a little bit\nJust well I one of the things we did I once knew for a long time to talk about leadership leadership in general not you know specifics 'cause this there is something that we can learn there that will make us better leader is whether it's in our families or\nIn our community or you know\nAt our church or whatever um that are followers to 'em so you know there's some skills to some knowledge that goes with it and I thought you were just three deployments to Iraq and\nOnly to one of the Iraq went to Afghanistan\nOne term Iraq and went to Afghanistan and how old are your kids then\nUm they weren't around when I was in Iraq in um\nBut then my oldest was four when I was over in Afghanistan and uh it it's interesting so I I left him at home with mom for ... for about a year and when she potty trained them and\n[laughter] it maybe a little piece of as a child who had bought you felt that you had to do to go and serve the country\nIt was really a choice necessarily um I I definitely felt obligated to re enlist time and again it and\nLook at my military service in my decision to join the Army National guard is one of the best decisions I've made my life from ... it's it's taught me a lot and it's the the Army National guard is just the you know the one weekend about two weeks during the summer sort of thing\nGuard is just the you know the one weekend about two weeks during the summer it's sort of thing\nIn Philly we're way for Eighteen months to go to Iraq or a year to go to Afghanistan and all of that but normally it's it's a part time thing um and it's really fascinating to sort of be working at a civilian job as a as a as a software guy and then down to the way to go\nBut it's important um\nAre the army values are loyalty duty respect selfless service on Iraq I think as I said don't go on to them because they are important loyalty\nLoyalty loyalty to your fellow city council is not to go behind their back or something like that\nWill in the the one I was ... loyalty duty in respect in that respect one of the last ... I was getting to respect somebody that you disagree with but it's important that you do yes which ... find you\nKnow you find maybe find something good in that person and something noble and that person that you admire mhm\nIn and they were ... ... there were people on the council that I thought there was no way I Would get along with that disagree pretty strongly with with the marijuana stuff that I ...\nIt was pretty strongly with with some of the marijuana stuff that I I have a lot of respect for or even though we very much disagree on some of the issues are\nInto that respect is is I think ... incredibly important so when this marijuana issue was being heard in discussed before the full counsel for the final vote um\nI was getting messages up into the day before and the day I was saying if if this passes and this way that you know will veto it with if we if you restrict it to five I'm\nI'm like I I I went to the past and and I think it's in the way that I prefer to see it but I knew some of the other counsellors were concerned about the the zoning aspects of it so I\nStayed up late Wednesday night put together an amendment that there was a fairly long set of amendments to change it from\nBeing zones in the retail aspects of adult use marijuana known to general business to restrict everything to industrial zones and I very much disagreed with that amendment\nBut I felt my fellow counselors would have made that amendment and actually on the day of three of them had said that they were you know feverishly scribbling notes that tried to make that amendment so\nI don't think alike you know how badly solve this kind of impasse that would seem to be developing\nAnd I disagreed with the amendment but I felt it was only fair in respectful to my fellow counselors to give them an opportunity to have the discussion on the couch a floor to give their ideas of chats I'm In it and I feel that what democracy sort of all about um\nI disagree with it I made the\nUm I disagree with it I made the amendment I argued my point the gets it and ultimately I lost it everything has been restricted to industrial zones\nNow for now are for this which is a brand new in the city and in the state and so\nWhy not give it a try like an experiment and then later on it can be change when people are more familiarity with it I mean I I'm a raging liberal so [laughter] but I mean I can see anything in the benefits as a compromise\nIt I did too and I was very proud of it because after that change it it I ... I didn't get what I wanted\nBut ultimately the overall ordinance change passed unanimously and I was very happy that we sort of supporting came together for that matter um in that\nAnd you are doing a little bit or indirect effect on other is that you weren't going to\nPush and being noxious that you were going to continue to respect them even though you\nDisagreed and I could have tried to play games and ...\nIf an amendment was made and it was a perfect I could've been tacked that aspect of it as opposed to discussing the ideas are based on the merits of the idea of some of them so I thought that was important it was one of\nIt is the the one moment that I'm most proud of him so far not not necessarily passing the the ordinance itself but the way the law and other than work together\nSo what are the qualities that a person needs when they have to change their their mind or cooperate or collaborate in order to get a good decision I I I have no idea [laughter] what are the I mean I I come from a sterile background and so I'm thinking you have cats\nI come from a minister or background or so\nI'm thinking you have to have a certain humility I agree\nI very much agree I I think you know we can come in and say I know all the answers and I'm right and you're walking and you know that leads to what we have in Washington [laughter] now and and um you know the authoritarian mentality down there\nThat everybody that disagrees should just roll over and play dead is is poison\nI mean I think that's why city councils are great because we have to live with each other\nYou know you we don't do their own countries are going to see\nEach other and and buy you a compromising or being flexible the next time there's something they want you know there may be more given tape\nWhere at least the merits of the ideas right will will with two guys are a nation\nGiven to different viewpoints than they were all\nAnd I don't mean this in terms of personality is on the city council I mean general and how we get along\nIn a in that comes with the middle humility like you said you know it's it's incredibly important yeah um I could use more of it but [laughter]\nIf you ask my wife [laughter]\nUm but ... it's\nNot sure she has ways of telling you that [laughter] certainly [laughter] I mean in our spouses that me and my spouse my husband\nIs is is it might get ... just about everything I Do you mean 'cause I Know he he sold fair and he's so\n... and he knows how to put these things in the gentlest way\nAnd I don't get my feelings hurt and they don't come I backed out um but I Do come to that place of humility because\nUm but I Do come to that place of humility because of the respect that we share for one another\nIt's common set of values [laughter] it is you\nTalked about the the army values of loyalty duty respect\nAnd loyalty duty respect\nThe fourth one is self uh self with surface which is selfless\nService so which isn't giving over of yourself to a greater benefits and then we'll come to us he will benefit others and we may not get any benefit from\nIt looking at the overall benefit as opposed to any personal gain is um\nWhat's the best thing for our as a community that you know the question that a lot of leaders would ask themselves\nAnd there was at one point or a friend of mine has suggested oh why don't you go to this event or or do this and it'll be great come reelection time to to show your ...\nAnd I I ... I was like\nDon't ever make that argument with the like what's what's\nThe it has to have any meaning for you\nAnd you went to a um a veterans a event was it\nA few of them yes ... and that means a lot to me personally\n... you said you said one of them you will you you'll take your son to next time I was so beautifully done and it was such a beautiful program\nThat was the POW nine eleven event that was incredibly touching\nMhm um yeah and and I feel bad that I didn't bring them this time\nIt was a lot of time [laughter]\nBut I I mean I think\nYou know one of the things I like about doing the show is I get introduced to people I wouldn't otherwise get to know and I get to read present them to the public\nGet to know and I get to read things and than to the public and um and and the benefits of working in the city council is you can find some amazing people\nIt's it's really a\nIn an interesting group of people and it's been fascinating to get to know each of them individually as well as the multitude of people within the community that I wouldn't have met normally I mean I wouldn't have knocked on your door if it was it was a ... it's it's great and it's\nIt's personally very touching to me to to be that that much more involved in that community just set the example for my kids I mean uh it's super excited my my son Jake ended up running for ...\n... ... Facebook page [laughter]\nAnd and he won in ... and it was I was so proud of both for just having the the nerve to to\nHelp out that they have to be bold and he might have to learn that now\nI I loved it um it was so proud of them not not necessarily not for winning but for having put himself out there and it was great mhm so tell me about failure it never happens to me\n[laughter] on meaning other mines was that sky rocket brewery to discuss the themes in element that'll be Ron Carlson novel five guys\nThis weekend I Believe so yes catch five guys five guys a presentation sponsored by outer boroughs big read the ties into the story with the help from a cast of characters from the community you can watch this program and all of our quality programs from around the area in high definition on double A.

illness everything you wanted to know but were afraid to ask I'm Kerry Baluch community relations coordinator at the hospital and out of our Massachusetts and with me is\nDirt ... and and I am a sufferer of mental illness and I'm trying to be here to try to break some stigmas that go along with it so Terry um what are we trying to we're trying to do with this podcast here\nDerek I really feel that this podcast is meant to make individuals aware of mental health and mental illness in our communities to break stigma to educate 'em as somebody who has a background\nThe very diverse background and mental health um I can say that education outreach and community outreach are so important to the care and the continuity of care for individuals who are suffering from mental illness so I think we just really wanted to get the word out there\nSo I'm for people who don't know us while we do a little bit of a background ourselves not you know nothing to link thing so um what brought you into this field carry\nSo I actually started off on with a desire to be an art therapist\nBecause I had a passion for our and I had a passion for psychology um when I went to college items to my major to art in psychology and just figured you know what I'll see her life takes me and I had the absolute blessing of having my\nI'll see where life takes me and I had the absolute blessing of having my first job working for a a clubhouse model and hope deal math\nAnd I worked with the chronically mentally ill population but even beyond that there is there's a deeper passion that I have for the population besides the experiences that I've had\nWorking with these individuals my father my father is he diagnosed or individual with bipolar disorder and I have seen him struggle throughout my entire life\nAnd I've always had this soft spot in my heart\nFor it in perspective of mental illness is not just your label mental illness is just an aspect of you so from the outside world someone may see for instance my father and say that so and so that's where he has bipolar disorder\nBut I always knew him as dad that's my dad and he just happens that bipolar disorder\nThat I strongly feel influenced my passion for understanding I got the human mind focusing on psychology and then leading into I'm leading to working with individuals with chronic mental health disorders\nAs I said in this field in Massachusetts for about five years\nAnd then decided to make a life leap I moved down to Pennsylvania and I had the opportunity to work with a very different population and I've worked with individuals with intellectual disabilities and challenging behaviors as well as chronic mental health disorders it gave me a very different aspect\nAnd we'll have local a gas that will be able to um offer more insight into into these topics\nSo where to take a short break and who do we have coming and we have a great first guest that you um lined up for us who's coming in\nAbsolutely so we have Rachel legend on Rachel is the CEO of our hospital here in Atlanta borrow and she'll be joining us she has a an extensive background and mental health and she'll be able to offer kind of perspective of um services and mental health needs in issues in our local community\nOkay great I'm so stay tuned a this is exploring mental illness everything you wanted to know but were afraid to rest and we'll be right back\nOK well come back we're going to have carry introduce our first guest who she knows a very well here it for hospital\nThank you Derek I'd like to welcome Rachel legend CEO at full or hospital a two hour first pot cast\nAnd a ritual to start off about a little bit about your background and the mental health field\nUm thanks for having me appreciate being here I'm a licensed social worker by trade 'em I've spent the last Thirty years my career I'm serving behavior of clients and both macro legislative work as well as micro doing clinical work\nYou ever have clients in both macro legislative work as well as Mike Rowe doing clinical work with very high risk population so algae Beatty kids um and then sexual assault survivors and then lastly behavioral health patients in a psychiatric Hedy\nSo I started in the psyche D's 'em and fell in love with a behavioral health patients I'm primarily psychotic patients or who I really enjoy working with\nHere at full or I think one of the most rewarding things about everything I've done is looking at how do we take a patient when they first arrive and then what are they looked like when they leave 'em and we create an environment where they can heal and access resources I mean that that is the bottom line of what we do here every day\nAnd I'm One of the biggest misconceptions about mental health care facilities\nUm I think there's so many but I guess the first I'd say is kind of outdated view that were an institution and it's an institutionalized feel\nI think the great thing about four hospitals is actually used to be a family mansion back in the day and I was a community family here and so the old horse stables are actually a patient unit every single patients' rooms have windows\nBut I think the truth is is that we are here to deliver a compassionate care\nBy license clinicians and psychiatrists we're here to do good work and so we spend our days\nGoing to groups and I'm Talking to physicians and doing therapeutic interventions mean that that's I think not a perception of people are sitting around medicated and not receiving services and not getting engaged and that couldn't be further from the truth\nNow is one person or on my own I've been trying to break the stigma of mental illness by becoming very open a talking about a very openly not being embarrassed about it I Know why breaking the stigma of mental illnesses saw him on why do you think it's so important and why is it so hard to do\nRight you know I think the misconceptions exist about mental health um\nHard to do right you know I think the misconceptions exist about mental health um and it's rampant in our community because of the taboo of what people believe I think it goes back to the institutional comments I just made\n'em but the truth is the vast majority of us us ourselves have a family member or friend who suffers from mental illness or substance abuse and so the truth is when we realized that it touches many many people in our lives and across all demographics\nUm socioeconomic genders race\nWhen we start to look at it and the impact that it has then I think people like you are opening people's eyes that that it does it impacts all of us I mean\nI have people who work for me or some of the most amazing employees I have who have mental illness and carry a diagnosis and they're productive and engaged and compassionate and I would say they even bring an added level of care\nUm to our patients because they understand um what it's like to live in those shoes I think the disease impacts a massive amount of the people in our community\nIn this facility works to treat those people in a compassionate patient centered way um and we also serve as a beacon in our community for those who are in need or who seek help to say we're here walk in our front door you know let us assess let us off or resources\nAre carrying I think he had a couple of questions I did [noise]\nRachel how do you think gender plays a role in mental illness I think that's an interesting concept because um and when we look at gender and societies impact on gender um we have all kinds of conceptions about how men and or women should behave and so\nThose social contracts of gender we we actually makeup and so what we believe about gender today is not how people perceive gender\nFifty one hundred a hundred and fifty years ago or in different countries for that matter the truth is that impacts both men and women um but in some ways the way it impacts can be different we have different expectations on how ... we we set those expectations um\nWe have different expectations on how ... we we set those expectations I'm an act like we know how many should be um and when they act less than that we call them weak or other more inappropriate names\nSo it makes it harder for men to seek treatment and so we see 'em for depression and anxiety less men receiving treatment for depression anxiety you see more women receiving treatment and so it's our job at this facility with the help of people like Derek to say\nThis is an impact across the board because people experienced trauma\nUm similarly and so how do we set the stage for a man to be able to walk in and say I need assistance with some of the stuff but also to honor that the vast majority of women have trauma histories and so how do we also create a facility\nAnd a team enter treatment team in physicians who are able to accept\nUm sexual assault survivors into this facility and treat them in a way that allows them to heal I think it's also important we were talking about gender to acknowledge that transgender gender community and so the facility has worked really hard\nTo make sure not only we abide by state statute and abide by hate crimes but that we worked diligently to create a facility that accepts all people period until whatever that looks like man woman transgender patient who comes in here and can be expected to be treated along with best practice to not be re traumatized\nBy coming into a facility that doesn't know how to engage all patients with equality and respect and dignity\nCan you give us an example or even a story of of of something that you've seen where you have been able to address this gender roles this gender issue within a mental health facility or setting\nThem I think I'd go back to um the trans community and I think it has been practice that I'm trans clients her trans patients will be put in single ...\nPractice that I'm trans clients her trans patients will be put in single room so we'll have separate and apart bathrooms I think certainly history has told us um that separate is not equal\nAnd so we've worked diligently here to honor someone's known gender and so we have a trans man who comes in um we're putting him with a male roommate access to the male haul 'em as well as access to mail bathrooms and so\nWe frequently will get pushback around that and say what about the other clients\nBut the truth is we navigate this every single day in a vast majority of different circumstances so people who are struggling with race issues and men and may make racial comments we appropriately placed patients in rooms where they're going to have the most success and sometimes with some of those around\nAnd that's the way it goes but setting the stage for every single person who comes in here to be treated with dignity\nTo honor their identity um honor the work that they need to do and create a healing space for them in fact to do that and we can't do that um if we set the stage from hello that we're not doing the right thing and not honoring who that human is and so I think at full or we're done an exceptional job all the way from intake\nTo honoring people's preferred names um and how does that look and how do we set the stage on the unit for that to be carry through from beginning to end from admission from the very first time you walk into this facility to the day you leave in every single staff is on the same page\nAbout what my expectations are of my staff about how we treat patients but also setting the stage across the board for other patients who are on the unit who may struggle who may not have information who may not have knowledge about that I'm In a way that's appropriate in confidential but again honors that individual patient\nI have I have a follow up to that um how tough has a learning curve been with the the transgender problems that the you know that you face here at the hospital right now\nTransgender problems that them you know that you face here at the hospital right now I'm you know I mean I honestly I think\nThe learning curve is ongoing and I think it will be because you know I've done L G T trainings for hospital systems for schools for H R departments for Twenty years\nAnd honestly the training is I did Twenty years ago were super different than the training I Do today because language changes um expectations change statute and legislation changes\nUm and the truth is more often than not it's the adolescent population of the gay lesbian by trans kids who kind of drive and push forward some progress so the language isn't the same as Twenty years ago and so\nThe learning curve is ever present quite honestly\nHowever I Will say that the best practices we put in place here kind of set the stage for expectations so we have a policy on how we engage and treat ... patients\nThat addresses language pronoun use name use 'em while we can't change a healthcare card or a medical record that doesn't mean that we can't honor someone's\nName restroom room designation in a way that meets what their gender is so it's ever changing and were up for the task and I think we do it better than most quite honestly\nAbsolutely I totally agree\nNaming in claiming mental illness I'm definitely reduces the stigma especially when it's the people we care about coming out if you will write write coming out we usually use as an algae term but I like to explain coming out to people as\nTelling someone something that you're not sure how they'll react because the truth as every single person knows how that feels right doesn't matter is it about mental illnesses that about being a domestic violence survivor is it about being a child of an alcoholic it is it about being a lesbian like whatever it's about we all know what that feels like\nAnd so the truth is that that is what it feels like and so how do we honor that and support people and they're already in crisis right now no one is coming to flourish front door um because they're having a good day\nAnd so we need to be prepared literally from my front desk staff through the nurse who says hello while they walk on the unit to the first mental health worker they engage with all of those people to be hand holding and compassionate and engaged in full of information in creating a place that feels safe\nBecause that's that's the first step if you don't feel safe you're not going to you have no ability to work on anything and you're not healing um first and foremost do you feel safe can we reduce anxiety to a place that you can start thinking about what are what are the things that I actively need to work on to feel better\nYou said talking about coming out because I was I'd um I had told Kerry it'll be five years in February that I came out on Facebook mhm about my struggles with it\nBe five years in February that I came out on Facebook about my struggles with mental illness for the past Twenty years at that time\nAnd I got you know like two or three hundred likes I had all these private messages and I said I appreciate\nYou know what you folks but I didn't do it for like ... I didn't do it for I just want to let people know my car can only break down so times I kept lying you know I lost jobs lost friends I lost it was like a huge weight lifted off my shoulders\nBut then I got a lot of private messages about fifty to sixty private messages you know what I suffer from the same thing so unfortunately but fortunately I was kind of an expert at the time on what they were going through\nSo now they would call me at midnight or one or two or three in the morning say him having anxiety attack okay calmed down it's going to be okay I'm In coming out on Facebook you know that was\nThat was my big thing like I said it was a huge weight lifted off my shoulder and there was no\n... everybody was proud of you you know and I knew some people knew but I don't think they knew to what degree in how bad it was and doing that you know people you know the chicken I hey how ya doing haven't seen it on Facebook in awhile haven't heard from your while I'm having a tough time so like I said you know I just wanted my life back\nThat was the biggest thing so I don't I don't understand why you know I I you know from when you said before you get called names and stuff like that but if you've got friends and you've got a great support system they're not going to hold it against you got and granted I lost some friends\nBut most of my friends when I came out and I told them what I was suffering from they did research on it so they could try to help me right handed or engage conversation right they would go on the Internet and they just wouldn't say oh it's an excuse is it's an excuse he's using his\nHis anxiety depression and his panic as an excuse well no I'm not and if you've seen the hard work I've done over the past twenty five years you know I don't use as an excuse\nAnd if you've seen the hard work I've done over the past twenty five years you know I don't use it as an excuse I use breaking down my cars an excuse to cover up my mental illness don't cover it up anymore I wear a badge I own it but it doesn't define who you know who I Am anymore\nYou know that was part of the reason so I I live in this community right I used to live six minutes down the road and I would drive by this hospital consistently and actually only knew of this hospital because I also ran a behavioral health\nFacilities in Rhode Island and so when I first got hired here I thought you know that that's my local grocery store next door um this is the main thoroughfare more people need to understand what the White House on the hill is because\nWhen we start to understand that fuller is integrated in this community people who live and work here I'm living this community\nAnd so when Kerry came on the first thing I ever said to her as I went to community fair on our front lawn\nAnd lo and behold less than half a year later you know she produce four hundred people in\nFifty um community resource vendors\nAnd so and that's where I'm at you and so that that's important right that's how we do this is come on my front lawn meet my staff\nSay hello carnival games for the kids let me show you who we are and what we're about and what we do here so that we can again we're always working to kind of reduced the stigma that you continue to talk about\nBecause the truth is people work at fuller because we are looking to help people make their lives better and people are here because they're struggling there's not anyone in this facility who isn't currently sick and so\nHow do we get them better and part of it is isn't a community fair is things like the semi colon project so that we started to have some visibility around mental health and so we'll have another community fair this summer we'll continue and invite people into our front doors to tour a facility to\nOther community fair this summer we'll continue and invite people into our front doors to tour a facility to come on our front lawn to hang out with us um because the truth is that's the only way to start to break it down\nYou know I had to put us I put a banner out front that says walking welcome because I Want people to know that you can walk into our front door you don't have to make a call you don't have to get a PCP referral you don't have to go to an emergency department\nAnd that doesn't mean you're going to get hospitalized either it means I'm struggling can you help and our answer is always going to be yes what is it you need and how do we make it happen and you know my my staff kind of makes fun of me consistently but what am I saying as we come from a place of yes here\nAnd so can we make it happen the answer is yes can I help that patient the answer is yes can I get you to where you need to go next yes can I make you feel better yes\nAnd what we can't do it alone we can't do without the patients engagement we can't do it all out with a whole team um but the answer is yes we come from a place of yes how can I help yes come in my front door yes come and ask for help yes we will be there to answer\nWhat would you like people to know about fuller aside and you know you don't want people just think oh that's the house up on the hill with a crazy people go rent so your your final thoughts what do you want people to get out of today's a message\nI liked him to see solar as a resource there are engaged staff there are you know my CFO started hairs housekeeper and never left and he still has his housekeeping shirt on the back of his door\nYou know my director of facilities full or on the entire neighborhood out behind here and ah his mom was a nurse here and he grew up with full or rent and his mom one of those houses and he's never left here um that is what fuller is\nFull or as a place that has engage staff who are here saying we want to help we're here to help\nBut this community should know as we should be a resource you know you do not have to go to a needy do not have to go\nYou should know as we should be a resource you know you do not have to go to any do you do not have to go to a clinic you do not have to go to your PCP and it doesn't mean you're going to get hospitalized either we have a partial hospitalization program where you can go for the day I have an intensive outpatient program where you can go three times a day or do half days\nThere are many many options to get you help 'em that don't necessarily end up an inpatient level of care however we have that if that's where you are as well\nAnd so if people could start to see fuller one is a place that's accessible because that's very important to me um but to as a resource um and even if it's just to go straight to outpatient\nHow do we help you set up that therapist appointment that has just been too hard for you to do on the outside because patients if they could have done it they would have already done it right no one's more committed to a patient's care than the patient themselves and so frequently I find if they could have made something happened they already have\nAnd so how does fuller offer that next step to actually get them that peace will ever whatever it is we should be accessible um and we should come from places yes Rachel\nI

I've heard people talking about mega millions I guess the mega millions is up to some huge\nJackpot I'm Out now over six hundred million or something like that I don't I never read the lottery numbers on this show I don't follow the lottery I don't play the lottery never bought a scratch ticket my life never mind mega millions or that stuff\nI don't play the lottery never bought a ... ticket in my life never mind mega millions or that stuff\nOr just don't trust it it's another aggressive tax hey hey I Know will tell people they have a chance to win millions and they won't even know it's another way another way to get the poor and working class to support our tax base so the rich don't have to wow the lottery yuck\nAnd are over six hundred million is that the right figure actually I take that question back is that the right figure I couldn't care less if that's the right figure I couldn't care less about the lottery I mean I Do think it should be legal because if we didn't have the lottery we'd still have\nYou know rocky working in Philadelphia as a a leg breaker for numbers runner and the loan shark I'm so people are going to engage in that kinda stuff so we might as well a sanction it let the state get their cut\nBut uh\nIf it is six hundred million whatever it is a six hundred million to one person one person that's insanity that's obscene that's awful how about a set of one price for six hundred million you have I don't know six hundred prizes for one million\nThat would seem better to me and level off the odds with the mega millions if you're going to rush out and buy your tickets knock yourself out of don't worry you won't have to wait behind me in line\nFor that [noise]\nAlthough and now now if I'm waiting in line behind you to buy all your lottery tickets and you

hundred million or it's not three hundred and fifty seven million it's probably a hundred and eighty million\nOr whatever while they had to do is they have to take the winnings then immediately by all kinds of real estate property\nMake millions more on that and then claim to the government that the properties Abd appreciated and not pay one penny and tax just like Jared Kushner remember our own president told us not paying that cheating on your taxes that's what smart people do only suckers pay taxes gym you know patriotic citizens\nTaking that money that the lottery gets from the winnings ah you know half of it or whatever it is and get back to a lot of people that needed that would be a nice thing at any rate we're going to have temperatures falling to the mid thirties\nThan back the sunshine mid fifties tomorrow the big story really beginning this afternoon through about mid day tomorrow strong winds today at southwest that's why it will be fairly mild\nAnd I said that rang a bell for mayor had some meaning for me and because it meant so much to Steve and\nSo of course the donation didn't come anywhere close to what to what we actually did and um [noise] and so we started down that road and I I made a couple of connections with people about properties and\nAh people to talk to and actually the property so we're located in\nSheldon ville section of rent them we are on route one Twenty one it's the old Sheldon ville nursing home which so many people have a memories\nOf it being I'm nursing home I've had so many people come up to me and say they were a nurse there they or someone was a maintenance man the cook the Girl Scout who sang Christmas songs to the U.S seniors they are at Christmas Time um\nThat's the property that we on right now uh we purchased it in February\nWe uh open to a couple of months ago we are as I said it's a structured sober recovery has which means that we have twenty four hour supervision at the house we\nOh I have three ... cheese with four layers of wallpaper and covered by paint and one wall\nHalfway would that removed and it just looks awful so when everyone when everyone in southern Russia to the gym Rhode Island is sober if you could send your career over to my house search to to fix my ruined to do it yourself projects were talking to our Barbara ... of Gilead house which has only been around a couple of years\nUm I just interrupt to the middle of a ... month month month one guy and ah I offer ... off route one Twenty one uh-huh in rent them and are you are making a point\nThat I felt the need to interrupt about my failed yourself project\nSo we've done a lot to do it yourself I mean we ... like I said we've had a so K. P. high school has a group called the KP cares which is their outreach community service organization they have spent a huge amount of hours they're\nUh we've had hoped out of high school and mount St Charles\nCome all these kids came on a Saturday or Sunday spent the day did um as I said stripping wallpaper cleaning floors or I'm painting we've had a E. M. C. has come for a number of days the emcee encourages their employees to do community service\nWe had um a company a Hal I'm corporation and Fox borrow came on a Ninety five degree day and spent the entire day doing all kinds of projects around\nThe house um we've had many faith based groups come to that has to do all kinds of work it's just the community\nOutreach an outpouring has just been amazing we have had literally probably now getting close to four hundred people who have come to volunteer at the house and it is a major\nFunding come from I mean did did you\nHave come to volunteer at the ... and it is\nA major funding come from I mean did did you rent lease or purchase the property so we purchased the property oh did you hit mega millions and just write them a check or where did the funding come from Barbara\nOut to a great question a took a while for us to find a mortgage uh we put some of our own money into it we found a a Milford national bank was a wonderful bank to us\nGave us a mortgage and then frankly the woman that we bought the property from gave us some second mortgage also so um but it was not easy putting it all together yeah and\nUh now uh so sober recovery has is a I don't get any funding from anywhere there's no insurance pays for people to be there\nAnd it's all private pay 'em so the people who come to live at the house they all have to work everybody we're not getting around that and you know or you need to keep busy and uh so people are either working or doing community service or something around our\n... you know the ... has your or around some other place in town a so that they keep busy they pay a program feet to the house and uh otherwise we really rely on a on a community for donations\nAnd um ... what happened was just to give you another story OK backstory here was one Sunday we were working at the house and a couple of came in\nAnd uh said we were at church this morning and the minister was talking about ... has and we knew we just had to come in here and they had lost their son a year earlier and they asked if they could decorate and dedicated a bedroom in their son's name and that was\nThey could decorate and dedicate a bedroom\nIn their son's name and that was kind of the beginning of something that we never planned on it all every single bedroom at the house and all the rooms as a matter of fact have all been I'm adopted\nDedicated and decorated and I loved\nOne's name wow uh parents who have lost sons every room has a um [noise]\nHas a plaque on it in the name of a young man who's passed away and the rooms are gorgeous it's very homey at our house every room has kind of a different theme like one young man loved music and so the whole bedroom is decorated kind of music came down to his guitars is in the room\nAnother um young man was a fisherman so they painted a couple of the walls blue and one of his fishing rises hang on the wall or\nIs there a room with the left field wall at Fenway Park painted on it or\nNot but there are plenty of sports memorabilia around the house in ... you know men and it just seemed to be easily go to that\nWell up when you have a little a few extra shackles in the tech I'd encourage you to build a nice Wiffle ball field out backward activity age and fifty five o get to your question in just one second uh we're talking to a\nI'm Barbara why did I just based on your last name ... right easy to do yeah yeah right yeah uh uh the chief coke bottle washer at a ... house which is a sober house up for men um I Know what it's like to lose a spouse I Can't imagine what it's like to lose a child\nUm what prevented you from just swallowing in your own pain and depression\nAnd actually turning this into a positive for so so many hundreds maybe thousands of other people where did that strength come from\n[noise] that's a hard question\nPeople were that strength come from [noise]\nThat's a hard question to answer I don't know I just knew that I had to do something I couldn't just let it go like that I couldn't just let that happen and and\nQuite honestly you know everybody grieve differently and we all know that and there I certainly now I'm In touch with so many parents who with losses and you know there are some people who are finding it hard to get out of bed in the morning\nSo [noise] um what I Do have to say is that the parents who have done things that Gilead has feel\nSo empowered about their grief because they're they're moving forward to do something in such a positive way and uh the camaraderie we just had last night as a matter of fact\nThat group of people who parents and\nLoved ones who have named drums we just had a dinner together last night at the house and with the residents they are and the residents get to meet the people who is the rooms are named that you know the parents of those rooms and it's just an amazing\nUm camaraderie is the only word I can come up with of such a warm feeling a for everybody and you know I had one\nUm set of parents who went and bought some clothes for a young man he had been homeless for a while and I went and bought him some clothes and and people just feel like they're doing something wonderful which they are out of such a great tragedy here\nIs a saw my we in the Gulf Baghdad did that on purpose sober three years did it on my own\nHer place meaning Gillis place sounds so much better I Wish it was available when I was sick do you mix drug addicts with alcoholics they're totally different addictions is yours scaly house for any kind of substance abuse addiction or is it just like opioid abuse or just\nIt's for any substance abuse addictions\nHave you found any issue with uh like alcoholics or opioid addicts or pot heads ...\nHave a mix of people have what they are drug of choice was so to speak whether you know alcohol or some particular type of drug\n... and honestly I think we've just created an atmosphere in a culture and our has that uh that doesn't matter and that I think all the guys would tell you that it's kind of all the same and I\nI don't mean to cover that lately at all\nUm but I think the guys in the house I mean they all go to AA meetings together and ah we do have starting to have some in has um there is a tremendous camaraderie a tremendous amount of trust in the has the right now we ... we have a seven people living in the house [noise]\nUm so it's not twenty and I think it will change when it is twenty but um you know I think we have a solid base\nStandard when it is twenty but um you know I think we have a solid base all our staff are all in long term recovery yeah my house director worked for nor cap for 'em I somewhere around ten years so I feel as though he's extremely experienced a number of other people who work at the has\nHave um are also a counsellors have received licensing to be drug addiction counsellors so um you know I feel like we have a really solid staff\nAnd it's funny with with opioid addiction opioids it seems more than than alcohol and other substance actually changes the wiring in the brain [noise]\nUm so it's a it's not just a matter of discipline and you just have to tough it out and it's for an opioid addiction it's almost impossible to take that alone it is almost\nImpossible you really need support you need to get rid of any of the old relationships that drag you down um you know some people need to really leave the area that they were living in completely uh my son\nWent ... went to ah to Maine to celebrate as he also went to California to some rehab and the place that he passed away it was in my house so um you know it was right here back at home with somebody that he knew\nSo that's why you know for some people they need to go away I it it varies as much\nA you know with what the treatment is as you said earlier I mean you know some things work for some people on some other things worked for other people\nKnow there were more correspondence is I don't think it matters what kind of addiction or they have um the twelve steps worked for all of them I was at Alcoholics Anonymous\nAh oh it was\nThe hawks anonymous uh\nOh it was that Alcoholics Anonymous was the first one with twelve steps again bar but you know you know you've got more about this huge issue that I Know but from what I've read the the the uh opioid addiction seems to be a little bit different and how would change changes the wiring of the brain a couple of philosophical questions um\nMany many many a psychologist or psychiatrist tell us we have to get to the root cause what's the cause what's the hole in the soul that the person is trying to fill\nWith drugs or alcohol or some other thing uh everyone Bradshaw was around about Twenty years ago and uh we had to heal the hearts of the inner child that was big for a while my mom bought us all a Bradshaw books\nAnd then there were some people who go with the tough love root unique tough love dammit life's hard we're not going to make it easy for\nYou and that seems to have faded away a little bit and now the total support mode is coming back into vogue the total support so not to make it a black and white issue but ... house is that more of a tough love kind of place where is that more of a total support kind of place [noise]\nWell I think [noise] excuse me the philosophy that we've tried to change over the past couple of years which has really made a big difference is eliminating the stigma\nSo years ago nobody would've ever spoken about a family member who had a drug addiction and so it became something awful for not only the person who was active but for the family as well I mean I have someone who is dedicating one of the bedrooms in the house\nWho lives in my neighborhood and she said her brother passed away Thirty years ago from a heroin overdose nobody can talk about that that and I mean it it just was never spoken I'm back\nSo the fact that somebody is an active addiction now at least\nThe fact that somebody is in active addiction now at least you can talk about it there are other people that you can talk to about it and there are support groups just for that\nAnd honestly we've had so many people come to that as they drive in the driveway they walk in the house and they just started telling their story because they know that our houses a safe place to talk about it\nUm there's a difference on your tough love the I think the word would really be enabling and I think so many parents you know all we want to do is just be able to fix things\nI think that's sort of where society is right now\nAnd and I think unfortunately for kids I mean\nThey think it's a two second facts and I think that's part of the issue especially for young\nPeople who have active addictions is that you know they just want to get my now my son Stephen I mean he just like just let me have a couple of weeks and then let just wanting to be perfectly batter and unfortunately it just doesn't work that way and it is all about long term recovery and I feel like I really need to\nThrow that in there before we finish our conversation because unfortunately I think government and insurance companies are as well looking for quick fixes\nThere is really no quick fix you know all of us have some habit\nThat we'd like we'd like to change whether it's we want to lose weight we want to read more we want to relax more whatever whatever it is that we want to do we don't change those things overnight it takes a really long time and this is the same thing for recovery from addiction\nAnd it takes a long time and we you really never hear so start listening now when you hear a government our insurance does no support from those at all for people who want to be in long term recovery\nAnd uh insurance if anything has gotten shorter and shorter and what they'll provide even between a deep ...\nHas gotten shorter and shorter and what they'll provide even between a detox and um and going to a residential rehab\nI'm a halfway house um insurance has gone shorter and shorter and what they're willing to provide and again it depends on what your insurance is which that's another whole subject about the maze of out there\nThat's a nightmare for parents because they just don't know like which road you go to and what do you take what do you do which places okay which plays isn't okay what will my insurance cover I mean we we\nHad such arguments with Blue Cross and my husband actually went there in Quincy to take paperwork because they kept saying they didn't receive hours I mean it very frustrating especially when you have a child who you know\nIt could be his last day you know so a long term recovery is really the only way that people are going to get better from this and and just to circle back on the uh enabling a tough love ... I mean it is it's hard for parents to uh\nTo be able to do to cut themselves off on certain things with their kids are not to account just do this one more time kind of thing it's very difficult and I would be remiss if I didn't mention learned to cope which is a wonderful support group for\nParents or a loved ones with someone in active addiction and it's specifically for that and\nAh they're all local chapters a there's a one an adult borrow there's one in Franklin a it's a wonderful network for people to go to that again there's no stigma nobody judges you almost everybody's been in someone's story somewhere along the line so\nI'm even feeding their obituaries now used to be a past suddenly now\n... um even see it in their obituaries now it used to be a path suddenly now a bill mentioned exactly what it was trying to bring attention to the issue and then even place you know in lieu of flowers pleased donate to places like ...\nEven passed away I thought it was I didn't want to act like I was ashamed ... and um and I thought if he could help somebody else now eh man meant the world to me\nIf this table wasn't so big I give you a giant hug right now we're talking to Barbara Gil meister of Gilead house G.

imagine this year you're playing a game where you're trying to win but you're also the referee and so you get to choose when a foul has been called anybody would look at that and say wait a minute that game is cute\nAnd that's what's happening here integrity would require Brian Kemp to recuse himself to step down as secretary of state in this kind of high profile election instead he has not and so we see things going on like prior to this\nUm we had the ... they're trying to shut down the polling places in a majority or\nA majority African American counties or counties that had a sizable black population so like in Randolph county um where one of camps allies tried to you know recommended that seven of nine polling stations shut down um\nBefore the general election I mean that kind of\nInterference that kind of skewed\nI'm I'm a decision making is what is what Stacey Abrams is talking about when she says that it is calling into question the legitimacy of the election is calling into question and legitimacy of our electoral process safe and so a secretary of state\nThat is the bedrock foundation of his role is to ensure the integrity of the election process and sitting on top of this one undermines that Brian cats\nElection process sitting on top of this one undermines that\nBrian kept the secretary of state and the Republican candidate for governor Twain and Sunday my

of Kansas I'm you know Kobach has been writing that lie of um non citizens voting in math I'm skewing the elections in Kansas and only he can block them\nAnd so and by raising the flag of illegal immigrants it is playing to a racist trope um that in the body politic that these immigrants are going to somehow steal our elections\nBut he cannot point to note saying the same way that Kris Kobach could not point to all of these illegal immigrants um it is a fiction it is a lie it is a myth that as being used\nTo stir up fear and to justify the kind of unwarranted voter suppression techniques that the secretaries of state like Brian Kemp and Kris Kobach are using\nI'd like to go back to this whole issue of will do the closing of polling places or most people who really don't pay attention to what happens in polling places all of them there's\nAnd because you talk about the impact on voter turnout of all of a sudden or either closing the bowling places or shifting of old voting place would from one location to another just before an election\nAbsolutely I'm so one of the things to to pay attention to is that after the Supreme Court and gutted the voting rights act with the Shelby County beholder decision in twenty Thirteen\nWith the Shelby County beholder decision and twenty Thirteen\nBy the time we got to the twenty sixth teen election states that had been under pre clearance and that is where because of their history of racial discrimination at the polls they had to have all of their voting rights voting changes may or approved by the department of justice\nAfter the voting rights was got it a hundred and sixty eight polling places were shutting down by the time we got to the twenty sixteen election Brian camp has been responsible for two hundred and fourteen of those polling places being shut down\nWhat the research shows is that for every tenth of a mile that a polling place is removed from the African American community black voter turnout goes down by point five percent so the more you move these polling places\nThe the further and further the more and more you're able to depress the black voter turnout\nSo we had a an instance in Sparta where\nA under the guise of being fiscally responsible they were going to consolidate the polling stations well when they consolidated the polling stations\nThe one for the black community and I can say the black community because we do have residential segregation in the United states so for the one in the black community that one was moved Seventeen miles away\nNow think about that for trying to vote and what we also know is that many in the African American community do not have a private cars they don't have personal transportation so they have to rely upon public transportation so when you move\nA polling place further and further away from the black community by that very moment\nFurther and further away from the black community by that very moment that very instance is designed to be pressed the black voter turnout\nIn June democracy now spoke with Stacey Abrams a democratic candidate for governor in Georgia\nVery Kim has unfortunately built very strong record of voter suppression and yes he and I have\nTo leave a conflict at a number of times and I think I'm I'm very well I'm not I don't think I Know I'm very proud of our record of beating him a forcing him to restore the cancel registrations of thousands of compelling his office to do the right thing when it comes to voter registration\nBut also I think it's a challenging conversation to have both with secretary cans and with lieutenant governor cable because rather than focusing on how we move the state forward they've both focus unfortunately on required or form of bigotry and how they want to harm communities and hold us back\nSo that Stacey Abrams speaking ... about her opponent church a secretary of state Brian Kemp and Georgia lieutenant governor Casey Cagle I also want it to turn to the Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia\nWho was captured on video Saturday as he snatched a cell phone out of the hands of a constituent\nWho asked about\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp poop Purdue was stumping for senator Purdue is on the campus of Georgia Tech in Atlanta when a student try to ask him about his endorsement\nSo uh how can you endorse a candidate Robert started going to want to jump through when\nSenator Purdue return the phone after student demanded it back\nOn Sunday produce office called the incident a misunderstanding saying the senator thought the student wants to take a selfie\nAnd senator misunderstanding saying the senator thought a student wanting to take a self ain't ...\nI'm\nA professor I understand if you could comment on that finished we wrap up this discussion about Georgia who is voting right now I mean in some states there's no voting taking place by what's happening in Georgia\nI'm so first on I'm senator ... do\nYou remember senator Purdue is the one who opened a one of those Christian breakfast is\nUm by praying for Obama's death by saying you know make your life be ended short you know quoting of a song and you know may your wife be left to I'm a widow and your children homeless and beggars so this is Senator David Perdue\nUm and and Stacey Abrams is actually right that the the language that we're getting from\nI'm Brian\nKemp and Casey Cagle has been the language of fear has been the language of stoking um um racial animosity racial anxiety ah and and bigotry and sold and they're they're selling fear as as they're as their component\nFor why they shouldn't be in office\nAnd so what we're seeing right now is that we have early voting going on 'em and the the I I'm not sure how how risk it hasn't been yet but I Know that um the grassroots organizations have been very active\nAnd getting people registered to vote getting people out to vote and because Stacey Abrams in ...\nHas a message of hope has a message of how we build Georgia for all of us um that is in fact stoking the fear on the side of the Republicans\nUm that is in fact stoking the fear on the side of the Republicans um because the demographics are changing so much in Georgia that the vote\nThe vote for African Americans Asians and Latinos has to be stuff down because the message that the uh Brian temp and the Republicans are bringing aren't messages that resonate with that population because ... those populations are in fact targeted by that their message\nAnd Carolyn Anderson chair of African American studies department at Emory University author of well most recently one person no vote voter suppression is destroying our democracy will be back with her and other guests in a moment [noise] [noise]\nOr because of having a felony conviction suggesting me in this\nBipartisan a coalition that has formed talk about what it's like to work with these different groups and what are the polls indicate for November\nWell first of all we don't even call out of the bipartisan movement we are organic grassroots movement that welcomes enjoys bipartisan support we're not leading where the partisan nature of of this topic or or the issue of voting\nWith the partisan nature of uh of this topic or the issue of voting what we're leading with is the human nature you know that they're real people's lives who are impacted by these policies and because of that we've been able to first of all recognize\nThat that some interest in franchising now impacts people from all walks of life which now allows us to go into communities in rural parts of Florida in urban parts of Florida and have real conversations with real people and really connect with the pain that they're feeling\nBecause of that because of that what we've seen is indicative of what we're seeing now with the hurricane relief efforts that we've always seen\nThat in the aftermath of hurricane no one cares how their neighbor voted no one cares how much money they made only thing they see is another human being and need and that's the beautiful part of this campaign\nThat we have in brace and we're all on two\nFor dear life because at the end we are organizing folks along the lines of humanity\nAnd because of that we've been able to get people that that that that that throw off their partisan clothes and come together as brothers and sisters are in this movement as Americans that's rallying around each other and knowing that wants to desert space is\nPaid so we can have a organizations like the tax watts\nChristian Coalition freedom partners that stand up and say you know what it is time to bring second chances back to the state of Florida and they could do that alongside the ACLU or organizations like Advancement Project I'm I'm a lines for safety injustice and Florida writes restoration coalition\nThat is to me the most beautiful thing that we're witnessing here I Believe that we are becoming a shining light for the rest of the country about what's good when people can elevate themselves\nFor the rest of the country about what's good when people can elevate themselves above partisan bakery above racial discord and connect along the lines of humanity for the good of all people are\nAble to move from Florida to another uh another state that's also a a scene of a disproportionate targeting a racial minority and the Supreme Court has ruled that will allow the state of North Dakota to enforce a new voter id requirement that will make it harder for Native Americans to vote during the midterm elections\nThe state's new voter id law requires voters to show identification that demonstrates a residential street address\nBut this has already rented many tribal IDs invalid since many Native Americans who live on reservations depend on post office boxes to receive their mail or the law could make a big difference in the close race between\nDemocratic senator Heidi Heitkamp and the Republican challenger Kevin Cramer a the races expected to help decide who controls the Senate you talk about that as well\nSo the north Dakota voter id law has flown under the radar relative to Georgia but it's just a serious because the way this Republican voter id law is written is that most tribal ideas are not going to be accepted because they do not have a residential address in them\nMany Native Americans live in rural areas on reservations they don't have address as they get their mail at the post office there's nothing wrong with that\nBut there's probably civically written to not allow PO box is count as an address so what's happening now in North Dakota is that sounds of Native Americans could be disenfranchised by this Republican voter id law according to federal court statistics twenty percent\nOf eligible Native American voters don't have\nThe correct I D and that means about five thousand Native American voters might not be able to vote in the next election and there were running out of time\nTo try to get them the correct ideas right now\nAnd the next election and then we're running out of time\nTo try to get them the correct ideas right now I mean we're basically twenty days away from the election and\nHeidi Heitkamp only won her first race for the Senate by three thousand votes with strong native support now you're talking about a much larger percentage of Native Americans who could be disenfranchised so this one voter id law in North Dakota could cost ... percent sea and could cost\nDemocrats control of the Senate so it's a very very serious situation we're also talking about the most historically disenfranchised\nGroup in this country who faces all sorts of barriers today and now thirty days before the election they find out they might not be able to vote in a critical midterm election it's absolutely shocking an appalling was half an hour it's the kind of it's also particularly\nInteresting that this is happening at a time as\nA Trump continually attacking US Senator Elizabeth Warren are trying to use the word Pocahontas named Pocahontas as a pejorative to describe her she has now gone and gotten a DNA test which she says from us Stanford professor\n... says she has Native American lineage and ancestry as she looks like she's about to announce her bed for twenty twenty at presidential uh for the twenty twenty presidential election\nJust imagine Amy is voter suppression North Dakota got a fraction of the attention of Elizabeth Warren's DNA test or Donald Trump's Pocahontas slurs and I think what we should be focusing on instead of her as history is all the barriers are being faced by Native Americans in this country and you can go down every single statistic\nAnd you see the problems but particularly with voting there was a long history of disenfranchising Native American voters of making polling places\nVery inaccessible of gerrymandering district so they don't have representation and that was right before an election a new voter ID laws put into place that could disenfranchised thousands of native voters to me this is absolutely outrageous it's on American and the fact is this\nThe voters to me this is absolutely outrageous it's on American and the fact that this election North Dakota is tainted by voter suppression you can't reverse it\nAnd so right now people have to do everything they can to get Native Americans so that they can get the idea that they need to vote but this law was specifically written it's very very clear to disenfranchise native\nAmerican writers in an hour and what are the ... in terms of the fact that we're only weeks away from the mid term elections clearly\nThe Florida referendum or whatever happens there will only take effect for the next election is but what can be done now in Georgia and in North Dakota or to be able to have some I\nHave a have these folks have their rights a vote before this lecture\nSo in Georgia there is a lawsuit filed the to allow the pending registrations to go through even if you are pending registration you can show up and vote with an idea at the polls so it's very important people know that they can vote in North Dakota the tribal authorities are going to have\nBasically a temporary IDs are going to give people a letter saying they have an address\nPoll workers are supposed to accept that but we used to be very very vigilant here and that's why issues like election protection are going to be so important 'cause I'm extremely worried people are going to show up in Georgia they're going to show up in North Dakota they might even have the right documents and election workers won't be able to won't won't tell them that they're able to vote\nAnd I'm a ... ballot initiatives that have um that will ease restrictions and other parts of the country\nWell this is huge because there's a ballot initiatives in seven states that would dramatically expand voting rights restoring voting rights ex felons in Florida to making it easier to register to vote in Michigan Nevada\nTo cracking down on gerrymandering and places like Colorado and Utah and so despite all the focus on voter suppression there is an opportunity to dramatically expand voting rights and twenty Eighteen and there is the best opportunity in a decade\nTo make it easier to vote for millions of people so I think\nThe best opportunity in a decade to make it easier to vote for millions of people so\nI think that while all the focus is on suppression and twenty Eighteen the landscape for voting rights could look dramatically different and twenty twenty if all of these ballot initiatives pass or even if some of them just passed and twenty Eighteen\nWell we want to thank you both for being with us Ari Berman of Mother Jones will

those first responders and certainly athletes and we can go on and on and today's expert is really going to start to help us\nThink about that and also think about\nWhat it means in terms when

will encourage you throughout this conversation to point people to where they can best learn about you and your team and what you do but I see a lot about maximum\nAbout you and your team and what you do but I see a lot about maximum human performance and kind of tell us what that means and how that fits with your mission\nAnd does show our our mission is a maximizing human performance\nThey not primarily we do it for tactical athletes\nUm those with mentally physically emotionally demanding jobs so when we think of our our first responders that are out there on the front line every day I'm you know the type of demands a day go through the military to him at um those out those types of um those jobs you know we have a multi disciplinary\nA program that your curriculum and education and training that hits\nNutrition conditioning resilience stress management and sleep we look at those five spheres\nAnd then you kind of pull those together and even small little changes one by one percent one percent increments\nAre really gets hit a big part of it and I know a big part of the show sustainability\nAnd that's what it's all about our for our program is about sustainability durability taking care of the individual so uh they can take care of us\nAnd as you think back in ... and then we're going to talk about what you're doing today and then you're going to expand going forward you're based in New England right up in Queens me there ... there was some of them are you\nOK I'm thinking back to your base schools when you started the company had a really a brilliant career in individual achievement in a short period of time that has no worthy\n[noise] what was it was some of those goals and why why would those are the those things driving you\nYou know I I think for for me getting out of the military and making the transition you don't have reflected on ...\nFor me getting out of the military and making the transition you don't have reflected a lot\nA lot of my experience I had a lot of the amazing men and women I worked with and it got to serve alongside\nAnd um you know one of my ... the co other co founders Palmer colors out we were teammates and the military together so we always started about talking a talking about building a business together and what are those core principles and what would it meant to us and we want to start a company\nThat for one was started with a you know great friends a solid foundation and most importantly to give back\nUm bras given back I I don't think anyone who serve their country can you know they just go out and in one day you're you're not wearing a uniform anymore and how can you continue to provide for those who who provide for us\nNow are we started when I transition I went to Harvard Kennedy School and I spend a lot of time um and are we talking about and thinking through you know what this\nCompany would be a we originally started uh actually the company Iron Man was a model that Paul and I really are talked about a lot\nAnd you get familiar with Iron Man it's a little bit more than a a swim a\nIran you know their memory and people will go to trained yeah there is nobody is\nThan that right it's a it's a brand and all we have speculated on everything that they did their training and education apparel so in a big part of our take away that we wanted to provide an experience where people\nSo we created the base to peak mountain race and what it was doing it was saying mission statement maximizing human performance it was getting people outside\nTheir comfort zones into natural terrain and challenges you by well we've been challenged the most in our in our careers in our life which is by Mother Nature alone kind of takes care of a lot um\nHere's in our life which is by Mother Nature alone kind of takes care of a lot um we had a a Base Camp\nSo when you think about the keys telling me about those keys and what is the basis of that kind of the science the data\nAround your your curriculum around what you teach in train\nSure well we take the nutrition conditioning resilience stress management and sleep but we boil it down to something that you know the big part is something as simple and that people that are you know they're going to remember so we boil it down into our curriculum is our methodology of meat eat sweat and thrive\nAnd so we have to go ahead\nNo go ahead and I just want you to give us some of the basics and are they in any order as an example do you say listen if you're not feeding your body properly you can't get to number two and three but kind of take us to the basics and how they fundamentally build on each other\nYeah so I Will say that we will wait are pillars\nA little known each other\nYeah so I Would say that we will wait are pillars the same\nUm you know a lot of some people focus on conditioning some people focus on nutrition Jerome on the on the sleep or the stress management or or resilient but I can tell you that\nIt is um the multi disciplinary you know I'm way we look at it it's holistic and your way all these things the same way and you know like from a ... doesn't matter how hard you work in the gym and what you're doing it it's hard at work of that for right\nNutrition ... is is critical and then if you're not getting you know proper sleep and recovery\nUm if you're not doing the right conditioning programs or what your goals are going to be and I think that that causes a lot where we we start a high level with the program and with all of our um you know with all of our clients is like what is your goal what are we getting out of here\nAnd what is your job so we talk a lot about the needs and now this like what is your specific needs word of the demands of your job and also how do we structure something that we talk about go back to the you know the the sustainable side of it\nHow do you make this sustainable if you are\nYou know have some um you know a very interesting nutrition habits um I you know how you're going to maintain something that overall we always say if you're not going to do it for the rest of your life and don't do\nYou know that's something that is going to be very difficult to [noise] um I'm just a stain\nAdam you're willing to pause just for a second but it is so true in in the realm of sustainability in the room\nOf corporate and you guys are running a business speed is about reunions it is about endurance it is about not giving up its a boat consistency and if you lack that would reduce it it's in nutrition or it's an extra\nLack that what they were as you said it's in nutrition or it's an exercise or it's just overall discipline of how you run your life it's not going to work you will for fall short when we get back\nWe're going to get into some again more specific so I'd like to really pick your brain Adam for for our global audience about okay you know tell us about some of these theories around exercise and and what can work and and how to you adapted to\nMy goals and same thing with with nutrition and as an example big thing today supplements give us a minute we'll be right back on renewable levels [noise]\n\nLeader argument

comprehensive human performance training and education to our nation's heroes can finish their careers and this of course\nIs for all of us finish their careers as strong as they started they are having a meaningful impact on public safety on public works obviously an first responder\nLike on public safety on public works obviously on first responders and that includes the health and safety of our community So Adam is I read your material look through your day to think about\nYour training in your education your curriculum your your events including the ones where you went from base to peak\nGive me some specifics you know so I tried to work out pretty much every day and and I've always been told listened cardio cardio cardio and I know that that part of your formula was born out of the deal to mix the gold standard for measuring cardiovascular fitness but tell us about\nThe the training around around cardio and weight training and strength training and durability and the things that they use stressed that are important to all of us\nYeah okay well go back to um you know that the eight foot and thrive methodology right bill among the sweat portion I think that you know you do have to look at the man's like ... depending on you know what you're doing it you say you're working out every day and what\nWhat fine but as long as you're working towards your working towards a goal and we want to make sure that in our workshops and their clients we work with that everybody has\nYou know the right program for them and it's a structured program a lot of people are kind of putting on necessary wear and tear on their body that I may I'm going to go out and do my my three mile run again and it's like they're really not getting anything out of it but just that besides just breaking\nDown their body even born\nWhen you talk about those goals Adam should they be very specific to I Want to get stronger I Want to get faster I mean how how targeted all day\nSo they're very targeted it depends on the bike who were with if were worth the fire department I Will tell you that you know you're going to get ranges you're going to get um a sixteen year old a man who is who is three or six months away for a year away for retirement or\nOld a man who's who's three or six months away for a year away from retirement or you got someone who just out of the roof of the recruit training class so we talk about we for the recruits we have to talk about like we have to save them from themselves you know they're coming in there they're made of rubber you know there\nThey haven't found it and then you know I'm a masters in the world right\nExactly so but the thing is we're trying to get them we talk about all those pillars of conditioning nutrition sleep stress management building resilience and improving one percent and all these different areas and when you look at the conditioning side were like what is your needs what is through your job\nOkay you need to push things he'd call things you need to carry up to eighty Ninety pounds of gear 'em you need to um Thursday cardiovascular component to it there is a upper body strength and lower body strength\nAnd some people for example like we've come across people that I Would say that or do a lot of just conditioning do a lot of cardio but they don't they don't necessarily have that\nStrength show we have a a resource of them for ... you know we want something for everyone we don't want to lose anybody that comes to our program and truthfully we have something for all the listeners to they can go to our site at all to X. dot com and go to a tap\nWe call the tactical athlete portal right\nSo we want to bring resources and give something to everybody and we want to get them comfortable with something for us because there's sometimes that people believe it or not to come to our course that hasn't worked out and like a decade\nAnd and we're like OK starting with specific goals are not going to start that person with a a five day program\nI'm not going to uh because I don't want them to get intimidated overwhelmed I Want them starting with like like just a warm up just the preparation for a workout and maybe do to recover get you to your body moving moving again but some of these well rounded they have to build speed strength endurance\nWhich is fine but your your rest days or you're going to fuel different then you're you're high intensity workout days until you're like moderate and low intensity workout days\nAnd I think that just to say that there is different types of feelings were different workout days and different preparation or that you're actually have a low intensity or you're working on the power and you're working on some different energy system later on and you're fueling different\nTo put it very simply\nYou want high quality food right and I would also not struggle with things as taste terrible um 'cause that's not sustainable either right so you're just on ... ... ... the things that you like things that you enjoy eating\nUm a quantity like how much are you how much you really need right and then the times and the timing you're going to eat and you know even down to the timing like you know\nEating too close to dinner of you to bed time I'm Sorry I'm that could disrupt your sleep so we talk about all these things and how they how they work with each other but also for the corporate athlete that's out there I mean you think about your energy\nBut also for the corporate athlete that's out there I mean you think about your either your energy level during a guy and also hydration it's something very critical to their\nOwn election that will cause just for a second but I think I'm about mothers and families and and that kind of stress when as you said hydration but the quality of foods and one of the things that we bought was stressed is can you buy a little more local can you buy a little more\nOrganic you know because we have a soil that's been somewhat depleted\nDo we have the same nutrients in those fruits and vegetables and when we get back\nWill touch on to your your kind of approach to supplements I Know again I'm the high in protein spend been pretty been pretty common and then more so I Want to talk about taking\nYour mission you're motto\nKind of use simplifying this for us in that eats sweat and thrive and how alternately can we use that to the best of our ability as a little bit of a magic the licks are for healthy living right good wait\nA low stress good cardio and obviously high quality of life give us

environment of\nWhether it's a needing really good food a needing really good sleep\nOr supplements those types of things and outside help in in training and how we exercise how we use our body how we move how we stay flexible how we kind of ward off the end of the career may be an end to end of life issue So Adam I'm\nTelling me about this then so as I think about\nYour simplification and I like it a lot eat sweat and thrive and that I'm sure it can start very young as we think about families and kids all the way up to grandparents older generations\nSo tell us about how well maybe that can be ultimately that a little bit of that magic all except for us in healthy healthy living and in different stages of our lives do you place maybe different weight different emphasis on\nNutrition versus exercise versus cardio does it changed\nVersus exercise versus cardio does it change has changed as the science of keeping people healthy changed a lot since you started this company\nIt doesn't matter what age you know someone who's listening here is that you know when you think about nutrition and eating it I think about your energy management you should think you should be trying to be self aware Doris Day like it might sluggish why\nDo I feel good why um that I wake up that I have breakfast today so many people we work with don't eat breakfast so they don't drink water\nAnd it's such an important it's such an important part we're losing a leader to order every night and you're starting your day dehydrated I mean your reaction time is lower um you um it causes daytime fatigue the dehydration\nSo waking up in the morning eating breakfast you know things that are once again quality quickly timing um you know start moving find at times\nDon't set your don't set your ah your sweat sessions or your your conditioning for some time at five AM because if you're not a morning person I don't want you start the day like ... automatically not achieving your goals set it

movement\nAnd they're finding something that you enjoy doing getting up eating breakfast drinking water 'em and then ... ... a big part of that we didn't really talk about much as the thrive portion and that's like the the mental performance the stress management\nYou know the sleep component and I said that's really really critical to uh\nYou know the fleet component and I think that that's really really critical to\nThat manage to manage the distress in day in and day out find time to breathe every day we have a credible amount of resources on their tactical athletes world that has

here's your house Peter are putting\nSo much from like\nYou know now it's a renewable known network are and and today\nWe get into one of\nWell potentially our favorite topics but I guess for a lot of people maybe it is not and that is about diet about food about what we consume about what we cook what else do we use you know what level of saturated fat as an example is acceptable\nAnd then of course what does that mean to us in terms of health and in terms of heart health and cardiovascular\nAnd to help us get through all of that is our guest Dr penny ... after ten and and it fits with some of the things that we've had a worldwide chat going on\nA blogger and some of the other social outlet some part of it has been the influence of other environmental\nImpacts on our day to day living on on our health one of them was an interesting piece that we posted in and go to court and exchange going about green space in urban centers about the the role the\nThe effect of air pollution on children as an example of great story\nJust came out about air pollution levels and how it is potentially a diminishing\nShould levels and how it is potentially um diminishing the edge of the\nAbility of our children on up kind of a short cognitive cognitive\nMemory so academic scholastic things like that uh level so all of those things kind of come together to day because we know there's a lot of environmental elements and that's the purity of the soil and water\nAnd other natural resources ecosystem one ecosystem of which we are part of but certainly we potentially have a little more control around nutrition around that side\nOf the equation and Dr penny Chris ethane after ten is a distinguished professor of nutrition\nAnd the department of nutritional sciences at the Pennsylvania State University she has served on several national committee's including the dietary guidelines for Americans and national academy's dietary reference intake for energy\nA macro nutrients and cholesterol and as a member of the American Heart Association nutrition committee she's coauthor numerous scientific statements and advisories that have made diet\nAnd lifestyle recommendations again maybe things we don't always want to deal with that we're not always ... about put recommendations for the prevention and treatment as an example of CBD she's a presently vice chair of the ha ha ha counsel on lifestyle and\nA cardio metabolic health\nAnd she is published over three hundred and thirty papers in the peer reviewed literature and has won numerous awards ... sake thank you so much for being with us today and I know one of the things we're going to touch on certainly\nIs a story we posted about the U.S groan saw soybean oil achieved and FDA quality\nUs rooms saw soybean oil achieved an FDA qualified heart health claim and what that means in kind of the role of the food and Drug Administration and how that is authorized the use of a qualified health clean and what does it mean to us\nBut I Want to start with your research research focuses on quote the effects of diet stab launched an emerging risk factors for cardiovascular disease let me ask you this this is this for people of all age groups\n[noise] well I thank you so much for having me here today I'm very excited to be here [noise] um yes I Do research in the area of cardiovascular nutrition and when you look at different\nDiets Hawkeye ran off her specific foods [noise] and we try and says well on\nThe risk factor for heart disease as a major one for like class time levels and direct pressure and men have within Miller an emerging risk factors like markets transformation\nUm we also you know and look at related factors\nTo heart disease and we look at how guy affects body composition and overweight and obesity and then even um gr customer and scratches her diabetes too\nAnd what's interesting Dr right so even personally going through let's say an annual physical I noticed that\nThe results are much more detailed where before it was a little more generic owned the levels of cholesterol now will break down all these different types of cholesterol and I'm not a scientist I don't know enough about it but are they are it is a kind of like small\nParticles are pieces and\nWell I'm particles are pieces and like the insight into the body to me is is pretty remarkable in unbelievably detail\nWhat do you specifically look at that in more of an aging population or is that across the board\nWhile we look at me like you know adults of all ages we don't really do research in children from my colleagues here at Penn State do [laughter] but um you know our\nAge range that we study is about two and Twenty one and we have people all the way up to age Seventy five\nAnd does that research include a look at kind of aging and disease in general as it relates to food and nutrition or is it much more specific to cardiovascular health\nWell they didn't have that to them for a good point and I'm very good question that you're asking about um what we found is and it's not so much age that plays a role in the diet response but\nIt's related to just give us the overall health so in general are overweight and obese people now don't respond quite as well\nTo a healthy diet compared to normal weight individuals and then also the other thing is people who have increased markers of information seemed to have a diminished diet\nResponse but you know some of these things tend to correlate with getting older so in the United states people have age related increases in body weight and then along with that you know come a increases in these markers of inflammation\nSo in essence yeah there are a part of it as an age factor here\nFor the nation so in essence yeah they're a part of an age factor here but it does relate a lot more to just the way a person is at a given time in terms of their body weight and their information status\nThen I'm Glad you mentioned inflammation week we seem to hear a lot more about it in a little bit later we're going to get into some different dietary recommendations obviously as you know there's some misinformation or miss understood elements of what is being suggested to us\nBut I don't know maybe it's me but I I I feel as though inflammation in I don't know if you're talking about markers as it relates to cardiovascular or even joined in inflammation which is so common um but it just seems as though that\nThat ah the impact that role is\nTalked about a lot more seems to be taking on more status is that true is inflammation ... a ... a very relevant part of what you're looking at\n'em and it absolutely is that right well\nYeah I like to think of information sort of as\nA range and so there's sort of a low grade inflammation\nSo that oh if you might have to say you know it's going to be something temporary but that does cause inflammation in front of her response than there is\n[noise] around the world infectious diseases like malaria banging shock as disease and the illness has spread bypass are causing a major health\nRestrict the most vulnerable many of them

renewable now at\nThe same ability [noise]\nSo you're saying but those are the doctor\nIs it to speak English professor in the department of\nNatural nutritional science at Pennsylvania\nState University and she's helping us sort through a couple of reasons stories we ran one is one of the subjects but\nBut also we're having a broader conversation about food about what we're eating about why we're eating about our heart cardiovascular and one of the points made early on which was really interesting Dr that you've touched on\nWhich I've been thinking a lot about I I like to try to work out every day and at certain days I'll go to the gym\nAnd there's people there that are generally fit that hey I Want to lose ten pounds or you know I Want to get rid of this before Christmas and it does seem as though they do it fairly quickly and maybe you know they have a little easier time keeping it\nDo they do it fairly quickly and maybe you know they have a little easier time keeping it often somebody who is a little more sedentary\nNot as fit but specifically because this may be caught my attention a big thing in particular\nThere was there was a subject that we touched on which I Believe came out of your office or something that you had developed and that was us grooms soybean oil achieves this FDA qualified heart health claim the food and Drug Administration authorized the use of a qualified health claim\nConfirming soybeans oils ability to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and soybean oil is the most widely used edible oil in the United states the most oil sold as vegetable oil are intact soybean oil\nSo this announcement this achievement this this health clean\n'em how is it significant\nWell um it's a very significant because it validates ... we do now\nAnd that is that I'm probably being oil can in fact reduce the risk of corner heart disease and um now people have to really follow what the climate is saying and so and not overdo town that may just redo the exact claim\nThat tests supportive but not cross of scientific evidence suggests that eating about wanting to have tablespoons down I mean I'll which contains saturated fat\nMay reduce the risk of corner disease\nTo achieve this possible benefit soybean oil to replace saturated fat and not increase the total number of calories you eat and the day and that's the key you know don't just stop eating some you know and\nNot change anything else in your diet because well\nStart eating some you know and not change anything in your diet because that will definitely cause weight gain but what you want to do I want people want to do is to to be an oil for solid fats in their diet\n[noise] and so as you said it's very specific there's some disclaimer is this process than that the FDA goes through in order to issue that is it a long process\n[noise] well it can be um it is a very I think of rigorous process\nAnd so somebody has to submit an application or the kitchen and they have to review all of science\nAnd justify why I'm fat soybean oil is a healthy oil and\nMay reduce the risk of corner activities so that takes a while to put that petition together and then it does take a little while for the FDA to review it and he wrote gay or in a part of the crime\nAnd I'm guessing that that would be put forward by supporters of soybean oil maybe an association of of growers manufacturers distributors that type of thing\nThat to typically\nPut case because for yes\nOkay and I'm so in then in that situation the FDA as you said would go ... and then we have kind of this qualified but let me ask you this can you be more specific I'm just trying to think about\nIf I go ahead and follow this routine you made a very good point you know your substituting rivalries you're not adding calories which is so and sometimes forget yeah and I'm able to get to a level did you\nTo show that we sometimes forget yeah and I'm able to get to a level did you say two tablespoons and a half per\nDay yes wandering tablespoons of de\n... exactly would that help my cardiovascular performance\nExcellent that's the question it will lower your LDL cholesterol and to recall the earlier I said that they all cost shop is a major and in fact cause of risk factor for heart disease out of this oil is going to help lower that bad cholesterol\nAnd it's very interesting too because again thinking of my own situation and I've been really lucky where my journal cholesterol has been very low but one thing that can be really hard and I hope you don't mind touching on this or certainly in my keys has been difficult and I really do try to follow a pretty\nRigid rigorous\nFor room around nutrition and take some supplements insured any\nExercise but it's hard it it seems to raise your age deal\nYou're absolutely right it is that\nRight [noise] well um it's\nJust you know biologically it just doesn't move much now there are certain things you can do a eat a healthy diet that helps\nUm eat good fat and stay away from you know those refined carbs that I'll bump that can bump it up a little bit of a physical activity works but again we're not talking about increasing it a lot are talking about bumping it up you know\nA few several points and then the other thing as as well now I I just said this carefully and in moderation but alcohol has been shown to increase they feel that they say that I Hope everybody doesn't go out and just start\nBut beyond that it's a ... and people have been studying coffee now showing some house forever\nAnd one of the things that's funny I was talking with a nutritionist stone I was known in Nashville, Tennessee really smart guy and we're going to you and I going to touch on\nSome of the things that he believes in include including a which generally referred to as a as a paleo diet although I Know that's ... ... a little bit and ... into some other variations\nOf but he said well listen coffee is you just said in moderation maybe one or two a day said what makes it bad news to add sugar and cream theory in sugar to it\nMhm that's right\nDiet plan which as you know is very big on proteins so certainly very big on\nAs you know is very big on proteins to certainly very big on meat you talked about fruit before and one of the things that does is a radical the most of the fruits because of the sugar so if you're going to do any fruit\nYou would do it more as a desert and it would be as low sugar as possible might be certain berries as an example and it really\nPretty much a rabbit cage rains carbon so for that fit in with your understanding of nutrition and ... and what you have learned even recently to some of these changes with the FDA\nYeah we currently have food based\nRecommendation that have been made by the department of health and Human Services and U.S Department of agriculture and these are our\nDietary guidelines and they to guide all eating behavior and purchasing decisions are they are used by legislatures as well you know for food stamp programs and programs [noise] and so they are truly a holy grail\nAnd planning menus in schools right after\nThe or get into those doctor but also the into us but they must change vacillate alive right to\n[noise] well\nI guess it depends upon how you look at them you know some of our core recommendation have been the same for many years and that is eat fruits and vegetables and actually dairy products and whole grains are all recommended [noise] um\nBut you have a very just a little bit in terms of now with these ... struck Monday and we actually have a number of servings and serving sizes defined\nWe actually have a number of servings\nAnd serving sizes defined for a lot of different calorie level of for both men and women and the United states [noise] but [noise] you know I think the key message here is that where these guidelines they recommend\nNow is that a number of servings from all food groups and that's the problem that I have on the patio that even though there's an emphasis on veggies and a fish seafood poetry a lean meats\nKnow they they eliminate grain products and they eliminate dairy products and also they like him which are so good\nAnd they eliminate a lot of the fruit but so are they wrong to as an example try to the cutting neurotic heat a lot of the sugars as an example or potentially the dairy why why would they put most of the Dario\n[noise] well it's an issue that deals with the sugars so this is a real real low carb diet and it's you know basically higher protein low carb diet so yeah you would have to\nYou'd have to eliminate or take out any foods that contribute in some carbohydrate like dairy like him even peanuts they're like yeah they do contain some car and of course ... even if their\nWhole grain high fiber cereals can have you done this time\nIt would take a mostly arises right yeah and the multi grain breads and things like that and but the I guess the question is miss would you would you agree\nBut the I guess the\nQuestion is miss would you would you agree or disagree it's always if you could follow this because in essence it's almost a state of doses right the German huh that you're getting two for your body and\nI guess that's not done to excess but but it's done properly that might be one of the best bet\nBurning conditions you can be in particularly as you get rid of all the sugars does does that make sense to you the danger of that\nOn the short term basis yes there's a lot of evidence that that's what's happening but then what I worry about is if people follow this way long term one or the health consequences and that hasn't been tested\nI often worry about people home yo yo back and forth on this diet plan and ... over you know they can do this over a period of ten years or more going on the patio and then off of it and back and forth and back and forth and\nThen I Wonder what the health consequences are of that\nAnd when I first heard about it it reminded me a bit and I didn't I never did I did research it a lot but I remember Dr Atkins being very popular yeah while and he was promoting a lot of the same tone foundational principles I think\nYou are right Amos promoting you know a very high protein low carb diet and his diet when it's real high in fat and high and saturated fat\nAnd that would you kind of\nCaution against as you think about heart disease cardiovascular health\nAbsolutely we know that saturated fat increases Elvie out of class draw and that's again a cause of factor for after ...\nIncrease for out of class straw and Africa cause a factor for after ...\nAnd so ... perhaps than a diet like this is an example could be very good as you said in the short term let's say you're building a lot of muscle and there does seem to be a heavy emphasis on putting more proteins into our bodies at this point would you agree with that\nI'm kind of recommendation that we might want to put more protein in our bodies\nWell at the expense of that car first round out about that whatsoever and then ...\nAge after I should probably be in front of our ... maybe the elderly and especially ... when they don't get getting that might not getting the amount of practice and they pay dreamy pow population she never ran\nOut of pocket women and might be good to have a higher ... and\nAnd and again on a temporary basis maybe you're it's fat reduction or muscle building maybe you're getting into routine to run a marathon or something that would peak kind of peak demand that might be a good a good week one of the things Dr we worry about here\nAre really environmental conditions and again we just posted it on the air quality and the impact on kids cognitive certainly memory short term memory ability\nIs is potentially impacted\nBut we've reported in talks a lot to soil specialists and restoration specialist about soil and it being stripped of its nutrients when you think about our food supply and what the dietary recommendations are do you worry at all that we're not going to get it because the quality of the food is not as good\n[noise] there are a lot of things\nOnly the food is not as good\n[noise] well there are a lot of things that contribute to the nutrient density of vitamins\nAnd minerals and food and yes growing conditions can play a role like you're saying but then also um you know just storage conditions may amount of time that the food takes to\nGet from the farm to the retail market those are all contributing factors and then beyond that how a person cooks the food\nAnd so somebody could just really over cook certain fruits and vegetables and destroy or get rid of a lot of vitamins and minerals just by how they cook the food\nSo many many factors contributes to the new trend quality of the foods we eat\nAnd processing potentially yeah absolutely yeah what about contaminants what about the things that might be in our water supply or grounds and\nIs that\nBecoming more of a risk factor do you look at that in terms of overall look them in donations for good hope the cardiovascular systems [noise] well\nIs an issue that we have to be mindful of uh especially as it relates to fish and seafood because you know there are some waters that um [noise] you know have contaminants and\nPeople should check with their you know local state public health departments just to see if it's okay to eat fish from certain of local you know a waterways\nUm but then you know we all have heard about some real problems like Flint, Michigan\nThat was just terrible what happened there\nSome real problems like Flint, Michigan that was just terrible what happened there so there are going to be those situations um but I think I Know\nPeople really should have that they you know something that they check out but I don't think that they said just a worry so much about it\nWouldn't have them do more dark there too I don't know local organic would that be a trend where you would be able to maybe even control and understand where it comes from and the quality of that produce\nOut of luck\nWas going\nBe [noise]\n\n\n\nYou're listening to W.

live our state Senate a state senator Kennedy ... tour on TALK about his candidacy what he what his platform is\nAnd I kind of his back on and whatnot but to begin a we have but why don't you guys introduce yourselves in a kind of give it a little background and buy all you guys do\nA rub get us I'm ah the admissions counselor at the Albert campus for Bristol community college I've been there for about six years for that um I was working\nAh I worked at a bunch of different colleges and universities are for ten years before that are all sorts of different jobs in college administration residents white student activities I managed to campus pub at one point [laughter]\nCollege administration residents life student activities I managed to campus police at one point so just about anything you could imagine um I I did it um my job at Bristol includes helping students with the enrollment process the application are going to college fairs answering questions I'm\nI was talking to a a an admissions counselor from another school yesterday\nOr about how fortunate I Am one of the benefits of my job as I get to go out into the community a lot more than other rocks from other schools um to do more educational stuff like that so yeah absolutely an added bonus Rob is actually my admissions counselor\nShows how long ago [laughter] a a micro\nGavin I'm financially ... ah I've been there for about two years before that um I was in uh the trio programs which are community based programs that help with a\nAdmissions financial aid the college process for first generation students um my role at the colleges I decide for canceling students on the financial aid process um I also do financial literacy or programs\nFor a all campuses as well as default prevention um programs\nAwesome you mentioned first generation Rob you're actually doing an event to write were first generation families yes thank you [laughter] uh yeah tomorrow night or on a October Eighteenth at six thirty PM at ... high school um\nWe're doing an event or to educate it's targeted it's a first generation primer so it's it specific to it's it's pretty much taking college and breaking it down to the\nSimplest terms for folks that are for students whose family has never sent anyone college before\nUh for students whose family has never sent anyone college before I'm In an attempt to demystify the whole process\nUm it's part of a larger college planning series that we've been doing this year um that we are continuing through the spring semester or in collaboration with Bridgewater State University um Alvaro bishops being north outer borough and north in high schools um\nUh doing different sessions to get folks more involved in the different aspects of the process um so uh it's un bury auditorium tomorrow night if anyone wants to stop by and get more information\nThere will come to do that awesome cool and that's the goal of this segment I guess was the same kind of stuff you're talking about now just to give advice to families first generation families or even families in general that\nAre so so there there are tons of opportunities to learn about all the different schools um once you've expose yourself to those schools and know what you're looking for\nA then you can that that will get you down to what school you you all Timothy ... yeah yeah I I Know for me to it might be just be the nerdy me but I used to always look up the faculty there and kind of like what their background was are there resources have done because\nThe faculty there and it's kind of like what their background was or their research that they've done because if there is research in the same stuff I'm interested in my I'm going to like this and that same thing when I I was a tour guide for a little bit during my undergrad\nSo I always like you know our teachers of their lawyers or this or that they've done this and I feel like that kinda helps students gauging or interest in it too\nThat's who I'm Mike how did you ultimately decide what school you wanted to go to\nUm I I Am that they had a special program that I that I was interested in a that was something it was I'm a little bit more of a financial burden that I Wish now that I'm\nPaying [laughter] scare everyone away with it [laughter] I I don't mean to do that but you know on\nUm you know how do you pick a school it's also good to ah when you're looking at schools to talk with your family and and analyze your available funds and resources and how\nUm you plan on on and funding your education uh because a\nFar too often I I've I've had people who had this perfect idea this perfect school\nUm and the funds were there and and they had to come to the realization that it it\nJust was just wasn't doable again not trying to scare people away just\nA want you to ah to be aware but are ultimately as they had a special program um that are\nNo other schools had gotcha so that's that's why we're\nCool Rob is they're up there are specific websites to write what people can search my major in our down isn't there some once or twice\nYeah they're um I mean the the\nApplication website so the common application is is one way to apply to colleges are about I think five hundred schools across the country subscribe to the common application where you go you fill out\nI think five hundred schools across the country subscribe to the common application where you go you fill out one application and that goes to whatever school to pick on on the coming up I'm so that has application of its ... information about its members schools\nI'm a\nCollege Board um has information about different colleges and universities um there are some other search engines that are specific to colleges and universities um it also doesn't or to look up specific schools or specific programs\nThat being said or\nGoogle gets advertising money [laughter] from him colleges and universities so I'm a good so it's an added a perspective that I have is my oldest daughter is going through this process now I'm also a parent um [noise] and uh a couple\nOf years ago she was considering going into forensic science and so she looked up forensic science programs yeah and you know University of Tampa Syracuse University and a couple of others and and\nSo okay that's that's one way to start the search yeah um do you really think you want to be in Tampa yeah you really think you want to and then driving up to the\nMid west one summer we stopped for lunch in Syracuse and I spoke to us the car ride so far so long I said\nWell we're about forty five minutes away from Syracuse University [laughter] and she said oh yeah this is the limit of how far I Want to go [laughter] so now we've got a radius so ... ... um uh so\nSo there's ... there's a few different ways to go about it yeah\nCool and uh let's say someone finally decides they want to attend a in one thing the school's always mentioned to the SATs\nDoes everyone have to take this or is it you know some schools and you don't have to uh how should someone determine whether or not if they want to take their SATs or they should or shouldn't they should look at what the school requires every every college\nShould they should look at what the school requires every every college and university has different requirements related to the application process in terms of minimum high school GPA\nOr whether or not they require SAT or a C. T. or both or whether they're touched optional which means you can a wave the test requirement from your application ... typically in that case they the colleges are universities wanted to see a higher GPA I'm\nA so there's there's a number of different\nOr was there\nA number of different criteria that colleges will look at 'em some will require an interview some will or will be explicit in terms of scoring or a resume of activities or extra curricular co curricular activities [noise] um\nSo it the important and then there are schools like like Bristol we don't require college I say we don't require SATs or ACTs um if you uh did well on the reading and writing portion of your SAT than we can wave part of our placement tests for you\nSo there is still benefit to taking them but they're not required or so the important thing is once you've decided a on a school or your narrative down to a few schools making sure you fully understand what their requirements\nAre and that you're meeting the the deadlines for the application\nGotcha deadlines are important especially when it when you're transferring or anything like that absolutely her um\nWell so let's say you're in school maybe don't have the highest GPA or you have options for ya you doomed like what can somewhat a low GPA do a thing that they they still want to go to college though are you you're definitely not doomed um for for schools that have a minimum GPA requirements\nOr or some combination of GPA\nPA requirements or or some combination of GPA an SAT score requirements a student that as a low GPA\nBut uh did exceptionally well on SATs may still be considered by a by a college or university that has a minimum GPA requirement\nI'm a British still doesn't look at GPA or or at all for any of our programs um for some of our selective health programs we we may look at specific grades in math or chemistry\nOr for in terms of our health science programs like nursing or dental hygiene but beyond that um we're we're not looking at your GPA were ... as long as you're sending us a transcript that verified you've completed your high school requirements we can we can admit you into the into\nOr just about any of our programs awesome awesome\nAlready folks were in the studio with a representative from birds to community college talking about the admissions process how to apply how do you know you're ready to apply a different tips in advice for a first generation families or just any family in general I'm In that college process\nAnd I'm also going to discuss financial aid options for families or how to apply a different scholarships grants and loans what the differences and what not to look out for your feeling so stick around we'll we'll learn a little bit more after these messages\nHi my name is Chris Wyoming and I'm the manager of the elder dental program where in lighting any seniors residing in Massachusetts who are sixteen older\nSo they can ... dental screening clinic and titan on Saturday October Tanya from a forty five AM to one plan protected pencil receive afraid that they'll screening and have an opportunity to speak that identity and the clinics relaxed and finally setting I tend to be screened for oral cancer and\nHave a chance to receive free that checking\nFor more information\nCats aren't and have a chance to receive free that checking\nFor more information called seven seven four zero three one three kick the free dental screening connect and organized by the ... that's a program a project at the community will all\nRich is just a really really good guy\nThe term good egg isn't enough to describe but he's also certified organic and free range rich puts the cat back done everything the toothpaste the olive oil the sham poo everything\nHe lets his ten year old nephew beat him in virtual tennis even though he can straight up sleigh ten year old nephew [noise] when the toilet paper is running low rich replaces the rules on the actual holder not just on the back of the toilet reaches\nTexting and driving rich you know what do you do in rich [noise]\nI was just telling everyone how great you are texting and driving\nMakes good people look bad\nVisit stopped tech stop ... dot org a public service announcement brought you by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the ad council\nMental health or just like physical health is an important part of every person's overall wellbeing learn about the many issues surrounding mental health by listening to our new show exploring mental illness everything you wanted to know but we're too afraid to ask\nOn Mondays at six PM on W.

aid\nSo some of the community college guy friend admissions process and we're going to say went to the financially\nUm portion of the interview or a raw before we wrap up if you can give a tip to a a high school junior or senior thinking about college or maybe first generation that families are have been to college what would you tell that person if you could give them one\nPiece of advice I'm like I said before it was also\nIn my opinion I think it's going to the financial aid counselor is extremely helpful through that entire process I'm angry\n[laughter] and you're insuring\nYourself that's getting done the right way to you know you don't have to worry about it um but there are different types of\nA financial opportunities right so we have scholarships grants and loans or did you explain a little bit what each is in how they differentiate from one another and kind of uh what are some things that family could say All right we're going to choose this loan or will pick the scholarship or whatnot\nWhat are some things that family could Sarah we're going to choose this loan or will pick the scholarship or whatnot okay\nSo I grants grants and scholarships are free money those money that you never have to pay back it just given to go to school grants come primarily from either the federal state government or or is this school themselves\nUm you never have to pay back scholarships can come from a either the school or I knew or is outside institutions there are millions of scholarships for almost anything you can think of\nUm [noise] I was cautious often they're separate application to the FAFSA\nUm or CSS Profile for private and a private institutions um and usually they require some sort of essay or or I work but they can be tailored to a hobby you have a field of study that you're going into anything like that\nUh and then there's some great resources out there to search for those um [noise] I Would recommend if you're interested in scholarships are starting a ... a year before like with the FAFSA\nUm 'cause far too often students have come to me in the summer\nI'm looking for scholarships for the following school year and uh they're they're just they're all gone um if I can plug one source I Would say fast Web dot com or is it good resource for our looking up scholarships you create a profile\n'em and they'll show you um some scholarships that they think we'd be tailored towards you are as well as um email you wind scholarships come up that would fit the or your your profile\n... and so the fast food strictly\nYour profile I'm ... and so the fast food strictly junior loans correct no the FAFSA is for loans grants and scholarships sorry I forgot the loan\nPeace [laughter] how long did you have to pay back um there are multiple\nKinds of loans are the two primary loans they eye you will see are the direct Stafford loans um and those are there are annual limits to those based on your a dependency status and uh and um\n[noise] uh enrollment level and are those are kind of broken up into two categories I'm not sure how indebted to you want me to get on this\nOr do you think the more the better I think for sure I direct loans directly ... broken up into a subsidized non subsidized\nWhat that means is that for these subsidized loans the government pays the interest for you while you're in school or which is a great benefit and ends up saving you are lots of money\nI'm On subsidized loans or interest is occurring all you're in school and is then capitalized um whenever you graduate or drop below halftime enrollment ah\nAh students can make interest payments while they're old if they want to keep that down or if not um you know that's that's fine too they're not required to do so [noise] um for a more expensive institutions are also plus loans PLUS Loan\nOr is at the undergraduate level is alone than a parent would take out\nUm to help the student pay 'em you know pay for the cost of attendance or in a a graduate school the students themselves can take out a plus loan and then there's private loans or I Would always recommend federal loans over private loans um they\nUh I Would always recommend federal loans over private loans um they uh have tend to have lower interest rates they ah with the direct loans they're not credit based so even if you have credit problems\nThat doesn't matter you can still get those loans and I'm\nA they have excellent um benefits that help you pay off if you get into trouble there are different programs that you can get into to help you pay off your loans in different ways\nAbsolutely already folks were in in the studio with a mission to counter and financial aid counselor from birth to community college talking about missions process financially tips in

families are just now any family in general thinking about it but Mike we were talking about the fast or a\n... where is that he can somebody even go what's the website at someone can go to it or to start their faster process so\nAh does does um the the primary website and the only website ... should use to do the FAFSA is a facet dot Gov is government's site and his government aid ah I'd just like to emphasize that because there are many sites out there that are pose as the facet and charge people money\nUm I had students a number of times come in\nPeople money um I had students a number of times come in and think that they had it done or when they didn't and they had already paid eighty bucks to this website that they thought was true uh uh one thing to just to remember is that the first African the fastest stands for free\nSo [laughter] ... dot Gov is the site\nTo go to that and uh so they apply for they did they do their fast when they get the the winter and with their loans to have a few different options for their loans and whatnot um do they do they have to accept these loans can they say I don't want this or is it automatically hey you apply this is yours now\nStudent doesn't have to accept any part of their aid package that they don't want 'em so if you are offered loans and you don't want to take them or something that happens a lot with um\nA private ends to four year institutions is are they will roll parent plus loans into the award letter I'm which\nI'm not a fan of just because a parent plus loans are based on credit so not everybody's parents can get them and it's also not you know it's it's not a a it's not aid for the students it's a it's a parent's decision or whether or not they want to do that and some parents are very willing somehow on I have nothing to do with it\nSo you don't have to accept any money that you don't want to accept\nAbsolutely and uh when they accept whatever they want and what not and that they're left with sometimes there is the sometimes alone would uncover everything and sometimes it does but uh what what are some of the payment options are families have available to them when they're in this process I'd different schools have different\nOptions at BCC um uh we start our payment plan in the summer\nI'm a we start our payment plan in the summer and uh if you enrolled before I generally it's the beginning of August or you don't have to put any money down and then it's broke out into for payments that will will be withdrawn", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Attleboro", "day":

in Studio ... will be here until nine o'clock support of your show a in Studio right now we have Jacob Ventura who is a candidate for state Senate in uh in Massachusetts He's running against a a ... a Jacob how's it going [noise]\nI'm doing well how are you good good good to be here 'cause it have you um have you been in here before have you done any interviews or this is an exclusive this is giving you the exclusive sounds good sounds good\nAll right so ah actually this can be a nice way to for the community to get to know you are kind of what you stand for what you want to have done a so for starters just tell us about who you are kind of your background and kind of experience what you've done\nA we grow up and everything it was like the whole lowdown yeah\nYeah no so I was a born and raised in the Dartmouth New Bedford area of southern Bristol county um I'd been familiar with Adel borough\nFor the area of southern Bristol county um I'd been familiar with adult burrow a as a child coming to last a lead for the ... the Christmas lights yeah yeah\nI think that was my first experience with adult borough but ah had the opportunity to move here um recently and uh um you know a decided to run for the seat or the prior to that uh\nIt was the first generation college grad in my family went to U. mass Dartmouth attending a public schools\nOr had a degree in finance worked in banking for it to a a little while and at that point I decided to uh uh parlayed that into the state house public service or had the opportunity to work with the Steven how is the representative or just south of here and see caulk and we're hoping Norton\nAnd uh through that experience\nAh really learned first hand how are the legislature works and more importantly how um\nThe uh the the\nGreat impact you can have on the local community and that's really what it's about um after that experience I had an opportunity after hard work to go to law school down in Virginia at Washington and Lee and a\nCame back here and was set to practice law and then a Senator Jim till multi all of a sudden resigned and it was a vacuum I'm In my party a I was asked to run and it was not the first\nThing on my mind and after a little bit of convincing we finally gave it a shot so it's been now we're going on Eighteen months of a constant campaigning for this legislative seat it feels like a presidential race [laughter] so and how has it been campaigning what's the feedback you kind of feeling from our community what are their\nConcerns ... you know what's the feedback you can get short so uh and when you mentioned community I just have to mention that this district is so large um this district\nI just have to mention that this district is so large um this district road wise it's about forty miles north to south from the southern tip of robots and seekonk all the way up to midfield in sharing and well poll a Adel borough happens to be conveniently located in the center of the district\nUm so really there are nine communities in this district a each community has very very bashed a\nA needs um different challenges\nI'm but generally people have been extremely receptive or this has been a a a great opportunity and I've been going door to door\nUm since you know last summer a summer of twenty Seventy and so uh I've had an opportunity to meet thousands of people\nYeah losing his owners is that a common concern that these families are having a out there was kind of what are they worried about these days yeah so you ... you know when you meet that many people you start seeing themes that arise 'em\nAgain you know a lot of it is town by town or just over the border of course uh your your listeners know above the water situation ... ... yeah I just came from knocking over there so that's why it's fresh in my mind\nUh but uh in Norton and we have severe water problems I Would say district wide um you know one of the the constant uh issues of senior citizens are feeling the squeeze property they need property tax relief a property values continue to increase\nAnd ah and many of them are on fixed incomes are so that's one of the issues that I think we're going to try and deal with uh in the next legislative session in January if I'm elected absolutely but schools you know schools are\nA an issue district wide statewide big priority for us\nUm local roads and train so our means of transportation that's obviously a huge issue here in the commonwealth a and a a we're going to need to fix it and bring it up to par for the twenty first century or if we want to come\nUh we're going to need to fix it and bring it up to par for the twenty first century or if we want to continue to have a thriving economy here so you know I Would say schools roads um\nTax relief for our seniors of course we support our veterans are public safety is a huge concern as well so these are some of the the broader themes I'd say of the campaign and the concerns of people\nYeah absolutely ... that's what I can kind of want to I think this is a good platform to kind of explains for listeners um what are the some of the current issues that are state faces as a whole and kind of a you know what would you want to change what would you want to bring to ah to our state\nYeah so you know my again my background is in finance um and\nI are also had the opportunity to serve on a local Finance Committee or in the town of darkness or I was probably one of the youngest folks and in town meeting so I have that ... base are similar to the governor and lieutenant governor and I think having that municipal finance background\nUm my campaign managers a Democrat um some of my top advisors are Democrats and independents um and uh I I think that's important bringing people together\nOh absolutely absolutely and it's good to see to see that your campaign is is it\nOh absolutely absolutely and it's good to see\nTo see that your campaign is is is involved in that but you guys recently had a debate to um the other day I was at seekonk right handed to you right TV to be a sort of like they give our listeners a chance to understand the differences\nBetween you and your opponent and one of the biggest ones are is immigration sure what's ... what's ... stance on immigration kind of how do you feel about it in general as as our state\nYeah so um again immigration is a a obviously a hot topic right now nationally and again my approach to immigration is to avoid the national noise on both sides and focus here locally and focus on things that we can control\nUm the biggest difference between me and my opponent um is probably an immigration a last year on may twenty third ah actually this year on may twenty third a few months ago or the Senate or during the budget debates slipped through\nAn amendment to the Senate budget um amendment\nOne one for seven which was essentially a sanctuary cities a sanctuary state amendment or they refer to it a safe communities are but regardless of the the title\nIt's semantics at the end of the day or this amendment or what are\nCalled for the prohibition of our local police are local sheriffs and our state police from a inquiring about an individual citizen citizenship status or when this individual was already apprehended so we're not talking about ratings people and\nYou know lifting people from the shadows and you know this is not about that this is about a public safety amendment and as far as I'm concerned I'm ... percent it did in my opponent voted for this was to prohibit our local law enforcement from inquiring\nThe Senate did in my opponent voted for this was to prohibit our local law enforcement from inquiring about a citizenship status I disagree with it um and uh I think most people in this district tend to agree with me that we should have a we should give our local law enforcement all the tools they need to keep our community safe\nUm this particular amendment which was a again ... amendment one one for seven to Senate bill for this was a senator Jamie Eldridge is amendment I'm\nDoug sanctuary cities are safe communities and um it went so far as do if a local police officer for example in Edinburgh officer at apprehended someone on a drug trafficking charge\nAnd inquired about citizenship status to cooperate with our state or federal authorities are that individual police officer would actually be a reprimanded and so I think that bill went too far away as extreme and um\nIt was so extreme that they were even six Democrats who joined the seven or Republicans in the Senate to vote against it now it automatically made it through the Senate or but then fails before it got to the house which is also Democrat control so that's how extreme it was and I think that's probably the biggest difference\nI'm One of a few issues between me and my opponent\nSure sure well let's get a let's get into the um\nThe all the issues of because I think it's a good way for them because the election is November six so it's right around the corner coming up and ... what are some of the other ones that you you feel\nAre you are pretty a different day as opposed to your views are against your opponent or some of the others are issues that you think are something that he he stands for a year just like nope not me yeah so he supports\nA single payer Bernie Sanders style healthcare system I don't um I Do support legislation that we've done in a bipartisan manner here in Massachusetts where we can continue to offer the world's best\nDone in a bipartisan manner here in Massachusetts where we can continue to offer the world's best healthcare and ... a continued to try and make advances in curbing the cost to make it more affordable I'm all for that of course a for seniors and veterans and working families and small businesses um I don't believe\nSingle payer is the way to go um it's a it's essentially a socialist plan or he supported it would cost the commonwealth on conservative estimates are thirty billion dollars and uh\nThere's no way to pay for it there's just no way a so that's a\nDifference between ... and I I'm an you know general economic a philosophy\nI was endorsed by the national federation of Independent Business a they represent thousands of small businesses across the commonwealth an over one million small business employees I'm I'm very pro small business and pro entrepreneurial ship 'em I think my background and finance lens\nThat perspective we're look you know you have a lot of small business owners are and start ups here in the commonwealth who are trying to just make it by you know they pay their taxes\nOr energy rates are through the roof healthcare is through the roof and the last thing we need is more a burdensome regulation or and or additional taxes um my opponent ah as for higher taxes more government spending um and\nUh the associated industries of Massachusetts uh they referred to as aim a gave him actually the lowest ranking of two hundred members of the legislature he's only been in there for eight months and he already has the lowest ranking for a business friendliness and the commonwealth so I\nThink immigration we differ\nCompletely and a a business or a relations I think we differ\nYeah absolutely it it's an issue because [noise] just the other day we were talking about an Arab rose kind of one of these places where that's so relevant you look at all the jewelry factors that\nTalking about an Arab rose kind of one of these places where that's so relevant you look at all the jewelry factors that we had at one point in this small businesses that were thriving and now it's just\nWhether jobs are going overseas or it's becoming a so strict on these businesses to to come here and what not so it's a I think that's a you know small business that's really in my opinion what kind of went makes a community so it's important to prioritize\nThem right and I think I think Adam ... right now um we are prime for great gross a we're located be a conveniently between Boston and Providence right here on I'd had five and the ah\nThe commuter rail or obviously as a state we have some transportation issues we need to address with both of those means of transportation but uh we've got a great downtown here I think it could be more bustling a more transit oriented um community here down near the\nUh the train station and also continue to keep the characteristics of the city that has made the city a great city over the last several decades and a beyond so\nYeah so we're a gateway city so there's also different opportunities for finance um funding to to really get in it because it's like you said we're in the middle of Boston in Providence and you also arrows a walkable place too you know what I mean from downtown even here we can ah you access tons of restaurants and different businesses\nBut already folks here in Studio Jacob ... who is a candidate for state Senate offer this coming election November six or we're gonna come back talk more about his platform I'm\nActually in some of the things he wants to see done and I'm just just as general background and whatnot so

sunset at six o'clock or eleven hours\nLebanon hours and so we get to enjoy eleven hours of the sun but as you were saying a very ineffective as we go through this month of October the sun low in the sky and that's why we're only going to reach the mid forties will have North West winds Fifteen to thirty five miles an hour now again the winner will tend to diminish as the afternoon wears on as the high pressure builds in but as that\nAgain the windows tend to diminish has the afternoon wears on as the high pressure builds in but at that go visit overhead it's going to be clear in cold tonight [noise] schools they will have that ever increasing bull and a temperature falling down into the upper twenties and low thirties\nA ... one of those nights and mornings where it'd be a wide variety of temperature up you're in a more rural location or you could be as low as twenty six twenty seven and a few down near the coast or\nA up on a high heel you could be thirty two but it's going to be cold everywhere with frost I highly recommend if you have tend to plan so vegetables are you trying to keep growing or you might want to take them into a cover them up at the very least\nA however we will have a nice recovery tomorrow sunshine high in the upper fifties\nAnd then suddenly clouds on Saturday just a quick shower a kind of like the other day when we had that the one or two showers through the day but much of the day was sending clouds\nAnd hiding a sixty on Saturday not bad however colder air booze and Saturday Night setting the stage for a chilly day on Sunday a little like today\nA high in the mid to upper forties and then Monday after starting out uh once again colds and the upper twenties lower thirties we should reach the forties Monday afternoon next week we're going to be monitoring again I what's going on well two hours south a with a stall front and that could generate some stormy weather here late next week but right now I think Tuesday looks good\nA son in clouds high in the fifties and\nUh the cooler weather will be back down for Wednesday again long range still looks like something going on late next week in terms of stormy weather whether it comes to ... go to our west or comes up along the coast\nProbably not purely tropical but some indications that about a week from now we could get into some stormy weather at least have the\nThreat of that going on now with the last afternoon late afternoon cold front of passage we did have a a tree down on a car at St Mary's church in North adult borrow a and again uh hopefully the person was okay also Elizabeth wrote and Fox\nUh and again the hopefully the person was okay also Elizabeth wrote and Fox poetry came down ... dog battle by our road if you know what that is in Cumberland a tree fell on a moving car hopefully they were okay a federal Newton parkway of taught in the tree came down and also a a ... down in ...\nI'm On caster hill road so again or some scattered areas of trees coming down a branches coming down with that cold final passage\nOr late yesterday afternoon drop the temperature about ten degrees at about fifty minutes and the whistle blowing leaves around things like that so again not the best of situations are late yesterday afternoon but at least that didn't last long\nI end this cold is actually not go in the last one either as we've kind of go up and down a with the uh warm and the cold and it's kinda typical as you go through October but the good news well today we're going to have the ... at least the sun shining all day a dorm Nineteen Seventy two\nWhat happened on this date ...\nNineteen Seventy two what happened on this date um God what had happened was today the Eighteenth of October uh I Would say something\nUnusual that's why I brought it up so there's the hint\nYeah okay um let's see Nineteen Seventy two what would be a weather related incidents that would happen on this day I'm ... ... ... Nineteen Seventy two well I Would probably would management is\nThey can't ... here's the hand here's another one for you and I talk if you think about it I've said this before and others uh the Seventy two Seventy three a seat and didn't have a lot of snow did not have much snow at all Nineteen Seventy two Seventy three\n... um so we ... well it was going to say we probably had the first uh flakes of snow in our area\nThat's right you are correct right a matter of fact we had more than a few flakes we got a couple two inches of snow in adults\nCorrect right a matter of fact we had more than a few flakes we got a couple two inches of snow in adult borrow\nOn this date in Nineteen Seventy two and everyone was all the snow lovers as I've said before\nA falsely were up up in a cheering and say this is going to be a great winter of snow I've got to make a lot of buddy plowing I'm going to be able to make a lot of snow man and know Seventy two in Seventy three we had about twelve inches of snow the entire season\nA and there's another case where in early snowfall often leads to not much to the season so uh once again if we were to get snow and the next couple of weeks or even flurries\nOr that bodes well for most people that don't like snow in the winter obviously we have never had a winter that has not spilled but in terms of getting a even a normal about which is about forty three inches a on average or in the ... area or that went to we had about twelve inches of snow the entire winter but two of it fell on\nOctober Eighteenth Nineteen Seventy two how 'bout that matter of fact in the elite terrain\nNorth situate Rhode Island four and a half inches of snow\nI could see I could see a ... round the getting getting that yeah I can see that definitely\nThe hilly terrain but any rate just to bring that up that uh\nSnowed on this date or but we will not ... it's cold enough to actually if there was precipitation Linda this dog uh it is it is snowing this morning in parts of New Hampshire and Vermont they had so showers in Lewiston, Maine\nUh let's see Springfield, Vermont and also Las ... New Hampshire so all three northern New England states that we're talking God not just the mountains but there are flurries now or that's why would they have a few scattered clouds throughout the day but that's about it the sun will shine\nA it is snowing now if you'd only went up in Lewiston, Maine Springfield, Vermont and ... New Hampshire up by lake went up a psyche they're getting flurries not melt it's melting as it hits the ground obviously but a snow showers in Maine New Hampshire and Vermont this morning and a few locations\nObviously but ah still showers in Maine New Hampshire and Vermont this morning and a few locations so again a cold air mess with the good news is going to be moving out of here and by tomorrow afternoon we'll be back up around that probably about fifty eight degrees in the afternoon\nI'm looking at the observation deck up mount Washington right now there is some snow flurries out there in fact a very cloudy but I can see it right now looking right at it\nI can see some white snow on the ground are up ... up on the deck there ah on the side entrances or to the deck up there as well\nAgainst the railings there the\nThe ... exactly yeah\nAnd it gets a little brighter there hopefully they'll stay out of the clouds would be able to see more than just about just about done with allowing people to just go up there on your own going off the auto and I think it I Want to say it might end\nIt might have just ended a think October Fifteen but uh\nYeah so that's an indication that dawn that a you know it's cold enough for snow obviously we have clear skies now here but ah if there were precipitation it would be the atmosphere is cold enough snow but\nAre not as much a threat of that as we had back in Nineteen Seventy two and again that's a classic example the as I've said to you and you remember that the earliest snow on record was October ninth and\nListening to W.

state representative Jim Hawkins who said opioid addiction is his top issue now reach speaker said that situation has become very critical\nWith nearly three uh three hundred people dying of overdoses last year in Brazil county alone\nIn fact the c._e._o. of the hospital rates alleging says right now we are in a crisis in our community our state and our nation she added that insurance companies need to better fund treatment programs so addicts can basically\nGet better care as well in fact she also says in fact in fact longer a stays in\nOh in fact she also says in fact in fact longer\nA

created a unit called pop the problem oriented apologizing and one of his duties is to visit families of overdose victims and tried to get them involved\nIn the victims recovery as well in fact the brother of state representative Jim Hawkins Dan Hawkins and founder of the clarion healthcare said medical research does offer some hope for the future but\nThere were no solutions coming in the new in the near term right now they do suggest schools have nurses and that led to train as monitor the painkillers taken by some of the injured students at least and explain to them the benefits of ice and also alleviating the ... body part as well in fact from the Brockton hospital then use\nA set emergency rooms said health care providers did help start the opioid problem by over prescribing some

raise the level of roads more gradually then speed bumps which are often found in some parking lots\nThose sounds are considered an effective way to force drivers to reduce the speed of their cars were speeding as a chronic problem man of course used by a number of communities throughout the state mayor also said he is also proposing new audience because speeding on some of the city streets is one of the biggest complaints that he's received by his officers well\nIn fact other ordinance sponsored by the mayor would impose parking restrictions on legal club road\nSome of those plaques up plastic shopping bags and also imposed penalties on drivers who actually smoke in their cars while they have a child in their cars as well all are in the committee but none have gone to the floor for a vote mass and those speed bumps are about as tall as those others speed bumps that are all backed out a wider\nLessening their impact as well [noise]\nWell the talking base has row is now planning

sixteen did involve teen drivers out teen drivers would everyone on the road at risk of a deadly crash especially if\nThey're bringing team passengers along for the ride well this is this has been ... you know talked about for many many years\nNew research from AAA did find that when a team driver has only team passengers in their vehicle\nFatality rate for all people involved is ... increased by fifty one percent now in contrast when older passengers thirty five or older ride with the teen overall fatality rate decrease nearly eight percent\nNow considering the increased risk created by a combination of teen drivers and team passengers\nAAA is inviting the teen and the need for teen drivers to gain adequate supervise training and specially in different driving scenarios before taking what could be possibly a fatal Dr\nWell back two years ago teen drivers were involved in more than one million police report it crashes resulting in more than thirty two hundred deaths\nNow researches pinpointed but when teens were carrying the teen passengers\nFatality rates jumped fifty six percent\nCarrying the teen passengers fatality rates jumped fifty six percent for occupants of other vehicles\nForty five percent for the team driver and Seventeen percent for pedestrians and people on bikes now here in Massachusetts back in twenty six team they were thirty three fatalities in crashes involving teen drivers\nTen were drivers eleven were passengers and six ... occupants of other vehicles and six were either pedestrians cyclists now this analysis shows that in crashes where teen drivers are behind the wheel with the teen\nPassenger the larger portion of those killed our other road users now this study also found a fatality rate of a teen drivers related ... related crashed increased when factors like speeding or driving at night\nWere first introduced well as I said supervised driving with parents in the passenger seat as the coach is right now the first step in teaching teens how to become responsible safe drivers what they are asked also offering you can go to teen driving dot triple A. dot com\nTo find out more about this saying required teens to live at least a hundred dollars a supervised practice driving with a parent before driving going out solo\nBegin by practicing driving in low risk situations and gravel gradually move to situations that are more complex nighttime highway driving and rain and on and around challenging roadways like curves\nAnd allow no more than one non family person under the age of twenty to ride with that teen\nDuring the maybe the first six months of driving also use slightly different routes each practice session and finally practice adjusting speed based on three factors visibility on road traffic and different road conditions\nSo as I said you can get more about this by going on\nRoad conditions so as I said you can get more about this\nBy going onto teen driving dot triple A. dot com to help coach these

culture like music like art your station covers sports at the high school level you're not talking brewers baseball for crying out loud\nYou're talking the local scene briefly sometimes other topics don't interest me but it's part of the fabric of the community just wanted to express my two cents that was closer to sixteen or Seventeen cents I think but I say I was in like a quarter yeah right right um [noise]\nWhat factor oh we have a question for you okay which ... which will get to in just a question or no no uh what factors determine a dog's life expectancy I have two Thirteen year old now while we have to ask agent six what breeds what kind of dogs are adding\nBut it's you know there there were so many factors\nThat determine that there's genetics is healthy lifestyle is diet um you know the the amount of medical care the dog gets a you know the generally speaking the larger the breed the shorter lifespan but that's even changing now we're seeing you know larger breed dogs living into their early to mid teens\nWell those are the dogs who are being fed earth foreign pet foods ice has because again Bob can say this but I Will if you're not feeding your dog earth born products um you're feeding them poison it's just that simple I'm aged sixty nine\nCent in a bunch of remote correspondence but these are actually worth reading I'm probably should have left his agent number out of this one but he's been very honest with us I just woke up watch the whole game then girlfriend decided she was frisky ooh [laughter] good for you\nThe whole game then girlfriend decided she was frisky ooh [laughter] good for you it genetics you know I'm not so good for her but I'm sure it was good for you uh went to sleep at two Fifteen am well and then back to the uh Nineteen Seventy five games six greatest game in baseball history according to Pete Rose\nAnd because normally I spent in the ground when they have to mention Pete Rose his name God what a horrible human being great baseball player and truly horrible human being um I had to get permission after ... home run\nIn the eighth inning yeah so we're already over anyway center tied the game up at six after the foul ball to stay alive for them terrible terrible swing and then sort of feel I had to get permission after ... home run to come back downstairs in Nineteen Seventy five to seize this to see Fisk blast in the twelfth\nAnd then and then agents sixty nine writes in an agent sixty nine um I had this highlighted in the newspaper yesterday I had a circled in big letters because I wanted to talk about it and I didn't get to it\nOr the last hour of yesterday's show was almost like a real talk show here it was like political ... going back and forth uh two two calls going back and forth on political stuff I don't do real talk show stole stuff much was very odd for me but um this is\nI'm no sports Regina Pizzeria was named the number one pizza joint in the country number one of the country ... someplace in New York came in second someplace in New haven came in third\nRegina Pizzeria a thin crust brick oven who does the noodles and ... of toppings or what's your favorite pizza I don't have a pizza I never met a pizza I didn't like oh okay yeah All right I'm more of a deep dish guy or thin crust when I Will rest okay I like them both you know\nWe can terriers by the way the Thirteen year old dogs or we can terriers\nWe can terriers by the way the Thirteen year old dogs are Wheaton terriers yeah they're they're a smaller dog yeah OK the best dog ever born that was girl the dog guard dog she was a west highland terrier\nJust give them one or the other I'm I'm a\nAccess to hear your answer because all of the above all right because we go to the dog we used to mix some of the wet yeah dry\nAnd that I mean it it makes it maybe a little more interesting for the dog is enhanced palate ability\nUm if if the dog is content with a dry and uh the dry yeah you know I'm the only time I really recommend wet food\nIs um if if you don't know how much the dog is drinking and you want to be sure that hydrated okay because let food is Seventy percent moisture um and uh it's a ... such that he has to eat the soft wet food but other than that you know there's really no advantage\nTo wet food over dry or you know than the dry food and a lot of people say well it it it scrapes their teeth really doesn't\nCause they will take a mouthful to chopping to swallow and don't chew it yeah you know it's just it's just the chopping swallow but what it does do is to promote saliva flow and that tends to wash everything down to throw when you feed the wet food that doesn't promote\nAnd that tends to wash everything down their throat when you feed the wet food that doesn't promote the saliva flow and tends to stick to their teeth okay and then again you know within like Ninety six hours it can be plaque which will turn into tartar\nHuh oh and I'm here's where we go into um the difference between dog taste buds and human taste buds and for all of you people out there who are so concerned with the flavor of your dogs food\nYeah yeah the dogs that practically no sense of taste\nWe know and he was known science we know them on that I Will run or tongue of there's they've only got about Seventeen hundred and taste buds on are struggling a little town we have almost ten thousand ...\nWhen you offer something to a dog they invariably sniff it yeah and if they take gets the chopping swallow yellow to dissolve in their mouth\nI'm to enjoy the flavor ... and and the big the big thing is um they wouldn't get dessert out all the cats litter box if they had a sense of taste and they wouldn't let themselves where they looked themselves in that sense of taste probably you know wow [noise] so but it's you know\nThe advertising wouldn't be as as effective as you said the great smells dogs love the way to Rome and so we all talk about the great taste dog stuff 'cause we identify with taste when that's really not a factor which taste I mean the ... and sometimes texture you know the dog will take in his mouth and won't feel right to them and spit it out\nThat happens on occasion but generally if if it doesn't fight back it's gone\nAnd the guy and then um what we were going to talk about when we came back from our last break I completely forgot now that are in that short term memory law degree every\nThe grain free controversy you know the the the big confusion over the grain free issue when the dilated cardiomyopathy um that I tell you the FDA came out with an alert back in July on July twelfth they should know alert um for a dog so I'm a show\nTo an alert um for a dogs I'm showing up with cardio dilated cardio my op at the OK I'm Dalai the cardio my apathy is is an enlargement of the heart or it makes it a difficult for the heart to pump blood\nSo you know the various organs and so forth get oxygen starved for one thing or the valves can leak\nAnd that can cause a floor built up in the chest and abdominal cavity is leading to um congestive heart failure so I mean it's a it's a pretty serious a condition and there are some large in giant breed dogs that are\nAre genetically predisposed to getting that um that condition [laughter] um but in the past year or so or they didn't really give a timeframe\nUm they have been small and medium sized dog showing up at that ordinary cardiologist with DC I'm Down there the cardio biology a puppy and uh so USDA FDA took a look at it\nAnd um you know the the information right now it's still very sketchy they're still collecting data ... you know from all over the country wants to send got an ounce and everybody you know oh I I my dog is this and my dog is that so they're\nThey're just collecting and analyzing data but I'm the one thing that they found there was a common thread was that um a lot of dogs run grain free diets\nThat had um peace I mean that potatoes and legumes huh as a main ingredient\nNow there's no regulatory or legal definition of a main ingredient ... what you what the FDA uses a to define a um an ingredient of a main ingredient is those ingredients that appear on the ingredient panel before the first vitamins mineral\nVitamins and minerals that usually those things you can't pronounce [laughter] because where we are required by law to use to scientific name um\nBecause we're we're required by law to use to scientific name um for the same reason I've I've I've said this before um when when people plant new to new plant things in the yard you're safe the tags that come with those plants because they get the tax anonymous name that that big long Latin Amy camps\nInterest rates on AM Thirteen twenty W. A. R. A. of more of a kid with Paul ended up north Carolina I'm next to Ken Brown university who hosts the lecture error shot oh I'm Sorry Bob\nYou were saying oh are they going to go to the breaking girls break I Want you to finish your thought gosh darn okay well as I say [laughter] ... so great for good or bad\nYeah well I mean grain free has always been a little more marketing and sign yeah dogs have no nutritional requirement for carbohydrates which what the grains are the main purpose of the grains is um as a binding agent to help all the cable together\nPeople think of them is Phil is there are no fillers and pet foods okay everything has a purpose to may not be nutrition but everything has a purpose\nAnd and what we consider to be the lower end foods you see a lot of corn wheat soy sorghum gluten things like that that can affect the digest ability of the food produced gas softer stools more volumes tools and can ah can affect the dogs' skin you know dry skin out and\nMake them scratch in the in the higher end foods that youth grains will use all meal rice barley and rye um those aren't problematic grains and then in the grain free we use a binders life he's potatoes tapioca\nSo that's why you see 'em a lot in the grain free um but there are there are a foods and aren't green free but also have potatoes and tapioca and ah so anyway that's you know the FDA came up with this warning and of course social media just lit up and I mean that\nThat gives things or a life of its own everything gets you know gets blown way out of proportion even FDA's position at this point\nGets blown way out of proportion even FDA's position at this point is don't change your dogs die based on the information we've gotten so far 'cause it's inconclusive okay right now it's just it's just a it's a common thread ... um\nAnd then you know other other questions came up well what if it says sweet potatoes Yukon Gold red potatoes\nPotatoes or potatoes throughout the taste [laughter] okay um and then that as an aside they mentioned that I'm touring deficiency is another a significant cause of DC yeah\nWell that took on a life of its own as well Torino to fit shoring yeah touring as an essential amino acids and a touring deficiency can lead to blindness and it can lead to the dilated cardio money off of the um the retina can break down or if there's not enough touring\nSo that took on life his own people looking at that pet food label for touring and often times and the dog food anyway you know what I'm saying yeah you don't see it because dogs can synthesized tore my people can\nDogs I'm going to pressure with this okay dogs take the amino acids messiah name a Seventeen almost empty and sent ten to combine together to form touring er which becomes a significant um element of bio\nAnd there's the ... solves a approached the exit in a small intestine\nThe um the touring in the ... um gets it gets a created and read absorbed so that's how they make their own their own touring\nSo you don't need to add that I'm at earth born and we have always supplemented was touring or our dog food because we understand that there was largely giant breed dogs that are predisposed to DC I'm so we want to support them\nYou don't have to have to arena does the cat you do yeah 'cause cats can't synthesize touring they have to get it from the diet huh\nCat you do yeah 'cause cats can't synthesize touring they have to get it from the diet and the only sources of Torino or meat and shellfish you can't get Tori and from you know from plant protein or anything like that\nThere goes the vegan diet for your cat\nYou know and I'm so that you know that that created more confusion because people didn't see tore arenas several unit dog food\nUm ingredient bill and so I mean it it it really has gotten blown out of out of proportion I've covered it a couple of times so far in the in the column and on the on the hub pages website in fact I just I just wrote one last night that I published on a on a page website\nAnd and I keep up on it you know has a new information becomes available\nBut right now it's it's really much ado about nothing because they don't know I mean they suspected maybe potatoes ... could have a you know be part of the issue but they don't know why that don't know that it is that just have to be something you know a common thread\nIn those um in those cases of DC I'm\nOK Bob amber is where this year will be was too about uh ten thirty yep okay Bob amber is with is the author of pets aren't people call them every Monday in the sun chronicle he is way wicked smart if you've got any questions for Bob about your pets\nOr give us a call five oh wait two to one three to zero five oh wait two to two Thirteen twenty or text me it's seven seven four to eight seven six one nine four we'll be right back after this and Thirteen twenty W.\nA.

in some some tolerated fine yeah you know I I'll see them this time of year in the pet stores and they came in and they they got the costumes on and they they do look you yeah um but some dogs just you know\nYeah we did it with a dog once you ... it was a little thing you put over to make a looked like a dragon yeah lasted about thirty seven seconds she wanted nothing to do with it\nYeah I had never put it on her again I'd let the dog determine you know yeah I mean you know if you're going to force it on for a for a quick photo shoot for a minute or two yeah that's one thing but that to force them to you know take him to a doggy event or family party or something like that dressed up when they don't want to be dressed up that's not\nFair exactly you know what costume or I'm going to wear this Halloween I'm going to dress up as a mature adult [laughter] nobody will recognize me nobody speaking of mature adults let's go to the phone lines and speak to the world's most amazing meteorologist Jim carbon yeah\nWell that's very kind of you'll live to see another day of that I guess but [laughter] it's all good morning Bob Hi Jim uh I have a couple of questions right at the end if I can ask well get right to the weather and Bob it's a question that you asked me a couple of years ago they actually take place tomorrow morning remember the question you asked about the temperature\nYeah why it it goes down when the sun rises the temperature goes down you\nKnow not most\nWhen the sun rises the temperature goes down you\nNot not most David doesn't put tomorrow morning we'll be I think the classic example of that now today as I like to call it an example of mental wild weather almost six months to the day April nineteenth\nI was the last time we had the temperature is only reach the middle forties during the day it rained it rained all day April nineteenth almost exactly six months ago\nA and so this is something we haven't seen in six months at least the sun is shining though but\nAnother indication of the ever weakening signed the shadows continue to get longer each day the sun comes in the window in the morning at a different angle and it's set so we all know in the west but now it's sitting in the west southwest of the coming into the different angles all these go as we go through the shorter days of the year to cause it's that angle of the sun that really affects the temperature\nOr average high on this date of sixty out which is very similar to uh the last few days of April and that's kind of makes sense that we have had we getting weather kind of like mid to late April that coming up\nOver the next day or so now they reached the mid forties today we're going to drop off this afternoon so if you want to fly a kite do it this morning we have a better chance of going up because a window diminished but that will set the stage for the certainly the coldest morning of the season in terms of the actual air temperature now\nAlabama or on the Senate only dropped to about thirty six thirty seven this morning but the wind was blowing at fifty miles an hour on average and we had the windshield and the twenties tomorrow morning we'll have almost no wind radiation will cooling\nAnd we're going to have a white frost on the grass in many areas\nAre outside of the more urban locations because the temperature is going to get close to the point we're going down around twenty nine or thirty\nSo it will be colder temperature wise tomorrow morning pot or they will be almost no wind so in some cases some people would almost take that now the thing about the temperature again Bob in all yep we had one night when the steel the temperature is usually taken about five or six feet above the ground the official temperatures\nWhen the steel the temperature is usually taken about five or six feet above the ground the official temperatures I have at the monitor on the laying right on the on your back yard Grasso wherever a not on the pavement because it'll be ... ah on the grass the temperature could easily be five degrees cooler\nRight at the bottom and that's why people have asked me and other forecasters how can I get frost if it's like thirty six degrees well the process forming right off the ground\nSo uh and I've done it many times as a as an experiment in the past and showing people saying to saint the monitors it always ... to like\nPut one on like a ladder six feet above the ground on a nightly tonight and lay the other one just on the ground\nAnd the one on the ground or will be at least five sometimes six seven degrees colder and that's why you get the frost\nBottom line is we're going to see a nice ... nice recovery tomorrow afternoon into the middle to upper fifties back closer to that sixty what we should be were losing about a degree every two and a half days now through the temperature average temperatures and that a good news for the weekend signed clouds just a quick passing shower probably late afternoon another cold frontal approach\nAnd we'll spike up to about sixty so there we go back to average\nAnd then Sunday very similar to today windy cold in the forties\nI'm like today though I think there'll be a little more on the way of those are the Louis clouds mixed with the blue skies Indy\nSo we can picture that Sunday by the way the patriots in case you're interested in Chicago last Sunday afternoon they will be on the back side of the high so they're going to be playing and sunshine and about sixty degrees in Chicago on Sunday afternoon so and luckily it's a one o'clock game so he doesn't get sleep\nAs God herself intended football at one o'clock on Sundays two things quickly um ah they were clown questions last night on Jeopardy Jim oh really well yes asked\nMe asked me one of them see if I can get\nUm the top of some cumulus cloud looks like the handle bingo they don't want to [noise] [noise] right yeah\nLike and do\nBingo there in that one right yeah\nAnd ... and then whenever anyone uses the word and bill or a CNN ville I immediately think of um the road runner and Wylie coyote genius boy they went through a ton of bills in their skill at all of the\nCompany it was made by acme anyway I oh yeah well no envelope under storms to worry about hopefully for the rest of the year as we were pretty much out of our thunderstorm season next chance\nHold on hold on hold on hold on I I yeah last time we talked about Wylie coyote genius and the road runner I asked where did you get the money to order all the acme products\nAnd I was really stunned by this and the ... one of our quality control engineers wrote in he doesn't need money to purchase those products it's an advertising technique called product placement\nAct me was willing to give Wylie coyote genius all of those products for free because so many of us would see the acme products on the cartoons while now you were trying to talk about the weather or something\nThat I always thought that was like it's like the generic brand in let's say from the sixties you know ... you know but uh yeah you know and and and all the TV shows you see when they have a bottle of ... a hot enough milk\nWith what you don't see those anymore cartons of milk but are they always just had milk on them or not all the time it was just really no brand you know so anyway that's what I was trying to say what the next chance of rain\nKnow where they got that information it's welcome back to the pontificated with Paul and Bob ... show right now here at Thirteen twenty W.

I'm a dog mom during the day my dog is in daycare but the nights present more of a challenge I work full time and I'm Single but I still choose to have a dog because of the proven emotional and\nFitness benefits that correlate to owning four legged friends\nLately I've been wondering whether my dog can come along with me in a typical settings such as Bible study\nTo hair dressing appointments and to other venues that are not conspicuously dog friendly I live in Denver and our city is extremely dog friendly but I fear the culture here could be desensitizing me to what is otherwise unacceptable social behavior\nI have a healthy view of an animal's place in the world versus the humans so it\nActually use the term pet it gets wound up like you do man but anyway um I have a healthy view of animals place in the ...\nTrump advocates will think you'd do man but anyway um I have a healthy view of animals place in the world versus humans she does so I Do not want to display bad manners to my two legged friends by imposing my four legged friend upon them what's the appropriate ...\nAs the owner of the still I mean come on [laughter]\nYou know I wouldn't have thinking person just do that you know for the Bible study group do send an email make a phone call yeah kind of bring my dog right yeah no you can okay and then don't argue you know if they said oh don't argue right just but they know who who else in the group but an allergy younger you know\nThe fears you know um but then\nThe the thing that got me though is this is someone who thinks thinks they have a healthy respect for the difference between dogs and humans um I'm Sorry you don't you don't and I and you know what a terrible person I'm not trying to say that\nBut uh you're wrong or Bob amber I mean a Amy you'll love the first I'm not going to be ... or ...

I Know you don't yeah um when you did did your dog sleep in your bed\nI never had a dog had a cat and yes she did really yup you've never had a dog never had a dog but you had cats\nReally yeah you've never had a dog never had a dog but you had cats\nYeah had a cat she was born Bob I have a lot of this I hate to do this I think I'm going to have to ban you pontificate and with Paul show [laughter] wow kittens I guess it and not cats yeah my only the one who said you're the one who said dogs are family cats think your staff yeah\nYeah but she was born I named her fluffy she was born behind my chair and my office at the old barn and when she got to be eight weeks I took her home I was single the times yeah she was company for me and he lost his sixteen years wow\nWow Asian Seventeen writes in Bob's right pets are not people but my pets make me feel better than most people do yeah yeah that's a common common sentiment him they don't talk back and there's been all kinds of just having a dog yeah lowers your blood pressure lowers your heart rate yeah all kinds of there's all kinds of\nBenefits and the fact is an organization called the human animal bond research Institute it's ha be our eye that a fund research into this type of thing you know the the human animal bond yeah the benefits of pet ownership to to humans and so a lot of lot of research being done on that\nThere was an amazing study I saw on PBS about dogs a couple of years ago um where they were trying a it was this was out of a a Russia and they were trying to domesticate wolves\nSo there'd be a a family of wolves and they select only the most gentle or ... file\nWolves and it only took them for generations for generations to come up with wolves that they have much more like dogs and then like wolves and yeah and they expected it to take like Fifteen or sixteen generations amazing but dogs they started his walls right\nYeah and there's there's some controversy about that um you know\nSwells right yeah and there's been some controversy about that um you know the dogs get get domesticated when wolves to our hanging around the campfire scraps of the eyes\nYou know the the the people would throw the scraps of food out to them so they wouldn't eat the people you know [laughter] and uh and and that's where it came from but you know the central he talked to\nOkay um [noise] I met a tongue in cheek that I might not invite you back but now it's starting to consider the seriously agents seventeenth with me all my God he's never had a dog\nYou know my interest in animals has always been scientific then he can find a scientific perspective not a wow not an emotional than he can't say pets are people I'm not going to go that far I think he's still said oh yeah I mean that that that makes it easier for me to say\nThat while I'm okay and then agent five Ninety five writes in ... six Ninety nine right exactly right Bob very wow\nI'm tired too I'm not really lost and I might steal that yeah by the way it was soon as you leave the studio you're going to engage in on my favorite activity is living really humidity and the inside to my island yes you will you're taking a nap yeah napping used to be third on my list but I'm sixty years old now and it's number one\nI kind of way and I'm so glad this is almost over with [laughter]\nAnd drive more like Tom Rath dirty in a relaxed manner for Tom and this this we have talked about a little for Tom\nDriving is a relaxing activity he's not in a rush he's not always looking at a clock he doesn't leave for late work a leaf work late so we have to rush Tom is one of those rare individuals in God I Wish I was like this were driving\nIs a relaxing activity for most of us driving is a stressful activity we're trying to get somewhere and damage we want to get there now the exceptions are\nMy loving daughter grace did this summit with Kim but this was much more of a a grace and dad thing um mystery writes we still do it to this day but from the time\nShe was a little girl you know just when she was old enough to make her own mix CDs or ... you know I Would go on mystery rides put a a mix CD and the CD player listen to the music would introduce songs to each other and just uh whenever we got to an intersection\nWhichever way we didn't know did not know which way that road went we take that road\nAnd we usually drive very relaxed very slow and that that's one of the only times in my life were driving was relaxing a relaxing activity and not as stressful activity but to make sure we didn't cause stress for other drivers\nWhen we were taking it slow relaxing mystery ride and someone came up behind me we would poll over we pull over now we're both happy we're both happy\nAll over we pull over now we're both happy we're both happy\nI don't have some impatient jerk riding the rare bumper of my car\nAnd he doesn't have some slow polka holding them up he's got somewhere to go we would pull over let cars by I mean four five six seven times on our mystery rights everyone's happy everyone's happy and and\nSome people do this even some people close to me do this so I Will not use their names or someone comes up behind them on a road and starts tailgating all get them back so they slow down even more\nDon't do that don't do that really ... wow wow you think they're being a jerk by\nYou know writing to close do tailgating you Idaho I Know the solution I'll do what Trump would do if someone's being a jerk to me I'll be a bigger jerk up figure jerk\nNo oh who knows maybe there's an emergency [noise]\nMaybe they forgot their wife's anniversary and they're desperately trying to get to the store and get her present wife's anniversary their anniversary or wife's birthday and they're desperately trying to get to get get to a store to get a president before she finds out\nThat he forgot the birthday or anniversary maybe it's a medical emergency someone's tailgating you\nAnd you have room or there's a safe place to do it by saying do it right away but at the next day\nFor opportunity pull over let him get by your both happier you're both happy or you don't have some jerk tailgating you\nAnd while they don't have some slow polka holding them up anyway other ...\nOther ordinances proposed by the mayor would impose parking restrictions on Beagle club road bed\nWould impose parking restrictions on Beagle club road ban thin plastic shopping bags and impose penalties on drivers who smoke in their cars when they have a child in the car seat that one I'm not in favor of\nI'm In favor of trying to educate people that you shouldn't be smoking gas spurs when your kids in the car seat in the back seat I don't want to pass laws on that stuff\nUm that's kinda like um\nIf someone ... ever asked me what my political leanings are now usually mentioned that while I'm consider myself a progressive I'm a proud progressive but I'm not a gym rowdy kind of progressive and if he ever see Jim rowdy on his show greater Boston or hear him on the radio with Marjorie Egan\nOn one of the NPR stations a gym is the kind of progressive who wants to ban everything wow wow I still kind of believe in freedom of choice cigarettes are legal\nYou know I'm someone wants to smoke\nAnd I guess I'm almost libertarian on that kind of stuff I mean I don't use excessive sugar someone else does fine I think so to is poison poison I tell you\nI'm I don't want to ban it I don't want to ban the giant cops I don't want to ban stuff I Want to educate people and then let them make their own decision and that's where the penalties on drivers who smoke in their cars when they have a child in the car seat um I think it's a good idea not not\nTo be puffing on gas ... when your kids in the car seat but I don't want to make laws about it but just I guess the general point I'm getting at took your while okay to take me to want to get to the point\nI'm Sorry but George roads in this article um\nLet me read just that first paragraph again but read it with the tone that I think George roads is implying I could be wrong but I think\nGeorge roads is implying I could be wrong but I think\nI think his tone is more like this\nMayor Paul hero is added again the city's chief executive but apparently he also loves the law making role he left the state legislature when he became mayor\nThis week he submitted the fourth fourth I tell you proposed ordinance of which he and he alone is the sole sponsor\nIs that tone correct\nDo you want your marriage just sit back shut up and run the city and have people have been problems to him or or do you like the fact that mare hero is being pro active and when he sees a problem he tries to propose an ordinance to solve said problem\nIn some cases uh I'd agree with them I think the plastic ban plastic bag ban is fine with that in other\nCases the um speed bumps and the um\nIf you smoke in your car with a child in the car seat we will a risk you actually they'll just find you they wanna rescue does those things go too far\n\nSo do you agree with George roads I think I think I'm guessing here but I think hey hey hey look out your mayor and not a state rap let other people boroughs audiences for or\nAre you glad that you're ... is being that proactive hey I see a problem there I've got an idea of how to fix that city council what do you think a couple of remote correspondence it's seven seven four to eight seven six one nine for that seven seven four to eight seven six\nYou eight seven six one nine for that seven seven four to eight seven six one nine for ... hold on\n\nWhich this um him doesn't drive her is probably a maniac in her white jeep Cherokee\nOh okay sorry this is the point of that now I get it oh freedom of choice by ... yes when we're talking about that when we're talking about that yeah so I I'm I Am a progressive but unlike a gym rowdy I'm not a huge fan of banning things\nI'm up up up up up\nAnd then I think we have another remote correspondence at seven seven four to eight seven six one nine for that seven seven four to eight seven six one nine for age in thirty one right smoking in the car with a child in the car is child abuse\nOkay\nThat's probably accurate some people might think that statement goes too far but that's probably accurate um I think I Want to educate people this child abuse I'm not sure I Want to pass a law about it\nUm and then by extension agent thirty one um [noise]\nDidn't see a lot of obese children when we were kids we didn't see a lot of obese children the fat kid always stuck out the fat kid always got picked on a while ago when I saw the movie to serve would love to serve with love Lulu city poor TA I cried during that movie to uh the kid in that movie they call fats\nWouldn't even be considered fat by today's standards um so\nWouldn't even be considered fat by today's standards um so you think smoking with a child in the car is child abuse um\n\nI got to be careful because I'm going to really really anger some people I think when I say this um [noise] I think having a five six seven eight year old kid a kid that young who's already obese I think that's child abuse too I really really do\nI Want to try to educate people about that I don't want to pass a lot about that I don't want to take take the kid away but um you know you walk through the mall and um\n[noise] a young kid that overweight wow wow I don't think it's bland ... I really do um\nOh OK aged forty eight um I think that was the last mayor agent forty eight not\nNot the current one not that there's anything wrong with that either way and then an anonymous texture rights and yes I think you got George roses George roads tone right yes the tone of that article was correct um I guess a a texture or remote correspondent\nHey you know I'm listening to talk of all the all the different changes and rules and stuff like that you know it's kind of ... ad in a way because there's so many laws so many rules regulations I mean pretty much you know far as when it comes with us You're an adult\nYou know you should know right from wrong and you know you do not to do and stuff like that and then as far as like these or what have you on a college but he bombshell whatever yes well we got more than enough of those in the city of out of her with\nWith all the potholes and stuff like that I think that we ought to be thinking is taking the money and try to upgrade a lot of the ... oh you know I mean that's just\nMy opinion I mean yeah a lately they've done you know pleasant as three self main street focus street it's still a lot of those that are really a tough shape so if you need a speed up your down Ninety five percent of those other roses funniest evolves [laughter]\nThat's yeah when I whenever you I hit a bump in your car you have to wonder was that a speed bump or a pothole\nYeah [laughter] after what people want to know what the differences and then that would be like well the same thing if they put these things through you know somebody has to do something damage to their vehicle and ... whatever the city solicitor lawyer and they'll be up an issue and get money and stuff like that so\nLike I said I I think we can use money or what was a a better use violence like I said upgrading the roads and doing other things and stuff like that\nExcellent All right um and just back to your first point um yeah it's an adult wants to smoke it off their back but I can see the point where you know you want to put smoke in your own body that's just fine I'm forcing it into a child's body um I can see I can see\nForcing it into a child's body um I can see I can see how that really really angers and aggravates some people because the kid doesn't have any choice about it\nNo apps and like I said once again you're an adult you should know that are not\nFunny at shows I mean it's like my daughter she smokes right but he doesn't do it uh when she said that car with the children\nYou know at the same thing if she wants to do it right there she's\nAt our house and lab and a couple of other stuff like that show the whole you know always where the children are not and so once again you know of all you know you know\nThat you all know and right from wrong you know like I said you know better not to do it on a children excellent points when you've got to have a law you know ticket is so on a cellphone right\nAll right hey oh Dan thank you so so much for calling in its eleven o two time from our Lebanon embrace who I got to give me the bombs Russians they get the hell out of here you're always\nGiven above average I hey did text me your email you mean your address or are they going to beat the Sunday deadline\nProblem are worried about it take care of\nAll I'm not either but ...

so you get to choose when a foul has been called anybody would look at that and say wait a minute that game is skewed\nAnd that's what's happening here integrity would require Brian Kemp to recuse himself to step down as secretary of state in this kind of high profile election instead he has not and so we see things going on like prior to this\nWe had the ... they're trying to shut down the polling places in a majority or\nA majority African American counties or counties that had sizable black population so like in Randolph county um where one of camps allies try to you know recommended that seven of nine polling stations shut down um\nBefore the general election I mean that kind of interference that kind of skewed\nI'm I'm a decision making is what is what Stacey Abrams is talking about when she says that it is calling into question the legitimacy of the election is calling into question legitimacy of our electoral process these and so a secretary of state\nThat is the bedrock foundation of his role is to ensure the integrity of the election process sitting on top of this one undermines that um\nOf the election process not sitting on top of this one undermines that\nBrian Kemp the secretary of state and the Republican candidate for governor ...

of illegal immigrants it is playing to a racist troop um that's in the body politic that these immigrants are going to somehow steal our elections\nBut he cannot point to note saying the same way that Kris Kobach could not point to all of these illegal immigrants um it is a fiction it is a lie it is a myth that as being used\nTo stir up fear to justify the kind of unwarranted voter suppression techniques\nThe secretaries of state like Brian Kemp and Kris Kobach are using\nI'd like to go back to this whole issue of will do the closing of polling places or most people who really don't pay attention to what happens in polling places all of them there's\nA and because you talk about the impact on voter turnout of all of sudden or either closing of all places or shifting the ... voting place it from one location to another just before an election\nAbsolutely I'm so one of the things to to pay attention to is that after the Supreme Court got at the voting rights act with the Shelby County beholder decision in twenty Thirteen\nHorton got at the voting rights act with the Shelby County beholder decision and twenty Thirteen\nBy the time we got to the twenty six teen election states that had been under pre clearance and that is where because of their history of racial discrimination at the polls they had to have all of their voting rights voting changes may uh approved by the department of justice\nAfter the voting rights was got it\nEight hundred and sixty eight polling places where shutting down by the time we got to the twenty sixteen election Brian Kemp has been responsible for two hundred and fourteen of those polling places being shut down\nWhat the research shows is that for every tenth of a mile that a polling place is removed from the African American community black voter turnout goes down by point five percent so the more you move these polling places\nThe further and further the more and more you're able to depress the black voter turnout\nSo we had a an instance in Sparta where\nA under the guise of being fiscally responsible they were going to consolidate the polling stations well when they consolidated the polling stations the one for the black community and I can say the black community because we do have residential segregation in the United states\nSo for the one in the black community that one was moved Seventeen miles away\nNow think about that for trying to vote and what we also know is that many in the African American community do not have a private cars they don't have personal transportation so they have to rely upon public transportation so when you move\nA polling place further and further away from the black community but\nA polling place further and further away from the black community by that very moment that very instance is designed to be pressed the black voter turnout\nIn June democracy now spoke with Stacey Abrams a democratic candidate for governor in Georgia\nTrade Kim has unfortunately built two very strong record of voter suppression\nAnd yes he and I have\nTo leave a conflict at a number of times and\nI think I'm I'm very well I'm not I don't think I Know I'm very proud of our record of beating of forcing him to restore the cancelled registrations of thousands of compelling his office to do the right thing when it comes to voter registration\nBut also I think it's a challenging conversation to have both with secretary can to end with lieutenant governor cable because rather than focusing on how we move the state forward they've both focus unfortunately on required or forum of bigotry and how they want to harm communities and hold us back\nSo that Stacey Abrams speaking on ... about her opponent churches secretary of state Brian Kemp in Georgia lieutenant governor Casey Cagle I also want it to turn to the Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia and\nWho was captured on video Saturday as he snatched a cell phone out of the hands of a constituent who asked about\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp who Purdue was stumping for senator Purdue is on the campus of Georgia Tech in Atlanta when a student tried to ask\nHim about his endorsement\nSo ah how can you endorse a candidate film I probably want to be one of the\nSenator Purdue return the phone after student demanded it back on Sunday produced office called the incident a misunderstanding saying the senator thought the student wants and shit\nIt produces office called the incident a misunderstanding saying the senator thought the student wants to take a selfie with him I'm\nA professor understand if you could comment on that front as we wrap up this discussion about Georgia who's voting right now I mean in some states there's no voting taking place by what's happening in Georgia\nI'm so first on I'm senator ... do you know remember senator Purdue is the one who opened a one of those Christian breakfast is um by praying for Obama's death\nBy saying you know make your life be ended short you know quoting us a song and you know may your wife be left to I'm a widow and your children homeless and beggars so this is Senator David Perdue\nUm and and Stacey Abrams is actually right that the the language that we're getting from\nI'm Brian\nKemp and Casey cable has been the language of fear has been the language of stoking um um racial animosity racial anxiety ah and and bigotry and sold and they're they're selling fear as as they're as their component\nFor why they shouldn't be in office\nAnd so what we're seeing right now is that we have early voting going on 'em and the the I I'm not sure how how risk it has been yet but I Know that um the grassroots organizations had been very active\nAnd getting people registered to vote getting people out to vote and because Stacey Abrams in ... has a a message of hope has a message of how the we build in Georgia for all of us um that is in fact stoking the fear on the side\nJoke for all of us um that is in fact stoking the fear on the side of the Republican I'm because the demographics are changing so much in Georgia that the vote the vote for African Americans Asians and Latinos has to be stuff down because\nThe message that the uh Brian Kemp and the Republicans are bringing aren't messages that resonate with that population because those populations are in fact targeted by that their message\nAnd Carolyn Anderson share of African American studies department at Emory University author of well most recently one person no vote voter suppression is destroying our democracy will be back with her and other guests in a moment [noise] [noise]\nA because I'm having a felony conviction sent me in this\nBipartisan a coalition that has formed talk about what it's like to work with these different groups and what are the polls indicate for November\nFirst of all we don't even call out of the bipartisan movement we are organic grassroots movement that welcomes in enjoys bipartisan\nSupport we're not leading where the partisan nature of of this topic or or the issue of voting what we're leaving with is the human nature you know that they're real people's lives who are impacted by these policies and because of that we've been able to first of all recognize that that selling\nAnd because of that we've been able to first of all recognize\nThat that selling disenfranchisement now impacts people from all walks of life which now allows us to go into communities in rural parts of Florida in urban parts of Florida and have real conversations with real people and really connect with the pain that they're feeling\nBecause of that because of that what we've seen is indicative of what we're seeing now with the hurricane relief efforts that we've always seen\nThat in the aftermath of hurricane no one cares how their neighbor voted no one cares how much money they made only thing they see is another human being and need and that's the beautiful part of this campaign that we haven't brace and we all onto\nFor dear life because at the end we are organizing folks along the lines of humanity and because of that we've been able to get people\nThat that that that that throw off their part of the same clothes and come together as brothers and sisters are in this movement as Americans that's rallying around each other and knowing that wants to desert space it's paid\nSo we can have a organizations like the tax watts\nChristian Coalition freedom partners that stand up and say you know what it is time to bring second chances back to the state of Florida and they could do that alongside the ACLU a organizations like Advancement Project I'm I'm a lines for safety injustice and throwing the rights restoration coalition\nThat is to me the most beautiful thing that we're witnessing here I Believe that we are becoming a shining light for the rest of the country about what's good when people can elevate themselves above partisan bickering above racial discord\nAnd connect along the lines of humanity for the good of all people\nAble to move from Florida to another uh another state\nAri I'd like to move from Florida to another uh another state that's also\nA a scene of a disproportionate targeting a racial minority and the Supreme Court has ruled that will allow the state of North Dakota to enforce a new voter id requirement that will make it harder for Native Americans to vote during the midterm elections\nThe state's new voter id law requires voters to show identification that demonstrates a residential street address\nBut this has already rented many tribal IDs invalid since many Native Americans live on reservations depend on post office boxes to receive their mail or the law could make a big difference in the close race between\nDemocratic senator Heidi Heitkamp and her Republican challenger Kevin Cramer a the races expected to help decide who controls the Senate you're talking about that as well\nSo the north Dakota voter id law has flown under the radar relative to Georgia but it's just a serious because the way this Republican voter id law is written is that most tribal ideas are not going to be accepted because they do not have a residential address in them\nMany Native Americans live in rural areas on reservations they don't have address as they get their mail at the post office there's nothing wrong with that but this ... written to not allow\nPO box as count as an address so what's happening now in North Dakota is that sounds of Native Americans couldn't be disenfranchised by this Republican voter id law according to federal court statistics twenty percent\nOf eligible Native American voters don't have\nThe correct I date and that means about five thousand Native American voters might not be able to vote in the next election and there were running out of time\nTo try to get them the correct ideas right now I mean we're basically twenty days away from the election and Heidi Heitkamp only won her first race for the Senate by three thousand votes with strong native support now you're talking about a much larger percentage of Native Americans who could be different\nWith strong native support now you're talking about a much larger percentage of Native Americans who could be disenfranchised so this one voter id law in North Dakota could cost Heidi Heitkamp percent sea and could cost\nDemocrats control of the Senate so it's a very very serious situation we're also talking about the most historically disenfranchised group in this country who faces all sorts of barriers today and now thirty days before the election they find out they might not be able to vote in a critical midterm elections absolutely shocking an appalling was half an hour if the kind of it's also particularly\nInteresting that this is happening at a time as\nA Trump continually attacking US Senator Elizabeth Warren are trying to use the word Pocahontas the name Pocahontas that's a pejorative to describe her she has now gone and gotten a DNA test which she says from us Stanford professor\n... says she has Native American lineage an ancestry as she looks like she's about to announce her bed for twenty twenty at presidential uh for the ... presidential election\nJust imagine Amy voter suppression North Dakota got a fraction of the attention of Elizabeth Warren's DNA test or Donald Trump's Pocahontas slurs and I think what we should be focusing on instead of her ancestry is all the barriers are being faced by Native Americans in this country you can go down every single statistic\nAnd you see the problems but particularly with voting there was a long history of disenfranchising Native American voters of making polling places\nVery inaccessible of gerrymandering district so they don't have representation and now right before an election a new voter ID laws put into place that could disenfranchise thousands of native voters to me this is absolutely outrageous it's on American and the fact that this election North Dakota\nIs tainted by voter suppression you can't reverse it\nAnd so right now people have to do everything they can to get Native Americans so that they can get the idea that they need to vote for this law was sick\nDo everything they can to get Native Americans so that they can get the idea is they need to vote for this law was specifically written it's very very clear to disenfranchise native\nAmerica ... an hour and what are the ... in terms of the fact that we're only weeks away from the mid term elections clearly\nThe Florida referendum or whatever happens there will only take effect for the next election is but what can be done now in Georgia and in North Dakota or to be able to or have some I\nHave a have these folks have their rights a vote on before this lecture\nSo in Georgia there is a lawsuit filed the to allow the pending registrations to go through even if you are pending registration you can show up and vote with an idea at the polls so it's very foreign people know that they can vote\nIn North Dakota the tribal authorities are going to have basically a temporary IDs are going to give people a letter saying they have an address\nPoll workers are supposed to accept that but we used to be very very vigilant here and that's why issues like election protection are going to be so important 'cause I'm extremely worried people are going to show up in Georgia they're going to show up in North Dakota they might even have the right documents and election workers won't be able to won't won't tell them that they're able to vote\nAnd I'm a ... ballot initiatives that have um that will ease restrictions and other parts of the country\nWell this is huge because there's a ballot initiatives in seven states that would dramatically expand voting rights restoring voting rights ex felons in Florida to making it easier to register to vote in Michigan Nevada\nTo cracking down on gerrymandering and places like Colorado and Utah and so despite all the focus on voter suppression there is an opportunity to dramatically expand voting rights and twenty a teen and there is the best opportunity in a decade\nTo make it easier to vote for millions of people so I think that while all the focus is on suppression and twenty Eighteen the landscape for voting rights could look dramatically different in twenty twenty if all of these ballot initiatives pass or even if some of them just passed and twenty Eighteen well we want to thank you\nTwenty if all of these ballot
