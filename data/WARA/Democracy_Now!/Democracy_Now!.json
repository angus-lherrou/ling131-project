just Fifteen Percent of the vote we're joined right now by ... she is director of the network for social justice and human rights in Brazil joining us in our New York studio welcome to democracy now can you talk about what took place on Sunday and the significance of both an hour is not\nOutright victory he still has the runoff but he got many more votes than what's expected\nYeah so that's a very dangerous situation in Brazil that I think is very important to monitor because that could have an effect in the whole region um\nLike I said before a former president Lula actually or if he was able to run he would probably win very easily but there was a vacuum created because um he was put in jail or with charges of receiving a bribe but actually that is no\nEvidence that he received the bribe\nSo since the ... the parliamentary cool against president Dilma Rousseff to leaders and go we are in this situation of limbo with cannot come see that that we have a democracy in Brazil right now\nAnd uh so both on that or is there was out of a series of attacks on democracy that started two years ago when the parliament the record against him or herself\nJemma Seth hum is who'd out or she is forced out of the presidency and then um Lula who is the food decided to run for president is in person\nI'm ... who is the fruit decided to run for president is impressed and\nExactly yeah I Wish that that there was a cool because that was no effort now that's typical muted any crimes\nAnd but she wasn't the it's the anyway and both ... and I do at that time voted a as a Congress member voter for the ... in the name of the person who ports for her during the military dictatorship\nOnce where do you mean he ... in teaching support in the impeachment in his honor\nYes because during the votes in Congress most Congress members of ordering the name of God in the name of the family and both so NATO voted in the name of the person who reports for ... during\nThe day that they don't want to go to Jim Crow south I interviewed her in April here she was ousted in two thousand sixteen and what she's described as a co and I asked her about the rise of the far right\nWill see do far too yes I can indies the far right in Brazil like the fluoride everywhere it's anti ... anti black anti indigenous person and it is in favor of ending all over sites and they struggle with is the one to end any oversight of labor work situations\nAnd the longest to slavery that continue to exist in Brazil is full of prejudice and intolerance use and they believe that they can resolve the most complex problems\nUsing brute force of violence result in violence what's happened in the vote in the impeachment process that I suffered legislative balls and narrow cast his vote to paying tribute to the military dictatorship\nAnd torture and torture whose name was Carlos ... to ... to\n... voyage he paid tribute to this man who was\nSeeing all of the processes of truth and justice that unfolded in Brazil he said the following to pay tribute to someone who brought Tara to president Dilma Rousseff person who is capable of doing an impeachment proceeding\nTo justifies voted in this manner is a person who sells hatred he's spreads hatred because he only understands one language the language of violence\nThat's dealing with chef the former Brazilian precedent tuition peach I was speaking to her when she was at University of California Berkeley and many of the way some men don't say she describes both NATO if you can talk more about both not us history and what exactly he represents\nYeah have represents a a a set the ... the military and that's a\nIt's openly fascist like I said before it talks about raping women openly\nHas said that he'd rather have a dance than than on gay son they praising the military dictatorship his his head than he would\nGive a a\nA ... a\n... shouldn't be free to kill so it's a\nVery go to him and his own words of a two thousand Thirteen interview with then while he was congressmen ... on BBC\nAnd throwing out some way to go to I went to the battle with the gays because the government proposed anti homophobia classes for the junior grades knew\nThey wanted us to do with the actor we stimulate homosexuality and children from six years old this is not normal\nLost your culture is different to ours we're not ready for all of this Brazil has no father would ever take pride in your case on pride happiness celebrate if his son turns out gay no way\nSo if it turns okay no way\nThat they are both in the front runner in Brazil also as you said said I'm told a congresswoman Chu was too ugly to rate\nThe exact and yeah so yeah we what happens now is that is a lot of a media manipulation\nA scenes thing pitchmen of president ... years ago that is constant attacks song that the tea on the workers' party a\nIt was almost like all mainstream meeting or is it was like Fox News that is no alternative and uh also now during the campaign I'm both an avid starts at a ... a company of fake news especially on what's sad that it's not controlled\nFor example Facebook has a closed several accounts that were spreading fake news and dance for ... in against a candidate for vice president ... uh\nSo you know also Steve Bannon is one of them be advisors for both on that so that is a lot of misinformation and manipulation\nIn August ... posted a photo on Twitter of him with former Trump strategist Steve Bannon\nEduardo ... auto wrote quote it was a pleasure to meet Steve Bannon strategist in Donald Trump's presidential campaign we had a great conversation and we share the same worldview and we're certainly in touch to join forces especially against cultural Marxism and the significance of what Edward o himself Joe your son\nYes exactly and uh\nWell I think that they'd solves things for them to understand that to the meeting Brazil was portraying for them but that said the progressive candidate as far left but when he was the mayor of some follow actually what he did the was a he\nHe was the mayor of some follow actually what he did was uh\nHe built a several daycares and more than thirty hospitals and uh he tried to make the traffic and to see the batter\nFor example have the infrastructure for bikes\nWhen he was a ministry of education under the Lula administration is he created more than a chain new federal university is more than three hound during new um campuses university campuses and there was much more um incentive and a\nFellow ships for ah education at all levels so you know he comes from an educational backgrounds\nAnd that it's a you know he doesn't come from any type of uh extreme laughed background and so what what we have now is a very extreme fascist candidates\nRunning against a moderate candidates that are in our hope now is that to treat all the candidates progressive candidates have said then they would support and under dads and now in the runoff elections in a few weeks so hopefully the known between now and then uh\nThey think you're going to make up the difference and then the run off\nI think so because those progressive punted this to gather will probably get about twenty percent of the votes and ah if they are able to convince people that that this is a dangerous path and that the challenge is how do we\nDeal with ... and not just mainstream media but the ... the manipulation of social media\nI wanted to go to Noam Chomsky who just recently went to Brazil um he met with ... ...\nTrump ski who just recently went to Brazil um he met with ... in prison and when he came out a Chomsky condemned Brazil's right wing media\nSo can you talk about what the us is facing right now this monster hurricane hitting the panhandle if you look at um ...\nWeather reports and the networks are you know at the time like this increasingly take up more and more news time either weather reports because whether we're talking about wildfires in California or the monster storms\nOr in the Carolinas and now possibly hitting Florida and Alabama\nStir storms or in the Carolinas and now possibly hitting Florida and Alabama Alabama it's the whole state has been called the state of emergency um\n... there is\nAlmost no mention by meteorologists and I'm not talking even Fox I'm Talking MSNBC and CNN CNN of the connection between these increasingly violent storms and climate change is there one and can you explain it\nWhether it's certainly is a connection and what we what we haven't done ... into the atmosphere is what made the atmosphere warmer in other words you put a lot more energy in the atmosphere\nThat energy move play out in terms of a whole suite of different more extreme weather conditions that whether this particular publication is um it's caused by climate change is impossible to say ... is often the cases that we are exhausted by to increasing the the power in these how Africans in these extreme weather events\nOn the ... what we call the funds that was actually a beautician\nWhere we're trying to say is this event a climate change if we're getting better with the understanding that uncertainty of his quarterly loss of evidence now this year that some of them will recent severe weather conditions were saying how being seriously exacerbated by the additional warming we're putting the atmosphere from a burning of fossil fuels and the release of calm dogs on\nThe wall so I Can't comment on this particular topic and it's like this how it can was caused by climate change\nOr you know the severity of is how we can and this is a very through some of the other events that we've seen in recent years certainly um has been exacerbated by issues of climate change by a burning of fossil fuels\n... enemy joined this should be making that clear link when they make them into discussing these issues and during during the weather forecast within the u._s.\nYou talk about what's needed professor Anderson the report says there's no documented his star precedent for the scale of changes required um ...\nPrecedent for the scale of change as required um you have talked about a Marshall Plan what do you mean a new Marshall Plan\n... well the Marshall Plan was the um the the to deliberate strategy after the second World War to trying to reconstruct Europe after being nosy very severely bones and destroyed\nAnd both institutionally but mostly physically during the war so I'm saying that that is probably the newest metaphor analogy we have a scale of challenge that we should be face\nTo the compromise to shift away from the fossil fuel based energy system to zero carbon energy system and to do that within within the wealthy parts of the world really within about two decades I'm probably three or four enough that guy with a slightly poorer parts of the world so we're not going to do that through\nA small price mechanisms through just tweaking the market is going to be ...\nTo change it intervention by government to make the necessary rates of change now that sounds initially very I'm very challenging and suddenly will be but I think there was also ...\nAnd there was a positive narrative behind this and that this this transition this transformation to zero Kelvin and uses them will come with some job opportunities are long term secure job opportunities\nNot just in building a low carbon power stations but in the massive electrification program that will be necessary\nIn retrofitting in other words making our existing building infrastructure which when we'll still be using for the next twenty thirty forty years to make that building infrastructure is suitable for the twenty first century so he require much less anything it was a cool it\nAnd and this is a safer environment to be in the climate continues to change which is undoubtedly will um ... even if we stopped emissions today what we're seeing some ongoing climate change\nYou have criticized the eyepiece stay safe for us\nClimate change\nYou have criticized the I. P. C. C. four constraining its policy advice to fit neatly within the current economic model can you explain I mean for some kind of a landmark report like this is simply critical because we live in a country in the United states where the president proudly\nDeny its climate change you know calls it a client at Chinese hoax\nOn and so had any kind of report like this but you were a critic of the report in some respects\nCertainly well so I think is a really good report and joined to understand the impacts between one point five and two degrees centigrade of warming when it comes to what we have to do about it I think again it it runs skate a really being very honest\nAnd given that how it is effectively a scientific report I think our role with a scientist as academics is to\nTell it like it is not to color it's all sweetened the pill to make it more attractive to\nMy comments have all but I mean it's not just for this report Ajmi repeatedly come up with the PC to was way coin direct and honest about the impact side when it comes to what we have to do about it we ... we don't want to scare the politicians or the public we don't want to um\nMove away from the store the energy systems that we have today so we always try to bully bullies massage the status quo incremental changes if you're like what I'm saying is that actually when you really look at the numbers behind the report look at the numbers the science comes out with then we're talking about\nA complete revolution and the energy system and that is going to be very fundamental questions about how we run our economies\nAnd again you can to him I said well not seen as just as you know ... to ... to remove the current economic system we have we have to remember so many being was ten years now since the banking crisis and many parts of the world are still suffering the repercussions without finding cautious to the current economic framework has struggled\nSuffering the repercussions of that ... to the current economic framework has struggled and within his own remiss if you like do I think this has been a real opportunity which will not losing to reshape the economy there was an economy that suitable for society not sound like the suitable for the economy\nAnd I think the policy make the academics I'm just runs scared of this\nOf being honest about ... on numbers tell us\nAbout the rates of change that we will we require and how we have to move\nThe productive capacity of our society from building second homes for professors or private jet so private your so large four wheel drive cars moving from that to building public transport electrification improved homes but everyone does it just shifted that productive capacity the resources and the labor\nFrom the if you like the luxury for the twenty percent\nTo be essential low carbon infrastructure order this\nDr Anderson the effect of Trump pulling the U.S out of the Paris Agreement we just had a segment on Brazil the front runner ... who are gas called uh open fascist a extremely far right wing candidate\nUm has promised um that he will pull out of the Paris Agreement as well and would abolish Brazil's ministry of environment\nOr which environmentalist fairly late to deforestation has the Amazon your thoughts on both both NATO and Trump\nWell there are\nPlenty from a scientific perspective and I would always argue probably from mold perspective they all completely 'em out to chew with walked on now says is saying\nOh it was so we have to be very careful when we see these extreme figures on both of these I think of a sudden the extreme figures we have to remember the day off a little bit of noise on the system the the the the general trend line is more recognition to climate change is a serious issue even the poll data in the states shows they so I'm not seeing like different Brazil so I'm not sure\nBut we so we are seeing climate change advancing people\nSo I'm not seeing like different Brazil so I'm not sure but so we are seeing climate change advancing people off thinking this is an important issue\nBecause some of 'em I'm not always the brightest people who are leading our country's I'm kind of understand that all the things that they have a political fights they have to appeal to who doesn't do not want to hear that message\nAnd I think the rest of us should not scared of them we just have to double redouble our efforts and then the wing and President Trump decided to put out the Paris Agreement which of course he can't do it anyway but has plans to and the Chinese and the French step forward and say well we will try and do some make some extra effort to compensate\nAnd we also said the U.S many ... sang the climate change is still an important issue\nTo the U.S has nothing to do is not a dictatorship ... cannot take tight ... population of the U.S and it's going to do of course ... both an uneasy influential but so all the ... so it is incumbent on the rest of us there were more informed by the science and I would argue with a more reasoned mode and progressive or by groundswell analysis\nAnd it's up to us to wind up all our efforts and make sure that we move and the right direction and not to run the scared\nOf of the Trump service well there are plenty of them they will come and they will go but the overall issue of climate change the physics of climate change is here to stay regardless of the time frame who wins over the occasional presidents\nAnd in the last minute what\nDoes the future look like a how bad can and things get if we proceed on this course\n\nOf the way things are going at the moment I think it is quite reasonable to think we're heading about four degrees centigrade warming across the century that would be off the devastating just remember the difference between now and an ice ages about five degrees\nSo we're talking about changes that would normally occur over probably tens of thousands of years a little more than a hundred years and and the Hundred Years' in some respects sounds like a long time but many of the people listened to this\nIs and and the Hundred Years' in some respects sounds like a long time but many of the people listening to this that children will still be alive and hundred years and certainly the grandchildren will be on the news is just to move I really and so many respects and when the world wildlife looks in infrastructure and what would the ... we will be saying from a family and from a famine drought", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "city": "Attleboro", "day":

talk about what happens on on Wednesday and something that was not paid very much attention to all around the country\nOn first ad Bush's apparent attempt to get into a predominantly black church then going over to kroger's the grocery store\nYes thank you for having us on the show um Wednesday was a very somber day somewhere a little bit for three o'clock I'm all of us was in the office of the mayor's office and I'm One of our colleagues are we heard a scream\nAnd she was on the phone and and she was talking with someone and we really didn't know what had happened at that point\nUm and then as time to continue to proceed we discovered that there was a possibility of a ... there was shooting and it was a possibility there was a family member not really understanding and knowing what had happened uh with ... brand I went out to the location we had several members of our team there\nAnd we later discovered a that Kelly watch the news the cheap equity officer um in metro Denver Louisville metro government or that it was her father\nAh Mari style or who had been murdered\n'em and another loan another woman had been murdered in the parking lot\nI was a horrific day a sad day and we're continuing to grieve through this process\nBut one of the exciting things is that we're very resilient city and we've been working on some things in terms of out of Kelly's office or as the cheap equity officer in terms of looking at these very types of issues [noise]\nWell I I wanted to ask a representative Adam Scott in terms of the the reaction of some public officials are are in the area about whether this was uh\nShouldn't have some public officials are are in the area about whether this was a hate crime or not or could you talk about that and the judgment that people did or didn't go through a very uh soon after this uh this crime occurred\nDefinitely and when something like this happens entire community grieve and his anxious and is stressed out and\nOften look to elected leaders to provide some direction and guidance and in this situation we are as an African American community or failed by many of our elected officials who refused\nTo call this what it was which is a hate crime and when you kill to black people miss Jones and ... and you try to break into a black church that's a hate crime and to have people at the local and state level she use even call it a hate crime sends a message to many of us in community\nThat our lives do not indeed matter to some people and we shouldn't have to beg you to call this what it is\n... we hope to have mayor Greg Fischer on he had to back out late last night but Reverend pension change do you work for the Mayor Tom can you talk about here um can you talk about that and whether there is why the mayor didn't immediately call it a hate crime\nI can share with you the mayor did come out and say that it was a hate crime you talked about the fact that uh the situation was driven by hate when you think about and I have the privilege of past year and a local African American church in ... in the city\nAnd understanding in terms of what the community needs and and then they're hurt that a community goes through and they experienced this\nAnd just recently on yesterday a mayor Greg Fischer and several local pastors and faith leaders in our community sat down and talk with the commonwealth attorney Tom wine and talked about this very issue of a hate crime is horrendous hate crime and\nVery issue of a hate crime is horrendous hate crime and mayor Fischer acknowledged that he had dinner fight with it and he agrees with the community and the families and so he's very aware and very in tune and we've been working on these issues of for the past several years\nAre working with gear or government our lives for racial equity and putting together racial equity plans in terms of our community\nOne of our um tenets in terms of when we think about our community is a very compassionate community\nSo our mayors heart was greed he's anger but also we're going to move into action we've put in action plans and we working with community leaders to begin to look at how this can never happen again in our community how do we avoid these types of things\nAnd so as a community we're very resilient were very focused and we have a plan in place to be able to execute that this won't happen again [noise]\nUh well a representative Scott I Want to see if you are if you agree with the assessment of Reverend James and also if you could talk about this whole issue of the the blue lives matter legislation that went through the\nUh the legislature\nWe have to make sure that um we had on his conversations about what got us here and when we have a political system that passes hateful legislation when we have\nA societal I issues around comments that are made whether you're calling young black kids pumps that dogs or whether you're passing legislation like the blue lives matter building\nAnd changing Kentucky's hate crimes\nLaw to now including your profession what you choose to do or if you are first respond including law enforcement or that sends a clear message across Kentucky about who's last really do matter and then this year passing a so called gang bill that we saw in Mississippi and eight years\nThis year passing a so called gang bill that we saw in Mississippi in the eight years since it's been passed it only black people have received and enhanced sentence from that gang bill to support it and then pass that bill here in Kentucky\nSends a message across our black communities and other communities of color that you are under attack by her own elected officials at the local and state level and we have to have those conversations that say wait a minute what are we doing to make sure that we're looking\nTo restore people to their fullness rather than to incarcerate them so that we can justify building more prisons\nAnd I wanted to I'm correct we had said the St Louis police chief but it's the Jefferson town police chief Sam Rogers I'm a ... we had said the ... police chief but the Jefferson town police chief Sam Rogers who\nI'm told the first Baptist church on Sunday that the shooting was motivated by racism was a hate crime um can you talk I'm Reverend James about\nUh the feelings right now and inside the church that Bush apparently tried to get into your the Reverend of another church uh how\nChurches are yelling right now um and also this being\nThe one\nOf a series of attacks this week I mean you have this man allegedly saying\nUm to a white man standing outside with a gun outside kroger's whites don't kill whites like saying don't kill me I'm or he's not going to kill him\nAnd then you have the um letter bombs ... now apparently Fifteen of them sent out to people who are critics of President Trump and then of course the horrific\nUm synagogue a massacre that took place added another place of worship in Pittsburgh the funerals beginning today with the\nUm anti Semitic shooter who\nWent dead on an anti Semitic shooter who also linked um and Jewish groups helping immigrants and his fierce anti immigrant a hatred\nIs is it's it's a very sad time in our country and when we have these types of acts of hatred in our communities and in our churches and synagogues\nAnd mosque when you think about all that has taken place across the country but one of the things\nThat people of faith recognize the fact that these challenges are written in the holy word that these things were to come and so one of the things in terms of what we find and what we see as faith leaders ask community leaders\nIs that it is our faith that really drives us beyond and what we see and what we experience to hope\nThat we know that with people coming together and staying together that we can change we have to realize and know that we ... this is not a time to turn on each other but it's a time to turn to each other\nAnd so what I've seen across the faith community talking with all kinds of faith leaders across our city and across this country is the fact that we have a a reality that we have to look at it and confront when we talk about hatred when we talk about the rhetoric that is coming from our ministry ration all these types of things\nThat we as a people of faith have to rise above it and take action you know the reality is is that it it takes us as a people to recognize what is going on and then we have to go to the polls next week is going to be a very critical time\nFor our country that we need to send a message that this type of behavior this type of situation that happened in in Pittsburgh that happened in Louisville is totally unacceptable and we're going to change and the way that you change that is going to the polls and sort of remedy is rising above uh-huh\nRodman James I want to ask you in a in the same vein for the President Trump\nReverend James I wanted to ask you in a in the same vein for the President Trump or a after the attack\nOn the synagogue in Pittsburgh said that perhaps armed guards were needed at places of worship or he said similar things after the Parkland shooting that are that are armed guards or the arming of teacher she he ... he suggested must have been under the arming of teachers what's your response to this idea\nThat maybe a houses of worship should now have armed guards as a means of protecting themselves\nI don't believe that houses with say our schools need to have armed guards you know that that's not why we attend church we attend church to be able to connect with our God and to be able to realize that our faith protects us and even when challenges come against us\nForm for many of these are extremists orders you to comment on that\nAbsolutely true that social media and online spaces have been become really crucial places for radicalization and but it's also important to realize that these social media platforms are tools that white supremacists are using to try to recruit and radicalized people it's not the sort of hate sort of\nMysteriously blossoming these are organized white supremacist activists\nSort of hatred of mysteriously blossoming these are organized white supremacist activists were trying to exploit platforms and use them to connect with people use them to find new followers and and so\nWe can't look at this was sort of just the abroad problem of how do we fix social media how do we fix Instagram how to fix Twitter I think it's important to really narrow the question and say I'm Twitter Instagram Facebook are being exploited by hostile actors and by terrorists\nTo recruit people who will commit violence how do we focused on that particular problem and how do we how do these companies take particular responsibility for white supremacist terror and how those terrorists are using their platforms\nThe Robert ... hours account on ... breed posted another user who wrote open your eyes it's the filthy evil Jews bringing the filthy evil Muslims into the country um\nIf you can talk about um his link Bowers link a white supremacist link\nBetween Jews and Jewish groups were about to speak to representative of highest he particularly focused on this issue\nThat a refugee I'm I'm resettlement organization was bringing what he called the invaders and I'm a Brian ... of CNN just looked at um a Fox News and other right wing outlets and saying the level of\nUm times that they are talking about invaders just in the last few weeks has so escalated\nAnd Bowers himself said I like the way they're changing the language of aliens illegal aliens to invaders and it's this link of immigration as President Trump now even if she goes to Pittsburgh tries to divert attention\nAnd as President Trump now even if she goes to Pittsburgh tries to divert attention to the border sending saying he's sending the fifty two hundred soldiers to the border shown on the border there'll be more soldiers than in Iraq and Afghanistan\nOn sending more than fifty two hundred um soldiers to the border um and also saying he plans to through executive order and the birthright citizenship\nI mean you're\nPulling all of these incredibly troubling threads together and it's really important to recognize that the attack of on the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh was an attack on Jewish people and\nThe ... areas of the people who died are just heart wrenching but an attack on Jewish people for supporting refugees an attack specifically targeted at an organization that was helping a has a she bought ceremonies in honor of supporting refugees and\nAnd drawing on the Jewish history of persecution or\nEmphasize how important it is that people who are fleeing violence in terror elsewhere in the world that we have the capacity to welcome them and give them a safe place them that that is a moral duty ...\nAnd in talking to a representative for highest the particular a refugee organization and that the shooter named and that he said if you will to his rage that he shared a link\nTo a synagogue that were hosting these kinds of events you know she said that there are still wrestling with what it means to be targeted with violence particularly for fighting for this basic humanity for treating other people with basic humanity and that is what is so incredibly tragic here uh\nThat this congregation and these people were targeted at because of their humanitarian impulses because of support for Jews for refugees for people of color\nFor refugees for people of color\nWas over Wyoming\nWill do the Anti Defamation league has found that anti Semitic incidents in the U.S rose by fifty seven percent in two thousand Seventeen the largest single year increased\nSince it started recording such statistics\nI'm Wondering if you or your strength and this is of course not an isolated situation here in the United states so there's been a rise in anti Semitic incidents across Europe as well uh I'm Wondering if you could uh uh uh talk about the context in which is is a current as more and more\nOf a right wing governments are coming to power all across the industrial world and even in in many parts of Asia and Latin America as well\nSo obviously the context of rising anti Semitism is very disturbing\nAnd what was particularly striking about Robert Bowers the Pittsburgh shooter is it and looking at his on line a profile on gap and the post that he made it was clear that he was channeling a lot of very ancient anti Semitism but a lot of the ropes and the hatred that he was sharing a\nAre very are centuries old but this is not a new phenomenon and the anti Semitic violence\nAnd it's a very old and a very dangerous ideology but Robert powers was also someone\nWho was actively in communication with other white supremacists someone who was very familiar with the events of Charlottesville where white supremacist groups marched through university town with torches Santa chanting Jews will not replace us\nAnd some of the statements that he made on his account suggests that he was familiar with those debates about what people who are white supremacy in America should do the optics and different kinds of action what's going to be most effective\nUh for advancing his white supremacist beliefs\nThe kinds of action what's going to be most effective uh for advancing his white supremacist beliefs again this belief in an all white country that the United states is only a country for white people that other people should be shut out or don't belong here or shouldn't be allowed to have citizenship\nSo that you saw him on this platform interacting including interacting with other white supremacist activist I spoke to one activist who's an anti fascist from Charlottesville who says that she constantly monitors gab\nFor the harassment of white supremacists and she actually got some of these Robert Bauer posts um but they she passed them by she saw them she had screen shots of a couple of them but the kind of hatred that he was doing was silk comment on this platform that there were so many dozens and hundreds of men sharing equally extreme\nRacist propaganda that nothing about what he had said has stood out to her\nThat this was someone who had apparently harassed her directly directly is I'm a massage in his ticket nasty comments and then appear to go on to commit mass murder at a Jewish synagogue and she said she's still wrestling with it because what he said on that platform the kind of hate that he was expressing was so common\nThat it didn't stand out it didn't seem exceptional\nBurden I or do do do a speaking I'm about what happened on Saturday ah the synagogue attacked the darkest days Pittsburgh's history but said armed guards are not the solution\nSeems to be a place that we need to be looking at is how we choose the guns which is the common denominator is every mass shootings in America ... grocery truth drew murder\nSo that's there to do he also said that President Trump or should not come today to Pittsburgh\nYou also said that President Trump or should not come today to Pittsburgh but they are busy burying the dead this is President Trump right after the massacre talking about armed guards\nProduction in size of the results would have been\nLoser will always or social spread but\nSome kind of a production moves to jump all\nMaybe you should have been very much difference to Georgia\nHe was able to do things for for Jewish or the will to do it here the boys were outstanding players of pollution in front of a job but as you know\nNumerous solutions and we're just\nSo that was President Trump calling for armed guards in the synagogues um\nLowest Beckett if you could talk about this and also I mean as we're talking about this violence you have\nUm grad Bush or in the Louisville area and Jefferson town I she has a numerous weapons are not clear whether he had some legally he had to hand them over because of his violent background again so often we see the links to domestic violence in their past\nBut why these men are able to have these guns course Bowers used in a are Fifteen\nThese Lincoln just to violence and in this might you might think of as a stretch but because you are a guardian reporter I'm thinking about your colleague Ben Jacobs um who is body slammed by the Montana Congress member to plead guilty to criminal assaults and why I'm bringing that up now is President Trump just last\nWeek on held a rally in Montana where he applauded a June fourth day for bodies slamming your colleague at\nA June fourth day for bodies slamming your colleague at\nThe guardian this in the midst of\nUm uh the investigation into the murder of a drum all ... with President

all of us are\nWell for more we're joined by ... he was a freshman at the all male Georgetown Prep high school when Brett Kavanaugh was a senior\nAfter having us testimony Thursday bar bow coauthored the petition calling on fellow graduates to come forward if they had any information about any sexual assaults possibly committed by the Supreme Court nominee ... joining us by phone from the Washington DC area\nBill welcome to democracy now can you talk about why you started this petition and how many people have signed on so far\nUh yeah I was um we were first moved to to do this um because we felt that it was stunning to me that we as a community I Believe\nNo so much about what was going on during the eighties and the ... party culture um and that there were many graduates with the class of eighty three who were close to Brett\nBut who have not shown their faces they've not they've not spoken out about what was going on either in his defense or a doctor for defense um and so I I was stunned by that violence than felt we have to try to do something to\nTo shake my classmates and my schoolmates up and get them to think this is an opportunity for you to do the right thing and if it if if our little position in our drive to get them to speak um gets even one of them to say something that I I feel it's been a success\nDrive to get them to speak um gets even one of them to say something that I I feel it's been a success\nAnd ... are you were a freshman all when Brett Kavanaugh was a senior at their school or did you uh how well did you know him and when you were to saw the testimony how does that jibe with your recollections of what he was like\nWell I didn't know Brett personally and I think it's important to note that I I don't consider myself a witness in this case in any way shape or form again I was a freshman and he was a senior he was a very big personality on campus he was a I'm a\nFootball player he was kept on the basketball team it was hard in a roughly four hundred person school not to know who the real social leaders were um even as a freshman um\nSo I knew him and his crew more by reputation than personal observation um however it just struck me during his testimony that given what I Know about perhaps party culture in the eighties um and knowing that he\nBragged openly on his ... page about his participation in that party culture\nThat he would rule out categorically the possibility that something untoward or downright illegal could have happened when he was under the influence of alcohol and that just felt wrong to me and um I I Know that there are\nThere must be people who are closer to him closer in age enclosure and in social commitment ... that have to know more about what was going on and I think we've been seeing that from his classmates and I would like to see that from his\nPrep class in Nineteen Ninety the Washington Post reported that had masters from seven prestigious Washington DC area private schools including yours Georgetown prepping Kavanaugh's at St ladder to warn parents had a party culture among their children\nHad sent a letter to warn parents about a party culture among their children which included heavy drinking leading to quote sexual or violent behavior\nThe article quotes headmaster at Holton arms saying quote a number of parents and kids have expressed dismay over some of the situations that we can parties were concerned about the potential for tragedy\nAbout can you respond to that on yeah I unfortunately\nIt wasn't a millionaire with that article when it was printed in in Nineteen Ninety I that was when I was graduating from college but what I read yesterday when it was first forwarded to me I'm\nShocked me in in some way because it was an acknowledgement on the part of the administrations of the schools that we all went to that there was a severe problem and it was a severe problem um but what is what a shocking and upsetting to me is that as I understand it not much institutionally\nHas been done to really put a stop to it and I know that there is a very very steep hill to climb for educators in managing teenage kids um I Know that as as a parent of a teenager myself my son's Seventeen um it's not easy for parents to get involved but I just feel like\nWow that was a long time ago and we're still fighting the same battle with underage drinking and drug use with um a a a culture of party culture that seems to be accepting of\nIllegal behavior and dangerous behavior\nUm and I just wish that there was something more that that we could have done and the the twenty eight years plus that had transpired since um since that letter came out\nYou have a close to Seventy names on this letter that you knew issue what do you hope to do with with it and what are you a hope are all the people who signed a petition are willing to go public with their names\nAll the people who signed a petition are willing to go public with their names are\nWell it's it's closer to a hundred now actually didn't look at the number of this morning I should have it's it's been growing since I'm we release it on Saturday which um is probably a tricky day to try to get people to pay attention to it but since we started to get some news coverage on it I'm a we've been getting more and more signatories um and we've been very judicious with uh how we're going to proceed because\nThere are a number of folks who signed who for various reasons such as they are employed by the federal government\nCan't have their names released publicly um but did they did find it in that they wanted to indicate support so we're having to be very thoughtful and we're contacting everyone individually to make sure that they are aware that we intend to go public with their name make sure that they are they say they are and that we didn't end up with some fall centuries [noise]\n[noise] um but the concern that I have right now is that I'm not all that sure how interested the FBI is in our list um they have their hands full and that's what is so\nUrgent about the situation to me is a week is not very much time for the FBI to conduct a very thorough investigation um they have to\nIdentify locate an interview a lot of people if they really want to get to the bottom of this um so they may have their hands full which leads me to believe that the press um maybe a more\nA effective way to get the word out and to get our letter to see the light of day and for then\nFellow prop alumni to take the action of saying you know what I Do have a story and I do think it's important that it'd be heard [noise]\nI'm barb oh you said in an interview with the Washingtonian consent is a concept did not even exist it was not in our lexicon at Georgetown ...\nExplain well I\nOur lexicon at Georgetown ...\nExplain\nI feel culturally it's important to recognize that the eighties we're a very different time and place for the country at large I'm not just in in private schools private boys' schools um everywhere\nWe weren't talking a whole lot about the sexual dynamic between boys and girls at the high school level it just wasn't part of the conversation when you compound that by\nHaving an all boys private school that's Catholic um the likelihood of meaningful conversations between administrators between parents and kids I'm coming up to try to recognize the fact that\nBeen adequate investigation and judge Kavanaugh's testimony at the hearing lead us to doubt judge Kavanaugh's fitness to serve and an associate justice of the Supreme Court\nAs a nonpartisan organization the ACLU does not oppose judge cabinet are based on predictions about how he would vote as a justice we oppose him in light of the credible allegations of sexual assault against him on\nHeels of the announcement the ACLU launched a million dollar ad campaign across four states\nIf you launched a million dollar ad campaign across four states urging key swing votes senators to vote against Kavanaugh's confirmation said targets Colorado Republican Sen Cory Gardner\nWe've seen this before denials from our firm in\nTheir\nLives she lives in\nA categorical on a naive you know should we do ...\nAmerica is watching and as we choose a lifetime seat on our highest court integrity matters and we cannot have any doubt\nSenator Gardner posed the confirmation of judge Kavanaugh\nSimilar ACLU as a dress Nebraska Senator Deb Fischer West Virginia's Joe mansion and Shelley Moore Capito interestingly she went to a whole an arms as Dr Ford\nUh Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski and senator Dan Sullivan urging them to vote no on Kavanaugh\nThe last time the ACLU publicly opposed a Supreme Court nominee was over a decade ago in two thousand six when George W. Bush nominated Justice Samuel Alito\nIn Nineteen eighty seven the ACLU opposed president Ronald Reagan's nomination of justice Robert Bork and in Seventy one at a police president Richard Nixon's domination of justice William Rehnquist\nWell for more we're joined by Louis smelling deputy legal director at the ACLU and director of the center for liberty which encompasses the ACLU is work on reproductive freedom women's rights lesbian gay bisexual transgender rights freedom of religion and belief and disability rights welcome to democracy now the ways so talk about the change of heart we just had David Cole on\nWhen the Kavanaugh noun Smith was made he said we cannot take a stand up\nSo um I Would say in brief extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures as as you talked about before\nI Would say and brief extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures as as you talked about before we didn't have post judge Kavanaugh when he was first nominated we didn't pose as the proceedings went forward we issued a report talking about his record we raise concerns about his civil liberties record in certain areas\nBut but we adhere to our long standing policy but now in light of the sexual assault allegations we have come out to a post judge Kavanaugh believing that those raise serious questions that are fundamentally different they were serious questions about the integrity of the court should he be non should he be on the court\nWhat are the well I'm a point to the code of judicial conduct the cutter judicial conduct talks about the importance of a judge behaving in a way that inspires public confidence in the integrity and the impartiality of of the court\nAnd when we look at judge Kavanaugh's record in these proceedings or what's come out he's not behaving in a manner that will\nAdvance the public confidence in the integrity I Would point to we have credible allegations of sexual assault\nWe have a judge who has resisted calling for a full investigation what we would think of as\nAs central to any any fair proceedings and we have a judge who now in the hearings last Thursday talk to about the allegations as a political hit and as a political hit in response to pay back I Believe was his word for Trump and for Clinton that's\nThat that speaks more of a partisan than a judicial temperament\nAre ones that are asked about that because\nThe hearing was really stunning in terms of the the damages the judge government do to himself and his testimony in terms of the belligerence\nA show to the members of the Senate and also the um the lack of would you buy or judicial restraint though in the way you approached the questions that we're talking about him I'm Wondering to what degree those years really galvanized\nThe questions that we're talking about him I'm Wondering to what degree those hearings really galvanized the on the board or to make this decision the show you\nOn the board was was considering seriously the allegations of sexual assault and attempted rape the board met after the hearing so that the board could have a chance to hear the witnesses as such as we had it\nUm we like others of share concerns about what kinds of investigation there is how robust the hearing is and whether there's a fair chance for both of them to tell their stories robustly um and in light of of the allegations and as Susan Herman statement says in light of the allegations in light of the hearings we came out to oppose\nAnd a decision to launch an ad campaign in the same time\nWell the decision to launch that campaign of course followed the board's position the boards those that we would oppose but now that we are opposing it's incredibly important that we stand up it's incredibly important that we stand up because of the message\nThat the any confirmation of judge Kavanaugh would send to sexual assault survivors it's important that we stand up given what this would say about the integrity of the ... I Can't\nReiterate enough how important it is that we believe in our in our systems into believing the court requires us to believe that people are being human or working as hard as they can to be impartial unfair\nSo let's go to a judge Brett Kavanaugh is giving his opening statement Thursday\nThis whole effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political fueled with a parent pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election fear that has been unfairly stoked\nAbout more judicial record revenge on behalf of the coins and millions of dollars and money from outside left wing opposition groups\nFish is a circus and talked about the Clinton conspiracy is\nThis is a circus\nAnd talked about the Clinton conspiracy et cetera the million spent ... left wing groups he talked about left wing conspiracies his rage was almost an contained now does this mean that progressive groups that go the before the Supreme Court should ask\nHim to recuse himself I mean the fact that matters right wing groups have also spent millions of dollars she has not raising that\n[noise] um I think I Would lead to another day questions are for a cute little but I Will say that we had a lot of conversation about it we the public can and discourse around nominations about how they become so partisan what we saw here was the nominee himself engaging in in partisan conduct and I think your question\nOf course raises for us I'm a serious question about how well the public perceives a decision that comes out against a group like Planned Parenthood the N. double ACP for example groups that have been opposing cabinet how will how will we assess the fairness and stand by the fairness of a decision\nThat affects you know quote democratic opponents close quote that might run to political gerrymandering our campaign finance or the census again this is about\nHow important it is for judges to really conduct themselves in a way that gives us confidence that they're doing everything they can to be impartial as they hear cases before the\nWar to nursery NBC News is reporting that there are some text messages a suggestive recover and I reached out to a ...\nTo try to refute Deborah Ramirez is sexual assault ... before it became public are there any ... if that's true and it concerns there about his conduct a leading up to the hearings\nI certainly think you know that\nIt's incredibly important that we have had a here that we have a hearing and that we have a full investigation and a full investigation seems important both for the integrity\nDuring that we have a full investigation and a full investigation seems important both for the integrity of the opportunity for judge Kavanaugh to clear his name should that be the case\nFor Dr Blasey Ford's allegations to be robustly hurt and tested and for the public to have confidence confidence in Canada is our as I said this is too important we can have no doubt\nSo it's important for an investigation an investigation to look for the facts and to test the veracity of of the statements that have made\nI wanted to switch the gear in the last\nMinute we have with you and that is the ACLU involvement with the migrant children should the New York times reporting the Trump Administration\nHas begun transferring detained migrant children from shelters across the country to a barren tent city in West Texas the times reports hundreds of children being sent each week from shelters to the center city which currently houses sixteen hundred children ... he reportedly as new school children have limited\nAccess to legal services the U.

Garcia Marquez without the hyphen then that registration is kicked out and it's put in this kind of limbo status and because\nUm things like a a hyphen or accent mark or a Y. instead of an eye those kinds of things immediately began to go after the names um for African Americans\nFor Hispanics and for Asians this is why you're seeing that kind of dissed proportional disproportionate um\nElimination of these registration cards it's it's it's as pernicious as Kris Kobach cross check\nThis whole issue of having one of the candidates for the she also be in charge of oversee the election process uh could you talk about that as well\nYes and so I imagine this year you're playing a game where you're trying to win but you're also the referee and so you get to choose when a foul has been called anybody wouldn't look at that\nAnd so you get to choose when a foul has been called anybody would look at that and say wait a minute that game is cute\nAnd that's what's happening here integrity wouldn't require Brian Kemp to recuse himself to step down as secretary of state in this kind of high profile election instead he has not and so we see things going on like prior to this\nWe had the ... they're trying to shut down the polling places in a majority or\nA majority African American counties or counties that had sizable black population so like in Randolph county um where one of camps allies try to you know recommended that seven of nine polling stations shut down\nBefore the general election I mean that kind of interference that kind of skewed\nI'm I'm a decision making\nIs what is what Stacey Abrams is talking about when she says that it is calling into question the legitimacy of the election is calling into question legitimacy of our electoral process seats and so a secretary of state\nThat is the bedrock foundation of his role is to ensure the integrity of the election process sitting on top of this one undermines that\nBrian kept the secretary of state and the Republican candidate for governor ... Sunday my opponent is unapologetically extreme she's banking on illegal immigrants to secure a victory for her at the ballot box professor oh\nAnd and so that is campus so much like Kris Kobach out of Kansas I'm you know Kobach has been writing that lie of um non citizens voting in math I'm skewing\nOf um non citizens voting in math I'm skewing the elections in Kansas and only he can block them\nAnd so and by raising the flag of illegal immigrants it is playing to a racist trope um that's in the body politic that these immigrants are going to somehow steal our elections\nBut he cannot point to note stay the same way that Kris Kobach could not point to all of these illegal immigrants um it is a fiction it is a lie it is a myth that as being used\nTo stir up fear to justify the kind of unwarranted voter suppression techniques that the secretaries of state like Brian camp and Kris Kobach are using\nI'd like to go back to this whole issue of will do the closing of polling places most people who really don't pay attention to what happens in polling places all of them there's\nA and cause you talk about the impact on voter turnout or more of a sudden or either closings of all places or shifting a ... vote in places from one location to another just before an election\nAbsolutely I'm so one of the things to to pay attention to is that after the Supreme Court got at the voting rights act with the Shelby County the hold her decision in twenty Thirteen\nBy the time we got to the twenty sixteen election states that had been under pre clearance and that is where because of their history of racial discrimination at the polls they had to have all of their voting rights voting changes may or approved by the department of justice\nAfter the voting rights was got it\nA hundred and sixty a polling places were shutting down by the time we got to the twenty sixteen election Brian ...\nBowling places where shutting down by the time we got to the twenty sixteen election Brian camp has been responsible for two hundred and fourteen of those polling place as being shut down\nWhat the research shows is that for every tenth of a mile that polling place is removed from the African American community black voter turnout goes down by point five percent so the more you move these polling places\nThe further and further the more and more you're able to depress the black voter turnout\nSo we had a an instance in Sparta where\nA under the guise of being fiscally responsible they were going to consolidate the polling stations will when they consolidated the polling stations\nThe one for the black community and I can say the black community because we do have residential segregation in the United states so for the one in the black community that one was moved Seventeen miles away\nNow think about that for trying to vote and what we also know is that many in the African American community do not have a private cars they don't have personal transportation so they have to rely upon public transportation so when you move\nA polling place further and further away from the black community by that very moment that very instance is designed to the press the black voter turnout\nIn June democracy now spoke with Stacey Abrams a democratic candidate for governor in Georgia\nVery Ken\nUnfortunately built a very strong record a voter suppression\nYes he and I have to leave a conflict at a number of times and I think I'm I'm very well I'm not I don't think I Know I'm very proud of our record of beating him a forcing him to restore it\nWell I'm not I don't think I Know I'm very proud of our record of beating a forcing him to restore the cancel registrations of thousands of compelling his office to do the right thing when it comes to voter registration\nBut also I think it's a challenging conversation to have both with secretary can end with lieutenant governor cable because rather than focusing on how we move the state forward they've both focus unfortunately on required or form of bigotry and how they want to harm communities and hold us back\nSo that Stacey Abrams speaking ... about her opponent church a secretary of state Brian Kemp and Georgia lieutenant governor Casey Cagle I also want it to turn to the Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia\nWho was captured on video Saturday as he snatched a cell phone out of the hands of a constituent who asked about\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp poop Purdue was stumping for senator Purdue is on the campus of Georgia Tech in Atlanta when a student try to ask him about his endorsement\nSo uh how can you endorse a candidate Robert started going to want to jump in when\nSenator Purdue return the phone after the student demanded it back\nOn Sunday produce office called the incident a misunderstanding saying the senator thought the student wants to take a selfie with him I'm\nA professor understand if you could comment on this and as we wrap up this discussion about Georgia who's voting right now I mean in some states there's no voting taking place but what's happening in Georgia\nSo first on I'm senator ... do you know remember senator Purdue is the one who opened a one of those Christian breakfast says I'm by praying for Obama's\nOne of those Christian breakfast is um by praying for Obama's death\nBy saying you know make your life be ended short you know quoting us a song\nAnd you know may your wife be left to I'm a widow and your children homeless and beggars so this is Senator David Perdue um and and Stacey Abrams is actually right that the the language that we're getting from\nI'm Brian Kemp and Casey cable has been the language of fear has been the language of stoking um um racial animosity racial anxiety\n[laughter] I think it was during the time of Moses well no actually the last time I voted live when I was serving in the military and that's been quite a number of years\nI'm so that you know it it it's an act that now I I think I treasure even more than I did back then and that's something I'm looking forward to do you know I mean we have citizens or across this great state of ours who have made mistakes in the past and they have had pets\nAcross this great state of ours who have made mistakes in the past and they have have paid their debt and this is a country that really believe that when a dead as fate is what is paid and it's time for us to move on and experience what being a citizen is all about and there's no greater expressing the net then being able to vote\nAnd I wanted to turn to a map of the country on and talk about it with\nThe states to states in the country which everyone including people with felony convictions are allowed to vote Maine and Vermont you can vote from jail\nI'm In ... states Florida Virginia or Kentucky in Iowa all people with felony convictions or permanently disenfranchised Florida has the highest number as has been said if a disenfranchised voters one point four million adults in the state can't vote\nOr because of having a felony conviction sent me in this\nBipartisan a coalition that has formed talk about what it's like to work with these different groups and what are the polls indicate for November\nFirst of all we don't even call out of the bipartisan movement we are organic grassroots movement that welcomes and enjoys bipartisan support we're not leading where the partisan nature of\nUh of this topic or or the issue of voting what we're leading with is the human nature you know that they're real people's lives who are impacted by these policies and because of that we've been able to first of all recognize\nThat that selling disenfranchisement now impacts people from all walks of life which now allows us to go into communities in rural parts of Florida in urban parts of Florida and have real conversations with real people and really connect with the pain that\nAnd have real conversations with real people and really connect with the pain that they're feeling\nBecause of that because of that what we've seen is indicative of what we're seeing now with the hurricane relief efforts that we've always seen\nThat in the aftermath of hurricane no one cares how their neighbor voted no one cares how much money they made only thing they see is another human being and need and that's the beautiful part of this campaign that we haven't brace and we own onto\nFor dear life because at the end we are organizing folks along the lines of humanity and because of that we've been able to get people\nThat that that that that throw off their parties and clothes and come together as brothers and sisters are in this movement as Americans that's rallying around each other knowing that once the debt is paid it's paid\nSo we can have a organizations like the tax watts\nChristian Coalition freedom partners that stand up and say you know what it is time to bring second chances back to the state of Florida and they could do that alongside the ACLU a organizations like Advancement Project I'm I'm a lines for safety injustice\nAnd for the rights restoration coalition\nThat is to me the most beautiful thing that we're witnessing hair I Believe that we are becoming a shining light for the rest of the country about what's good when people can elevate themselves above partisan bickering above racial discord\nAnd connect along the lines of humanity for the good of all people\nAre able to move from Florida to another uh another state that's also a a scene a disproportionate targeting a racial minority and the Supreme Court has ruled that will allow the state of North Dakota to enforce a new voter id requirement that will make it harder for Native Americans to vote during the ...\nIt's a new voter id requirement that will make it harder for Native Americans to vote during the midterm elections\nThe state's new voter id law requires voters to show identification that demonstrates a residential street address\nBut this has already rented many tribal IDs invalid since many Native Americans who live on reservations depend on post office boxes to receive their mail or the law could make a big difference in the close race between\nDemocratic senator Heidi Heitkamp and the Republican challenger Kevin Cramer or the race is expected to help decide who controls the Senate you talk about that as well\nYeah so the north Dakota voter id law has flown under the radar relative to Georgia but it's just a serious because the way this Republican voter id law is written is that most tribal ideas are not going to be accepted because they do not have a residential address in them\nMany Native Americans live in rural areas on reservations they don't have address as they get their mail at the post office there's nothing wrong with that but there's probably civically written to not allow\nPO box is count as an address so what's happening now in North Dakota is that sounds of Native Americans could be disenfranchised by this Republican voter id law according to federal court statistics twenty percent\nOf eligible Native American voters don't have\nThe correct I D and that means about five thousand Native American voters might not be able to vote in the next election and there were running out of time\nTo try to get them the correct ideas right now I mean we're basically twenty days away from the election and\nHeidi Heitkamp only won her first race for the Senate by three thousand votes with strong native support now you're talking about a much larger percentage of Native Americans who could be disenfranchised so this one voter id law in North Dakota could cost Heidi Heitkamp percent sea and could cost\nDemocrats control of the Senate so it's a very very serious situation we're also talking about the most historically disenfranchised group\nSo that so it's a very very serious situation we're also talking about the most historically disenfranchised group in this country who faces all sorts of barriers today and now thirty days before the election they find out they might not be able to vote in a critical midterm election it's absolutely shocking an appalling was half an hour it's the kind of it's also particularly\nInteresting that this is happening at a time as a Trump continually attacking US Senator Elizabeth Warren are trying to use the word Pocahontas named Pocahontas as a pejorative to describe her she has now gone and gotten a DNA test which she says from us Stanford professor\nOn that say she has Native American lineage and ancestry as she looks like she's about to announce her bed for twenty twenty at presidential uh for the twenty twenty presidential election\nWill just imagine Amy is voter suppression North Dakota got a fraction of the attention of Elizabeth Warren's DNA test or Donald Trump's Pocahontas slurs and I think what we should be focusing on instead of her as history is all the barriers that are being faced by Native Americans in this country and you can go down every single statistic\nAnd you see the problems but particularly with voting there was a long history of disenfranchising Native American voters of making polling places\nVery inaccessible of gerrymandering district so they don't have representation and that was right before an election a new voter ID laws put into place that could disenfranchised thousands of native voters to me this is absolutely outrageous it's on American and the fact that this election North Dakota\nIs tainted by voter suppression you can't reverse it\nAnd so right now people have to do everything they can to get Native Americans so that they can get the idea that they need to go with this law was specifically written it's very very clear to disenfranchise native\nAnd they are and what are the two in terms of the fact that we're only weeks away from the mid term elections clearly the Florida referendum or whatever happens there will\nElections clearly the Florida referendum or whatever happens there will only take effect for the next elections but what can be done now in Georgia and in North Dakota or to be able to have some I have a have these folks have their rights a vote before this lecture\nSo in Georgia there was a lawsuit filed the to allow the pending registrations to go through even if you are pending registration you can show up and vote with an idea at the polls so it's very important people know that they can vote in North Dakota the tribal authorities are going to have\nBasically a temporary IDs are going to give people a letter saying they have an address\nPoll workers are supposed to accept that but we used to be very very vigilant here and that's why issues like election protection are going to be so important 'cause I'm a truly worried people are going to show up in Georgia they're going to show up in North Dakota they might even have the right documents and election workers won't be able to won't won't tell them that they're able to vote\nAnd I'm a ... ballot initiatives that have um that will ease restrictions and other parts of the country\nWell this is huge because there's a ballot initiatives in seven states that would dramatically expand voting rights restoring voting rights ex felons in Florida to making it easier to register to vote in Michigan Nevada\nTo cracking down on gerrymandering and places like Colorado and Utah and so despite all the focus on voter suppression there is an opportunity to dramatically expand voting rights and twenty Eighteen and there is the best opportunity in a decade\nTo make it easier to vote for millions of people so I think that while all the focus is on suppression and twenty Eighteen the landscape for voting rights could look dramatically different and twenty twenty if all of these ballot initiatives pass or even if some of them just passed and twenty Eighteen\nWe want to thank you both for being with us Ari Berman of Mother Jones linked ... made the Florida writes restoration coalition that's been down to see you on Saturday Night and Melbourne, Florida at the Gleason performing arts center at will be
