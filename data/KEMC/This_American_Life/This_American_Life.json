relationship with you\nUm are the kind of a relationship that might have like another\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember used to find that that was because I think it works both ways I think that we still hope is that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we responded in\nWell I was desperately I guess I was looking for a family that I mean it it's only you knew you probably wouldn't hire me but I mean that people are complicated now what I really wanted to spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified\n[noise] I mean I I just

forgotten that are passed it happened she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that have been knowing under our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she'd damage me by exposing me to it\nI don't think I was to kind of accent because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and that's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people and and I know probably I did on a couple of people that they were my age but ah\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby sitter at the kids love

went to your rooms I didn't it didn't seem like you had a whole lot of toys\nI Hope I've got this right but it just seems like they were mostly folks and more educational things\nI mean I remember you had planned it in your room and a chemistry set and I didn't remember that Kate had hardly any dolls you didn't seem quite as playful as other kids that I had they not just in more serious\nAnd\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story is how little I memorized the deceived us about each other even if they had to seem to us about ourselves\nAs Susan said at one point each of us remembered what we need to do about the other I needed to remember the part of Susan but she doesn't think about much her toughness in the face of hardship [noise] she said she must

life than that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this ridiculous fantasy of you know I'm not just a sixteen year old kid who has\nCan't get a girl with them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but I don't know I mean\nMaybe the maybe keeping a diary one tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\nMay may maybe maybe\nOther people in another kind of situation need to actually\nMake up a little fantasy yeah I think um\nI didn't have much anxious about being the future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident uncomfortable with it and I had so much anxious about every other aspect of my life [laughter]\nI Know it's just kind of maybe it was a good solution you know there was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be you know one of the great ...\nI Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel it knowing that finally you know an audience of a million people with with getting some of the\nReading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so nothing I mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and\nAnd I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions won't affect\nMillions of people like how is that enough motivation you know just to have your petty little craft and you're putting little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nYou know it just seemed pathetic\nI mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself but you're saying though is is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at your thirty year old just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at sixteen yeah that's very true yeah\nHe would be very very disgusted [noise]\nTo be heard this this rating appease\nIt would seem like I had settled in the ... that are way\nThese days staff writer for the New York\nBoy when we were angels\nHistory originally came to us from a graduate student and we frankly studying drying at the New York Academy of art and she mailed a radio show a story that you wanted to get him to the program in which he had done is that she had recorded the interviews using her little micro cassette answering machine\nAnd then to edit the quotes that you had gotten which you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like the story from this American Life\nNow for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it onto the radio but this week's show however we had her put together another story using that same style which we added music to hear the radio station to make it bully sound like story on our show\nIt's a story about an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate [noise]\nUniversity is a pretty straight place\nEntertainment for most people means fraternity tigers\nIt's not the sort of place you'd expect people\nTo watch a guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt happened by accident in Nineteen Ninety four\nMy friend's got with the top half\n[noise] it was beginning of the school year and we were [noise]\n\nGot aboard one night and we decided to go up to the quad and [noise] I guess basically got up on a\nOn the phone back and they started yelling and screaming about how giant he was back into the U.S [noise] and uh [noise] I think actually right after that I might have gotten us going back and said yeah you know I also try it [laughter]\nAnd uh I guess that really struck a chord in me I thought that was pretty amazing [noise]\nUm\nThey bought a lot about it um [noise] it actually good you know start me thinking along [laughter] killer pat [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nTalked about the idea eliminating the dining hall the next day on the weight of class he saw signs all over campus and that set in both pretty\nI Am nine feet tall\n... giant and then eight pm on the

gave giant man a booming boy\nPardon my dogs I play with something like you know I'm drawing you know just the you know loud but this kind of weird sort of\nThing [laughter] you know I don't know\nGot asked his college friends hold on to access giant men's legs\nThey grab some ... before heading up to the plot\nOf Lincoln wrapped around their middle high Toto\nAnd black really way like the guys can't\nWe picked up a point in the bushes put on at I um [noise] we really couldn't see what was going on out of the ... for the time came and I got on the shoulder effects way up there like around my waist and we walked out\nAnd I remember just being maybe you know maybe ten people for people right\nAnd I remember them being way on the other side and sort of running and it worked so ridiculous about it was the other is like a handful of people and they were so spread out but they're all coming to work for it right like you know what the what the hell am I doing here\n[noise] they decided to win another a giant may end up here in the ... the posted more science and hold everyone they knew go see giant man it'll blow your mind\nWould spread quickly and amazingly\nThey were able to keep it keep it in some words and then\nMost students believed there was\nAn accident and I'm sitting in home to roost in various reasons\nI was friends with these guys and I didn't even know yet\nAt the next appearing almost two hundred people were waiting for giant men and chanting his name\nIt was like a political rally\nSome carried signs that things like\nWe love you giant man why are you here\nHave
