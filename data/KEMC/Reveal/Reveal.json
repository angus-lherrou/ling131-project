the other but as a responsible citizen and a person in the state of Georgia you need to vote\nYou really do you need to teach your children the importance of voting you go out and you beat the bushes and you complain which you don't vote\n\nMore than one hundred million Americans of voting age didn't go to the polls in twenty sixteen so Democrats and Republicans are trying to get the numbers to work for their side the Democrats are hopeful here in Georgia a Democrat has won the governor's mansion since Nineteen Ninety eight\nWe're working on a story about people who send removed from the

brands he's voting as a write in their privilege so he disagrees with Reverend ponder who says voting is outright period\nBrian sings registering ahead of an election is important because it shows someone's educated and engaged enough to deserve to vote\nYou want people who have been following the election to some degree or who knows what the issues are and what the candidates stand for I don't believe in the same day registration because I Do think it's that administrative headache because I Do think it distorts the electorate a bit I doubt it how does it distorted the electorate [noise]\nI don't know how you describe it frankly I'm at a loss on all that but if you don't know an October the first so there's a presidential election or a gubernatorial election in uh the first two weeks of November you're not an informed voter\nBrian argues purging people for not voting isn't taking anything from them because they're not voters\nLike if if the presidential election and in fact two presidential elections don't get you out I don't know what it's going to take to get you out and I don't care what color you are what your partisanship is I think that's a fair standard\nBrian looks at the governor's race like this it's all about who shows up at the polls camp wins if the racial breakdown of voters stays about where it's been in recent elections Abrams wins by getting more people of color to the polls\nBoth probably need to win over some voters who haven't made up their minds but finding those types of voters could be really tough\nYou have to polarized angry tribes going at each other you look at the falling today there's almost no one decided [noise]\n\nStory from Johnny Kauffman of public radio station W. A. B. E. N.\n\n\nWhen it comes to voting something else distinguishes Georgia for most other states it's voting machines are easy targets for computer hackers was what you were doing here even\nTechnically hacking no I Would not counted as hacking now\nWhat was it then it was it was browsing the Web site that's coming up next on repeal [noise]\nYeah [noise] [noise]\nWhy be are supported by Yellowstone theological Institute and independent faith based graduate school in Bozeman offering scholarships for students in three passive study as well as course audit enrollment it scholarship information at Yellowstone theology dot org\n\nFrom the center for investigative reporting in P. R. ex this is revealed I'm outlets up till now we've been talking about all the barriers\nTo prevent people from stepping into a voting booth on election day like getting to the polling station in finding out your name is on the list\nBut even if you get into the booth your vote might not be properly County Georgia is one of five states that rely solely on\nTouch screen voting machines with no paper audit trail cyber experts warned about these machines for years and recently so as President Trump\nOf the things we're learning is it's always good it's old fashioned but it's always good\nHighly complex computers paper\nThere's a real cause for concern special counsel Robert Mueller has indicted twelve Russian agents for ... to target county Web sites in Georgia\nA lot of security experts are worried that when it comes to hacking Georgia is one of the most vulnerable states in the country but are the people in charge of elections there actually listening reveals by Duncan picks up the story [noise]\nYeah so right now I'm like in the machine in\nLogan lamb has a voting machine in his living room this is what one looks\nLike on the inside so here's where the memory cards [noise]\nLogan is a cyber security researcher in Atlanta his specialty is finding new ways to break into wireless networks and new ways to keep the bad guys out\nThe touch screen voting machines he has is the kind of Georgia uses edits polling places the machine is bulky and book shaped with the big screen it looks kind of like a cross between the Nintendo and the Bible Logan boots it up\nSo it was actually touch ... glitter and then it's the compressed being the image is the one funny thing I've been wanting to do is pull off that little chime at the beginning and use that as Irene came\nTo this is a direct recording electronic machine or DRA it doesn't produce any sort of voter verified paper audit trail for Logan and other cybersecurity type that's a major red flag\nIn fact dairies had been criticized by technologists basically since they were installed across the country in the early two thousand one alternative to these machines as paper ballots and in recent years more and more people are pushing to start using them again\nLike last march at a Senate intelligence committee hearing on election security Ron Wyden a Democrat from Oregon had some questions for homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nYou wanted to get her official position on electronic voting machines\nAnd I'd like to get your views for the record\nOf whether you believe the continued use of paper less voting machines in this country threatens our national security\nAnd the department is now prepared to recommend paper\nBallots [noise] ... yes sorry if there is no way to audit the election that is absolutely a national security concern why didn't look satisfied and you now told us that the status quo\nIt's worth noting that cyber experts disagree with is\nStrongly that\nBurned heart is a PHD student at the University of Michigan\nHe studied the arteries and their vulnerability\nThat says the problem with George's system is that I'm like a lot of other states it's all interconnected like a giant tree\nHe told me the secretary of state's office is the roots your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads\nSo really you inject information or inject basically now we're a virus into any part of this tree the way it's set up is that virus could get transmitted to every other part of the tree [noise]\nNot long after Logan downloaded all that data second time some election integrity groups filed a complaint against Brian Kemp for violating Georgians constitutional rights to have their ballots\nThere was a hearing in September in federal court in Atlanta was grueling took all day\nYou at cyber experts on one side explaining why Georgia's system is so vulnerable one of them even hacked a voting machine right there in the courtroom\nOn the other side where can people telling the cyber experts hey you don't understand how Georgia system works a few days after the hearing\nA federal judge deciding again adopting paper ballots over electronic wind for the midterm elections\nJudge any Totenberg filed an order in favor of Brian ... she wrote that switching to paper ballots just weeks before an election would create total chaos but she also spent dozens and dozens of pages validating the testimony of cyber experts and scolding the state [noise]\nI'm going to read just a little bit from the order\nQuote the court is gravely concerned about the state's pace in responding to the serious vulnerabilities of its voting system by the way throughout the hearing camps team tried to paint the cyber experts as out of state elites judge Totenberg was having none of that\nHacking she wrote is here to stay and quote defendants will fail to address that reality if they demean as paranoia the research based findings of national\nCyber security engineers an expert\nSo that's where we are Georgia's barreling towards mid terms with the vulnerable system the machines that very few people trust\nKennesaw state is no longer handling elections now the secretary of state's office does the people I\nTalked to said that change won't really make much of a difference they say if a hacker got the info Logan got back in twenty sixteen they could still use it to disenfranchise\nVoters in twenty eight teams and it's worth noting here just how much judge Totenberg has ruined resembles the logic Kennesaw state right after Logan first email that we know are elections are vulnerable but we can't fix them because the elections are so soon\nBefore Logan I parted ways I asked him a question\nLet me ask you this how sure are you that somebody didn't beat you to this [laughter] uh there's there's not really a way of knowing at this point huh I mean still to this day I'm very concerned [noise]\n\nReveals by Duncan brought us the story\n[noise]\nThis year Brian Kemp established a commission to look at options for replacing the curve voting system by twenty twenty oh and the other four states heading into the midterms that used to touch screen machines with no paper audit trail\n\n\nFear of voter fraud is driving a lot of efforts to restrict access to voting around the country but where is that fear coming from that's next on reveal from the center for investigative reporting T. R. [noise]\n\n\nWhy PR is supported by the Montana university system presenting the Montana research road show where speakers from universities across the state but they're twenty five Montana towns to share their ten minute research story from tiny houses to brains to bees folder stuff's opposite M. U. S. dot edu splash road show\nIn Nineteen Ninety then President George H W. Bush told world amount a nice long enemy\nI Do not like broccoli and I haven't liked it since I was a little kid\nHow our taste in food preferences in music even our pets can really in our politics\nAnd I'm president of the United states and I'm not going to eat any more but\nNot this week on hidden brain from NPR News ... news\n\nFrom the center for investigative reporting NPR ... this is revealed I'm outlets today we've been talking about voter suppression in fear of voter fraud people are worried about it in part because of what President Trump has been\nSeen in many places like California the same person votes many times you've probably heard about that they always like to say oh that's a conspiracy theory not a conspiracy theorist Alex millions and millions of people those claims\nHave been totally the bar but one of the people who got those theories going was a Kansas lawyer who's waged a long running campaign against what he calls voter fraud his name is Kris Kobach he's the Kansas secretary of state\nAnd while that typically a pretty sleepy office he's a household name in his home state even used to have a weekly radio show\nFees the ACLU worst nightmare 'cause he knows the constitution terrified to keep them from making confetti of it is Kris\nKobach spin a loyal Trump supporter from the beginning Trump appointed him to run his so called election integrity commission it was disbanded less than a year after it was started without accomplishing anything Peggy Lowe of Casey you are in Kansas City has been covering Kobach for years\nHey hey yeah so Kobach is from a small state population wise but he has this big national profile in conservative circles\nArizona law that basically gave law enforcement a lot more authority to stop people in question them about their immigration status it was called the papers please law that's dating back to about twenty ten\nAnd since then he's been aligned with white nationalist groups who backed that effort and that's when he got on the radar of the Southern Poverty Law Center who now calls Kobach the lawyer for America's native his movement\nSince then his anti immigration crusade has morphed into this campaign against what he calls massive voter fraud\nKobach claims that illegal aliens that's attorney loves to use our voting in great numbers and this fraud could be swinging elections that way we know that that is not true that is right now I could through a bunch of little zeroes in percentages at you here but\nAccording to the Brennan Center for justice it would be harder for an American to be struck by lightning than to impersonate and how their voter but that doesn't stop Kobach he's the leader in the fight against this well it's a major problem\n[noise]\nYou interview coup last summer what was the looking person well you know come up makes a really good politician he's good looking he's charming he's really articulate\nBut as a reporter he is also just maddening he will tell you that even your question is inaccurate he will fight chew on every term and you guys just\nSaid it would be a year\nThe germ line as inaccurate it's not off line then you will thrill all these studies and statistics that you which many of these studies have been debunked by academics but he's still uses them it's like talking to Kris Kobach is arguing with your high school debate coach\nYou know you're talking to a guy who really wants you to lose the argument\nAnd I think he's really respected in some circles because he has a very impressive resume he has degrees from Harvard Yale University of Oxford and then he also has this other big help it's a tool called the interstate cross check system it's a massive voter tracking program\nUnder Kobach it grew to include more than half of the total voter registrations in the U. S. okay so how does this thing work so about two dozen states are enrolled in this cross check program it's free they share information between states keeping the voter registration rolls clean\nHappens when people move so out when you moved from Florida California did you call the secretary of state in Florida [laughter] no I did not that's okay then because you actually weren't breaking the law here's a deal it's not illegal to be registered to vote in two states\nThat said it is illegal to vote in the same election in two different states\nServes Kobach uses cross strict system to go after voter fraud\nThis is where Kobach signed in using cross check Kobach persuaded the Kansas Legislature to give him the power to prosecute these cases by himself so he doesn't have to turn them over to the attorney general's office like the way it's done in all these other states\nOkay so all of a sudden Kris Kobach has the power of a prosecutor what's he doing with it\nWell so far he's turned up nine cases of this alleged voter fraud he's prosecuted them is felonies and they mostly played it down to misdemeanors\nAnd most of the people he caught up in this are older white Republican men not illegal aliens again Kobach term", "show_name": "Reveal", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "21", "locations": [["Georgia", 41.99998, 43.4999], ["Atlanta Georgia", 33.749, -84.38798], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Russia", 60.0, 100.0], ["Moscow", 55.75222, 37.61556], ["Russia", 60.0, 100.0], ["Moscow", 55.75222, 37.61556], ["Moscow", 55.75222, 37.61556], ["China", 35.0, 105.0], ["Moscow", 55.75222, 37.61556], ["Iraq", 33.0, 44.0], ["Iraq", 33.0, 44.0], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Iraq", 33.0, 44.0], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Afghanistan", 33.0, 66.0], ["Kabul", 34.52813, 69.17233], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Honduras", 15.0, -86.5], ["Guatemala Mexico", 15.83106, -88.77719], ["Georgia", 41.99998, 43.4999], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Atlanta Georgia Georgia", 33.749, -84.38798], ["Atlanta Georgia Georgia Georgia Georgia", 33.749, -84.38798], ["Rome", 41.89193, 12.51133], ["Georgia", 41.99998, 43.4999], ["Georgia", 41.99998, 43.4999], ["Georgia", 41.99998, 43.4999], ["Bozeman", 45.67965, -111.03856], ["Georgia", 41.99998, 43.4999], ["Georgia", 41.99998, 43.4999], ["Georgia", 41.99998, 43.4999], ["Atlanta Georgia", 33.749, -84.38798], ["Oregon", 44.00013, -120.50139], ["Atlanta Georgia Georgia Georgia", 33.749, -84.38798], ["Kennesaw", 34.02343, -84.61549], ["Kennesaw", 34.02343, -84.61549], ["Montana", 47.00025, -109.75102], ["Montana", 47.00025, -109.75102], ["Montana", 47.00025, -109.75102], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["Kansas", 39.09973, -94.57857], ["Kansas", 39.09973, -94.57857], ["Kansas City", 39.09973, -94.57857], ["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["the U.
