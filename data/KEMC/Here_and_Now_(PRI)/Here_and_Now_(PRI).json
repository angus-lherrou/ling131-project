loading it reflects an increase in hate crimes across the country\nRight about this route to community but has this been in the back of your mind you know what were you thinking when you heard about this attack\nBy first thought was this is a\nBrutal anti Semitic killing tack not only in the Jews but Americans and our values and the shock of it all was Jews have been living in America comfortable it's accepted in all communities around the country\nSee changed since the fifties and sixties and in the anti Semitism bigotry against Jews and many minorities\nAnd here we are again one more time\nOr the ugliness not only pop to the surface does periodically but it seems to grip a good number of people in America [laughter]\nWell uh ... let's talk about the climate in which it occurred do you make up about two percent of this country's population the FBI data says they account for about half the country is really just hate crimes\nAccording to the Anti Defamation league that's nearly two thousand incidents in twenty Seventeen five hundred more than the previous here have you been feeling that increase\nIn the last two three years we've seen more anti Semitic acts Nazi symbols of the loan Jewish cemeteries schools the SAT on Saturday there's quite a shock to the community and to America it seems\nAnd you know we only the so the gathering there in Pittsburgh thousands of people came out of out of your feeling that support from across the board and yet we heard the President's Day in his first remark it's hard to believe that this could happen in this day and age I mean you're saying somewhat the same thing\nExcept you're saying that you are also aware as a rising incidents\nDo you think that maybe possibly this horrific act on Saturday\nThat maybe at the very very least you know it's a small consolation but there there can be a a a moment of people understanding that there is anti Semitism in this country\nI'm fearful that unless we mobilize stop political leadership decides to change its ways they won't be any\nMajor changes taking place you know there's an opportunity next week when we vote in America maybe a [noise] those that have had been spewing out some of his viral language you know politicians closes who not spoken out against intolerance against minorities and\nMaybe that will send a message in shock the system you know the answer to this or a political leaders\nThat was the biggest microphone in the country and I think it starts with him changing the tone\nOf how he speaks about Americans and politicians from other parties but it also has to go down to you know our representatives in Washington are man governors and mayors or you know it's a local issue and if we can mobilize loud voice to make sure that\nThey understand that this is not the American way than Americans won't accept it they'll go to the polls if necessary to to change it and it becomes a priority that's where it has to begin as\nWell uh actually somewhat table hearing the opposite from the president had been\nFor a while we know that the gunman in Pittsburgh shattered the same racist rant that was heard by those marching white nationalist in Charlottesville in August is plenty Seventeen and we know that you know on line these white nationalists a supremacist Nazis\nAbsolutely believe and foment the thinking that games are pulling the strings somehow behind policies they don't like let's listen to these marches it's hard to hear that led to listen to these marches again in Charlottesville\n\nSounds on the documented it's put together that day I mean when you heard that that that's what he allegedly the shooter was allegedly shouting into synagogue that had to be tailing\nYes of course you know coming off of Charlottesville and Charleston and other attacks I think Americans are very conscious of the wrong song being set in America I Know everybody speaking about the president having\nA big responsibility in this because of his views and his political rhetoric we should all be hard to let him know that we don't accept that in America but it's not only him as the point I'm trying to make it was just happened to been watching Clinton sharpening show no\nTV yesterday how shocked and I know it'd be the\nDiscussion tend to surround Trump the bigotry and hatred that show's been showing you the wrong tone has been sending you said to myself what am I can\nUh you speaking of Louis ... leader of the nation of Islam\nYou know he just a few weeks ago said the Jews are Tom writes why aren't you speaking out against him is that because you're a Democrat and Trump's Republicans but our political leaders should also be speaking out against [noise]\nWell more responsible you know he still has the biggest microphone she's going to\nA live with the fact that he's the one they talk about the most but we shouldn't forget other parties all leaders don't just get a pass\nOr in the mail President Trump said that there were find people on both sides in Charlottesville and some permission half as much as\nI don't think that you you can talk about Nazis and the old right and Americans I just don't think the comparison makes any sense either penniless America's\nCheckers and president as American Jewish Congress thanks so much and again set aside for the loss in your community\nThank you for your kind of thoughts appreciate the

thought we'd offer novel about grief that also happens to be a finalist for the national Book Award for fiction\nBut secret Nunez is exquisite novel the friend is about suicide and also about the writing world which the author says is a sinking raft with too many people trying to get on\nAnd it's about a dog a highly clean great Dane named Apollo after the suicide of her friend the narrator is asked to take his massive pet in and they mourn together see goodness focus last march\nThere were these three strands that I I wanted to bring together into the same story and one was about uh the suicide of of people that are very close to you and another was um [noise] my experiences as a writer and a teacher of writing [noise]\nAnd ah I've always loved animals and I have always wanted to write about animals and I've always been interested in this human animal bond particularly the human canine bond so I saw a way that I could write a story leaving all those strands together\nAnd did you ever um and throwing in by the way along the way I'm suddenly there's Beckett and flattery O'Connor and Kafka and you're\nUs like gods and we respond by treating them like sings\nFat is a quote from ... from his novel disgrace\nAnd what are you trying to say about these not just overall noble creatures but in this case a character named Apollo who's one of the largest dogs you can imagine but when he first comes into the narratives apartment his tail is lowered like a beast of burden\nWhat do we know about whether dogs grieve\n[noise] we do know that they do grief because we can observe that and we do know that you know that we can't explain to them all the person died because he was in a car accident or something I can explain that to a dog but they definitely do more and\nAnd uh you know in this book she didn't think about this because it wasn't her idea to take in the dog but once she has him she realizes that he is going through a process of grieving it just like her own and that draws them very close together and they get through it together they help each other he'll now\nI remember I had to put a little dogs asleep once and the person who came to the house that it's better that the other dog see this oh so that they know where the dog is gone and I I thought what seems odd but\nI Am so glad to meet you can't you can't say for sure that that would happen well\nWhen the when the shots started the injection to you know put him to sleep the other dog ran from the room jumped into the bath tub and picked over the top as if to say is anyone noticed you're killing a dog here I mean you know fascinating they and then he did more afterwards or\nAs I Do think that although we don't really know what's going on inside dogs heads because we we can't and they don't have language we know that they're smart I think they might be many many times smarter than we actually have fought on to this point\nBut the book isn't I mean for those wondering we've seen books recently that concentrate on an animal and somebody's relationship with an animal\nYours goes off I mean there's ... chapters where we're not hearing anything about Apollo and every now and then you say it's only happened to the dog or is something going to happen to the dog\nBecause you presume it's like old yell or you presume okay embracing here if there's a book with a dog something's gonna happen but you go off with your narrator to other parts of her life when you thinking there\nShe has a life outside of the dog even though during this period of mourning she doesn't do much besides take care of the the ... I mean he's he's her whole emotional life during this period\nSomebody asked for the party argue the woman who's in love with the dog yeah\nA big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a\nTalking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know where you do have a person who in trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain writers and certain books and certain words and that's why I quote people like\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she was trying to tell a story about ... and the and all of those writers do have a part in her life\nAs people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow along the way I I kept thinking I should Google this I should go to this is it true that during the Nineteen eighties in California there were many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight yes and they all lead atrocities and what they were just psychosomatic ally they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYes they did have psychosomatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it\nIs it true that research has shown that it helps I think it was damaged children or six children to read aloud to dogs\nYes that is something that uh has been going on in classrooms in libraries fairly recently I think um need a therapy dog say they know to be calm and to sit still and and listen\nAnd to the child is having reading difficulties the dog is listening but he's not judgmental and anyway it appears to work about what it does for the dogs I don't know but it does seem to help the children yes that's also true yes\nYou also talk about people we talked about the site but you also talk about people who were dying their throat because of something more powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times to our narrator we're not gonna give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend\nIs all along is the dog and maybe not the mentor who committed suicide [noise]\nBoy could be boats or maybe the friend is the narrator yeah and what\nAbout you said you know you've loved animals but you make your narrator a cat person who isn't sure how she feels about a dog\nMy my ... my married are really does Mitt this is something I definitely share with my married her she says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like a lot of other people have trouble\nThey kept you do dominate other animals horses dogs you know at some point she says uh they're almost two poignant and their relations with the person that and to our cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet but can live without me\nShe just much happier with the idea that her cats would easily survive [laughter] her dying suddenly whereas this dog is totally traumatized by the disappearance of his best friend\nNow dogs can be unbearably poignant and she said although I'm reminded of the great essay writer the public radio as a writer Alice furlough who wrote the definitive essay on a her cat dying\nAnd the only solace that she took from it every morning her cat would try to wake her up by not going to Penn on her head as they do you have her only solace is that\nShe is now waking up and the cat's not there it would have been more unbearable for her if the cat was still trying to you know with a pen wake her up when she had gone\nOh yes that's that's very moving\nWell and how was this book it's called the friend from secret newness and took it it'd have to ask you it is about writers in writing in the community and the teaching of it um can you give us one tip for those who uh wanna wrestle a story to the ground\nPiece of advice that I really like is the simple don't flinch I say it because I Do see a lot of very good work among students spoiled at least in a draft\nBecause they've done exactly that they have this really good story they have it is really good experience they have very strong feelings about it but when they get to writing it down they get scared and they flinch and they pull away from it and that you know makes it not as good a story as it could be\nWell I Would say if anybody wants to see how you can write a book about a dog that for the longest time in the book isn't really about a dog and then suddenly it was all about a dog in you know with such a punch pick up the friend\nUm and how much of this is you you've told interviewers this isn't my writing class [laughter] you know I'm not that frustrated with student writers but is the suicide maybe someone you didn't know because we read the germ of this was people who you knew who were contemplating suicide\nOne of the reasons why I did want to to write this book was because there were several friends that I had let me know that suicide was something that\n\nFunding for here and now comes from that weren't greeters of that law that simulates software accelerating the pace of engineering and science you learn more ... dot

education\nThe law was passed in twenty Fifteen and it's being enacted as suicide rates for kids and teens who are in fact according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention suicide became

of the ... the concrete things I mean talking about the fact that it's real and shouldn't be a stigma and it's as much a disease I guess as you know I'm diabetes that's great for awareness but then where does it go from there\nWhen we did get the legislation passed one thing we did not advocate for was a specific curriculum because what you teach in the Bronx might be a little different than what you're teaching in upstate New York\nSo we wanted to make sure that you know each district to determine what they perceive as their best sort of lesson plans are best curriculums\nYork very rural how might it be different\nWell I think that the understanding and and the socialization and things like that are are a little different in a rural area suburban area in the city\nNot that there's a greater understanding in one part of the state versus another part of the states but just a sort of an overall cultural peas and just a greater you know knowledge about mental health in general\nIt well and I'm thinking that Long Island very suburban Long Island may have more of an acceptance of\nThe idea of therapy and mental health being on the table then let's say a a a small town and I'm not going to pick out but a small town in upstate New York or it may not be as widely used\nCorrect yeah and there are cultural differences too there's depending on the culture there are cultures that are very accepting about talking about mental health more openly than other cultures are talking about a more openly so that also has to take in into place too and also\nSchool history some schools again have rolled out mental health court comes in the past and so we don't want to transpose our piece over what they are already teaching but what we did do in response is we were able to create a resource center at school mental health resource center where we were able to\nI have a a group of experts mental health and education experts meet through the\nState Department of education to develop what we regard as sort of a you know best practice lesson plans so people can go to our website and look in and see that there are lesson plans out there are dedicated to elementary school to middle school in the high schools\nYou got that teacher training there and other tools so willing people out here now doubt or the brain is an example like let's say you decided to implement this in grade school what like a specific part of a curriculum and then what might Wendy in eleventh grade\nSure well a lot of what you're talking about in elementary school\nEspecially early on kindergarten first grade second grade is just about things like feelings took about sadness and happiness and just general kind of sense of a basic knowledge you know obviously we don't want to bring in topics that are too heavy by any means especially the very early age\nAt this idea of talking about feelings get fellow thing an emotional awareness so that when ... comes has the teen years approach maybe somebody's got the tools to deal with it\nAnd it's exactly what we try to do is create a progression recognizing that okay where where buildings sort of like the the structure now\nWhen they are older and facing you know more challenges in terms of their mental health that they are better able to to deal with that so it's almost like really building in a progression\nThe national alliance on mental illness county\nHas all sorts of stats one of them is that one in five young people live with a mental health condition in the U.S that less than half get treatment so this might also funnel people to wield treatment as opposed to education and then she noticed opposition their teachers who don't feel comfortable with the subjects whiz kids\nTeachers who feel that it should be the parents who handle something like this or therapist\nI think what we say in response to look it's a very very legitimate issue and we are really emphasizing that this should be an inclusion of families in this discussion as much as possible\nAgain we don't want psychology when uh when we don't want teachers to go and talk about\nHere is a different diagnoses or anything like that we just want teachers to be able to go in and and give a basic knowledge about mental health and maybe again to your point when you were saying and talk about the things that we already know talk about stigma talk about things like the connection between physical and mental health issues\nAnd we hope that as more and more of these discussions going on and people are realizing T educators families that\nYou know this is just the normalization of a of a of a condition that hopefully people will be much more open about talking about it\nThat's when Lehman he's the CEOs and nonprofit mental health association of New York state one of the groups that advocate it for the new law that it's just gone into effect acquiring all public schools to have some form of mental health education Glenn thanks so much\nSure I really

she hasn't gained much recognition outside the art world there's never been a comprehensive museum survey of her work until now the beacon north of New York city and the Whitney Museum of American art in Manhattan are presenting major exhibitions of courses work\nWork that you have to see to fully see as Karen Michel reports\nAre times when a friend is telling you about an adventure they had a concert attended and the climate give you just had to be there\nAnd that's how it is with Mary course because every team to light in the room every movement made by the view or something else emerges from the parents\nSo it takes time as you walk by so without a viewer does that work exist [noise] that is a good question does the tree fall I think not [laughter] [noise] perception has a lot to do

the exhibits and written about course he's heard lots of other artists make similar claims about the role of the viewer\nJust an old aesthetic trouble you know that every work of art requires a viewer to complete the circuit probably her more than most\nHorses exhibition at the Whitney is called Mary course a survey in light of course calls herself a painter of light we play games does take issue\nThere's something to commercial about it it sounds like you know central painter a light right like some really bad PR region artist was Seventy five galleries all over the world painter of light is probably more compact than painter who's cruising around with light you know who you wouldn't want to say that\nThe corps throughout our history painters have been screwing around with white is Whitney curator Kim ... points out\nActually her practice has to do with something that painters I've been thinking about for centuries think back to an artist like Karl von geo ... Italian broke period trying to figure out how do you capture the ephemeral qualities of light from the round with every day it's kind of phenomenon\nHow does that translate into paint and how does that translate onto the surface\nMary courses been wrestling with that cannot grim since early twenties at one point she was experimenting with light as part of the work first using fluorescent lights and later the more subtle radiance of Oregon\nStill for all other experimentation she was pretty much kept out of the big boys club of Los Angeles art in the Nineteen sixties as the consensus of the time was the painting was dead concepts we're in the men were he men and women artist were pretty much ignored\nI was younger than everybody else so I was still really a girl I was in my twenties so maybe that had something I figured that has much to do with it as being a woman but I've also been in museum shows good shows and they listed everyone in the show but may I was the only woman and my name was left out\nHe kept happening prominent curators wouldn't even come look at her work and it wasn't like the burgeoning feminist art movement pioneers of the time at her ...\nWell the woman's limits should still likely because how many single artist raised two children single moms so I was working hard to live my life free\nCourse move through studio to the wilds Topanga Canyon near Malibu

government's consent it was the only way to do it\nBut they were adamant that we shouldn't speak to the bells about what happened to them during the three is that they were held by Boko Haram why a hotly uh\nI mean they you know the government's his cane that they control the narrative but also we the girls were released in may we started filming with them and not governments safe house in early July\nSo it was they had only been out of captivity [noise] for about six weeks so it was quite rules they um with still processing what would happen to them\nSo that that was part of it it wasn't for us when all counsellors to push them into reliving and telling us what had happened that we tried to give them the ... in the space to if they wish to\nBut he could eat anytime we were alone with the girls the government minders and security shut them down quite quickly so it's twofold I think the government also wanted to manage how\nThe rest of the world on Nigeria see the ... time in captivity because they were held the three is the full and association with down and they were released well\nWhat do we know about their time in captivity and what would what it was like\nWell they they um low they was free to speak to is they did give us that diaries discreetly ... and they kind of make it clear that life wasn't goods that they were forced to marry is ...\nUh and then the film what we do is the uh the girls the girls who were taken would actually just the tip of the iceberg there were thousands of girls in Nigeria who were taken by Boko Haram\nWho are free to speak and they do tell us walked the Boko Haram treatment is so through the testimony we get a sense of what happened to the ... goals as well\nSo such a let me bring you in because uh you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one girl in your film who was married had a kid ah with\nSomebody from Boko Haram and it's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid she's I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's a Boko Haram baby\nYeah say what we were told by a lot of the goals that we interviewed who and all and then the phone is that you kind of had two options in the forest either you marry a ... or you become a slave\nAnd if you're a slave than you know life is not taught us so it's a question of kind of survival and in a way even if you end up marrying a soldier or the golf felt like they you know we're rights\nAnd and we're supposed to be that why it's say she as she says I was two months pregnant when I ran away and when we first met had like she\nShe did tell us I don't love my baby as much as I Love the two little boys my baby of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually were kidnapped as well er and ended up being made into child soldiers\nYeah say one of the untold stories is the number of boys and men who have disappeared who have either been kidnapped or killed during this will\nSay ... has been kidnapping children but also older men and uh some of them are forced to pick up arms and fights\nAnd then when the military engaged with ... and they tried to take back territory they will kill and arrest or people who look like soldiers and so a lot of men have been killed in this fight in the process of trying to eradicate Boko Haram\nIt's kind of amazing watching how terrible the situation is and and as you report\nThey're living in these tent camps um that this isn't getting more attention globally\nYeah it is functioning I think all the focus has been on Syria and yet the famine in the north east of Nigeria\nIs just terrible it's a very widespread and high level and they all will running two towns and these they call them id becomes a intently displaced people\nAnd that's why they have to run too because Boko Haram you know they don't just kid not they then button and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even places like my degree which is kind of\nA one of the the main towns it's incredibly dangerous but also safety by numbers on that fled the food aid is going to see how if you want food and he wants to live that's why you have to them\nAnd their ... but then a lot of the uh uh loves intending displaced people end up living within the community so\nDespite the fact that they can die as some fair towards people who have escaped Boko Haram but they will have been incredibly welcoming to the number of displaced people who have come tomato Goree\nWell let's talk about that the the people who have managed to escape from captivity by Boko Haram they tried to go back into society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nYeah I mean I'm made a gory isn't a kind of normal front line will would say in it that it's it's controlled to miniaturize it's controlled the Nigerian military and\nTheir constant infiltration of suicide bombers to come into the city so when we with that like the second to last night it happened to be the end of Ramadan\nThat was sick suicide attacks in one night and you just never know\nWho to trust because Boko Haram uses young mostly young women as suicide bombers they stop them up and send them you know towards checkpoints where they manage to make it into bits of the city [noise]\nAnd so there is a lot of fear because unlike a kind of normal front line ... ... you just don't know why this is coming from and where and when I said there's a lot of mistrust\n[noise] what about the girls who are now out of captivity and looking to the future and and trying to have a hopeful future or the government is making it possible for some to attend college including some who managed to escape let's listen to one of them\nI'm no less than ... doesn't mean everything has changed my life now all of the nation I mean ... he's alright ...\n\nDo you see a bright future for some of these girls yes I think ah\nFor the ... girls who are are in a un American universities I dropped the American University in Nigeria which is what older girls who were released a negotiated full and uh the escaped girls who owned the nights that to\nThe kidnapping happens so Jones in Seventy six were kidnapped fifty seven of them during the long journey on the back of trucks to somebody's various kind of jumped off the back\nAnd half of those have gone straight to this uh University in yoga\nAnd that's where they've been the last three years and they feel positive about life and so the ... girls who are voting just stopped he lived on a year at the University of um we keep in contact with them and they say that while their education is coming on\nAnd I think they realize what a privilege education is so precious and ...\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

the networks new experiment in advertising Fox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair of five and a half minute blocks of branded content\nHere's a promo for a block of branded content that ran after Family Guy\n... more on Fox has only rarely do we fought for skin they listen to ... take on French I'm with a five minute we can't we can't say whether\nSunday Sunday edition sponsored by Google visuals race\nHere now media analyst John Carroll joins us now John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what what's going on with ranking behind this\nRight that's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brand the content of the overall thinking here Fox believes and many people do that audiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots\nAnd also trying to reform at some of the advertising into branded content which is marketing package as entertainment or new\nSixty second breast started these nine sixty second breaks jazz pods jackpot what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and Z which being sued traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial ... so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually eighty second you'd as they've got a promo in there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching it\nIs also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight right so brand new content is really adds in sheep's clothing so last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute block of brand the content there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and ah and other Mars candy ... brands and and basically it's due to a website with more of that kind of content\nIt's OK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in prime time by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for this\nSo the financial model is to charge more for the jazz pod so they could be double or triple the standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in in volume advertises like this they're not sure yet they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air\nIs worth something they're not sure how much it's worth\nSo this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nRise right as they say the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain it\nJohn Carroll here and now media analyst thanks very much thank you so is Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the automobile ride sharing and now car sharing have disrupted the taxi and rental car industries\nThere are also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest Sam ... is founder and CEO of a company called get around it allows you to rent your own personal car to other drivers\nAnd he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from the top conversations with business leaders\nSam your company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nWell I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost\nAsian by using the cars we already own so instead of buying a car you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that old cars will be shared\nYeah we fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen and that you know where we are today with personal car ownership that the entire ecosystem needs to be disrupted and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority but the minority and that every car will be assured car\nOkay so let's talk about the specifics how get around works right now it's available in what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an app you see what cars are around you and then what\nYeah so you ... you can look at the cars around you you can find that when you like to rent for anywhere from an hour or two you know multiple days you pick that car we run a real quick check instantly to make sure that you know your driver's license is valid and then instantly you have a car you locate it from the phone\nOn lock the doors and try one and you can rent some pretty nice cars by the way yes you can you know you can get anything from a previous to attack us led to a Porsche people share all sorts of course\nWell let's talk about the competition because there is a lot of it there's ... ah which has one point seven million monthly active users car to go as something like eight hundred thousand there's your company and then there's the old man of the group Zipcar which has been around probably the longest do you think the markets too crowded\nNo we think this is a massive opportunity this disrupting a trillion dollar market which has car ownership and so the main competitor here is people buying cars the more you can shift people away from ownership towards access to more of this market gross for all players\n... well some of your competitors might also be something like ... or lift um Cox Automotive recently did a survey that said\nThat those companies and sought customer's increase by Seventy seven percent since two thousand and Fifteen but car sharing only increased by Seventeen percent what do you what do you think about that I mean are people really that eager to rent their car from a stranger when they could just jumping to lift\nI don't know the methodology on the Koch study um I I certainly know what we've seen and it's been much much higher than Seventeen percent increase in businesses twenty Fifteen\nSo you know I think that the way we think about that and what we hear from our customers\nIs that people are looking at moving away from ownership but they can't rely purely on ride sharing a they can't rely on car sharing they need a combination of you know public transit car sharing and Roger to really allow them to live car free in fact we have a very public partnership with over a where they've heard the same thing\nMark but so you believe people really do want to live without a car\nI think if you offered them mobility an equivalent level as you get today from ownership that's absolutely true you know\nThis summer you got a big injection of cash three hundred million dollars from softbank the Japanese from what's your plan for the money\nIt's pretty straightforward I mean we plan to continue doubling down on expanding into new cities are both the United states and her nationally and then you know we've been very fortunate to partner or some some great companies like to over so it was continue investing those partnerships and expanding our roster partners\nWell speaking of labor and Toyota I mean these are companies also that are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves\nIs a great question and it's something that we've since day one than sort of very aware of in fact it was a ton of cars that drove us to the idea of getting around which is if\nYour car could drive itself would you really park at twenty two or twenty three hours a day you'd probably the other people use it and is maybe you'd start with friends and family are colleagues but eventually strangers just makes sense\nSo we really see the rise of autonomy as it begins to become a more prevalent as something that makes our marketplace more fluid allows those cars to be used by more people different cases and in fact as autonomy comes around it actually opens a lot more opportunity as to what can be done\nThrough a you know a marketplace get around or checking people or owners of vehicles with um you know companies and individuals that need access to\nI'm just thinking how that would work let's go Fifteen twenty fifty years down the road a ton of vehicles are here and they're here to stay [noise] would I just call a vehicle from somebody's parking space that isn't being used to have it come to me than drop it off and then it would go somewhere else\nYeah I think you can imagine that but I mean in the world were were fifty years out in the town of me as sort of a mainstream technology I think you think you're actually in a world where\nYou know the cars we know today is different the foreign factors of those cars have changed and you know fundamentally we're talking about a sort of a fluid network of cars that will be operating in around cities and outside of cities in suburban areas\nUm any of those cars might be self driving but they're fundamentally not you know self cleaning or self maintaining until there's a lot of infrastructure and sort of network functioned is required to sort of operate those vehicles and that's very close to even what we do today right we help owners\nShare cars efficiently in urban centers across the United states and we work with partners who helped service those cars or keep them on line and and continue to operate the network and so we see\n\nFunding for here and now comes from that part of the creators of that law

a former Democratic congressman from California\nGerman welcome back and you think the u._s. should consider new sanctions against Saudi Arabia over this\nI think condoning murder is something we should not stand for our foreign policy is based on values and interests and values that we have in this country a rule of law and a freedom of the press or both of which were violated in this case I Believe\nA an interest that we have are working with allies like Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has been our ally\nAgainst things like a Iran's malign behavior in in the region and surely Iran has been engaged to proxy terror groups in malign behavior especially targeting Israel but also elsewhere I mean a Saudi Arabia claims that Iran is meddling in Yemen\nAnd Yemenis targeting Saudi Arabia and that's why Saudi Arabia is in Yemen but at any rate uh I don't see how a condoning what happened even though we have an incomplete a picture of what happened\nIs in the U.S interest and therefore I think that a sanctions against Saudi Arabia if we have proof that there was a murder here are appropriate but I also ah suggest that perhaps the thirty three year old\nCrown prince a has a some some growing up maturing to do and that it might make sense from the Saudi point of view\nAdult supervision are there are so that excesses in his behavior\nWould stop happening I think that would be and Saudis interest I think that the the war in in Yemen has created the the largest could see Manny ... humanitarian catastrophe that we currently she and I think that this episode especially if\nThere was a Saudi cover up and plot ah to to do this is a really shocking and in every sense\nBut do you think that the Trump Administration which has been watching the war in Yemen go on for years now and and hasn't put the pressure on the Saudis to uh stop it that this was going to change President Trump's relationship for example with the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nI think the Trump Administration wants Saudi Arabia as a good ally in the middle east and also as a good trading partner I think those are two agendas that it has\nAnd ah I'm not against either agenda uh but what I'm against is condoning bad behavior or in order to make sure that agenda continues a I think we can do both\nAnd that is NBS the reason we have that agenda I don't think so I think Saudi Arabia is the

not about me it's about you and our country has that been working out for him\n[noise] ah it's been a struggle for him I think it will be fair to say she has been struggling to break into the lead in this race he is in the lead by um you know some recent public polls but it's been hard for them and that's surprising in New Jersey which is largely a a very blue democratic state\nWell and ... and has been trying to draw attention to the ethics issues associated with imminent as Syria's on Fox News earlier this month\nWe've been over four hundred campaign stops already event meeting with the jerseys of every location in our state they want change they're embarrassed by this guy you know he violated federal law abused the power of his office\nJob despite all of that uh there been some Democrats high profile Democrats who have been sticking by Menendez Hillary Clinton was just there for a fundraiser\nNationally he's getting some support from the party to Senate majority pac just dropped several million into the race to cement Menendez is lead and in New Jersey Democrats largely are standing with him um uh you know top leaders in the party here senator Cory Booker his colleague in the Senate\nThey're all standing by him and I should note that his corruption trial ended in a mistrial so he was not found guilty by the jury he was however admonished by the Senate for ethics violations so when ... says he was guilty of violating federal law that's what he's referring to\nAnd what about Bob he's he's a former executive at a biotech company that developed cancer drugs and he's been criticized for raising prices on one cancer drug here's Sen Menendez speaking to USA Today\nAnd at the end of the day is a question about\nWho's judgment you want sitting in the Senate fighting [noise]\n... you can raise the price on cancer patients last year alone not once not twice with three times for drugs that those cancer patients with ugly need\nNow he has blamed insurance companies for some of the costs of the drugs that his former company makes he's called for changes in how drugs are priced but when you look at hue again as a candidate he's also pro choice he's pro marriage equality um tell us more about him\n[noise] well it's true that his company or the company is called ... and they're based in New Jersey they did raise the price of their blockbuster cancer drug revel in that they've doubled it in less than a decade you would say that many patients are vast majority of patients didn't actually see that price increase when it came to their bills because it's got to go through\nInsurance companies and all that but the price of the drug did go up\n... and has also you know uh settle a lawsuit from a whistle blower who said that the company was advertising drugs for causes that weren't approved by the FDA\nBut you're right that ... is trying to run a moderate Republican campaign he's pro choice\nHe he's been talking a lot about women and and the equity of pay for women but he is also tied to Donald Trump he spent a hundred thousand dollars on the campaign to elect Donald Trump he he he went to the\nThe Republican convention so you know he doesn't have a record voting record for people or journalists to look at he's a he's a first time a political candidate but he has supported Trump and the Republican Party in the past\nFrom the voters you're speaking with how much is Trump a factor compared with ... ethics issues\nYeah you would think Trump was on the ballot this year because people keep keep talking\nAnd and for a lot of people they see you know ... tied to Trump and Menendez tied to his trial and they're trying to decide on the lesser of two evils that that is you know the calculus for many people in New Jersey this year\nIt's been a long time since New Jersey had a competitive Senate election\n[noise] yeah um you know it's been about forty years since the state elected a Republican to the Senate New Jersey's pretty pretty reliably democratic and that way I mean you know we had a Republican Governor Chris Christie for eight years\nNew Jersey is quite blue when you look at you know voter registration and things like that\nHowever these races do happen um you know New Jersey often does elect a Republican and and and ... them for a long time Republican Congressman Frank little beyond those retiring this year after decades in Congress so it does happen but it's surprising\nThis race it's surprising how close it is because of ... support and the party\nAnd just his popularity and previously\nThat is

I Can't even remember a time before the smartphone existed\nAnd that's a time when social life is very important where teams are forming their identity when what really shapes and a lot of times is the time that they spend with their friends\nAnd how they spend time with their friends has fundamentally shifted to go on line social media and texting and away from hanging out with each other in person\nDo you see people in this generation who shunned this way of life who who decided that they don't want to be on their phones all the time even though they've never known any other way\nWell there is certainly awareness or that a lot of times they're spending too much time on their phones they will in their own words often describe themselves as addicted\nBut Ninety five percent of teens um had a smartphone now and it it is become it has become a normative to spend hours and hours a day on the phone to always respond to your friends text instantly to want to be the first to post a like an ... and so it's a real cultural norm that shifted\nAnother thing that is different about this generation we we've been hearing that the generations are becoming more diverse in this country but generations ear I ... is actually even more diverse than the millennial generation\nYeah absolutely so they are the most diverse generation in American history and that's reflected in these big um surveys that I work with whether asked about um their experiences with um people from different backgrounds so say high school students of course\nThe cities to hang out with people from different backgrounds that's definitely more common among ige and then it was just say ten years ago with the millennials\nWe mentioned nine eleven how do you think U.S foreign policy has shaped this generation\nWell\nThat's hard to tell from the the data that we have because um you know foreign policy is arguably it's changed the most in the last\nFew years with the Trump Administration and we don't have that survey data yet\nBut the U.S has been at war for the entire lives of many of these people\n[noise] true um but because there's not a draft that hasn't had a direct effect on the majority of the country\nHowever companies marketing to this generation in a different way than they have to the millennials for example\nYeah they they do have to market to this generation differently because there's this such that big a generational shift I think a lot of them are picking up on the same trends that show up in these big surveys such as\nI Jen is really interested in safety is not something you usually associate with teens and young adults but in our conversation and what they say in um you know they're in their attitudes and in their behaviors\nAre very interested in physical safety and what they call emotional safety and I think that's something companies are starting to pick up on and um I think is well that there's a lot more awareness\nAround stress and anxiety that um companies are realizing is another theme um with this group\nSo we're just a a couple of weeks away from the mid term elections do you think that many of these potential voters will actually vote Generation Z people\n[noise] I Wish I could say yes I'm\nBut statistics from past elections and what they say about their attitudes toward getting involved in politics and government and voting or are not encouraging so in these big surveys Eighteen year olds are now less likely to say it's they're interested in government or social issues or politics\nDan teams were say Twenty years ago why do you think so um well I mean because there's so many other things to do\nThere's always the possibility of a you know something new to see on I'm On social media or new game to play or a new series to watch on Netflix and you know I think some ... some of the interviews that I did a lot of teens\nYou know say well you know we have all these other things to do while we pay attention to\nI mean I've had many conversations with people who are in this generation and I always find that yes they they are definitely more reliant on their phones their mobile devices the Internet in general [noise] um but they're also often really smart I I'm quite impressed sometimes when I speak with them\nOh absolutely that definitely smart I mean they've they've had access to all of this information and um they're quick thinkers on there's actually data showing that IQ has has gone up over the generations so I think ... is definitely not the issue\nSo obviously a generation Z is going to have to deal with some of these problems on their own as they get older ... and and even right now what can those of us in the other generations due to to assist in any way with some of the problems of this generation\n[noise] well I think we do need to be aware I just how severe um the mental health crisis says right now among teens and young adults so there's a little awareness around that but not half as much as they as there should be that we're seeing unprecedented levels of depression and\nSelf harm a among teens and young adults now and we need to have more resources and more awareness of that causes behind that and then more funding and awareness for treatment\nIs Jean ... who is professor of psychology at San Diego State University and author of I Gen gene thank

four seven auto\nThis year and now with less than three weeks until the mid term elections many are wondering if the polls are correct and Democrats will make big gains in the house or if like in twenty sixteen there's a lot more Republican enthusiasm than it's being reported\nFrom Boston Globe reporter and editor Ben Bradlee junior just spent some time in a key county in Pennsylvania which President Trump won he profiles twelve Trump voters in his new book just out the forgotten how the people of one Pennsylvania county elected Donald Trump and changed America\nAnd Bradley junior welcome to hear now that you will first tell us about this county in Pennsylvania [noise] this is a\nCounty ... county in northeast Pennsylvania [noise]\nThe edges and has been hurting for a long time\nAnd combing through a vote in the three critical swing states Pennsylvania Michigan or Wisconsin I discovered loser and county which is a traditionally democratic county hadn't voted Republican since Nineteen eighty eight for Bush senior\nPresident Obama want it to time President Obama\nWon it twice but its surged in the other direction for Trump and he wanted by twenty points building up such a margin in this one county that it was sixty percent of his victory margin for the state of Pennsylvania so without this one county or he wouldn't have wanted to state or perhaps the presidency\nAnd you profiled twelve people in this book how did you find them well I went down\nInitially poking around and you do what the journalists do you go to community leaders and a newspaper editors talk show host and learn who the Trump voters were and start talking to them and one person a region to another\nAnd ended up interviewing a over the months a about a hundred in depth but settled on twelve a who stories I decided to tell and I think that this is a window or a deep dive if you will into the Trump vote and that\nAt least more than half the country remains shocked at a candidate as unusual as Trump got elected and there's a hunger to know more about how it happened\nAnd you talk to a number of people who all kind of had different reasons for supporting Trump you you you dipped into many different views of him one of the people that you spoke with Tiffany cloud\nTold you that Trump's simple ... speak like huge big league or big league may have turned out voters in other parts of the country but it helped him connect with people in Lewes earned county but I think people base\nMost of their vote for president on the extent to which they can relate to them on a human level a how likeable they are I think that that is in the end more important than where they stand on a variety of issues and\nI think the people that I settle on a generally like Trump on most issues but really liked his style they just like she's a is moxie his feisty and that's how we get up every morning and I'm ... has uh\nHe was being condescending toward them that he was talking down to them\nNo on the contrary they felt heard and listen to and felt that Hillary was talking down to them especially with her now infamous remark calling them the deplorable [noise]\nOne of the things that we were talking about during the campaign is that what Trump was saying\nWas not what he actually met or not what many people were hearing from him um and and you talk to people here in loser and county who you know they hear him say I'm going to build a wall and what they would here is like not actually going to build the wall but he's gonna he's going to beef up the wall\nYeah the interesting they talked about the importance of deep coding Trump saying that the press was unfair to them to him and would treat him or to literally by merely covering or what he said we would get into lively discussions about this and I said well that's the press his job candidate\nSays something and the press is supposed to report it and they said no no you really making too much of a hall of blew out of you know the Access Hollywood tape and we know what he meant that kind of thing and so it was a way of apologizing for him and trying to make his rhetoric a understandable [noise]\nWhat about religion this is a place that is very Catholic um and it's also a place that used to be big in the coal industry that that's gone away but how much does religion play into how people view president\nTrump it's still predominantly Catholic not majority so that's a rising are evangelical population Trump's um evangelical vote was off the charts he carried a eighty percent of the evangelical vote\nSo I I talked to I'm a woman for whom Trump was literally sent by God\nShe believed that Trump was sent to cure America's political dysfunction ...\nAnd does she feel like he's delivered she does he's appointed evangelicals to his cabinet vice president Pence is evangelical they're willing to um excuse the Stormy Daniels business as essentially much ado about nothing\nThat he's been married three times they don't care for them the the most important issues are abortion\nAnd his delivering too conservative Supreme Court justices what about you\nTeen this is a place where there's not a lot of opportunity there also a lot of drug overdoses going on I mean this is you could go there and just do a book about the opioid crisis in this area\nThe opioid crisis is really bad they're really bad and it's affecting the entire county even if you\nDon't have someone in your family who is a an addict I'm the ripple effect is a widespread and or the county coroner\nDown there and he is uh just overworked and a thinks that it's an enormous problem and just trying to raise public awareness\nAbout it but it's pretty bleak in Missouri and county\nAnd young people are leaving is a brain brain is not a lot of opportunity beyond\nMaintenance and I'm working in warehouses minimum wage jobs\nAnd do they think that things have gotten any better under Trump\nMaybe at the margins the unemployment rate has gone down in the county as it has a nationally and perhaps it's a little bit better there but a lot you know a lot of the economic promises that Trump made during the campaign he hasn't really followed through on you know he said he would repeal and replace Obamacare\nOr the individual mandate has been repealed but he's been really a sabotaging Obamacare and there is no neither Trump for the Republican Party have come up with an alternative plan\nHe said that he would reduce the deficit by in his first or eight years\nGoing up the budget he filed in February or a shows a seven trillion dollar increase so no Republican Party doesn't seem to care\n... ... what about these voters do they care about those things they don't hasn't been able to do they don't seem to really care in the final analysis because they just like Trump I think it's it's personality over or anything else do you think that the Democrats are\nConnecting now with the people of Lucerne county I remember speaking to the liberal filmmaker Michael Moore who said you know they they didn't even try to win a place like Michigan or in the last election they didn't come here the way that Trump did\nUm there's been a lot of criticism that Democrats are ignoring these people that you've been talking to in in places like was there and county well they certainly\nOh to listen more to Democrats what other people that I talked to were Democrats but felt that the party had left them rather than they leaving the party\nAny thoughts on what might happen in the midterms well if\nI had to guess I Would think the uh this so called blue wave I don't know how big it will be but I think probably big enough for the Democrats to retake the house but not the Senate\nThen by the junior one of the things I really liked about this book is that you gave us a glimpse in to the minds of many people who voted for Trump but\nDid so with respect for their views and I feel like a lot of the um reporting even on people in the middle of the country that's coming from reporters and and and others on the coasts tests to look down on on them you didn't do that here\n[noise] [noise] [noise]

schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school in Manhattan which began to group the few minority students in the same home room so they'd have a place where they felt less like the other here's director Philippe Casson\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience but the parents\nOf some of the minority students headed smelled of segregation and they worry that gave their kids the feeling of being left out so the school end of the policy our question is it the right thing to a group African American or Hispanic students together when they are the minority in school\nWe turn to Dr Beverly Tatum she's the author of the best seller why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria she's also former president of Spelman College in historically black college for women\nThat container and the director the little red schoolhouse said they're revisiting this maybe it should have been more structured but then it was very well intentioned your thoughts [noise] um I think it\nWas well intentioned and certainly there's a lot of\nEvidence to suggest that there is value to give\nBlack kids time together sometimes that time together is called affinity grouping not necessarily in class time but time in a school time to talk to each other about the issues that adolescents are concerned about that can be very helpful talk about what is happening\nFor these teenagers because as you write in your book and the chapter called why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria [noise] it seems like\nIn high school was happening one of the things that's happening is the changing adolescent brain meaning that as kids move into puberty they start to think in a more sophisticated way they start to recognize the ways in which race plays itself out and you know there's lots of literature to suggest\nThat a black boys in school in particular I'm more likely to be disciplined for similar behaviors and also girls\nExperiencing questions about what does it mean to be a young black girls and having space to talk about that is not a bad thing it can be actually a very helpful thing\nThe stereotypes that we see of black women are imposed on them and so they might develop some oppositional behavior explain that sure well if I\nAm a young African American students and I'm trying to understand what it means to be a black person in a white dominated society\nOne of the things that I might be thinking about is\nI don't want to be perceived as quote acting white some social scientists have said you know the black kids think doing well in school is acting white but that's not universally true if you are in a largely black school and a lot of black kids are in schools that are segregated\nBecause their neighborhoods are segregated they're going to the local school\nAnd if you are in a school like that\nThe honor students are black but if you are in a predominantly white school the honors group is largely white and most of the black and brown kids are in the lower tracks if that's what your school looks like than you are likely to think doing well in school being in that on his track is so called acting why\nIt's such a vicious cycle because very often the kids are in those lower ... maybe because they come from low income families but very often there's bias on the part of the teacher that puts a child in that track when in fact they should be in a higher tractors a lower expectation\nBut what ends up happening is in a sense that they don't belong anywhere else so they start to bond further with the group that they're in\nIn fact tracking often does result in re segregation with in racially integrated schools for the reason we were just talking about the kids of color are being put in the lower ability groupings\nPerhaps because they are less well prepared and maybe that's related to family income and previous preparation but sometimes it isn't about that because there's also data that's the ...\nLess likely to be placed in those upper tracks you know the the the little red school so they looked at research it was probably yours in your book but\nTo read that was pretty amazing that have the same test scores that deal not be placed so what do we do\nAbout how to address this notion that perhaps there should be some support without making it look like segregating them or again reinforcing the low expectations this brings us\nTo the Boston medical program the greater Boston metropolitan counseling for education opportunity program Nineteen Ninety four the notion of bussing kids from the inner city from troubled spots in the inner city out to the suburbs very good schools but all white schools\nIt was kind of a failure at first talk a little bit about that and then what sure so most of the children who are traveling from Boston and to the suburban schools are black or Latino\nAnd often there's a sense of not really belonging they are not part of the local community and so when superintendents of these programs look at the performance of the black kids in particular\nThey often find that the kids are not doing as well as they would like them to be doing this also may not um echo but you had another anecdote about a young girl who was in a school a majority white and the teacher\nWas saying are you going to the dance kid doesn't want to say how we're going to get to the dance you know I I get busted school my parents don't have cars we lived in the city but she doesn't say that and to teach you get so frustrated that she won't say she's going to the dance\nThat she then ends up saying something racial she says oh come on you people love to dance which adds to the racialized moment that the young girl was feeling exactly\nThat teacher who made that comment was well intentioned but nonetheless projected a stereotype and it made the students feel even more like she didn't really belong in that school yeah but there was a program back in the nineties I was very involved\nAnd uh one of the districts I was involved with decided to start a program in the middle school\nFor medical students and they set aside one period a day for the kids to meet together to talk about issues related to academic performance academic achievement as well as some of the social concerns they had\nA minute this is a little little red schoolhouse his whole room it sounds like there isn't it but what the difference between this experience and the little red schoolhouse is that they did it\nThat experience improved academically and also they became more engaged socially why what are the kids say happened\nI'm at the kids said they felt more supported\nThey had the opportunity to talk without invoking stereotypes about some of the things that were challenging them\nSo if you've been riding on a bus from Boston for an hour and maybe there's been conflict on the bus you could go to that meeting and talk about it get it off your mind and then the more focused in class or if something happened in class let's say here's an example that one of the kids provided in this study\nUm they were watching a film eyes on the prize which is about the civil rights era and some of the white kids were laughing at something that happened in the film something that the black kids found upsetting\nAnd so the fact that their white peers were laughing as though it were funny and the black kids were feeling like this is horrible\nI'm was upsetting to them rather than a walking around agitated they were able to talk about it the brief it's so to so to speak in that um [noise] time together in ways that they found helpful by the way the title of your book again why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria\nNobody ever asks why the white kids in the cafeteria\nTheir bonding in in many ways\nAbsolutely and it's also important to say as you just did\nWe don't ask why all the white kids sitting together in the cafeteria but in fact at the college level it is actually the white students who are more likely to be racially isolated it is possible for white kids still to not engage with the diversity to stick to people who look like themselves\nJust such an odd thing in any high school or just about every college the entire culture is black whether it's the music comedians that they're following or the sports figures it must be very odd for young blacks to see that\nIt's true I mean certainly the cultural references that you talked about so you know those black artist to his music becomes mainstream you know those athletes who are admired by white teens as well as kids of color um those are physical symbols\nFunding for here and now comes from backwards greeters of that law that stimulates software accelerating the pace

because he was regarded as one of the twenty century the most powerful story tellers it was too low brow for the more abstract world of twenty century down here to balance the great Russian born choreographer and cofounder of the New York city ballet who hired\nA thirty one year old Robbins in Nineteen forty nine to be that companies associate artistic director\nAuthor Wendy lesser says she's made it her vow her sworn duty to overturn the prevailing miss about Robbins her new book Jerome Robbins a life in dance and she joins us now when the lesser welcome thank you for having me Robyn just you know thinking of the west Side Story scenes that we that are now in our minds\nYou write it to that I hadn't heard that in the film version these sharks and jets snapping their fingers are like above us we're beneath them somehow and that's because Jerome Robbins had trenches dug\nRight and if you go back and see the movie and I have to say although I Love the ballets and I am championing knows them in this book I Am not saying anything bad about west side story is a master piece it's a great work and so\nBecause he was so good in that field for the reasons you said his ballets got the wrong sort or not enough attention right anyway about the west Side Story family yes he had trenches dug into the street and you can actually go and see the movie again and see that you are lower than the dancer and I\nThink it will be fabulous well so how does this all start you are familiar with the ballet world had certainly observed it um had written about it and then you started writing this book for Yale University presses Jewish lives series for the hundreds centennial a journal Robin ... birth\nCertainly knew about his works as we all would know about west side story and and the king and I\nAnd then you're bowled over by something you didn't know about I didn't either until you wrote about it the journal Robbins Nineteen Seventy one ballet Goldberg Variations for the New York city

this valley what did you see that\nThat really got you [noise] the thing is that I went to that program not ever having heard of a Goldberg Variations by Jerome Robbins I didn't know he did a dance to it [noise]\nAnd I went to see the west Side Story fleet which was on the same program and to my enormous surprise Goldberg Variations turned out to be an incredible masterpiece Eighteen minutes long with a live\nIn a stove or on the side every kind of movement you could imagine standard ballet folks dial\nFriendly formal it was just an amazing range of dance it use thirty dancers and all and it had\nFeeling of the music I Can't say anything better about a piece of dance than to say that had the feeling of box cobra variation and I loved it so much I went back the following week and then I thought something's going on here that I don't know about I think of him as\nThe west Side Story man that Peter Pan manned fiddler on the roof man but really if he can do a ballet like this how many others could have done\nAnd you even spoke to a friend who said oh yeah I saw that back when it first came out and I remember really loving it and then feeling a little bad about that\nThat's right that was the impression I got and I couldn't figure out exactly why that would be although I knew that Robbins had a reputation as being ...\nGuy he couldn't really do ballet although Balanchine never thought that\nBut then I read Amanda veils and\nDeborah Xiao it's excellent biographies two of them and they both mentioned in relation to Goldberg Variations that are encroaching had panned and that she was the most powerful a dance critic and absolutely the most powerful ballet critic of her generation\nAnd you said you sat there stunned at the beauty of this piece for however many many minutes\nUh she called it Ninety minutes of hard labor and also called germ Robbins affects all angry man that was later but you became as you write like a court appointed lawyer you were going up Robbins words as a ballet choreographer\nAnd so let's take a listen to some of it again the pieces and we will have as much visual as we can hear now dot org\nAfternoon of a fun Nineteen fifty three

paralyzed by polio [noise]\n\nHow is this a reimagining of the afternoon of a fun [noise]\nWell I I just love the stats and it's only about ten minute twelve minutes long you can watch over and over and it just feels wonderful every time it's not just a reimagining of the music better reimagining ... version that he did in the very beginning of the twentieth century the\nFun is the main character and he has a\nPriest is is dancing around them and stuff but he's practically a\nSolar whereas Robbins imagined this as a ... [noise] wonderful to where I think we're at simultaneously about the ballet world we're looking at two dancers in a studio partly and then it's also\nAbout a fond and his dream girl who\nComes and visit him and with those two dancers tend to kill the clip and Jack Kemp was it was a knockout\nAnd what are they they're like they're watching themselves in a practice mirrors\nThat is what it feels like and we are the mayor there looking toward us out in the audience but they seem to be looking at him near as\nSometimes doing a studio said that\nThe superior attitude toward things that had a plot he was Balanchine loved dances at a gathering which Robbins made and down and she said it was so great you should make more make more it's like popcorn and he said like you could eat at the whole thing endlessly popcorn\nAnd that's probably drove others you know off the cliff but let me ask you a little dances at a\nGathering this is a the dance Robin said to Chopin music in Nineteen sixty nine [noise] he had been away from the New York city ballet doing choreography for Broadway but this stance is at a gathering was an instant had to do\n\n\nAnd what do we see in this day dancing the gathering starts with a young man alone on stage and sort of ends up with him [noise] touching the stage after\nMany many minutes I you know it's quite a long ballet all the answers coming in and joining him and they all get to strut their stuff and they combine in many different ways but the idea is they are dancers hanging out together and so\nOne of the things Jerome Robbins did this happen stand up beside watching each other as others are dancing it's again like afternoon on a combination of\nA work that's meant for us and that it's meant to have\nA real worldly reality and the work that talks about itself being on the stage\n[noise] uh you talk about his childhood which was difficult fraught relationship with his mother\nUm and he became difficult there's a famous and encircle story about him backing up on stage during rehearsal you know he has his back to the audience that companies in front of him he's backing up back up and no one tells him that he's coming at the edge and he falls in the orchestra pit and no one comes to help him\nUm he you know can be cruel\nIn ... and a lot of people talk about his cruelty and there are many many stories about how difficult he was and not just to the dancers to Leonard Bernstein for instance when they were rehearsing west side story in Washington in a theater and Leonard Bernstein was sitting there near the front of the theater listening to the play his music\nFunding for here and now comes from WVU are Boston and your NPR station from college fine where consultants work with high school students to identifying achieved their goals in high school complete the college admissions process and negotiate merit scholarship awards more at college fine dot com\nAnd NPR and MORNING EDITION on this station tomorrow morning what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nTo secure now every president since Jimmy Carter has voluntarily released his tax returns to the public but Donald Trump has not here's Trump on it\nThough like right now I'm under routine hundred nobody cares deal and cares is you know you and a few people that is in question\nObviously the public didn't care because they won\nThe election very easily\nSome Democrats have been pushing to get Trump's tax returns released Here's Democratic congressman Bill Pascrell speaking in Congress in April\nI call on the German and ways and means just stopped delay and yet Mr Trump's tax returns now\nThe Democrats efforts have been sidelined by Republicans being in control but if the Democrats win a majority in the house in November it means they could get Trump's tax returns joining us to explain is George ... who's a professor of law and taxation at the University of Virginia school of law\nAnd former chief of staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation welcome to hear now high Germany so what is this law who is allowed to ask for the president's tax returns\nUm the law authorizes the chair of any one of three tax committees in Congress\nTo request the tax return information of any person or any business and directs the secretary the treasury to furnish the information that's requested a upon receipt the committee must examine the information in a confidential manner\nUm but it can important agents such as a staffer ... outside experts\nAre the law doesn't specify but I think given the significance of the possible action by the house in the house committee\nOr it would probably be very wise for the house the full house first to pass a resolution authorizing the committee share to make this request and to be very clear on what the legislator purpose of this is\n... and it would just require the Democrats taking the house to do this they wouldn't have to take both the house and Senate\nThat's exactly right so either committee or any of the committees connect unilaterally and so if the Democrats simply took the house it's not the Senate the house committee could proceed on its own a symbol le descended could proceed on its own if if the opposite situation\nIf the house ways and Means Committee or to get those tax returns does that mean the public is going to be able to see them\nWell I'm there is a further provision in the law that allows the committee after completing its investigation to submit any of the information that it's a pain to the full house or the full Senate and presumably would be by some kind of\nWhy but I think sound practice would say that there should be some reason why the committee feels it needs to share this more broadly beyond simply the committee and its staff what kind of ... could you think of\nWell you know there are any number of reasons it really depends a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with his this is a tax committee and so it certainly\nCould be a legitimate reason to examine because the committee has oversight over the tax function or the long history going back forty years in this country has been that every president has voluntarily turned over his tax returns\nAnd you know there is a good public purpose if you will for that and so the committee could be carrying that out beyond that obviously there have been stories of the New York times had a story about some of the tax filing\nPrior tax filing by um by Mr Trump's a father\nAnd there have been obviously a issues about potential conflicts of interest the New York times also raises the possibility of fraud in that story\nYes well I mean again I I Would think that you know it's it's up to the committee to in the house to decide what exactly it's doing and why it searching it but I I think I could come up with some very legitimate arguments purposes for the committee to take this action\nWhat is the history of this law goes back to Nineteen twenty four the law that allows the house to do this to to get somebody's tax returns\nYeah so it is a almost a hundred year old law\nAnd the circumstances when it came about and we're actually fairly close to our current circumstances of the law prior to this law allowed only the president to make a decision of who's tax information could be disclosed\nAt that time when the law was that law was in effect it frustrated Congress and the early Nineteen twenties\nUh there were a variety of reasons to principle one where they were carrying out a number of investigations of the executive branch\nIncluding the scandal that became known as the teapot dome scandal involving some high level executive branch officials are the committees that were investigating wanted to examine their tax returns and because\nEven though they were investigating you know I'm executives under the president and so obviously Congress realized she we're not really a co equal branch of government if we have to go through this kind of procedure\nAh there was a similar concern or about treasury secretary Andrew Mellon who um was an extremely wealthy and successful business person prior to going into government and like the president or did not surrender or\nPlace in a blind trust his business interests but simply a retain them while he was in office and that obviously been raised all sorts of questions in Congress is mind\nUh the the the Coolidge in ... that time was pushing through various tax legislation just like the existing in Venice ration pushed through at the end of last year\nAnd there were issues of well how would this legislation affect you personally how would it affect your businesses\nYou know so there was all of that going on in Congress ultimately decided to be a co equal branch of government it needed to have the authority to get this information directly just as the executive branch already had\n[noise] do you think that if President Trump's tax returns are released in some way if if the Democrats take the house and they're able to get them that people who want to see them will be satisfied with what they see because what are we really going to learn from them well that's a tough\nQuestion because obviously it depends on what people want to see and I can't really say that people will be set aside without knowing exactly what people want to see\nUm I Would think of some policy matter you'd want to see you know somebody who for example is very honest in their tax filing because that goes to the character of a person let's make sure that you first did file returns did pay taxes and paid more or less the right amount of tax\nBut if President Trump for example took a big loss on real estate in one year and didn't pay taxes for ten years after that that would be as he's been saying legal it may not look good to some but it also might not prove anything that people don't already know about him\nRight so I agree with that I mean what I've been thinking about more is in terms of character simply complying with the law but I think another area that would be fairly obvious\nLot of authority to undertake various ah relationships on behalf of the country and the question is\nWhat are the these decisions and is there some personal or business\nInterest on the part of some of the decision making going on I Would think that would be a very legitimate inquiry on the part of a number of people in the public and if they wanted to know that well that would be something that might come out from an examination returns\nAnd I would add one more thing which is whether he actually made as much money as he said he he did what we would find that out in terms of his yearly income yeah\nAlthough I think that you know you need to be a little cautious about that because of tax return typically doesn't really show the amount of income the way you and I might or the member but the public might think of that is you know how rich you are and and how much and so forth\nBecause a lot of that income of that sort doesn't actually translate into taxable income\nAnd so uh the return may not really show I mean there may show a relatively modest amount a taxable income and in fact as you say may show little or no taxes

NPR's lead politics editor hide him and go hey they're so obviously we're going to keep him close track of the story and learning more about who the suspect is who has been arrested what we know for sure though is just how divisive these crimes have become in American politics and I wonder if you can tell us why\n[noise] [noise] well I you know I mean polarization it has been at an all time high for quite some time uh you know you look back at a couple of different ...\nAre worse than than today but there's not much in between uh and you know President Trump let's be Frank has been somebody who has\nCreated the sense that the press is the enemy of the people he continues to say fake news at his rallies and a point the finger at the pen that we're all kept in at the rallies or behind the riser is I was at a rally in Houston people were very nice to me going in\nA happy to take my questions a lovely people to chat with and talk to by the end in through the middle of as a crescendo of just anti a media stuff so that's what comes to be seen and President Trump has been somebody who's been a take no prisoners\nYou know I'm kind of politician for anybody who disagrees with him\nBut to medical the president's started this week by calling for unity and then he has come to this place of that you're describing now and want to hear from a White House press secretary Sarah Sanders who was speaking on Thursday\nOr if the president I think could not have been more presidential yesterday when he spoke directly to the American people condemned this violence let's not get lost and who is responsible for this heinous act\nIt is the person who made and sent the suspicious packages let's not forget that that is ultimately the person that is responsible and will be held responsible by this administration know clearly\nThe president thinks he's being unfairly linked to the person who did this but why hasn't he been able to stick to that message of unity that he started this with\nI mean it's pretty typical pattern of President Trump's I mean this is somebody who anytime he has criticized or becomes the sort of a focus of criticism then he doubles down he trickles down he digs that ah you know that trench and just going to fight for every inch\nAnd you know to some respects with Sarah Sanders says is true or the people the person who committed this act um is going to be held responsible or its adjusts department that the president overseas and that person is largely responsible for what they did obviously\nAt the same time you can't ignore the climate that's been created in this country where people view each other in ways that are in human and that is that a recipe for disaster especially for people who might not be as mentally stable or as\n\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm ...

that the FBI all the other\nSources of your disposal they were protected it you know him and made sure the attorney general Jeff Sessions all ages older to make sure he was going to be okay this is the moment we're supposed to reach out and not just for the words but also with the actions with\nSome of the president has has not apparently reached out to any of those do whom the on the the male bombings there were bombs were addressed\nUm but I Wonder if you could tell us about the suspect we don't know a lot about him but if you were to believe that pro Trump ... stickers on the windows of his van he is apparently a Trump supporter so how would you as a Republican strategist Alice advise leaders of the party to address is\n... ... more than anything it's important that we not jump to conclusions and not speculate prematurely what his motives were but as you say looking at that van with a lot of the the photographs you saw\nAnd there was also that sticker on there with mention of CNN and it was not in a favorable term\nAnd I am a contributor CNN I met that building where this happened the other day or at least once a week and it it's frightening but I think from a Republican standpoint we need to send a message\nThat a while we can disagree politically we need to do so in a nonviolent way and we need to do so in a calm way and\nUh the best way to show if you're disappointed with the way things are in this country is to go vote and let your emotions be heard at the ballot box and I think it needs to be consistent and I will say\nThat in my view the call to end the race to the bottom starts at the top\nYou're saying starting at the top meeting with the president a drawl absolutely how do you think Democrats you deal with it\n[noise] well I think Democrats would be the same way that is no time to play politics the thing I while I disagree with the rhetoric that the president has been using for the last year and a half a couple of years regardless of the media is lock her up and all the chance all the things that we are only called through the mall I disagree with those\nI'm willing to say maybe he didn't know maybe he didn't understand the impact of those words maybe even if he did he never thought anybody would take\nActions upon those words I don't blame the president for the actions that have occurred but after those actions occurred the president now knows if those words have impact now we can judge him was full knowledge how he got what he does next and we're so far\nI'm not that impressed Alison I Would love to see him do a little bit more and say a little more\nI'm a motivation there\nOkay hang was with us if you can also NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson let's bring you back in uh we are awaiting this press conference from the Justice Department just remind us who is uh that we expect to hear from it and what are some of the unanswered questions that we're still waiting for\nYeah this is quite a line up we're waiting to hear from including the attorney general of the United states Jeff Sessions the FBI Director Chris Wray the U.S attorney in Manhattan Geoffrey Berman and that's important because that's where we think\nThis individual ultimately will be prosecuted where he will face justice several of those devices were recovered in New York and we know the FBI's New York field office has been particularly active we have a\nWe have an official from the FBI is New York field office William Sweeney we also have the NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill a we have the postal inspectors we have the secret service and somebody from the Capitol police as well so\nThis is a murders row of law enforcement it's very rare you see that many of these top officials on the stage in fact I have a question whether all these men are actually going to fit on that time on stage at the Justice Department\nAs for unanswered questions did he have any help did he have any help and are there other devices out there as we speak I've gotten an email confirming that Tom's dire a prolific democratic donor has confirmed that he was addressed such a package and there may be other such devices out there\nWe've got to find that out a law enforcement desperately is going to be hunting for those things because they fear they're dangerous even if they don't go offer detonate\nUm they do contain material that could be problematic and law enforcement wants to wrap their arms around all those devices out there they also want to find out whether this man had any help and what he was planning next if anything\nAs for motives it's not clear right now there is a social media account that's been linked to the suspect fifty six year old Cesar ... from South Florida\nIn that Twitter account he has gone off after a prominent Democrats including some of whom have who have been an address the use of these suspicious packages and that's one hand test\nNation That's NPR's Carrie Johnson I'm ... and just to to reset for the audience where we stand now with already the rest of the south Florida Man this morning in connection with a wave of suspicious packages addressed this week to political critics of President Trump law enforcement has confirmed that that man is Cesar ... fifty six years old as an address in Davey Florida\nAnd has a criminal record also has some ties to New York\nUh the arrest followed the discovery of three more suspicious packages and Carrie Johnson you just mentioned the Democratic fundraiser Tom Sawyer has said that he was the recipient of or at least the intended recipient of one of those packages and he issued a statement as well did he say anything about the package or how he found out that he was targeted\nYeah through a spokesman he said I'm ... it's confirmed that a suspicious package mail to Tom Steyer was intercepted had a male facility in California he says\nWe're thankful every one we work with is safe and sound that's our first priority but he says were seen as systematic attack on our democracy and the rule of law that extends much further than one isolated incident in Florida\nAnd he's talking about the need for people to come together and rebuild a democracy for each and every American I'm trying to find some unity\nAh during this very a dark period where many prominent Democrats had been at that uh recipients are intended recipient of these suspicious devices over the last few days\nRight I'm just thinking that if you are a prominent critic of the president and you have not yet been targeted but perhaps you could be because of positions\nThat you've taken and again we don't know fully know the motivation but this so far the the people who've gotten these packages up and critics of the president I'm Kerry have you have you been hearing from people who who are concerned that they could be next door that they're taking precautions in case they are\nI have been hearing from people former officials in the federal government and the Obama administration\nWho are trying to be more mindful of how they handle mail where they open mail and I'm being basically on the lookout for one of these suspicious looking a yellow mental envelopes with patenting that we've seen on the news for the last two days\nOf course on some of the targets of 'em were intended recipients of of these devices are really well known the attorney former attorney general Eric Holder\nThe former CIA director John Brennan this morning in New York another package was intercepted intended for the former director of national intelligence James Clapper and another one this morning in Florida intended for\nNot clear to me that were done yet apparently have\nAll those packages for all those people that you just mentioned were they all ... exactly the same so that you would continue to know what to look for a ... in in the mail string\nAnd for the vast majority of those packages the FBI or local police are both have confirmed that these were similar looking packages you know the energy that you've seen NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson I Wonder if we can bring back in the loop William Hunter former\nFBI special agent teaches in the criminal Justice Department Radford University of Virginia a new continue their yeah I'm here yes\nSo you've seen on TV a lot of scene and had described as as Kerry just did what the packages and look like\nIt at one point or if there are packages that are are more and more packages to come at what point um can you identify those is coming from either this suspect or somebody connected with the suspect or maybe some buddy who's a a copycat as often happens in cases like these\nYeah yeah yeah it's it's extremely difficult I mean you know ... it's obviously are easy to get some of these materials that that it's a lot of materials are are very common and so it's really going to take\nA a a close look by law enforcement to confirm whether or not\nIt is I'm the same suspect over a copycat 'em so you know we're talking about um review of ... the FBI a lab back in the field office looking at the actual forensics or so it's not going to be an easy call a quick\nCall until it's actually you've had a a thorough look at these things\nAt what point will you feel that the threat is over\nThere the threat is over yeah [noise]\nThat's that's a great question I mean I I think\nOf as a as a couple of things so first there's got to interrogate destruction so um if he's willing to talk and that's a that's a big gift um you know you can have\nA sense of of how forthcoming is how you know what his ... what else is out there the other thing is just as a collaborative than the electronic evidence\nIf you get in and with a search warrant and you're able to take a look at is I'm a computer his phone records that\nMight give you a really good sense of what all he's done I mean there may be just a ton of evidence at his house or in his car and it's a business and that's going to give you an idea of how extensive the threats are so I Would say within the next you know twenty four hours\nYou're going to have search orange executed you're going to have a done it initially generation\nYou know again it's working with someone else a tracking down any potential each other associates that made a healthy\n... special agent Luke William hunt a NPR's Carrie Johnson it looks like it would be like very soon\nTo the Justice Department for this press conference about the arrest that happened today just very quickly we know that there was a a white van with all sorts of political decals apparently pro Trump ... spent details on the side of it do we know for sure if this vehicle is directly tied to the suspect who was arrested\nHere's what we do know law enforcement is proceeding on the idea that it is somehow connected to the suspect that they have not said it is his definitively on the record I expect we're going to hear a lot more about that in the next two minutes or so when a news conference start as law enforcement decides to tell us\nWhat if anything this individual is charged with and how they know that\nAnd does he just like the individual you're talking about a fifty six years old of daily Florida where he is he right now\nHe is in federal custody or he was taken into custody in South Florida and the likelihood is that he as authorities are trying to find out more from him about whether he had any help whether they're additional packages out there and and any number of other questions they want to know to protect public safety\nWe have gotten a warning that this press conference with attorney general Jeff Sessions is going to be getting started with in the next few seconds I Want to say thank you dilute William hunt former FBI special agent thanks very much for your incite pleasure good to be here and Republican strategist Alice Stewart's um we uh we want to thank you to please hang tight\nBecause we do expect to hear from attorney general Jeff Sessions in just a moment\n[noise]\nIf you all for being here over the past week more than a dozen suspicious packages have been sent to through the United States Postal service through a media outlet\nA Hollywood actor and at least seven high ranking current and former political leaders and the Democratic party this is only unacceptable political violence or the threat of violence is antithetical to our vigorous system of self government\nI couldn't be more proud of the work each of them did in this case and the work they do every day we said from the outset\nWe would identify and the rest of the person or people responsible for these acts we can make that promise because of the confidence we have our ability to investigate in a deliberate precise manner\nToday's arrest means that New Yorkers in the day people across our nation are safe but its director ... said that might be more packages out there so I went still needs to take caution and if you see something out there called nine one one and in New York City we have a number also won eight eight eight NYC safe\nI Want to thank them as the public who contacted authorities with information during this investigation New Yorkers don't back down they step up every single time we've\nListening to special coverage of the Justice Department\nHer broadcasting the photos NYPD released because it's certainly help workers around our city identify additional packages and help move forward with this investigation thank you [noise]\nCould afternoon I'm Jeff from in the United states attorney for the southern district\nOf New York five days ago on October twenty second law enforcement recovered the first device from a resident of George Soros\nOver the last five days has more packages were found across the country delivered to former presidents federal officials in public figures are law enforcement community federal state and local has worked day and night\nTogether with other prosecutors from my office to identify and apprehend the perpetrator that has now happened\nToday my office has filed a complaint against Caesar say oc charging him with multiple federal crimes for the city of conduct [noise]\nSpecifically to defend his charge in five counts that included illegally mailing and interstate transportation of explosives and threatening a former president of the United states\n\nAs a legend a complaint the defendant male destructive devices to citizens of this country's who currently hold or have held our highest public offices president Brock Obama\nFormer secretary of State Hillary Clinton former vice president Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder Congress person Maxine Waters US Senator Cory Booker former CIA director John Brennan and former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nThe defendants conduct as charge is cowardly and reprehensible and totally anathema\nTo our democracy and now the defendant faces a potential total fifty eight years in prison [noise]\nThis is an ongoing an active investigation we will not rest until these crimes are fully investigated and the defendant or defendants are brought to justice\nI wanted to take a moment to thank our partners the joint terrorism task force the FBI the NYPD US postal inspection service New York state police the ATF\nThe hard working career prosecutors and investigators and the terrorism unit of the southern district of New York and I also like to thank the extraordinary cooperation we receive from the southern district of Florida that could\n[noise] good afternoon\nFirst of like me and my colleagues I like to thank all of our federal partners who participated in this nation wide investigation FBI ATF Secret Service New York police department and the ... local law enforcement agencies were about a valuable assistance Chile I can say this is the way law enforcement supposed to work\nThis was a massive investigation what's the what's a collaborative effort and was well coordinated with the say the sea bringing a special expertise to the table\nBut also like to recognize the mini postal employees who we think of as a eyes and ears were appreciating the diligence and awareness in fact it was a postal employee this morning that alert us to one of these suspicious ...\nWhere in the postal inspection service have a great deal of expertise in responding to an investigating suspicious mail\nPals suspects are trained to wreck respond and investigate dangerous man in the mail these dangerous male investigation specialists are highly proficient in the news the state of equipment\nFortunately in this case none of the devices detonate it and there was no injuries however postal spices will remain villages and monitor postal facilities to determine whether there are additional ... that have not yet been discovered\nWe will continue to work with law enforcement partners to ensure the safety of the male a postal employees are customers and the American public\n[noise]\nGood afternoon a textile us the secret service director\nJust as a uh the other speakers emphasized as of ... just want to comment on the importance of cooperation here\nOr we were in the forefront of this uh uh what are receiving early packages on Tuesday and Wednesday and now fully engage the joint terrorism task force another federal partners and just want to acknowledge the great work done by the FBI ATF the postal service and inspectors a New York city police Capitol police and then the different states involved in New York\nFlorida California Delaware Maryland even the district of Columbia\nSo and I also want to uh spend just a few minutes to emphasize or how seriously the secret service tasty threats how important it is to provide a protection to our ah protecting including four presidents and the current president and vice president and just thank our agents and officers and analysts are\nWho not only investigates cyber and financial crime provide world class protection to our protect these I think they've done outstanding work here [noise]\nI Would say or just a also remark that ah since Tuesday along with the director ray\nAnd they're bringing the justice thank you [noise] just drink and you\nAlong the lines of how fast this\nWhen did you folks a high school or something\nUh so\nEach of the devices was being brought a through what are called total containment vehicles to our lab and they were coming kind of Syria autumn a and we received some of them the first two that we were see where the devices that were sent to former President Obama\nA and B I director cleaver ... sodium Santa congresswoman waters and so the analysis began on that I think yesterday and we were starting to receive information over the course of the last twenty four thirty six hours was them yesterday\nKyrah fault our\nFor directory and a three year old fashioned\nDescribe your reaction to\nAlso could you give us a sense of why the\nSecond part of the\nSo of the first part of my reaction to hearing that we had a possible match\nOr just validated my unbelievable faith and confidence in mental image of law enforcement and in particular of the FBI lab there's a reason why the FBI's lab is\nKnown as one of the very best in the world and the folks who worked there are extraordinary and once I knew that they had a print I was pretty confident that we'd be able to find the right person as far as the the devices themselves\nA it's important to say as as is in the complaint\nOr that even if the devices and we're still trying to determine whether or not uh they were functional as they say is what we're doing all kinds of analysis on that to make a definitive determination but they did contain\nEnergetic material or which is subjected to the right combination of heat for shock of friction or could be dangerous to the public and the public should treat any device like that Gordon\nI'm telling you could you tell us plainly why was targeting\n[noise]\n\nI don't know and then uh what you might uh normally expect a a man apart ... appears to be a partisan but that would be a determined by the facts\nAs the case goes for now I'm not able to comment on that [noise]\nNot going to be this has been investigations stands at this time\n[noise]\nWe're focus not on the talk but on the work the work of the men and women of law enforcement here in the work that was done over the last week is something that should make every American proud and grateful and it's too early to stage for us to be discussing motivation in this particular case [noise]\nMight not sound like this pre survive [noise] we're concerned\nAbout people committing acts of violence under any motivation\n[noise] director you believe that he's the only one off\nAnd you continue to make reference to other\nYou have any sense of how many\nSo as I said at the outside and I think the attorney general's said as well uh this is very much an active and ongoing investigation uh we do believe that we've got the right guy a but we also know that this is an ongoing investigation and there's a lot of work still to be done which means there's still plenty of unanswered questions [noise]\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners off W.

it is mostly underwater hurricane lock a tour through the central Pacific earlier this month and literally white Easter Island off the map\nSatellite photos show only sliver of land where the eleven acre island once stood out from the ocean and climate scientists say a warming ocean could be to blame chip Fletcher is a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii he joins us now in in chip you were on Easter Island in July\nWhen you heard that it had just been washed away what what was your reaction\nWell it was quite stunning [noise] um I had not followed hurricane a well off and do it at headed north from us but it never occurred to me that it might be a head into\nFrench crickets shoals and do damage to these very important small islands [noise] um so I was quite stunned\nMost people have probably never heard of this island we're going to post before and after pictures it here and now dot org but to tell us about it and why it was important to you\nWell it's a beautiful place um my research team which consists of\nA undergraduate and graduate students and some postdoctoral researchers headed up there in July under a grant with the national fish and wildlife association\nLoose sand and gravel it's made of uh the skeletal debris of the surrounding reef system as small as it is it is absolutely critical to the Hawaiian green sea turtle into monk seals there is just not much land up there this is low\nWhere sea turtles could um digs their nests and lay their eggs safely and they're only about a half dozen of these that were left but in the last month we've lost two of them one of them being deceased island which was the largest one or that remained\nWhat are the implications for those animals nearly half of the world's remaining green sea turtles nest there and one seventh of all the Hawaiian monk seals alive today were born on this little islands I mean this this is very important for those animals will they survive without it\nYeah yeah um [noise] the implications for these animals are they will have to find new habitat and if you look at the photo that was taken this past weekend by government scientists who flew over the island\nYou can see a small little bit of sand still sticking up above the waves and there must be a dozen monk seals already hauled out on that so it points to the fact that this is really important land they'll have to find a new place for raising their young lay their eggs\nUm and there are fewer and fewer of these places left will they turned in the south and come to the main Hawaiian Islands that can be problematic because much of the doing area in the main islands has been developed with roads and houses\nCan they turn to the north to some of the other ... are there are some additional Sandy islands to the north but not very many huh\nYou knew this island was low line it was Sandy ... did you expect it to vanish one day or were you surprised at the hurricane to this much damage\nWell answer is yes to both of those I figured\nThat this island under the threat of sea level rise maybe had another decade or two or three but certainly by mid century um it it would I Would be surprised if it were still in existence\nI didn't expect with a location this far north that it's still a very strong chance of being intersected by hurricane\nBut of course with climate change these weather systems are finding new pathways they're migrating away from the equator and their new areas new habitats and new human communities that are being threatened by hurricanes that that hadn't happened before\nThe twenty Eighteen hurricane season we're seeing actually is one of the most intense on record in the Pacific um or the other islands around there that are there are also in danger or their other problems that you foresee happening because of that\nYes it was and still is a very intense hurricane season and I think a earlier this week we saw a hurricane\nHundred miles per hour the average wind speed was up around a hundred and sixty five miles an hour and um you know this is an example of what a category ... hurricane would look like even though we have no such category ... such last year as hurricane season and\nTwenty Seventeen scientists are now thinking uh with for growth in hurricanes are getting larger the wind speed stronger maybe it's time for a new category\nIs there a chance that Easter Island could come back someday\nThere is a chance for sort of crossing our fingers it looks as if the sand um was moved by the hurricane to the north and north east\nThe trade when waves\nMay push that Sam back towards a word originally was and we might see some accretion or building of the island but our understanding of these islands is that they formed on a fall\nIn sea level around two thousand years ago we are currently in a stage of rising sea level and so the fundamental background conditions for reform in this island or don't exist\nThat chip fluctuate a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii thanks for speaking with us yeah thank you\nAnd other conversation now with connections to climate this one pertaining to the economy the U.S economy grew at three and a half percent in the third quarter of this year according to government figures out today one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on is that economic growth is good for everybody\nBut our next guest argues the uprising economic growth has quoted driven us into a ditch from an environmental standpoint\nAnd chasing Chowdhury is the executive director of the Brooklyn Institute for social research he\nSays if we want to deal with climate change small incremental change won't work he says we need to rethink our system of capitalism starting with our obsession with economic growth because of focus on growth causes us to prioritize the wrong things\nThere are lots of things in the short term could mean certain kinds of economic growth there's a lot more money right there's a lot more than ... GDP to be made an extra activism than there is in and sort of sustainability\nUm so actually what we need to really think be searching the conversation from and this is a huge shift it's not just a shift about policies that shift about the way we imagine politics the lady imagine economics\nIs not so much do we want growth do we want less wrote it what do we actually want from ... usually when people say oh I Want high growth rates what they mean something like\nOh high growth rates are going to lead to more prosperity um but I\nAnd yet somehow China seems to be able to turn those into slightly better social outcomes than India is a lot of what we associate with growth um can be achieved through other means distribution or means other ways of thinking about economic outcomes than what we currently talking about\nIs this an academic exercise or do you really [laughter] half of\nIt is possible do I think it's like a hundred percent uh like it's a certainty no in fact there's like so much arrayed against it I think so often this conversation about climate change\nOr gets ... and he's like hilarious things like oh are you like how much plastic surgery recycling how much are you can posting have you eaten more beans and meet\nRight like as opposed to like how have you worked to make an actual democratic politics more possible today right have you become part of a movement how are you doing those things those things are actually much more important believe it or not that our individual consumption Joyce\nWhat kind of movement I mean like one give give me one thing okay so I could not I'm not going to eat red meat any more but you're not stead of that you\nBecome part of movement that would do what\nAnyone who is emphasizing any movement that is trying to move the needle to give more power to popular sovereignty and less to Capitol less to the sovereignty of of concentrated wealth and money\nIs going to not necessarily cause all the changes that I Am saying it but it is necessary but what kind of movement give us an example\nThat you can think of to sort of a tendencies one is the sort of rise above sort of reinvigorated left or whether you associate that with\nA democratic socialist America or other movements um that is a very important part of the conversation\nAnother would be very local organizations but with a sort of very grand division or this will be groups like cooperation Jackson, Mississippi who are really trying to build a sort of ... go I'm sustainable society from the ground up meaning what\nOh meaning that they are working you know both to set up a sort of\nA system of greater democratic government they are trying to and they are succeeding in some ways to build\nA sort of ego sustainable city from the ground up including agriculture including manufacturing\nUm but that doesn't ignore these political and economic parts of the story right that are trying to put really a democratic control as necessary medium through which this management as possible so that's a very a local a response on their national responses um they're even ...\n\nFunding for here know comes from carbon I offering secure data protection solutions for growing business was\nIncluding automatic back up for servers and computers higher availability and disaster recovery solutions an automated data migration\nLearn more at ... dot com and from Sen gauge working to make higher education more affordable with a sin gauge unlimited subscription students can access over twenty two thousand each text books online homework access codes and study guides\nSon gauge unlimited C.

Scott\nWhat is Nikki Haley's record as UN ambassador and how much credit does she get ... for what we just heard\nWell actually we should say the international uh surveys by the Pew Research center suggested a attitudes in most countries towards the United states and the president have fallen rather sharply since Trump took office\nAlthough it is certainly true that the president has demonstrated if he says he's gonna blow something up he does whether it's a airstrip in Syria or the Iran nuclear deal\nOr you have definitely seen the U.S uh\nUh pushing forward with the president's America First agenda and Haley has been a an effective and the president today said glamorous advocate that agenda uh you can see it in the way the U.S\nA has\nA a more aggressive posture towards Israel I'm moving the U.S embassy there for example to Jerusalem\nAnd Nikki Haley famously criticize those who criticize that move saying the U.S would would take names most notably of course the U.S has pulled out of the Paris climate accord we we saw the report this week from the un climate agency\nTo testify today a panel of judges are reviewing that request NPR national correspondent ... long is following this story he joins us now I ... I Would say you have I Know rents thousands of government documents about this what did you learn from them about how the citizenship question came up out in the first place [noise] all\nThese documents were part release in part as part of the lawsuits over the citizenship question and it really key document is an internal memo written by commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who asked our secretary oversees the Census Bureau and the twenty twenty cents is\nAnd it it he says that he initially thought about adding a citizenship question to twenty twenty cents is as soon as shortly after he became ... the Senate confirmed him as the commerce secretary so this would be late February of twenty Seventeen and then a over those months he\nWorked with his staff at the commerce secretary to find a way to get this question a citizenship question on to the census and this is a question that asks is this person a citizen of the United states\nIt's a topic that the Census Bureau has not asked all us households since the Nineteen fifty cents is although there have been a there's been a citizenship question on a smaller Census Bureau survey that's now known as the American Community Survey\nWhat reasons then does the administration gave her why it doesn't want secretary Ross to testify about it at least once a thing about its reasons\n[noise] well the Justice Department or which is representing a commerce secretary Wilbur Ross and the Trump Administration these lawsuits their attorneys are saying that the judges should\nDecide these lawsuits based on the documents these internal documents that they're released as part of the lawsuits\nAnd not on depositions questioning of Wilbur Ross ah and trying to get into his intend to his mindset but that's exactly what the plaintiffs in these lawsuits and you know dozens of states cities and other groups that want this question removed\nThey say they really want to a better understand exactly why commerce secretary Wilbur Ross went to add this question because the Trump Administration has said\nThey wanted to add to because of the voting rights act and he wanted responses from a citizenship question to better enforced section to the voting rights act which has protections\nAgainst discrimination of racial and language minorities are essentially to make sure that those groups have the right to vote 'em that the law the federal government has relied on other\nAnother kind of citizenship data from the American Community Survey of um\nAnd it needs it on the descending on the twenty twenty cents as\nPlaintiffs are very skeptical of that and they're concerned that there are other other motives here involved a one of the internal memos or one of the emails released as part of the lawsuits include a communication between a Kris Kobach the current Republican gubernatorial candidates\nAs well as a former vice chair of President Trump's now defunct\nCommission on voter fraud he wrote to Wilbur Ross are trying to lobby Wilbur Ross to addict citizenship question and his concern\nWas that undocumented unauthorized immigrants are counted\nIn census numbers used to divide up\nThe congressional seats are among the states after the census\nOr all of this comes at a really pivotal time for the Census Bureau itself on the Senate has not yet confirmed President Trump's new appointee to lead the agency\nOr the Twenty one twenty cents as it's going to be the first to be conducted in part on line so with all of that going on how prepared is the Census Bureau for what is a massive undertaking well\nThey are the Census Bureau has really anxious to find out exactly will the citizenship question that Wilbur Ross edible at stay or will it go and we probably won't find out until a few months\nAnd that's really pushing up against a deadline that the Census Bureau spacing of what exactly prints on the forms are this will be the first online census but paper will play an important part for live households that may not be comfortable I don't have access to Internet and so they will be paper\nAnd so this is a really big question right now and that hopefully the lawsuits will resolve\nA from the Census Bureau perspective and other big questionable they the sense of being able to hire enough workers to collective uh information from households around the country\nOkay thank you NPR national correspondent ... long thanks a lot\nYou're welcome the anonymous British graffiti artist Banksy made headlines over the weekend by regain his own artwork to self destruct\nHis

painting slide down the picture frame in shreds at the auction\nOh my goodness I see a hot still paying maintenance and the question was why is it happening in and in fact with how how is it happening because obviously at its height\nThat was their first introduction to Banksy so tell us what we know about him because he's a a a man we think who is famous for being mysterious\nHe's absolutely famous being mysterious and he is known as the ... of the uh swelled and he's ... he's an enormous English artist he's a street and graffiti artists that he kind of gets known as a political artist as well I'm kind of showed up on the scene by the nineties um\nOn his black originally highlights the laws are corruption and inequality and society but he didn't have a humorous way nowadays it's humid it's slightly less and he takes them a series trained in his walk 'em as you say he's never been on moss that there are\nHundreds of theories as to who he could be um and we still they there's a big theory that he was in the ... when the painting was shredded\nWow so let's talk about some of the theories then what do you know 'cause there are people who who think they've seen him at work do we want have been installations on a wall somewhere or in what you know we don't know who he is so um what are some of the theories about about who this ... this mysterious or this might be\nThey have ranged from him being a painter and decorate to to another graffiti artist named king ... and people say he's Damian Hess people even say that\nYou know banks he may well be a woman and there's another theory that he's and not just one person he is a collection of artists it's just because he's such a a an icon of ministry the the theories range from what could potentially be the tree to something very outrageous and I think there was a\nBond that they said he was the ... mind if the bonds\nAnd because every time that bad and performed in this that and they ... the ... pop and the guy had to come out and say and it's definitely not me I have a creative bone in my ...\nWhat what do you think he was trying to say by ... painting\nIn my opinion and I think he's trying to say that his wife is not for sale it's not the fast time has what has gone up for sale and and it's something that has been done without his consent\nThis time I had to see I I this is just my past and opinion on the opinion that setting people I ... that the painting and the shutting if the painting was away at him saying my\n... for one pass and it's for everybody and because this painting it shut it off to the humble wet and it was a way of him saying they swap doesn't belong to anything\nTo one passed and he does it in public space that he does and in places where it would be very difficult to me than anybody to claim that that all black\nAnd I think that's what he did he wants his message and he wants his what to be for everybody rather than one passage take ownership cars at other theories I've had a he wants his wife to have a great ...\nOf the times I've had that he wants his what the priceless that could be it could be a number of things and and my personal opinion is that he just doesn't want anyone to in his message\nNow one of the questions people are asking is how do you hide a shredder inside a picture frame without anybody noticed the other news the auction house was in on this\n... and because he has ... Instagram Shea how he went about building the frame himself and installing a shredder inside and I think he was the passage in on that um\nIt could it could very well it's been someone inside the base in on it and maybe a friend who may be another another graffiti artist he may be lacking that but I ...

B. U. R. I'm ... I'm Peter O'Dowd this year and now\nPeople living along the Florida Panhandle are rushing to prepare today for hurricane Michael the storm is expected to make landfall tomorrow is a major hurricane with wind speeds of at least one hundred and ten miles per hour\nJeff Hoffman is director and chief meteorologist of the Florida public radio emergency network he's in Gainesville, Florida a hijab it's good to have you back again today\nOh good afternoon Peter I wish it was better circumstances that we are talking but good afternoon Jia and what are those circumstances and a lot has changed in the last twenty four hours and it has it has and let me get right to the point about something this you know when we talk about hurricanes and we've talked a lot about several in the last two or three years\nUh we always prepare for what could be the reasonable worst case scenario this one more than Florence I think a potentially it could be a worst case scenario or it could achieve that status for some locations in the panhandle of Florida I say that with the most\nStraightforward tone and my voice as possible uh this hurricane is continuing to strengthen it could have winds of one hundred twenty five miles per hour at landfall near Panama City or just to the east\nAnd we're talking about potentially a catastrophic storm surge event and some of the coastline that's the most vulnerable in Florida to a storm surge stretching all the way through Appalachia bay the big band and all the way over to the nature coast\nHow close to cedar key So Peter I Can't stress enough you know Harvey was an extreme event infringe terms of its rain Florence was also an extreme event in terms of its rain this one has the potential to also be an extreme event for wind as it comes to shore tomorrow\nLet's talk about that storm surge you mentioned at the geography of Florida and the Florida Panhandle they're locals call it the Big Bend area what is the geography have to do with how bad that storm surge could be\nWell two things are really working against a are working to enhance the surge in that area but get shallow shelf waters so think of a\nA bath tub being pretty deep it's pretty hard to to you know splash water out of a bath tub because it's so deep but didn't think of a you know something that's a little more shallow or the water can easily move out of it and the winds are going to push and drive that water\nOr miles inland in some areas and then also the ... of the coastline kind of access to funnel to funnel that water especially up near uh the Big Bend region or so when you take that even if the store and ... and it may be moved further to the west I spoke earlier just a few minutes ago actually at the national Hurricane Center specialist there\nAnd he confirmed with me that it doesn't really matter at this point how close the center comes to cities like Appalachia cola points they ...\nMatters and this is a significant in life threatening storm surge of for those areas and it's\nNot just Florida the entire state of Alabama is under an emergency declaration and it could this storm could eventually track over the Carolinas which of course we're still cleaning up after Hurricane Florence ... what are you watching for outside of the Florida Panhandle\nWhile we just a touch base with our partners in South Carolina 'cause we provide weather coverage for them as well and they're preparing for\nUh some flooding from this it's going to the storm's going to be moving in a fast enough pace but any water right now in eastern portions of South Carolina and southern portions in North Carolina is bad news it's it's going to take some time to assess how this will affect river levels over time but that's the big concern there\nAnd here doesn't become a what we call it a nor'easter almost it's going to become a very strong extra tropical low or post tropical low and really it'll have some wind and water impacts all the way up into the mid Atlantic states\nUm and we were so captivated and curious by why our generation in particular feels the need to kind of public we mourn and be a part of community by any means necessary and we wanted to explore that further\nWell but in this case evidence in a he's a kid that just\nGets it every day trying to have a better day in fact he's in therapy and part of his um assignment in therapy has been to write a letter to himself deer Evan Hansen you know kind of telling himself that how he's going to have a good day and what happens is that this young man Connor also a troubled classmate but he presented kind of a bully\nHe finds one of the letters takes it home after he killed himself his parents\nThink that it's a letter he's written to Evan Hansen your editor Hanson and so he's they think their best friends and for Evan Hansing kind of gets caught in this did that spirals out of control and also kind of changes him Steven Livingston\nThis idea that he suddenly finding respect from people and an entree into school life because there's this false idea about him that's very compelling\nYeah well I think he makes that decision ultimately to just kind of keep going with this story because everything he's always wanted comes true but it's also about the people around him are ... by the story as well I um he feels as though he's giving something to them\nYeah the young man's family they want to embrace this you know best friend of their son who of course is and I mean it's just heartbreaking and it's also heartbreaking to hear Evans mother a struggling single mom when she finds out Evans been taken in by Congress family because she can't give him a lot of things that they\nYou have to ... you were able to put those feelings into a song [noise] what's it like now there's a ... novel you don't have music to get across these characters\nKnow it's true um it's not that we talked about at the beginning of the process with vowels which was you know how do you take the would become a sort of temple moments when the musical how do you take that in translated into a book it is an interesting process of how do you get inside a character's head in the same way that a song does and that's why I think it does work so well as ...\nIn the way to the song does so I think it does translate well and uh and same token we also felt like we wanted this to be a different experience from the musical and so we weren't ... every time there's a huge song moments we have to have a big moment in the book and we have to capture that huge thing because we want this to be its own experience and to live on its own\nNow really any uh ... this is very special to people all these characters and especially ... really means something to young people then he's in your hands\nI'm Glad I didn't speak to you before beginning the novel yes lots of sweaty hands still sweaty hands in fact it was the sweaty hand line I'm In Evan first monologue in the show that I was like this is me I can write this\nBecause we should say and then also had sweaty hands\nThat's right he's trying to will his hands not to be sweaty by by even thinking about them being sweaty hair becoming more sweaty I've been through that rabbit hole before where I felt like I knew how to do this or emotion I knew how to do it at the same time I did think it was sort of an unfair challenge given the popularity\nAnd the intensity with with which people\nHad attached themselves to have and and the other characters\nWell talk more about this notion that you're writing about suicide you Erica I'm imagining be careful not to romanticize this\nFor sure um suicide is something um that I have experience with let's just say I know um was the other guys have stories of their own so I was definitely sensitive to that fact\nBut we all wanted to know more about Connor the guy's definitely that was a a um a goal of theirs and and the mission they gave me tell us more about Connor we have these ideas of him can you make these work\nOkay I can I think I can make some of this work really it started with just finding his voice at one point they said like we we want to give Congress some happiness in the show we're only seeing just this small glimpse of Connor and it's torture it's him taking his life\nI'm In the book we get to know more about life before that and part of his life\nHe did he\nDid he ever experienced joy I'm or was it all you know I'm darkness\nThey don't wanna give anything away but I have to say we actually find out ... and we find out this crushing thing that happened to him yeah some people may not want to know that you have this\nHow much do we want to know obviously you leave the show wanting to know more about Connor but do you really want to know more about counter or do you want to imagine\nMore about Connor and I think what we found in the book um especially with vowels treatment of it is that we learn many reasons why Connor goes the way he does and Evan goes the way he does\nAnd it was important to us that it not feel mano causal I'm like there's this one thing that ... that um you know is the reason Connor is the way he is or Connor does what he does\nYou know and I I think it's pretty successful in that\nIt also feels like a cautionary tale for times\nOf what it's like to suddenly get swept up in media ... and his friends become a you know since ... interviewed by everyone across the country it's a cautionary tale you know what can happen when suddenly or you don't even know what you're doing it and you're on a national stage there's that\nBut a bench pass it and I just didn't ... I understand that why you did they did like to do how much to do more in a book than you did in the musical your fans we're already doing it than fiction they were they were writing about Evan Connor and what might happen\nYeah this is Justin you know that that was something that was inspiring to us in terms of doing the novel adaptation was seeing that there were a fence around the country around the world who had never seen the show maybe they listen to the gas ... watched a clip on line or something and\nThey were beginning to create their own stories with these characters and interactions that might have been between evident Connor and and I'm a particular curiosity about Connor which is you know partially what inspired us people wanting to engage with these characters and that's what gave us the confidence to do this and the first place\nIt is a conversation starter for families you know moms can see elements of their kids that their kids won't talk about you know out loud and and and kids will see elements of their parents said that humanize them and ultimately it's really about how we relate to our family members how we hide ugly trees about ourselves\n\nFunding for here and now comes from W.

physicians to swear to abide by ethical standards Phillip ... is one of the doctors behind this new version\nIt's still the general principles of caring for patients first not doing mischief knowing one's limits keeping confidences that continue to this day\n... is professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at George Washington University School of medicine and health science he and his colleagues wrote the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian workers based on what Nineteen agencies told them\nThe way we turned to humanitarian ideals was by basing it on the resilience training but we were doing\nSo we were you that people take care of their team take care of themselves recognizing that there was a cascade of care\nThat has to occur if people are going to take care of refugees they have to take care of themselves first they have to take care of their teams they have to make sure that they stay with them there are areas of expertise\nOne of our colleagues at George Washington tells a story of when she was working in Africa\nAnd as a psychiatrist she was asked to do a Syrian section on a pregnant refugees so the the temptation to go beyond one's expertise is really difficult uh in in desperate\nSays you're saying that in this Hippocratic Oath you're able to give her permission to say I can't\nRight that's exactly right so defining the limits of one's expertise what one can do safely without the resources that one needs is one of the key principles of this work do you think\nThis is something that actually the humanitarian aid workers will really refer to or is it just kind of nice to have the guideline there\nIt's a it's a great point the our hope is that it can be kind of a unifying project for the folks that we work with uh we've had a translated into Greek already were making a gift of it to the groups that were going back to work with a next month so we're hoping it'll have some traction\nOne of the things that you and your colleagues have noted is the potential culture clash as Muslim refugees\nA pretty homogenous quite community how has that caused problems and how are you dealing with that we've\nBeen impressed that the people who work with the refugees have their own immigrant stories so there's a shared experience a shared humanity\nThat even those who are more western or European generate that they show when they're working with folks from North Africa I'm a Middle East\nSo we learned that many of them had grandparents great grandparents who were part of the genocidal exchange with populations in the Nineteen twenties [noise]\nIn the fall of ... they were refugees from Asia Minor\nEveryone seemed to have an immigrant story they had married someone from outside Greece these workers you talking about that's right that's right so there was a sense that we're all immigrants in one sense and therefore this kind of work takes on a shared a humanitarian motivation\nDid have one more question um I have no need for quite some time and I know you're as you said Greek American you go to Greece quite often because of the refugee crisis\nBut I Wonder what it was like for you to be in one of the cradle of modern medicine implementing a very different kind of hypocritical for a very different reason from what the original one was drawn up for me personally what is this like for you\nIt's an opportunity to take the expertise that I've learned here in the states and take it back to the origins of you know my family's migration in the Nineteen fifties so my family left Greece after er during the civil unrest there after World War two\nAnd to be able to go back and offer what I can we were just there in September\nTalking to folks in so long ago and asked them about the work that we do and a recruiting help from the Greek psychiatric community so being able to collaborate in this way has been both professionally I'm personally fulfilling\nPhilippine Dallas thank you thank you Lisa That's Dr Phil can deal is who is part of the George Washington global mental health program that's drawn up the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian aid workers back to the U.S now in a story from the American west walk

window it's edible\nBut he says where people eating it because it was a delicacy or because they were starving with medicine or part of a special occasion Julie Coleman wonders if these trees might reveal patterns about how tribes like the you were moving across the landscape she's an archaeologist with the San Juan national forest [noise]\nA GPS unit get point pots and each tree and hopefully we'll see a pattern and you might show trails and all the ways\nMark Mitchell says they're running out of time\nBut we really feel the urgency of it no drought could kill these trees or in expanding beetle infestation could crippled them with the fungus called blue stain or wildfires could erase them\nSome of the big fires that we've had in Colorado in the last five or six years have taken some of these streets we know that\nThe time could also get them some of these trees could be five hundred years old like this one\nOh wow that is cool\nThat I was hoping we would find a lot of these\nFor
