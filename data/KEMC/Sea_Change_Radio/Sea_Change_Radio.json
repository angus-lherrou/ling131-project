[{"month": "10", "state": "MT", "station": "KEMC", "content": "It sounds like that was a lot of research that went into understanding that time period and how accurate comical on you know experience was that was our fault him for for these not necessarily ... subjects at the time to inform you ...\nYeah well I'm I've been reading about that part of the state a lot for you know for most of my career so there has been a lot of research behind it for sure yeah\nAnd Alan I'm up on the\nMissouri brakes it's very isolated area and you're\nThe violence in your story happens really early and then it's a flashback when the bodies discovered you want to talk a little bit about that\nYeah so um I describe this book to when I where I'm Talking about the book to friends or when I'm I'm reading I describe it as a crime novel and it it opens with the crime I'm I'm always a little grateful when people\nGet past the first ten pages of the book to to read further it's not in this mostly violent book uh but there is an opening scene you know of course it's it's all downhill from there the challenge I gave myself with this book was to work within ... to write a crime novel\nBut then to flip it around to suffered so it's a crime novel it's sensibly something of a mystery but in the opening pages we have a pretty good idea of of who do than what happened as a writer how do you work with that that's that's kind of a challenge\nYou know I think both these books as sort of classical westerns in the fact that neither of your characters are real heroes they're sort of anti heroes and I wonder\nUm again is that a theme of sort of Montana literature the scarred individual\nYeah I suppose it is I'm In part ... part of the reason that turned out that way in in this but for me it was because I Am I always try to turn the stereotypes on their head a little bit and\nI'm so George I'm ends up being part of this lynching that you mentioned and um he's not there by choice um he's been dragged into it and even realizes halfway through the whole thing that he doesn't have a gun so he's kind of wondering what the hell is doing there yeah and he ends up being ...\nAlso confusing and an rarely unwanted from him so\nYeah I I think you're right that there's an interesting twist sometimes in Montana literature where the the the person who is least likely at least I'm desire desiring some kind of heroic title ends up in that role for some reason so\nNow when you've got a obviously an anti hero in your novel how much did that play a role in crafting the stock\nI'm not sure that while I was crafting the books that I was thinking in terms of hero or anti hero um I was trying to\nCreate a three dimensional character when you when you try to create as realistic or a person as possible you know there are elements of the anti hero that come through you know we're we're all flawed individuals you know so um to create a a real\nOr without qualification is is to kind of be a little lazy as a writer I think in some ways um I'd be interested in Russell's thoughts on this as well the idea of the anti heroes being\nKind of central to western literature it it didn't start out that way I mean I I agree with you guys that that's the thing that's an element of of contemporary literature um ...\nYou looked at the the history of literature in the west and and our heroes used to be very one dimensional you know you start out\nIt's the kind of the John Wayne archetype if you will so there's the white out in the blackout the good guy rise into town and sells everybody's problems a soda ... maybe the the trend toward the anti hero is a reaction against\nThat foundation or or playing a rip off I was in some ways uh I Know Russell is given some thought to this as well\nYeah I I think oh in western to blame for the the original template but um it's always been fascinating to me that it started to turn when will cast their became big and you know she was the first writer from the west to win any major literary prizes and [noise]\nAnd I think she was the one that first started to write about the west in a real way it was she ... she wrote about alcoholism and domestic violence and you know her characters were real\nSpread idea of writing about the west and never LA how I went in ... in your book and how much I it's very true to life at that time period and\nThat was a definitely a challenge with this book I wanted to have kept Catherine be someone who is not as stoic as women are mostly portrayed in the in that time period [noise] uh you know I think it's easy to fall\nSo I wanted her to be more vocal about her feelings and about her reaction of things um and that was really hard to do without you know sort of resorting to contemporary vernacular so um that was a challenge\nAllen in your book I'm thinking of the two women a very strong New York based editor character and then the mother who I wanted to do more are respond more and she doesn't can you talk about those two characters\nSo to to address the or the New York agent character ah I I found it helpful\nOr as a writer in reviewing the character of a place or an environment if you can introduce some contrast so\nWhen we bring a New York or eastern or character into the west and see the west through their eyes it provides a helpful foil ... to the subject so we\nSee Montana in two different ways we see it from a hero or anti hero and we see it from this character of clearly who's coming in from New York the character of close the strong New York a woman was meant to be in some ways a foil\nHopefully a character and she has her own conflicts and her own\nUh issues to resolve a so ... she has a substantial part of the book but introducing her also allowed us to see Montana in that particular way\nOr the other character ah she was in a ... as the flashback opens she was in a really difficult spot so she's and it's the Nineteen seventies she's a recent widow there's not a lot of\nPlaces for her to go one of the catalysts for the story is that she ends up working as a as a\nHouse made and the brakes are outside of Jordan and that was one of the few opportunities that she had a so in some ways her lack of options is is central to the store and she had to be in that position in order for the stories of the place\nI Love the idea of telling the story through their eyes I'm at some point in ... characters and and have this kind of a narrative that unfolded um wrestler you use a lot of dialogue obviously about that he had to uh to to get these storylines that costs and sounds like that that\nIt gets a little bit of play infection but to retain the historical nature of of a half the time period as important tail\nIt strikes me to mention these two books are alike insofar as there are two different\nWritten in first person so the character is telling the story and then we have a substantial part of the book is written in third person\nAnd the two voices are flip flopped between the two books so I chose to tell to write most of the story in first person from the male point of view then the third person was from the female point of view limited third Russell did the opposite to a first person from the female point of view from Catherine\nIn limited third from George\nI wanted to get in touch with my inner\n[laughter] and they're both placed in the most isolated parts of that ad is another ... difficult for him to write and do you find third person are our first question a little bit more challenging\nI've always liked the first person better um I think it gives you a more immediacy and more you can just get into the characters had more that's what I've always liked about it\nUh I'm I'm not sure I have a preference there it's all equally equally difficult\n[laughter] so um I Do have a question I'm Wondering both of you are not only prolific writers but you know so many of the writers in Montana I'm Wondering if they're of a knack killer for Montana or the west in terms of contemporary literature\nI don't think there is I think there there was I was talking to Richard wheeler recently um who's written a de novels most of them westerns and he he I had an interesting observation he said westerns are really southern literature\nAnd you kinda see that in the especially in the old western movies there's the the drawl you know and um so I think at one point there was the speech patterns in\nThe west we are influenced by the south\nBut um you know Montana has this really I'm attracted writers from all over the place and um the strength of the program in ... and and the Livingston community have really drawn people from all over the place so\nI think it's the ball to the point where people here just write about whatever they're interested in so there's not really a common vernacular anymore\nI I agree with that I think uh it's to the credit or those of our community that there's such a diversity of voices everyone has their own particular way of of writing about this particular place in these particular people", "show_name": "Sea Change Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings",

with the contribution to forage efforts who are some of the other providers and vendors\nBig main vendors would be our local distributors which would be quality foods distributing which is based out of both men and some distribution which is also based out of Bozeman\nThey aggregate a lot of the local\nProducts for us so that we can have access to thirty or fifty or hundreds specific local vendors through one entity so it's like ordering through Cisco but it's all local products and then we do direct sales as well with companies that will deliver directly to us or will utilize one of the different\nDistributors that we have in the state and so for instance all of our fresh burger patties we are to those directly through ranch land which is in ... which is a processing company and then some distribution distributes them back to us but we do\nThat direct sales we also have some companies like the oil barn which is safflower oil which is up in big Sandy and will place an order for a pallet oil at a time and they will distribute that\nThemselves down to us and then they'll be other companies that will order from and then they'll drop ship it and so for instance tumble with cheese is a tea company based in big temper will order T from them and then they'll ship it to us in the mail so we have multiple avenues and that said for ... sake and the rest of our ordering managers\nIt does make things more complicated than ordering just through Cisco and but it's a labor of love where they get to remember to order all these different products through all of our different outlets and then figure out how to make it all works\nAnd how does the kitchen making all wear chef's flurries comments\nGood about these products is because they are local and they are fresh it doesn't take a lot to make them taste great simple as better with these items and we do bring people with different Connery skills and to achieve different results like we have the pasta ... station where we have\nThe fresh vegetables in there and we just do a saute on those with the little seasoning and that's all it really mean\nItems there where we can rotisserie some top ... are we can smoke some brisket those all again are simple techniques but that produce a really delicious quality item\nI first came onto the MSU Bozeman campus earlier this year to talk to chef John chairman renowned chef of Native American busy when he was here to lecture and cooked for the campus\nI asked Richard Huffman whether indigenous cooking will be integrated into the campus fair\nWe just completed a new contract with Harrington Pepsi in Bozeman and as part of the signing bonus generously donated a portion of that too or indigenous foods initiative is kind of seed money and because when shift Sherman came here we're all very inspired and instead of just feeling good we thought well how can we actually\nTake some of these ideas and these initiatives and get indigenous foods and like we've done with from the campus incorporate that into things that we do every day or every station has so we've been meeting on campus with different leaders in the Native American community trying\nTo begin to build those relationships we found that there's quite a bit of grant money out there that we didn't even know about and so we're looking at matching funds were looking at piggybacking on some of those are pretty excited that what we're trying to do is again use are are purchasing size\nTo go to a producer and say we need rabbits right now rabbits\nAre more expensive than New York state do you know somebody that's\nFarming rabbits or wants to get into the rabbit business we can buy buy in from Colorado but we'd rather buy it from Ford men or from the black feet\nThey've got a bias and prejudice that's going up there by a lake trout from the sewage scrutiny that we're serving as very much like salmon so we're already starting to incorporate a lot of those things but the bigger part is getting the word out and taking the long term view of craving those relationships and creating those opportunities with the Native Americans\nNow ... talks about another local effort\nPartnering with the College of agriculture we obviously get\nAnimals so they get beef and lamb and pork or that but you also operates towns harvest garden which is a three acre organic vegetable farm to dislocated about a half mile off the campus and\nStudents particularly in a sustainable food in dire energy systems undergraduate degree program will enroll in a course or practical on\nOver the summer to learn how to raise vegetables and clean them and market them through the essay which has like community supported agriculture program where members from throughout the humanity will pay the farm in advance and then\nBasis they also operate a campus farm stand where they'll bring vegetables to campus and set up some tents and tables and members\nFrom the campus community or if people are driving by they can come and\nPurchase that shovels and then they have some subsidized farm stands as well where they'll go to some lower income areas throughout town and sell\nSome vegetables at a discounted price but from our standpoint they also do some wholesaling and so we can work with them to have them grow something specific for us for one particular event or if it's something that we want to have many of whom they can have it\nOn a routine basis for us generally every summer there are some welcome back picnics that occur on campus for staff and for students and usually are catering sales manager will partner with towns harvest to\nIntegrate in whatever vegetables they have available for us for those particular events\n[noise] we have learned

would have gone up what they were taking whatever they took\nWe were eating we had gone trailers we change some of the size of the place we tried to change up some of the utensils so that they were taking smaller servings but they could well welcome to come back and we did see quite a bit of a decreased and then of course we started composting and grown that program to Carolyn\n... provides further insights\nI think that there are more students and more student groups on campus that are concerned about environmental waste and food waste in our facilities and so we have them come to us and we partner with them to try and encourage people to be a little bit more mindful and we have ...\nTaste it don't waste it so it's unlimited access to all the food once you're in the dining hall but you don't have to take an entire serving as something you can take a little bit see if you like it and go back and get second or third or fourth or the next time they come into the facility you can remember that you enjoyed that dish and so you can take a larger portion next time\nFinally chef ... tells us how waste has lessened in the kitchen the\nOther thing is is that our waste also and decreased due to were not batch cooking anymore or we're not cooking on large volume anymore we're cooking what we need when we need it\nNow let's head into the ... the dining room reminiscent of the

marijuana raw milk\nCigarettes alcohol sugar and decide for yourself the risks and benefits\nUm when we permit people to make these decisions for themselves such as by offering them other alternatives such as marijuana in Colorado they saw decreasing opioid addiction when they put up these other markets and possibilities\nOr ... or ...\nOr um addiction is just such a concerning problem and and really in Montana uh it's my understanding that math is really the uh the the concern over opioids foot but all of these are concerned including alcohol um I've supported treatment courts and\nThe addiction issues are are complex and I will say that that one of the places where these issues are strongest our on our ah areas that are experiencing poverty so we need to work to ensure opportunity and to ensure that\nUh that we have the services we need to help people that are that find themselves in a in an addict it tastes\nLike the punishment June fourth annual a bottle while I'm proud of the results that Congress as your congressman we'd delivered in Syria just this week we've passed a package of ... to the Senate and the house specifically do dress opioids and messy shoes\nTell me

that's a step in Morris Russian\nThank you in the Illinois influence in your little\nI agree with the sushi unfortunately that we need to take a rehabilitative steps when we have addiction situations with harder drugs like methamphetamine because people off of the street and patient treatment is rehabilitative rather than prison system\nRight to our next question comes from ... and his fourth definitely Williams\nMuslims are you concerned about the growing inequality when it comes to income in the United states we have the top one percent controlling a larger and larger portion of the nation's wealth while wages for the average person have sort of remain stagnant do we just accept this or other stuff we can take to close that gap\nExtra bringing that up because again the the tax give away\nUm aggravated the growing income disparity between a everyday working Montanans and ultra wealthy like congressman gene forte so uh I complained about the that tax bill I was vice chair of the Montana taxation committee that in the house\nIn two thousand Fifteen where we've passed responsible fiscally responsible tax policy\nUm and and you're right the wages now uh\nHave about the same buying power as wages in Nineteen Seventy eight there are a lot of people that have not\nBeen able to progress while the upper one percent and ten percent are making record profits so yes I'm concerned about the growing income disparity I've been talking about that since two thousand eleven on the house floor\nOr one of the things that I advanced and the legislature we laid the groundwork for an earned income tax credit which really help the\nFolks that the uh working families that the lower levels and I I Want to continue to help close that gap\nThis whole question if I may um do you support than higher taxes on the wealthy\nThink the tax give away is going to require a bunch of fix is a there are mistakes in is there a loophole that weren't close that thing was a thousand pages long I Can't imagine that represent as you unfortunately actually read that there were a A N handwritten amendments from the margins are\nFix this thing is I was in the June fourth and you'll lose a little\nWell it's it's important that we look at the facts here of the tax plan first\nOver hold his plans for over Thirty years really help lower income families we doubled the child tax credit we doubled the standard deduction that single mom I talked about in Illinois earlier\nRaising three kids her paycheck and I went up four hundred dollars a month there's been allegations that somehow this was done for the rich\nAccording to the billings Gazette my taxes actually went up that's what my account sewing too so this was thought to give away for the wealthy my wife and I have crosswords here and I will work to help the rest of Montana prosperous well\nThank you and uh Illinois response in your little\nYou know I'm going to repeat myself because I think it's just that important in Nineteen thirty one we had no that now we have more deaths than any other country in the world for every twenty dollars that America makes the federal government takes three borrows one and then for\nI you know they say that every young Republican as a libertarian and every young Democrats as a libertarian too they just don't realize it yet I'm not sure our country's finances can wait long enough for these\nFolks to go up thank you and Kathleen Williams your rubble\nI agree that the debt as a an incredible problems and and that just the budget that was passed in ... yesterday I guess as\nA congressman gene forte has a set supported a balanced budget then voted for the tax give away then talked about a balanced budget than voted for a budget that increase the deficit then voted against

get those industries back [noise]\nJackie I'm a knock on the next question for Mr ...\nThinking that you Rosendale sci fi explain why Montanans are better off financially under the Trump tax cuts that simple math jacket I Love this lesson so I've been\nAround the state for the last thirty days and meeting with businesses and individuals across the state\nTo individuals are getting anywhere in the neighborhood about sixteen hundred dollars more that they're able to keep each year that businesses power expanding dramatically I went to an electrical contractor and muzzle law\nAcquire new from as bringing ten more full time employees on I went to ... creek products which is a company him as a law that\nHad a manufacturers special seating devices to allow folks are handicapped to enter into a hot tub or or a swimming pool and he is going to invest seven eight hundred thousand dollars\nAnd and I visited an aviation from and doing that over worded eight hundred to one thousand dollar bonuses to every two every employee and there were from has increased the compensation that is a kind of success that President Trump has brought\nHow do you explain to Montana and who are paying about three dollars for a gallon of gas even more for diesel\nChildcare costs are up\nInterest rates are up\nCosts of goods are up for those manufacturers you talked about because of the terrorists\nWhy are they better off financially now\nWell the ... again Jack in the math shows it costs to go up and they do go down and what we have to do is lie on the principles of supply and demand free market principles\nTo to actually govern those and not have the government coming in and picking the winners and losers and making determinations about where the marketplace should be when I was living in a while we saw the the Bach and the oil and take place I saw the minimum wage job from ten dollars an hour\nTo Seventeen dollars and fifty cents an hour in Sydney Montana\nAnd the government didn't have anything to do with it it was just simple supply and demand senator tester\nWell thanks for the question Jackie I Will tell you that uh I think Montanans appreciate the tax break or I see the problem is is that another two trillion dollars underwear nations to [noise]\nWe're we're having a short term game for a long term problem and that's a problem\nAnd I think that we can do better I think of the bill would have went through the process the committee we could have got public input where he could have made the bill a much better bill\nWe do need tax reform this bill was not tax reform and I will tell you in that regard are supporting a balanced budget and push for a balanced budget says I got there will be able to get across the finish when I voted against three out of five of Obama's last by just 'cause I thought this spent too much money\nAnd I've turned three point three million dollars back the treasury from my office so we can do some things that cut the deficit down but adding two trillion dollars a district where Penn is at our kids expense is not the direction reminder\nThirty seconds for those refinery dressed or Britain\nThan what we've seen as a jump from the ears of Obama administration of two percent GDP to four point five which is a raise the heart and soul of every libertarian you get rid of taxes if we got rid of the personal income tax\nAnd brought government spending into his constitutional confines we would have GDP is in the eight and nine percent every year but we have\nOnly thirty six delegated powers but yet we got a department of education with the federal government doing an education we got troops are over in wars\nThought of or is that the debt increase is being caused by a tax cuts is a false narrative\nCut legislation is going to generate more revenue than ever been generated for the federal government the problem is spending and debt increase is a direct result of that spending time talk to that cutting spending he increase the national debt\nEleven times the debt ceiling fell out of the times he's increase the national debt from eight dollars to Twenty one trillion dollars at the same time I reduce my operating calls by twenty three percent but we have to do this focus on free time fending\nFor next question from Tim mechanical and goes\nTo senator tester things change senator tester what percentage of ... for women and its reelected what will you do to increase the number of women and minorities on your staff\nGreat question let me let me back up just a little bit here by the way the numbers I got for to drill and increase on that by the tax bill was why the conservative think tanks in Washington DC put those numbers out or it could be much higher than by [noise]\nUm a lot um\nI think it's about half way but I don't know I mean I hire people based on their ability and I've got a lot of women on my staff [noise]\nUm but I have never counted up and and done the math to be honest with you um when I go out and hire folks are like my state directors a woman right now a lady from from anaconda it's about\nHow she can do her job and now she works and\nKen how she moves forward and I can tell you that I've got some of the hardest working women on my staff around and I can appreciate the benefits that they give to my office as far as policy work than constituent work for the best of the best and I'd say the same thing for the guys by the way\nWe've got a great office we're very proud of the constituent work we do we're very part of those folks have under the ground to hear about how important things like health care costs are public lands public education the list goes on\nWith him and a follow up question though what would you do if a member of your staff were accused of sexual harassment\nUm I Would hear 'em out and there was any merit to it that are going\nTo Breckenridge you have thirty seconds not quite sure how I can answer that attempt because I'm not in John staff here so [laughter] but if you are elected if I'm elected okay finally going I'm elected a I think is a better way to [laughter]\nAll right so um [noise] um you know I had um three businesses were we had a Eighteen employees\nJob description that we had some of the jobs that I had you know you're burning a chainsaw cutting line we're we're not to a lot of jobs that women apply for\nAnd so a as a survey or there's a lot of good\nAh intelligent women in our in our sector of society and uh I have the utmost respect\nFor every one of them just arose until\nI got to that fifty percent of my staff\nAre women my my point is there that I'm actually have have more control over my chief legal counsel as a Mormon my deputy all there is a woman my direct executive assistant who takes a lot of my um five daily management is a woman\nHigh hire these people based on their compensate and they're highly qualified and their understanding of the insurance industry and their ability to help me perform my duties properly and so I'm very proud of that fact\nCenter tests or even the final [noise]\nWell I just say that ah you know the fact is that we're talking about in Washington DC about equal pay for equal work is ridiculous we're in the twenty first century women should be paid the same amount as men for the same work [noise] I think that ah when we talk about a a lot of\nProblems in the workplace because of a of a folks making improper remarks or actions towards women I don't think we should have any tolerance for that and when it comes to hiring I think you open the door and if you hire women they'll do a great job for him that's what I found\nJackie on August next question Mr Breckenridge I'd like to go back to a an answer you gave regarding standing and get ...\nCan you name three agencies are programs and he would eliminate right now\nHealth and Human Services they're not there is no constitutional directive for the health and those are states issues\nAnd they need to be at the state they can handle them better third agency I cut would be the EPA in Montana you have sixty seven different laws rules and regulations you have to comply with just to flush the toilet\nAnd so Montana is very very strong on a on their environment clean drinking water standards are ten parts per million Montana's ... parts per million so the EPA get them out of", "year":
