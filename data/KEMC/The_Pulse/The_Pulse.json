I mean dirty dirt but this\nFor like sometimes you come out that a little muggy Logan [noise] ah smoking Logan and it has a smell tour all the time that's every day not only some days just every day\nSo it sounds like there's a lot to worry about already\nSkiffs but climate change is on the minds of experts people like pediatrician Tyra Brian Stevens\nWhether in fact climate change as contributing to more asthma or not it's hard to say but we do know they definitely impacts asthma attacks and asked a hospitalization\n... is medical director and founder of the community aspirin prevention program at the children's hospital of Philadelphia\nAnd they say the increases airway information that increased asthma than than an asthma attack\nSo what is the exact connection here how is climate change going to make asthma worse than it already is\nOkay climate change one on one\nBurning fossil fuels like oil coal and gas puts more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that changes the climate\nIn ... is one of the raw materials in photosynthesis that's the process that ... used to make food\nMore common final side means plants grow faster and research shows the plants like rag weed and pine trees could release pollen pseudonym and release more off it's leading to a longer pollen season\nAnd more pollen is of course the bad news for people with asthma or allergies and when I think\nAbout asthma as a condition Allen they are already a bunch of factors that are really out of the control of individual people write it\nGets worse in terms of where you live or what you're exposed to right so let's zoom in on that and look at factors in environments for in people's neighborhoods let's look in the secular at one of the family\nI met Angela salts and she has two sons both of them have asked them Angela says she wonders if the asthma started because of where they lived in Philadelphia neighborhood cold Germans home\nSo when you will come out sometimes you could walk in a puff of marijuana or you know I'm the neighbors was always a cigarette butts everywhere\nThe boy's father and grandmother were both heavy smokers their apartment wasn't a mice infested building\nUnfortunately nobody's holding these landlords accountable so they're able to just went on anything everybody have breathing problems everybody like everybody had a pump like one of your kids without that at the playground\nUm when I was at her house I also ... oldest son judge your thoughts on is Seventeen\nUm I like to dance consider myself a dancer or I play video games to watch movies like you know typical teenage though\nAbout ten years ago he had a really scary incidents\n... so we ... stroke and they had put an oxygen take on me but um it still wasn't working with a response to the hospital and they had to combine a steroid makes with some other medicines noted open up my lungs because there wasn't any oxygen\nEventually Angelou family to a different neighborhood but that was hard for her financially that move her rent almost double with all the words and that was the costs she has to shoulder on her own Mike and so these other kinds of challenges that some public health people are looking at when they take care of people were asking them\nAnd so it was free to go to Washington and she\nThere were a lot of people with hairline like mine showing up the point I'm trying to make for young people is just that your elders are starting to act like older 's okay and I think they will be with you as this fight goes for thank you all [noise]\nThat was a bit of a revelation for me so I signed up\nAnd became one of the thousand grandmothers I don't actually have grandkids but the group uses the Native American definition of grandmother an elderly woman who cares about the next seven generations and is Nancy says grandmothers can afford to do this\nOlder women can actually step up in ways that maybe when we were first trying to establish ourselves we couldn't do it when we were raising children we couldn't\nOf course the downside is we're old and a little creaky\nAll of us have had conversations about this because many of us had physical disability\nThat has made me more worry and when I get the rest of us my mom because she is less you know physically able and she is more stressed out about being in the back of a police lab again or being made to sit in a position that it's painful\nSo I I worry more for her in terms of\nPhysical discomfort than myself\nI feel more willing to take some risk um because I Can't think of anything more important [noise]\nOoh [noise]\nYou have to identify with a grandmother [laughter] if the public sees a grand mother getting arrested for a cause that they believe in it makes you think twice\nAnd so I'm really excited about the prospect of a thousand grandmothers rising up organizing grandmothers all over the place I think an incredibly powerful and\nKnow people always say you would put yourself on a train track of it protected your children that's kind of how I feel about this climate struggle I don't think of myself as a particularly courageous person but if I ever needed to be courageous\nInside the patients to support climate action\nAnd while the idea of getting arrested is scary I Am ready to take that into\nThat's audio producer ... shown to hear the full story and

that humans have to take serious action to reduce warming over the next ten years or face some dire consequences\nIn the meantime many researchers are looking into adoptive strategies ways to mitigate the impact of warming temperatures to protect ourselves our cities our infrastructure\nHere's a candidate that could help form a barrier against rising seas mangroves so there\nThere are those trees that look kind of like jungle gym that's biologist Samantha Chapman she studies wetland ecosystems including mangroves\nShe does most of her work at the Kennedy Space center in Florida mangroves to like it there but they grow and tropical and sub tropical waters all over the world\nClimate change could mean more storms rising sea levels and big destructive waves and Samantha says mangroves with their jungle gym shape could help less than that damage to have all these big\nRoots than things called new metaphors which are like little snorkel at stick up that allowed them to breathe in the water and all of that structure actually breaks up the energy as all of a wave as a kind of comes and so you are looking at mangroves as a barrier\nThat is one of the ways in which we're looking at them we're also looking at them and perhaps most importantly as sort of a builder of land so mangoes are very good at\nBuilding land like salt marsh grasses are so in order to keep up with rising sea levels that have been rising you know since the last ice age they've had to sort of build up the oil and they do this in two ways they both catch the dirt that's running down rivers and coming in on coastal events\nSo they catch that sediment and they trap it and they build up the land that way but they also do that by growing roots and sort of pushing the soil up and so in doing so they can form their own land which is pretty amazing especially when we're thinking about losing so much land to see things like the lower\nEnd with temperatures warming could we see mangroves\nIn areas were so far they haven't been able to survive so far mangroves in Florida where I'm working have reached kind of the limits of where they were in the past but this is like the long ago passed\nBut they've been steadily since the eighties moving up the coast the one thing my girls can't deal with our freeze event and it hasn't been freezing as much anymore in Florida and so they're sort of marching up the coast in for\nWell as other places in the world I just finished medical knew the on in the same thing is happening there they're changing their extent there as well so if we're talking mangroves\nWhat would we do what we plant them in all kinds of places it is not that hard to create new coastal wetlands China is doing an amazing job of it right so they're planting vast areas of new mangroves\nI've traveled there recently a couple of times to see some of the the work that they're doing writing coming back from ecological disasters in many cases that are planting lots of mangroves and lots of other types of wetlands to sort of\nClean up their ecosystems right and and ... and trap carbon one of the things that's tricky with mangroves as you have to get the\nThe water flow right and so you have to know kind of how much of that or it's going to be delivered into the system to allow them to build that land but in terms of planting itself\nIt's ... days they have these seeds that float right you can get a bunch of them they make lots of them and you sort of stick them in the ground and if you have the conditions right\nYou can build vast Maggart for us really quickly how do you think about nature's ability to attack was warming temperatures how the earth might adapt and change [noise]\nYeah and this is definitely a personal opinion that is not shared by everyone but I tend to think of that nature is resilient when we either leave it alone or give it a little bit of help to do what it needs to do\nAn example of that is the fact that these plants and animals are moving around with climate change not all plants can move migrants are good at that because they have things afloat\nBut there are you know maples that are becoming more abundant in northern areas right that are changing with this climate but [noise]\nI think that we need to provide the room for nature to adjust to climate change you know and it's going to adjust with or without us that's the that's the way I think about it right major is going to be here the earth will be here it's just whether it's a a stable place for us to live or not the real question\n[noise] Samantha Chapman is a biology
