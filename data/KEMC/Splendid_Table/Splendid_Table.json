night I'm watching people cook on TV [noise] which is kinda weird this is the nineties but anyway\nWhat are the one on screen chopping garlic and she goes now you really want to find some good fresh

first time I think in Nineteen eighty two and we were just beside ourselves you know excited that we're going to be for Julia Child wait wait you have to tell\nHow she can't we were in our tiny little kitchen that was like eight by ten or ten by ten or something like that and we had the bathroom was in the kitchen\nAnd there was you know we had finally put a stove in the kitchen with an Avon which we hadn't had before before we had just had to hot plates and to hibachi is in the parking lot outback\nBut there was a double door refrigerator right in front of the bathroom I think Mary Sue is behind the stove\nAnd they were pots and pans on hanging and I think I was on the floor cleaning out the refrigerator in front of the bathroom so that all of a sudden we have someone come in 'cause

to the front of this year's winners of Julia Child award and when we last left or her when they were telling us about the first years of their seminal LA restaurants and cafes\nFor the French food which we in the parking lot because they didn't have enough [noise] and then how they got into his figured as nicely and the poor Susan would take a trip that would change both they're [noise] they're going back to tape up to your [noise]\nAfter about two years neither of us had had a break more than one day a week for ages and Susan I'm decided that she was gonna take a trip and go to India and uh I'll never forget it the night before she left we were having a little kind of\nLike a fake fight or a race thing we were racing to see who could bona leg of lamb quicker and that's how it's worked out which I think I Want she didn't win because I like through my arm up in the air as in a gesture and she had her knife in the air and I cut the tendon and my finger\nSo I had to go to the hospital and get a cast and she was like oh maybe I Can't go and I said no no you got to go you got to go\nAnd so then there was me Jose Luis and [laughter] doing everything for those two weeks while she was gone but what happened is when she came home\nShe was gone how to put about you know four or five Indian dishes on the menu we did ... like little ... freighters we did a puente a pancake\nWe made doll and curry and did it shot navy and right and it was really like immediately we just incorporated into the menu so it was all these rustic French things and a bunch of Indian\nThing to do that and and I\nHad been so inspired over there by all the flavor profiles and just that it was such an interesting cuisine all vegetarian but it was the place where I was staying on an Asher more a friend of mine lab I spent the whole time in the kitchen with\nHis cooks and all the women were not allowed in the main little kitchen\nThat basically we're just three holes in a cement block that you know you put\nTrip she didn't cut me right before she laugh [laughter] she took her first trip than to Thailand\nAnd had a very similar experience yeah my uncle was there and he I landed up so I could work in the kitchen of the hotel where he was and it had a big very very authentic type of fate and the woman who cooked it was actually the cook for the king and queen of Thailand for ten years hordes\nAnd she didn't speak any English and I didn't speak any tie but you know we got along immediately and we cook together all day every day for three weeks and then same thing I came home and we were\nYou know time Ellen salad and Chinese sausage salad anti red curry duck and I'm scallops and oh my gosh we have pictures that are just amazing\nAnd so then you know that our menu then became had cats who lay and then duck red curry and then potato budget with mint cilantro chutney and then you know al ... and so it was a very mixed like that\nAnd one day the rigatoni that we bought from a person who made fresh pasta and delivered it came and it was like three or four inches long instead of the normal inch and a half\nAnd we were like what happened I said oh we had a problem with the cutter and blah blah blah blah blah and then I you know we were we this is how Susan and I kind of worked together we're in the kitchen going oh you remember those chicken breast we we've got to use them today no matter what we can't let them go another day okay well let's just\nLet's make a sausage outta that chicken breast with a lot of ... stuff it into the rigatoni and then I don't know what do you think of let's just try with cream and parmesan anyway that rigatoni became like a signature dish that everybody ordered and so we've had to tell the pasta company can you make our rigatoni long all\nOf them [laughter] and literally it became one of those favorite dishes and some of the inspiration comes that way of trying to like get rid of things that we think we need to get rid of\nAnd other ... other inspiration comes from people that work for us it someone whose mother made something when they were growing up in a tiny town in Mexico like our measurement bananas\nOr you see something in the market I mean when we first decided to turn city cafe into a little tiny Mexican restaurant called border grill we went to Mexico for three weeks we drove around in a little tiny VW Bug and we\nYou know asked a trillion questions of everybody we could do find ... but if we'd go to the market and see something we'd never seen before we would buy it and then we would take it and ask people what it is how to use it with this chili that I remember we discovered ... chilies and we'd nobody\n... student who came in you know probably wanted like Eighteen dollars now is that none of them will hire you for like five dollars an hour or whatever ... whatever minimum wage yeah and I said okay so he came to work for his name was ... and\nWe loved him and we ended up going to Mexico City and staying with his parents in their home and his mom took us\nEvery day for a few days to the market this is our first trip and we like bought everything that we didn't know what it was and come home and cook with her all day so it was how we started to learn about\nMexican ingredients and and we fell in love with this cuisine and then we did this driving around\nWhere we just like ate everything we wrote our first menu in the Volkswagen bug when we came back we opened up and when we opened up with this you know Mexican menu and literally we had to take our notebook out like with the pa new Joe's or with the ... as we couldn't remember what they even were\nYou know called and so we were constantly looking at are now but but that was sort of the beginning of border grill that was the beginning\nWow you know I keep thinking about the timeframe or this is in the early to mid eighties this was not stuff that was happening and shut the restaurants and\nYou know people starting today have such a different frame of reference and I've read that probably grew up with you know their favorite Thai restaurant for the one to your with their family and their favorite Mexican place will be one two and all it's all that stuff was built into so many American pilots as are growing up though right\nYou know when we opened city so the bigger version when we open city restaurant and it was then food that was influence from cities all around the world ... we put a ton dory of and in and we got that ... from a owner of a Indian\nA hotel he was an Indian man we went downtown in a pickup truck and picked up this on fire tend to hurry up and so it's just\nRock clay that's been dry and it's like held together with elephant hair\nAnd we brought it back in the back of a pickup truck hoping we wouldn't hit too big a bump so that it would crack and then we learned all about how to fire it and then we spent one day like fourteen hours where you have to bring it up to like\nTwelve hundred degrees we wrap their bodies so we could stick our our ... in there because you had to keep rushing the sides with a brown sugar and mustard\nWe may we that night like at three in the morning we finally made our first batch of non and you can't even looked like a dirty sad news out of the oven [laughter] well interestingly\nYou talk about how different it is these days for young cooks I mean we had never gone through an opening right we didn't know what that meant you know and opening it was just completely seat of the pants\nAnd we were dead out of money we had to open because we needed some cash we couldn't even buy groceries so\nWe had been in the kitchen with our health department or the okay for about maybe forty eight hours when we open the doors and we were flooded with [laughter] and we were the only two people who knew how to cook the food\nAnd that very first night our hut you know we had to go you're all getting the approval of the time do you have an because no one even know how to give it approval we finally get it approved so we opened the door and the hood went out that first night\nAnd so it was crazy hot on the line I almost passed out and we were jammed in right Mary Sue and I were the only two that were like running from station to station\nAlso happy and we know now what we know because you know that that opening was pretty brutal but you know I think also what's different is we were too young women and\nI think subconsciously we felt like yeah we could go work for some are French guys are working French kitchens here and you know really work our way up but how long would it take us to call the shots for our own business neither of us I think we're\nSupport for our programming comes from western sustainability exchange

talk about how she gets the fall a great to have [noise]\nHi Francis if you have a very cruel part of your job and that is you get to go to all the winners of Julia Child award and bring back something from them to display in the museum so I Want to know what what's that like I mean what's it like\nStanding in front of someone who's going through your stuff and you know they're thinking oh man I'm going to be in the Smithsonian\nYeah it is a cool part of my job I Will admit that\nIt has been different for each of the winners to tell you the truth [noise] um\nYou know for ... and it was something that uh we talked about and then it led from one thing to another um for Rick Bayliss it was also very different I was able to speak with him and his staff and to really talk about it quite a lot of time\nAnd by the time they came back with a very wonderful list I pretty much knew that there were certain things that uh stood out\nUm ... donated a collection of menus and as you probably know he is an artist and these menu or works of art and show both of course the menu items but also he has ... as well as photographs in documents and a few kitchen tools\nFrom Rick bail us uh we were able to collect his original field notes from his research in Mexico and then I have an days\nThey are just fantastic because he was a an anthropologist and keeping incredible notes as he traveled around different regions of Mexico\nAnd the field notes are handwritten and then midway through\nThey are typed and he realized that he really wanted to type is notes halfway through the trip so we bought a little typewriter\nAnd he donated the typewriter as well cool I'm from Danny Myer we collected around his concept of enlightened hospitality that really shaped and and drove his groundbreaking restaurants in in New York\nSo we have again another document this notebook of his conversations with people that he was asking for guidance dividing Union Square\nIt's quite a diverse collection as you can see we're really looking at again the biographies of people and their particular stories [noise] um this year I'm it's wonderful to have been able to go to Los Angeles and to speak\nStuff but we don't really start with the stuff we always start with the story of who they are and um how they got to where they are how they got into\nThe restaurant business and what those early years were like what the struggles may have been what were the challenges\nAnd how did they land on you know this very successful formula that they have so for me it really starts with the story of learning about who the people are what the big themes might be in their in their histories\nAnd then to show up and talk to them about what that might look like what is the\nKind of the the kernel of their their own history [noise]\nUm so I was delighted to be able to go to Los Angeles at the end of July and to meet them in border grill\nThey had gone through their stuff ahead of time and had pulled out just boxes and bags and piles of things and\nYou know to a curator that's just you know what's catnip again and I'm looking at that\nAnd I they had a pretty good sense of you know what we were after and had come up with some great material so what is it what is it the donors your view from which is yeah [laughter] okay that's where we watching\n'em we are in the middle of collecting this material I'm too big boxes arrived a few weeks ago and in one box was Mary Sue ... nice bag um that she hacked\nFor competing on top chef masters when she did in ... eleven and you know this is an object that we don't have anything quite like it in the collections yet\nAnd they're at all was um you know all beautifully arranged their six nights forced bachelors your chopsticks scissors Lester is all this stuff is very very cool I Wonder what Susan Susan during\nYes well the two of them of also donated some of the dishes from their early restaurant a city cafe in Los Angeles and these are just so special they're they're beautiful very colorful\nAnd they are um shapes that reflect the cuisine that they were really featuring in city cafe and so we have um a nice guys eight or ten pieces [noise]\nUm and to come to the museum we will have a chef scout um you know Mary Sue ensues and we're very ... very\nWriter on the cough I'm which again shows how they're very\nCognizant of the fact when they are doing something on television that they can also show that border grill part of the camera angle on which is is wonderful [noise] um and then we've got you know the archives are always you know very very interesting to go through I mean there's paper and then there's paper and\nFor us there were these little notebooks that didn't look like much but of course when you pick them up and you look at them and you realize oh my gosh this is their first trip to Mexico you know trying to really research some of the color the roots of dishes that they were interested in for their restaurants [noise] self little no books like that\nNot everyone from India and for Thailand sort of cool and you know this is where you can sort of imagine as a researcher looking through this and\nSort of seeing the thought process of somebody who is curious about food traditions in other parts of the world and cooks and and people in other parts of the world and to then think about bringing that back for their restaurants in Los Angeles yeah\nIt's so cool to cause I imagine you know [laughter] I was Twenty years in the future no Thirty years and then you know the people were going to win and then you're going to be like hey can you send me text text me there's an array of torture [laughter]\nBut let me out here we are also doing though is you're going through essentially somewhat which as you said someone's life story through\nThe objects that they have held and written in isn't an emotional process for them\nIt is kind of um and in fact you will see people bring that stuff out and then it's there and then when we come and we start handling it gently of course but handling it and and talking to them about it\nYou know that the stories are triggered and when they start telling the story the meaning is made a parent of what this object represents to them and their and their lives and what they care about\nAnd there are these emotional moments when somebody will you know have that look on their face\nAnd we always tell people look you know it's your choice to donate something to the collections and if you're not ready to you're not ready [laughter] um so we don't force people watch 'em but those emotional stories are the things that we document along with collecting the actual objects and that we try to preserve as well\nThank you so much fun and so I
