runoff election he will take office on the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy\nAnd let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and they use for the restoration of national pride\nI think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate financial and Daschle so comprehensively\nI should say though that most NATO himself insist the survival dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out part of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects\nTo the judge had to remind him and the people that people really do about the constitution and what it says\nAnd I think that underlines the extent to which they he's a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nAll they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an on corrupt for example his Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not his home in ...\nHe's rainy on that's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe this I think he really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said does he have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready\nPeople hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high mood right yet the prospect of more guns and more police violence also concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is a sprawling

inexpensive to Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is the kind of test\nAt a sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advising you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems\nIn the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting\nDon't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expense who could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to said that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think\nWe have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth

continued deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he will take office on the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy\nAnd let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves who was reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and they use for the restoration of national pride\nI think that it helps explain why both not a defeated the workers' party candidate for them to a dashing so comprehensively\nI should say the most amount of himself insists the survival of don't democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out part of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects to judge had\nTo remind him and the people that people really do about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they see is a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's a central issue\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an on corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not as home Andrea\nHe's rainy on that he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any racism I don't believe that I think he's really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as his promise to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said that this is a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready\nPeople hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high moody right yet the prospect of more guns ... police violence those are concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is a sprawling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... powder a

protect Liberian curls its founder is an American woman named Katie\n... she has thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nIn Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad I'll go on the streets selling herself eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there shouldn't be on the street when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who is a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's set more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its ... had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the ... level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually but taking a small step or making a difference\nSo who is Katie ... why did she start this organization\n... a woman from New Jersey who had a long background in doing various forms of gift community help volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand of six on an evangelical internship\nIn two thousand and eight [noise] she didn't have a lot of nonprofit management gets you\nKnow and ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this was an incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped start this organization on the ground in Liberia was an army Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental in starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nBut he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie ... the founder of the organization now what he was doing [noise]\nWell that's something that we asked the and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my lawyer had an intimate relationship with him but she's conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven there was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who [noise]\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't didn't really get it\nNow my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd heritage but she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that the he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial\nThe rain [noise] while it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died and as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which\nAccording to reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents\nWas many many girls and more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually are willing to bring a case they were re tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to the cities that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had in the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nAnd Liberia still allows the organization to operate schools there\nWell the the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm On the local community had the sense of\nA lot of people had a feeling that something had gone wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has announced a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case [noise]\nUm and they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we are also process for credit thing these organizations have we hold them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed and the school\nThat was Finley young for pro public I talking to Rachel Martin since his story was published Katie my lawyer has temporarily stepped down a CEO of more than me this is NPR News\n[noise]\nLike hurricane Michael arrived or shake somebody's trying to get in and the anti door was shaking I knew

founder is an American woman named Katie ... she has thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lower\nLiberia who doesn't have a mom or dad a girl who was on the streets selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there should be no girl on the street when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who is a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's ... more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me I'm particularly ... an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission and I think that in a way\nBubble make people reach into their pocket and think that the individually but taking a small steps are making a difference\nSo who is ... why did she start this organization\nGetting my there's a woman from New Jersey who had a long background in doing various forms of\nYeah of community help and volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on on evangelical internship and then from there she continued her relationship with the country and she started ... first registered in two thousand and eight [noise]\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management ditch you\nKnow and ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that well she brought to this wasn't incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia was an army Macintosh Johnson tell us about him [noise]\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental and the starting up of disorganization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nEm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nAnd he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls that he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with Katie ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what he was doing\nThat's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my mother had an intimate relationship with them but she's conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven\nThere was some form of conversation takes place which involved jumps in\nHe loves the children but she didn't she didn't really get it and then my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd heritage but she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that she had HIV right [noise]\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died and as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also to court documents and organizations internal documents\nWas many many girls and more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually are willing to bring a case they were to be tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to the cities that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had from the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse with an institution in any other context\nAnd Liberia still allows the organization to operate schools there\nWell the the story it's really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm a local community the sense of a lot of people had a feeling that something had gone wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has announced a fool investigation involving\nUm they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we are both her process for credit thing these organizations have we hold them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed and the school\nThat was certainly young

had a certain personal style the way he carried himself he had a lot of confidence and some people might say he was cocky arrogant and either way he dressed um how did that to embellish his personification\nWell it sure made him stand out he was the uh ultimate\nA promoter and he knew what caught people's attention\nI'm even brilliant that way and whether you like team or or levine everybody watched him liver is actually even when you get started going there rather jumpers this started copying him\nAnd a lot of guys doing a lot of jobs but none of them\nStood out you know one thing that's kind of interesting about him and nobody had ever had an action figure prior to him that was\nUm an actual person you know he was the first person that had his own action figure before that it was Superman Batman Captain America all the action figures but evil can evil the I'm a a true human being had was the first to have his own\nI grew up watching evil can evil on television and I do remember the Caesar's Palace jump in Las Vegas in particular\nBut uh you know there's a whole generation of people my age in their mid fifties that are maybe older or younger that just remember his appearances on TV he was on the Mike Douglas show the talk show back in the day on Johnny Carson the Tonight Show and die so he was really a celebrity outside of extreme sports\nNo question um he he um catapulted himself into in basically in a list or um you may remember the good Martin roast a he was a huge ... done\nMade a lot of appearances cameo appearances on TV shows and Sonny and Cher all kinds of different things the Beinecke woman I mean he was just stay in the seventies was\nThere is some studies done about um who is the most recognizable face in the Nineteen seventies and there are three guys um it was Elvis Muhammad Ali and evil can evil and that was worldwide\nRemind us how we came up with the name evil can ... can evils his given name that's his real name but the evil was a kind of a moniker a nickname how did that happen well\nThe the fourth or is that his name was the body can evil and um then when he lived in in ... and Bobby was kind of known to get in trouble in Butte quite a bit for\nWhatever reason that was the night he got thrown into jail and there was another guy name can awful that live in a and viewed as well and the jailer made a statement that night that it was going to be a rough night because that awful awful and evil can evil in the in jail and uh\nUm I think it kind of just stuck and I think I'm evil white the name ... sounded cool and he kept it he just changed it from TV I L to easy EL\nAnd finally I'm just curious has there ever been a total tally of all the broken bones that evil evil suffered over his long career\nHow many actual broken bones that he had\nHasn't ever been exactly documented there's a lot of ah folklore that say you know hundred I'm really at both down into 'em in the forty range and alive as bone or broken or multiple times\nUm and it's also been said that when he passed away that there was\nFourteen pounds of metal and him you know whether that's exactly true or not he had a lot of metal in him whatever the number is there's not many people that have ever broken more if there is anybody that's ever broken off\nYeah I'm sure it was a lot of fun during uh airport security checks or with metal in your body [laughter] exactly [laughter] hey might we appreciate your time very interesting thank you\nThank you for calling appreciate it\nMike Patterson is curator of the evil Knievel museum in Topeka,

News I'm David Greene\nAnd I'm Noel King good morning the u._s. stock market looks ready to recover some of yesterday's dramatic losses when Wall Street opens this morning most Asian markets were down overnight the Nikkei hang saying but the Shanghai stock exchange was stable which was unexpected because\nChina stock market has fallen thirty percent since January and its currency is falling to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years\nNPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob good morning Noel are thirty percent drop for China's stock market sounds pretty darn bad what's going on\n[noise] will just kind of me has been lagging for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt spiraling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble\nAnd through all of this Beijing's making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from an economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in China stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have\nAs big an impact on the economy like if the ... the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is edited weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\nWell it's interesting hearing well is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing years ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger\nChina is doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these tests that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a kind of speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chains to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy\nWas already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost NPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks up ...\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change\nSilicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes blocks chain the technology behind crypto currency like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science is talking about watching but at the recent global climate action some in San Francisco it was all over the place there were panels papers people were talking about how he could help mitigate climate change in all sorts of\nAgriculture\nHarvests oils frustration\nOur sometime in ... the climate change coalition he came to the conference to spread awareness about blocking [noise] so what is\nA chain or distributed electric technology really references a larger system of technology [noise]\nOkay [noise] they give it like the ... is like an accounting book\nCan see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank\nBut instead on the computers of everyone on the block chain transparency is its main advantage tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency blocked Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer to ending human trafficking\nAnd now even climate change its it's our intention to build\nHe's working on climate change now but he's still makes the grand tech world pitches he's a CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\n... is a black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credits distance the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNor he wants to use block chain to verify the accounting end to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNow the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy because a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those\nIs that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution that things that fix climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars to pollute\nBecause I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data the hot new things\nAnd these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nBecause it could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees the company has planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mocking a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially can kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually more important to make the entirety of the problem something is solvable\nWith a clock ticking on climate change ... there's

day yesterday the Dow was trading up about point eight percent this hour\nBut I don't think the market volatility we've been seeing in the past couple of weeks is not over NPR's Yuki Noguchi joins us now to discuss some of these markets swings ... good morning I'm All right so it has been a choppy October yesterday markets closed down and the Dow innocent pie basically erased all their gains for the year what has\nBeen going on it's because investors are conflicted and one of their biggest underlying concerns is the global economy you know how the trade war will play out and how higher terrorists might effects might affect U.S companies\nAre you're starting to see some of that already a caterpillar which makes farm equipment and three M which is a huge conglomerate that makes everything from sponges to car parts\nAh this we talked about how that's starting to affect their bottom line now on the plus side the economy and labor market are and have been chugging along so there are no clear indications that that's going to hit a wall or some companies are beating expectations\nAnd although interest rates are heading up there still historically low\nAll right so some good factors some bad factors one of those sectors that's been hardest hit in recent days is the tech sector yesterday\nAnd this morning we should say it is trading up but what is going on in the technology sector\nIt well the technology sector has been on an even steadier and stronger Bull Run in recent years I'm apple this summer or you might recall became the first company to reach a trillion dollars in market value so basically ... tech stocks have already risen very high end of a lot\nFurther to fall a and when you have a ... few companies talking as you saw this week about week sales or miss profits\nOn that makes investors nervous that perhaps those stocks are overvalued and tech is a great example actually of how the volatility kind of spreads around the world yesterday you had some us tech firms including Texas Instruments and\nAT and T. reporting some weaker earnings which then prompted you Asian tech stocks including Sony and Sampson to fall overnight\nBut then by the morning you had stronger results out of European tech firms and some U.S companies including Microsoft and Twitter this morning\nThat's helping shore up some of those losses\nSo it kind of good contagion they're eating nerve wracking though to see the markets lose like six hundred points in a day and analysts say this could continue for a\nWhile really quickly why is that it's largely because we don't have clarity on some of the questions that I outlined at the outset where's the global economy headed how much of a trade war is going to affect companies\nAnd until investors feel they have a clearer picture on that you are likely to see strong reactions to any kind of news that could be interpreted as a significant development and we'll get another chance a later today with Amazon and Google's alphabet reporting their earnings NPR's Yuki Noguchi thanks so much thank you Noel\nAccording to the un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about

of it like [noise] like Jane is like an accounting book everyone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank but instead on the computers of everyone on the block chain\nTransparency is its main advantage and tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer to ending human trafficking and now even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nBall gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he's still makes the grand tech world pitches he's the CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\n... is a black chained based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credit systems the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting and go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment not a company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch\nYou want to make the whole climate change problem just go\nAway so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy\nBecause a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution that things that fix climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute\nThe call I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things\nAnd these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nBecause there's lots and could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees a company's planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mock a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nEssentially Ken kicking

trial\nNow joining us to talk about this case and what the NC double a can do to clean up corruption and college athletics is Washington Post sports columnist Kevin Blackistone also a familiar voice on our program hey there Kevin hey are you doing do I'm good thank you so what does all this mean for college basketball as a whole what happened yesterday\nYou know I'm not sure it means anything for college basketball um in in total because what happened here was a pretty isolated incident um but what it does is it exposes the recruiting practices have been going on in a big time college athletics and football and particularly in basketball\nFor as long as I can remember and that is basically they're channeling of money from a one source\nUm to the families of talent um to ensure that that talent goes to a particular school and what has happened over the years is that the uh manufacturers of of basketball\nHas gotten people in the middle of them um to help transfer that money so that the surprise here is that it has been criminalize or by the federal government as opposed to be policed by uh the NC double A. is it's been done for years\nAnd it used to be that the worst thing that would happen in the situation is that a someone would be banned from the NC double a coach who was who was caught um funneling money or or some middle man\nNow there's like ... which is which is a step ...\nNow you could possibly go behind bars which is uh what these uh these three men are facing\nWhat you have these three men facing that you say um but I Want to your colleague at the Washington Post Sally Jenkins room recently that the real defended here should be a university but the universities are actually considered victims and all of this did you stay at the same way that she does I\nI don't see it that way but that was the way that the federal government decided to get involved in this basically they said that the ... universes were being defrauded 'em by this system ah because by funneling this money um\nTwo players are are players families um these people knew that they were making these players in eligible under NCWA rules and therefore that at some point it would all be found out and they wouldn't be allowed to play to the universities that have given them scholarships\nAnd therefore they had to fraud at the universities of of value which is a very strange thing to me because I still don't know\nHow that's fraud I mean universities or a University of basketball programs and football programs are still going to get these talented players under they're very um a low level of remuneration a for athletic talented brings them um tens of million dollars in revenue every year\nWhich speaks to what you said this is something that uh this is this

PR\n\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin in Del Rio Texas and I'm Noel King in Washington DC good morning a search is underway for the person or people who mailed homemade pipe bombs to critics of President Trump\nThis morning to more of these potentially threatening packages had been discovered one of them was addressed to New Jersey senator Cory Booker and the other two former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nNow they follow ten other packages that were sent a prominent figures including President Obama his former attorney general and his one time CIA director NPR's national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson has been following the story Hi Carey I Know so the story is still moving what is the focus now have this massive investigation\nAnd this morning there is some new activity at a male center in New York that's where a package addressed a former intelligence chief James Clapper has been located and there are similar activity surrounding senator Cory Booker the FBI says they've located another suspicious package that resembles the earlier ones addressed him\nRecovered it in South Florida the bulk of this investigation seems to be centered in two places though one is the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia which is analyzing these devices may look like homemade pipe bombs and the experts at the FBI will be looking for clues\nAbout how the bombs were constructed there'll be looking for DNA are fingerprints the bomber bombers may have been left behind and retired investigators are telling me this is very promising because so many of these devices are intact they didn't blow up\nIf history as a guide though the whole process could take a little while 'cause it's a long time to analyze that stuff or is this sense of being done in Quantico, Virginia as you said there's a second area as well\nYeah last night authorities were searching a package sorting facility in Florida in ... near Miami the operating theory has been some of the packages went through that facility and then through the u._s. mail\nA investigators are looking for more devices but also other clues and there's a tone of manpower our being deployed across the U.S the postal inspectors the FBI the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives\n... and local police to the bomb squad and canine unit in Miami Dade last night and of course in New York police department out in full force to none of these packages have exploded and so that's led to speculation that um that maybe they don't have the capacity to blow up\nWater investigative telling you well police and the FBI or decline to answer questions on the record about whether the bombs could have presented a lethal threat to anyone\nAnd race it's pretty much a toss up according to the Amish you empty and poll so the question was posed to empty and chief political analyst and MSU political scientist David Parker\nCould there be a coat tail effect and the scramble to win over undecided or independent voters Parker says looking deeper into this survey results shows independence aren't as enamored with Trump or the Trump tax cuts\nAnother factor he says sixty percent of independents say they approve of incumbent Senator Jon Tester's job performance although the Democrats overall jobs\nGather you're getting a picture here of essentially\nMatt Rosendale thinks the way he can win as rally all Republicans to him the problem is if those independents show up that's a massive advantage for Jon Tester because they like him and on top of that that could help Kathleen Williams down ballot so it's a high risk strategy\nParker says two issues that are strongly resonating among those surveyed is concern about illegal immigration as well as support for public lands he says that's why there are so many political ads on these issues\nAs for the job approval rating for the rest of the top elected officials in Montana democratic governor Steve bullock was at the top of the package just over fifty four percent followed closely by Republican U.S senator Steve Dane's at just over fifty three percent\nAgain test or it nearly forty nine percent well congressman Greg gene forte rounded out the pack\nAnd just over forty eight percent of respondents giving him a favorable job approval rating Jackie I'm a knock on why PR news Bozeman\nYou're listening to MORNING EDITION right here on member supported Yellowstone public radio\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm Noel King good morning earlier this week NBC's Today show anchor Megan Kelly caused outrage with some on air remarks about Halloween costumes\nThere was a controversy on the real housewives of New York with ... as she dresses Diana Ross and I felt like who doesn't want to and she wants to look like Diane around her one day I I don't know how like outrageous not hollow why\nNow NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show lineup and that she appears likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the morning David ... okay so this is not the first time that Megan Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she's in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News\nFor all your kids watch at home than it just is white and she says it was a white man to tell us about her history of making racialized comments\nWell these aren't uh the only examples of of their number I remember back in twenty and the Santa Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking and last year claim that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny sheet group ... group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately a face criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over three and a half hours in a three week period\nYelled at a white liberal a strategist for about ten minutes who she felt was failing to take it a sufficiently seriously\nOr one more example among several uh she keeps kept inviting the a former LA up a homicide detective mark ... farm in on the air to talk about a ... a\nCriminal justice issues and to talk about the question of are African American relations with police officers he of course had to admit on the stand he had said racist things over the years during the OJ trial um many people saw that as a as discredited thing she welcomed among show\nDo you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged to her remarks about ah what she felt was the acceptability a blackface\nNBC's nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole thing about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something important making Kelly's colleague an attitude toward her\nWell for you and me it might be an admirable exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American anchor ah of any meat of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news\nWhich is really interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the way the network has handled these comments see something bigger about the way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\nWell it's hard not to look at this in light of you know the reaction at times very slow of major news organizations to the me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet accuse her former boss at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that making Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News she had to just play some popular colleagues\nAnd that her ratings themselves were mediocre and that even before all this happened uh she'd been discussing with a network another role there because she needed to get out of that show now the show's gone and she's a negotiating her eggs that as well\nNPR's David Folkenflik Thanks David you bet\nIt's friday and time again for storing today a mother talks with one of our kids about an important moment in the case in foreign as the youngest of
