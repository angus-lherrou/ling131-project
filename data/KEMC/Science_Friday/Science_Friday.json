way through everyday arguments\nDivision of political issues with a little help from mathematician Eugene you're changing the first this week one of those rituals of science the early morning wake up call from Stockholm\nTo a handful of researchers whose work has changed their fields joining me now to talk about the prizes and others like Detroit subjects in science is Sarah Kaplan science reporter at the Washington Post welcome back\nThanks gets to be here fabulous let's walk through the Nobel we're planning a to speak with chemistry Nobel from a Nobel is Francis Arnold later this hour but briefly what did you win for\nShow a doctor or not and two other researchers George Smith and Gregory Winter were awarded the chemistry Nobel for their work on directed evolution so this is basically one person called it applying the principles of Darwin in a test to taking advantage of natural selection\nAnd using it to um kind of direct bacteria or viruses to produce molecules that can be used for all kinds of peaceful purposes whether it's making antibodies or biofuels or drugs\n... and the chemistry prize was split with two other researchers right Stuart Smith and Gregory Winter and what what did they win for\n'em so they both work on a this technique called phage display which harnesses bacteria phages there are viruses that infect bacteria\nAnd it's kind of us the similar principle where you're taking advantage of these living systems to produce useful molecules proteins and antibodies that have all kinds of biological and medical applications and what about physics\nSo in physics the prize was awarded to three researchers who work with lasers a pretty cool\nLasers but use lasers as tools so asking um develop this technique called optical tweezers where he basically figured out that when you point a laser this focused beam of light atmosphere ... object to the object is actually drawn towards the center of the beam and you can use that to manipulate\nThings as teeny as particles or as big as bacterial cells I've seen the ... yeah [laughter] it's a real life tractor beams and fortunately it doesn't work on that largest accumulate they're pretty focused but um it's fun to think\nAbout it after winning the dumbest trickle and explained what amazed her most about the research\nI think quite late generation is one of these remarkable thing one color water any clear and oh come on short and and it's just remarkable that there were all this color\nShades of Isaac Newton\nYeah and it was cool hearing that Strickland actually mentioned that she um uses white channel ... light generation when she teaches introductory physics courses so that's something that anyone can appreciate you don't need to be a Nobel laureate to see this really cool\nPhenomenon let's move on to physiology or medicine\nSo the award for medicine went to two researchers James Allison ... for their work on immunotherapy um this is basically a treatment that uses the body's own immune system to fight against cancer\nAnd both researchers discovered proteins that ... brakes on the immune system\nUm so when those proteins are engaged as they normally are they prevent the immune system from attacking things but um they actually their research led to the development of a class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors that can turn off the brakes and then\nUnleash the immune system and it's full force to fight against disease some of those there was a practical drugs used to write yeah actually Jimmy Carter's melanoma I'm President Jimmy Carter twenty Fifteen or under when I'm you know therapy as part of his cancer treatment\nSo we're we're blending together chemistry and engineering in evolution of new protein\nHow do you build that I was watching a to a Ted Talk you gave it was quite fascinating and you talked about being able to sit down at a keyboard and type out a recipe for some form of new genetic smell it out and and what a new gene comes back to you\n[laughter] yes it's really amazing has changed so much in the thirty years that I've been doing this\nSo that today you really can't type at a DNA sequence now whether it's a recipe is a different story we can talk about that but you can type out a DNA sequence email it off to your favorite supplier of DNA and they will send you back in the mail that DNA\nYou you say in that talk that I I Want to write new DNA what does that mean to you\nIt's easy to write and your DNA what's hard is composing it you think about DNA is the code of life it's the product of ... almost four billion years of evolution\nBut we don't know how to compose it how do you compose something codes of of a complex biological function that didn't exist before [noise]\nSo if you if you ... what is the problem in the composition why can't you compose [noise]\nBecause we don't understand how DNA encodes function\nRemember biology molecular biology is a brand new discipline it's been around the the structure of DNA was published in Nineteen fifty three so it's not been understood for but for a very short time\nAnd how DNA goes through all the complicated things of his cell and makes biological molecules and codes to ... the the the structure and function to these biological molecules\nIs a brand new field and we still don't understand those rules\nAre so what do you mean than what what do people mean ... whom when you say\nAre the directed evolution of something what is that process me\nWell it's just like breathing it's we've been breeding cats dogs racehorses lab rats corn for thousands of years without really manipulating the DNA directly but now that we can synthesize DNA and put it in a test tube\nI can go direct the DNA and\nCombined DNA from different sources different species I can dial in levels of random mutations that can direct negotiations so I have control over the underlying DNA diversity and then I decide who goes on to parent the next generation\nAnd then how do you get a useful product out of that what's the next step [noise]\nSo you put the DNA into a microbe and they start reading it as if it were their own\nAnd a day in day than take the DNA and create the proteins that the DNA encodes\nThan I as the breeder of molecules so to speak I have to decide who is better than what I started with which one of those microbes makes a bitter protein and that's called good old fashioned analytical chemistry so are you take the DNA out of that and feed it back and I do it all over again\nIt's sort of creating life and that sell as a new you're creating a new form of life are you are not [noise]\nWell I think that's probably exaggerating because life was there\nI'm making new proteins they're not alive but they do do some things inside of cells but\nYou do you need the sale to help you make the ... [noise]\nWell actually so [noise]\nYou don't have to have the cell there is now very powerful systems where you can do everything from DNA to protein inside of a test tube with no cells at all\n... and so uh where do you bring truly see this research going what is what is your ultimate goal here\nI run my ultimate goal is to allow human beings to use the power of biology the power of biology to do chemistry to make molecules to make materials to make\nTheir ... agents and and and pharmaceuticals and and basically all the things when we need in our daily lives from renewable resources without producing excess waste\nMy time you talked to said I have fun for swing molecules to have sex\nOh yes I Do I'm at [laughter] well if you think about sex you have to wonder why nature would devise such a a a strange process and have all these half the population that doesn't carry the next generation\nSo there has to be some benefit to re combining your DNA with somebody else's and that benefit is the innovation that comes around if you read combined DNA you get progeny\nRe combined DNA dining coach something novel\n... she would get a phone call or two before we have to go let's go to ... Adrian and Hamdan I imagine [noise]\nHi this is a non and hand on um [noise] I grew up in Southeast Asia where my parents my cousin's everyone around me were just starting out their math or engineering my son who is about two and a half years old\nWhat I'm trying to figure out how to identify his mind said whether it be towards chemistry sports um math so may not be completely irrelevant question but I Would love to hear your thoughts on this subject how to identify your kids\nOr younger generations um your skill sets that they can go towards chemistry or science or physics\n[noise] did you know did you know what an early age Dr Arnold that you want to I\nWas lucky my father was the nuclear physicist and he always thought the girls could do math just as well as boys\nAnd I like being the winner [laughter] so I had a father who encouraged my natural tendency never discouraged it and had plenty of people to compete with\nWell you know I hear this from so many scientists we've talked to over the years that they had a role model mentors somebody could even be their parents who kept them are good kept alive or encourage their interest in science same thing for you it seems\nIt seems so and I miss my father he passed away two years ago but he would have loved this news\nMhm I'm a ... and he's the right to add to to answer the listener's call is there any way to identify any young age was talented\nIn science I think all children are talented and if they love it they will ask questions they will do it I think the most important thing is not to discourage\nSomeone ... have a tweet from Sydney who says please ask what she knows about how instinct is encoded in DNA example dogs urge to bury thing [laughter] I\nWish I knew but it's clear that many important behaviors are at least partially genetically encoded loyalty and dogs are so many interesting behaviors\nThat can be bred but we don't really understand what the genetic details of that are as we sequence more things and under ... and measure their properties will be using important and powerful tools like machine learning to peace out and to try to pull out what is that genetic basis\nWhile you were you in his updated my and my last question and that is are there what tools would you like to see I mean I give you while you've got some money now from the Nobel right what kind of tools would you that don't exist would you like to have\nWell I Want to be able to measure important properties rapidly so that I can do this breeding faster I don't have\n... powerful enough tools to do that but I'm also interested in how do you use AI machine learning to interpret the results of evolution to make it even faster than it is now\nI noticed on your Ted Talk you said that one of your great ambitions is to be invited to give the Ig Nobel awards be [laughter] you know we broadcast the eggs every year the day after Thanksgiving [noise] now I Know mark Abrams pretty good so I think we can put any yeah you know might be able to put in a good word for you know\nWell I was actually hoping to win the Ig Nobel prize before [laughter] but\nHi thank you doctor for taking time to be with us today\nThank you Dr Francis Arnold recipient of the ... Nobel Prize in chemistry and she's a professor of chemical engineering bioengineering and chemistry at Cal Tech [noise]\nHaving arguments with someone you thought was being completely illogical maybe as about what's ahead for dinner or something simple like that or maybe a little more difficult about climate change or White House policy\nWhatever the topic you know it is frustrating right offering up your own side of the story you feel like you're getting nowhere and nothing's happening no nothing nothing rational\nMaybe they're even taking the same point you're making and using them to support their own side well my next guest says the hardest part is that we both may employee perfectly sound logic only to come to different conclusions\nBy previously identified myself as a an aspiring feminist\nUm and I had done so because my logic was that I really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women face I'm at the mail um and I was met with that logic from a a coworker of mine who um had said you know\nOut as a black male you know you might be doing things that contribute to I'm white supremacist systems that you might do so knowingly or unknowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer a an African American male in the same way\nUm women or being a man who contributes suicide you stick systems knowingly wasn't necessarily make me I'm unable to to identify as feminists um it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to feminist system and so\nI'm being able to see the fact that you know I can still be a male male experiences while existing at him and that's\nI'm In identifying myself in such a way really changed my mind um and I thought about\nThat that's great thanks for calling us that is great that very heartening\nHe's ... he's you know as part of the problems that we don't see how we are there see us\nI think that is part of the problem but I think a big problem is\nThat we often spend two don't try to defend our own points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view and we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what it's believed as he is and one thing I found very interesting in that the coolest experience is that\nIt was a great example of using some abstract structure to tap into the person's own experiences\nSo in a way I think the logic we've used very cleverly using emotions as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will understand from their own experiences and then hope that they can translate that\nTo somebody else is an hour just experience\nI have a tweet from James who says to me logical discussions don't require man he requires empathy empathy use caring enough to respect them in their view and listen to it is that emotional I don't know\nI agree I think that logic does not require math that logic is in a way pilots is math and these things have porous boundaries I mean we've construct to the north of us official boundaries\nMy points of view because I Am so deeply steeped in the discipline of mathematics I find that the full discipline of mathematics helps me with logic in the real world I'm not saying that you have to be a mathematician in order to use logic and that's a good thing because I think everybody can use logic whether they're a mathematician or not\nWe'll talk about some from the current events or which turn out to the artist topic and current events and not as voters in Congress are divided over whether to believe\nAccusations of sexual assault ticket and showed judge Brett Kavanaugh and whether this should affect his confirmation to the Supreme Court and you write than in terms of how people respond to stories about sexual assault there are a number of different logical process is at play tell me what you mean by that says\nThat's a whole other our whole lot of different\nParts of this argument that we can analyze starting with what we mentioned before about Rome definitions because all of the people who claimed to the principle of the presumption of innocence\nAnd the thing about the presumption of innocence I think is that it's technically for court cases and criminal trials\nAnd it's something that gets bandied around as a general principle but it's really a very specific principal and similarly the idea of freedom of speech is often bandied around as a general principle when in fact that's just about whether you can be in prison for saying certain things\nSo going on from the presumption of innocence\nThere is a paradox because some people say well we have to ... ... someone innocent until that until that proved guilty and the thing is that if you have an accuser\nUndone accused personnel let's just say the accuser is a woman and the accused person is a man then what about the fact that we should also presumed a woman to be innocent until she has proved guilty of a false accusation and so then we have a paradox because we can't actually hold the man on the woman both innocent at the same time because that causes a contradiction\nAnd mathematics and civil Sufi have studied paradoxes for a long time and studied ways to resolve paradoxes\nBy shifting levels are finding that things are to a different level and the thing is I think that we we can start with the axiom of\nPresuming the accused person to be innocent and then we can look whoa whoa that creates for us and what mathematics does all the time it starts with some basic assumptions and builds a logical well around that and then we look at that well and good what do we think of this world\nAnd so we can look at the world that we've created by presuming accuse people to be innocent until proven guilty and I think what we should see is that we've created a world in which people know that they can get away with sexual assault because there is\nMaybe that that means that they will do it more and so we've ended up in a culture where sexual assault can it can happen and does happen on happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives so do we care that so many people are getting away with sexual assault all we more afraid of what some people are worried about which is that that will be false accusations and innocent men will be have their lives destroyed by a false accusation so\nHaving a false accusation um would be when somebody is innocent but is thoughts is accused of being guilty and the other way is when somebody is guilty but ... isn't proved to be guilty and so it left off\nAnd that's really about whether you were prioritizing the plight of victims of sexual assault or the the potential innocence of men and we have to have a discussion about that and about the fact that we have some help prioritizing the the men who might be accused\nWere prioritizing them over the thousands and millions of women who are suffering sexual assault over time and so the question is are we going to do anything about that\nSo that ... is a a question of black and white thinking and this happens a lot wet people get into arguments in extremes and so many of our arguments at the moment ton divisive because we take extreme opposite positions instead of something more moderate in between\nI'm so there is a an argument's around saying something like um you are making everyone into a rapist or what one that professor lung but said on his book that that we are characterizing just spin the buffalo crimes as rape\nAnd that's taking a very black and white view of thinking that we're calling all forms of sexual assault and harassment rape which is not what is happening there is a scale and there are things that are as bad as rape and there are other things that are bad but perhaps not as bad as rape\nWhich comes takes us to the issue of false equivalence is and straw person arguments where you can take that false equivalence and then you can declare it while you're saying everyone has a rapist which is not what people are saying\nOr your ... some people say you're saying any woman should be able to destroy the life of any man just by accusing him of sexual assault which again is a very extreme position that I don't think that anyone really is taking\nI'm finally um that's the question of knowledge and ...\nAnd then say you say in the absence of further evidence I'm going to take this default position and I'm going to wait until I found enough evidence to change my mind and the thing is that in\nA court case to trial it's very important because we're going to punish somebody badly for something so before we do that we should be very show\nThat they deserve to be punished whereas in the case of a Supreme Court appointments than what we're doing is we're giving something something very good and important\nAnd so we should be very sure that they deserve that very good and important thing and in that case one might argue that that that situation could be negated by one bad thing happening whereas in the case of a trial\nBe we should nuke we should not punish somebody if there is some doubts about whether they should be punished which means if there is something something good to offset the are showing us about the fact that they are bad\nAnd those are two they sound the same but that's slightly different situations that have a different ... situation [noise]\nThey'd for for seven to four to five five lots of people are checking in on that let's go to a career in Washington state Hi welcome to science friday\nAnd Hi Ira thanks so much for taking my call and my question is well I'm Wondering how\nTo access my logical argument would I feel very emotional about the subject that Spain discuss especially if I feel that I have first hand experience or background knowledge that\nSupports my logic that sometimes I feel that my emotions getting away and I ended up\nLogical at all [noise]\nMost crude grocer thank you for that question and I think the first thing that's important to remember is that your emotions all was valid and I think that we have been led into a situation of a false dichotomy between emotions and logic\nAnd some people I'm afraid it's often men take the position that if you are emotional vent it somehow proves that you're not logical and that's not the case I Know I'm a very emotional puff and I'm also I'm a very logical person I Am a successful such mathematician and my hope profession depends on my use of logic", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Billings", "day": "05", "locations": [["Washington", 38.89511,

campus of California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks California\nLater in the hour an update on where world nations stand on curbing carbon emissions and avoiding a climate catastrophe but first\nThursday morning two astronauts on route to the international space station had to abort their launch after a booster rocket malfunction\nMade an emergency dissent back to earth and they're happy to report both are doing well both landing safely Rachel Feltman science editor of popular science issue to bring us up to date on the launch and others so like Detroit subjects in Science Welcome back right Joe\nThanks for having me Ira anything more about what went wrong there\nYet so we know that about two minutes into the launch there was some kind of booster failure\nAnd they had to undergo what's known as a a ballistic landing a ballistic descent which is so called because usually they add make kind of in a shallow angle as they come down to create a little bit of left and take away some of the um\nThe the force on on the astronaut string landing and this is where the rocket is really coming down more like a projectile and this has happened before but only ever um during landings which of course appears a lot less dramatic because ah they were supposed to come back down to the ground in the first place\nSo this is the first time they've ever had to make a such an aborted landing during a launch and um the Russian space agencies that immediately they would begin investigating and uh so far that that's all we know\nOne of the good news about it is that it worked right [laughter] right ahead [laughter]\nIt's not something that happens a lot but certainly one of the procedures that they are expected to uh occasionally encounter so you know not something we want to have happened but something that is certainly on the roster of things they have learned how to handle\nWell we're we're we're we're showing this capsule bring the only way for humans to reach the international space station is ... you know a little bit of a problem is no other way to get up there\nRight so there are um I Believe three so use missions\nPlanned that are now kind of up in the air because the Russian space agency again is undertaking this investigation\nAnd so it's possible some of those will be put on hold and even if they're not uh you know those two crew members who were counted on who are now on the ground instead of on I assessed a minute there's there's probably going to be a gap in staffing you know we if three people on the space station right now\nBut they're scheduled to come back in December and now they could extend their stay a bit but the show you this capsule they have up there that's going to bring them home\nI Believe it's only a it can only stay up there through some time in January so\nUh that's the longest there'll be able to stay before coming back down and that means that the space station probably will be an crude for some amount of time which is something that we know should be possible there are procedures in place for it uh but I don't believe it's ever happened before\n... which is a little love love to check on whether there are experiments up there but yeah you know it on hold or whatever certainly\nYou know every astronaut who goes up has a fully packed schedule of scientific experiments so NASA and the essay and the Russian space agency are certainly going to have to at least ... work schedules and I know there are few space walks that are now I'm up in the air so to speak\nSo to speak and other ... the the problem where to\nBut again ah you know and not a totally a pessimistic a message from NASA on that so the Hubble is twenty eight years old and has done fantastic work and hopefully a still has a lot of years left in it but it certainly is not a new telescope and\n[noise] this is science friday I'm Ira Flatow\nThere is less than a month until the mid term elections on November sex and there's a lot of talk about hacking and voter security\nThe federal government has said hackers targeted the election systems of Twenty one states before the twenty sixteen presidential election but reportedly no information was changed or manipulated yet for the second year in a row the DEF CON underground hacking conference\nWell it showed how hackers could break into voting machines\nSo what are the real risks to our voting infrastructure how can we security systems\nHow does all of this affect voting behavior and our question for your listeners is what is your top concern about voting security heading into the mid term elections we want to hear from you give us a call our number eight for for seven to for eight to five five\nEight four four site talk you can also tweet us at ... ... what concerns you most about voting security heading into these midterms let me bring on my guests\nAnd New York University Welcome to science friday Thanks Ira You're welcome Charles Stuart the third is a professor of political science and the founding director of the election data and science lab at MIT welcome to science friday\nLife here and it's nice to have you um [noise] well I mentioned the Russians hacking during the last presidential election what areas where the Russians or whether hackers compromising and what were they they trying to do their [noise]\nI'm not sure that we know and tireless what they were trying to do first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um [noise] there's a lot of\nConversation about Russian interference in the election and two thousand six team over there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned that one is\nA tax on the election infrastructure um but there's also um [noise] that kind of political purchase of political ads social media propaganda and attack on campaigns and their emails those are those are two separate things ah if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself\nA we saw them targeting a voter registration databases again not entirely clear what they were trying to do there um and and of course voter registration databases or the roles that had the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote\n'em and um there were phishing attacks against um [noise] uh election officials we know that um it looks like at least one or election systems vendor which uh manufacturers e pull books was attacked but I think\nUm [noise] we don't we don't know exactly what was going on I'm unclear or just that there was certainly a lot of I'm looking around on their part\nWhat was that was that the vendor company that was putting PC Anywhere on the on the machines as maintenance but the softer wasn't taken off [noise] is that what you're talking about in that case there was something different\nYou know know what I'm Talking about is um uh there there is a company the our systems my actually I think they may still [laughter]\nThey may still a U.S not have confirmed whether or not there there certainly was an attempt to hack them I'm ... and again they manufacture IPO books and and deal with registration databases\nOr electronic pull books or what you can kind of what argues they're often or a tablet or art or or computers that are used to check people in 'em and uh uh as I said uh\nOne of the Muller indictments there was an indication that there was some dinner and it sounded like them that that was actually breached\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine be compromised\nWell I'm a well that's actually quite a controversial question if you ... you mentioned\nUm well so let's start off by making distinctions and I am and Larry really helped um I'm making the distinctions among the Russians um what they were doing in various ways um you know perhaps to influence the elections ranging from\nUm affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think um\nIf we're asking about um what can be done to hack\nInto say machines\nAnd systems um in the first um distinction we would make is between you know the voter registration systems which um where he was just talking a bit about 'em you alluded to at the Twenty one states\nUm they got attacked those are voter registration systems um and then there are the voting machines themselves which can either be electronic voting machines that are used in several states um\nOr potentially the scanners that are used to scan\nScan paper ballots and if we're thinking about voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners um that's actually the answer to that question is actually quite um quite controversial you made a reference to that Khan um activities and\nSo what we do know is that if you have um access to I'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerabilities are well known that um you know a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine\nAnd do things to it um the\nUm what election officials will say is that first of all I'm In general the machines that have been broken into and DEF CON I'm either had been retired or in the process of being a retired and then secondly\nUm that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be successful against these machines um require such a degree of direct access that in order to have I'm actually an effective attack on them\nUm and you would need some sort of inside job um that would require a lot of attention to particular machines and we'll be easily ...\nThe computer science community thing 'cause it's easier to actually affect this type of kind of brute force attack against on the the guts of the voting machines than the election officials to\n... hour they right um well I mean I tend to kind of um\nIf I have to go with one side of the other I tend to my take on it is I'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about what the um what the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities\nAnd are taking 'em um are taking steps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that um the election officials that that are using electronic machines especially the ones that don't\nHave any sort of paper record of the election when they're in a position where they have to say well you know given everything we do to try to protect the machine is physically we're confident that they're not being attacked and we're confident because of the logic and accuracy testing we are doing that um there were mistakes made\nBut a skeptic can I think rightfully so even if you think the election officials have done everything they could\nI think there is still room for a skeptic to say yeah but wouldn't it be great if one could independently verify that the machines weren't monkey with and there weren't mistakes and the programming so um so I I tend to you know I I tend to fall on the side of thinking that the machines right now for\nTwenty Eighteen are well taken care of\nAnd are highly unlikely to be subject to the sorts of attacks that we see at DEF CON but it would ... who it would be good for the states to move in directions\nTo make it easier to demonstrate to skeptics that that was\nI could just jump in real crush point um I I I I think there to to build on on what Charles just said ah I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about\nUm uh problems with them and potentially somebody reaching them in various ways but but um [noise] more importantly there's there there's a lot of the election infrastructure of course that is connected to the Internet um and an example of that my an obvious example was election night reporting which comes out\nUm and that's how we get the unofficial results although we don't call them that on election night very quickly um that comes up on on websites and gets reported out and uh we we\nReporting attacks um and um if if you get the incorrect numbers there in in the environment that we have today the hyper partisan environment where there is\nUm a lot of false information put out on social media ... I was talking earlier about that level of interference from the Russians and the two thousand sixteen election casting doubt on election outcomes if you don't have as a as we don't in in in a Thirteen states at least in in some polling places and Thirteen states\nA paper back up that you can go back to afterwards and say yeah maybe there's been doubt cast on these elections but we can go back and we have something that's independent of the software to tell us the results [noise]\nUm I I think that's that's very dangerous and I am hopeful that the Thirteen states where we still have these um paperless systems or that will be replacing them before the twenty twenty election\nIn signing the Paris climate agreement nations agreed to keep the increase in global average temperature\nTo quote will below two degrees Celsius a critical point at which the planet gets locked into a future of catastrophic impacts such as rising sea levels more devastating floods and droughts widespread food and water shortages and more powerful storms\nAnd to ensure that we don't get too close to that to degree tipping point the agreement ask\nCountries to limit the temperature increase\nTo just one point five degrees Celsius but how much does happen to agree save us from the most devastating impacts of climate change a new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the I. P. C. C. this week has shed some light on that\nIt highlights a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to one point five degrees compared to two degrees or more [noise]\nThe conclusion every bit of warming even that full point five degrees matters here to break down the report and tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years\nIs Dr Kelly the Vin she is senior associate with the world resources Institute Dr living welcome back to science friday\nThank you so much to be with you\nI Want to send out a shout out to our listeners but you know with this question as we barrel Tour de one and a half degree increase in global temperature are you worried are you worried about climate change impacting where you live give ... give us a call our number eight for for\nSeven to for eight to five five eight four four seven to four to five five\nYou can also tweet us at ... fry 'em so Dr living the the the goal is to prevent it to a degree increase in average global temperatures but this report tells us\nThat even a one point five degree increase is going to bring some pretty big changes\n[noise] yeah that's absolutely right said that and has the government actually has these two goals as he said to limit warming well below two degrees and pursue advice from one point five degrees Celsius of warming and now is because some of the most vulnerable countries you can think of that small island ... states\nAnd so what this report did was look at what are the differences between warming of one point five degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of warming and how much harder is it to get to one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to two degrees Celsius and they found that indeed we are definitely not on track\n'em and and the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference\nAnd for example [noise]\nSo for example on what they found is they looked across a number of different systems and they found\nA for example for extreme heat the percentage of the global population exposed to a severe heat wave which we've already started to experience with one degree of warming\nOn at least once every five years is two and a half times worse with two degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming\nIf you think about on sea ice free Arctic in the summer on when you don't have any ice on top of the Arctic\nOr this could happen at least once every hundred years with one point five degrees Celsius of warming but at least once every decade under two degrees Celsius of warming and that can impact climate change even further because you have a dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth\nSea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one point five degrees and wild that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to millions more people being impacted a species losses um two times worse\nFor both plants invertebrates that lose at least half of their range under two degrees of warming as opposed to one point five degrees of warming three times worse for insects\nI'm almost forty percent worse uh under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the Arctic in the Arctic I said these are some really big numbers one of the most um devastating and surprising wants to me was for coral reefs\nWhere the report found that under one point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of a further decline and coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent ah which is just tremendous\nKnow does it look like there's any way we're going to be able to stay on the river to point zero degrees\nSo what the report finds is that both um two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible on there have been a lot of modeling studies where analysts come together and see what would have to happen um to make\nFifty to get get tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\nThey're projected to increase even with the climate change commitments that we've made under the Paris Agreement by twenty thirty\nInstead we essentially need to have that amount and go down to twenty five to thirty gig tons of carbon dioxide per year by twenty thirty and then we actually need to phase out net admissions altogether by mid century\nSo this is a tremendous transformation and decriminalization rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about on it also would require behavioral and technological shifts across the board\nSo for example by twenty fifty we're talking about renewables projected to supply Seventy to eighty five percent of electricity or to be able to me at one point five pathways we're talking about reducing energy demand increasing the efficiency of food production changing dietary choices\nUm a lot of different measures ah which were I'm just starting to do in certain locations but none of them do we need\nTo know the president said he wanted to know quote who drew the reports I won't go there with that can can you answer at least who commission do what they do they use [noise]\nSure so on the way that the IPC she works on is on in this particular case under the Paris Agreement there was an accompanying decision and that decision\nOn requested the PCC the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change to put this report together\nOn and what the scientists do they commissioned about a hundred different scientists um had had a very lengthy review process of several different drafts being um reviewed publicly reviewed\nAnd I was one of the reviewers for that on the scientist basically assess all of the recent literature and in this case on one point five degrees Celsius and see what the science says\nI'm up to a certain cut off point where the literature is published\nOn and then they put together a detailed technical analysis interestingly in this case there's an accompanying summary for policymakers which was agreed upon and Korea\nUm about a week ago and that all of the government's signed onto including the United states and that is actually something that I'm negotiators come make sure that they feel comfortable with the um the implications for policymakers so in this case I'm part of the answer is that the United states I'm did actually endorsed this report\nFrom a ... a lot of people want to talk about it but I'm going to go to the phones to\nSo I'm an agriculture and I think what ends up\nConfusing people when you talk about one and a half degrees people are real excited about it\nWhat really hurts us in our culture\nIs the high temperature is the record highs so for example in the mid West is corn gets over Ninety five degrees Fahrenheit at night it kills the pollen and greatly reduced to view or in the Central Valley of California when tomatoes when the pilot temperatures get very high over a hundred degrees that kills the pollen\nAnd so this is really critical of the er the highs not just the average temperatures and fixes by growing more plants that's what the little ice age was about\nThe north America for a screw back for a hundred and fifty years after Columbus and all these trees took so much the out to the atmosphere it's cool to play it at all so much we had all the little ice age\nI Wish more of the scientists will talk about that because we can we can substitute a lot of our renewables can be biofuel vial death of the things like that that will instill make us grow more plants\nAnd we can have them for food feed and feel I buy you are you a farmer [noise]\nNo I'm a researcher actually but I have a small farm and on the developer energy super which makes food for food feeding fuel all and the same maker and the uses little water and nitrogen\nYou know everybody thinks we're going to have some input Seattle to an atmosphere where all the plants will take it up if we switched to the renewables using plants\nBurnt let me get a comment thanks thanks for your call what about can we saw some of the CEO to reverse some of the\nThings on it to some really good points here I think first on as um as you mentioned the one point five degree goal is for global average temperature increase temperatures increase at any one location especially on any one particular moment in time\nAs well as its impacts are going to vary and that and it's an incredibly important point an interesting leader the report does talk extensively about carbon removal\nAnd on says that not only do we need to pull out all the stops on a mission reduction but we actually have to remove carbon from the atmosphere and on a scale that we need to ramp up significantly", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Billings", "day": "12", "locations": [["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637],

sections and if you have the story you'd like to share with us about\nYour a C section or your partner C section while you had it had to go I was in like please share with us\nGive us a call late for for seven to for eight to five five where you can tweet us at science\nFry phone eight for for seven to for eight to five five or tweet at scifri fry but first last week's report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change gave us a sobering look at what a world worn by\nTwo degrees Celsius might look like then on the heels of that report Exxon Mobil announced that it was throwing financial support\nBehind the U.S carbon tax it's a big step for one of the world's largest oil companies which last year was sued by its own employees for misleading statements about the environmental and financial impact of fossil fuels\nAnd has a history of denying the climate science settled\nHere with the story as well as other short subjects in science is ... or ... staff writer for vox mayor welcome back to science friday\nThanks for having me again so Exxon says it's going to back us carbon tax on a service that sounds like a good thing but what exactly are they proposing\nProposing to back a lobbying effort launched by conservative former secretaries of state George Schultz and James Baker this is a group called the climate leadership council and it proposes starting with a forty dollars per ton price on carbon dioxide emissions and that price would rise overtime\nThan they would use that money to go back to people like you and me essentially in the form of a dividend or rebate and the estimated ... ...\nJuan ... a roll back some other environmental regulations and one big catches that they want immunity from climate change related law suits that want damages for these companies\nIt's the same deal that the the gun producers have [noise]\nYeah pretty much it's kind of analogous to what they got and it's what I'm other industries have also tried to get\n... ah actually I have a complicated relationship with climate change it it's been a head of the industry in acknowledging it's a problem\nThey've had researchers who helped to author the PCC report and yet they are also being sued for misleading people about the impact of fossil fuels years ago and in two thousand they took out ads in newspapers saying that the science was not settled I mean should we be taking this seriously or is it just another\nYou know ... ... make us look good sort of thing\nThat's always the question isn't it I mean the thing to remember what Exxon is that they are an investor owned company so they do have to answer to their shareholders and they've been getting a lot of pressure in shareholder meetings to better address climate change also climate change poses a business risk for them um in terms of their facilities and\nIf they aren't out ahead on this they might get slapped with a carbon policy that they don't like that doesn't actually work in their favor and another way a carbon tax might actually benefit them is that it would target the dirtier fuels first things like coal which would clear some space for one of axons other products natural gas\nAnd of course the catches the things they want to exchange for getting other environmental regulations rolled back Andy immunity from lawsuits I mean those are all things that benefit the company so yeah this could be viewed as an act of self interest overall\nYeah we're gonna have to look deeper into this as in in the weeks to come let's move on to speaking of a warming planet there are a couple of new studies this week that Joe massive losses of wildlife that had scientists worry tell us about that\nThere are a couple of different studies that kind of have a grim outlook for white humanity is doing to nature one of them looked at Arthur ... in Puerto Rico which includes you know insects centipede and spiders creatures like that\n[noise]\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow for anyone having a baby the decision to have a C section he is not unusual but what is unusual is the number of seats Chechens happening all over the world listened to this to worldwide rate has nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent\nIn the past Fifteen Years and in the United states one out of three per se east by C section now\nA series of studies in the journal the Lancet look at this trend to see what is behind is up to pick what are the effects on mothers in babies\nAnd what didn't you ... can be done to decrease that number and that's what we're going to be talking about C section rapes globally also what's happening here in the U.S and my question for your listeners is did you or your partner you get a C. section\nWhat factored into that decision what was your experience like you can phone it in or you can tweet\nAt shy fry let me introduce my guest Holly Kennedy's an author author on that lasted Siri she's also professor of midwife midwifery at the Yale School of nursing thank you for joining us for that alec enemy\nThank you uh tell us alliances series looked at a hundred and sixty nine countries in overall there is a rising C section rage can you give us some of the numbers of different regions of must have buried around the world [noise]\nWell it does and um what we found was that over sixty percent of countries over U C sections and twenty five percent under use the the procedure so there's a quite a disparity and there are multiple reasons I'm part of it has to do with um\nThe um sort of socio cultural acceptance of surgery as an normative um thing to do part of it has to do with um insurance and um access\nAnd a and a large part of it has to do with um women not being able to get a ... birth after they've had their first this area and so it it's it's it's complicated we've seen the rise I'm\nIn a particularly in North America Western Europe Latin America and the Caribbean for example in Latin America it's gone from thirty two percent to forty four percent\nAnd um it it there's a bit of a paradox when what we would call 'em\nToo much too soon and too little too late so in the countries that overuse says area and they are probably intervening too much in low risk women that really don't need the procedure and in countries such as in Africa that um\nDon't have enough to access probably are under using it for the world Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about right about right so when you you think about one in three women in the United states having 'em as his area and we're way\nOver was talking about over ... there's just to for example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital getting C sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there\nWell I Can't speak specifically to you know the the interaction but but you write women who are wealthier who have insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have a C. section and it's and it's and accepted normative part of the culture in in Brazil\nAre there are big differences within countries and\nAnd again that has to do with access\nAnd a wealth education um interestingly enough I'm women that are have greater education are more likely to have this as area and and um which is a bit of a paradox in itself because [noise] um and as soon as area

and preterm birth leader and with um subsequent pregnancies and it's one small part of the piece of ... of the puzzle in the United states were increasing maternal mortality rate\nYou mentioned that in some places there's too much in some places not enough what are those not enough places like and why\nThey're not enough places are places that don't have access in particularly in Africa and and countries that have lower resources so they just don't have the facilities to to do is his area and sometimes when women really needs it and I think it's important to stay at at the outside there are women\nWho and babies that that it is a life saving procedure but it it's not one that should be done for the majority of women\nI Want to focus on a little bit about what's happening here in the U.S and why she sections are increasing your Tony Golan it'd be\nVice chair of quality in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center in Boston Welcome to science friday Dr ... thank you for having oh let's let's talk about this um [noise]\nBut there's also this idea of of planned C sections right the did you have to approach this do you have ... have you seen this in your experience\nIt's quite interesting I think there's a natural suspicion that this is a major contributor to the C section epidemic in the ... and the United states at this point and well it's true that a family's women can request to have the delivery of biases area and\nIt turns out that that's not really the most significant driver on in our experience at Beth Israel Deaconess for example which is a tertiary care institution academic hospital I'm In the middle of Boston I it really only contributes to about one percent of our deliveries per year\nSo while some of this could be attributed to ...\nThink that we as health care providers need to um realize that we are probably the major major contributors to the rise considering delivery right here in the U.S\nWhen you say health care providers you're talking about the doctors who actually are performing and\n[noise] yeah uh so certainly the doctors the obstetricians um they're the ones who make the recommendation versus area and I'm at the end of the day on that who's responsible\nUm it's a complex environment to practice obstetrics so there are other things that put pressure possibly on obstetricians um we had incomplete somewhat inaccurate data about health and fetuses during labor that might contribute to our decision making\n'em the progress string labor in terms of the cervical dial a nation I is subjective so that can contribute to some inaccuracy\nThere's other things that happened on our unit that might put pressure on us other emergencies that might be happening on a labor and delivery unit that might put some pressure on us to make quicker decisions to move toward delivery\nBut at but at the end it's really our decision on as obstetricians to make that recommendation and generally speaking when we make a recommendation like that on patients and families do say yes um and they ask questions but they generally do say yes\nA highly what's your reaction to\nOh I Would completely agree with her the the culture of the unit\nWhere a woman who's giving birth is very instrumental um there's a number of strategies we can do to promote of a first time mother having a badge and birth and but you have to have the staffing you have to have the commitment to do the kind of care that's going to help her\nAnd her physiology two two best achieved ... birth\nLet's go to the phones let's go to northern Kentucky Hi Lauren welcome to science friday\nIra thank you You're welcome good\nThough I actually had an emergency thirty why do we um [noise] and I think for that\nFor that but when I got pregnant that time I really wasn't given the option of that over after that I kind of had to do all that it um it said I said I I I look at\nWhat they I I look at what were the very end user pregnant [noise] and um it really was it was\nLike my provider\nBut I wasn't that get their risk and then it it will make it really it it that's it and so I think that I was able to\nActually win that Senate rain heat and then I changed my mind at thirty six and I but I really ... them with that and I was able to see that but I like a lot of them are nice and given to me by my provider I really had\nOkay in a lot of information what area motion and it was really hard to find the ...\nOr ... let me get let me get a real it's great great call him and get a quick reaction Tony ... you know I'm truth be told I must be should be [laughter] but I'm Wondering through you back to ... everybody had to have one C. section after another and learn was sort of thing you know I didn't know that maybe I didn't have to\n\nMm Martin hooker inviting you to join referral program dedicated to the\nDrawing what momma don't looking and much more on the next move on friday night at nine o'clock\nWhy they are supported by the Whitney Center for the arts that shared in college featuring Venice baroque orchestra November third exhibitions throughout the year and the other day Whitney at ... galleries information and tickets at Whitney arts dot org\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we've been talking this hour about the increasing the number of C sections and what that means for women's health\nMy guests are Dr Holly Kennedy professor of mid with free of the Yale School of nursing the Tony goal and vice chair of quality in a department of of obstetrics and gynecology at the famous Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and though lots lots of folks on on the line and let's see we only uh gosh I Can't get to everybody let me ask you how are you you worked in research midwifery in the u._k. how does the approach there compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nWell it it it differs in several ways and actually when the land this Lancet series on C. section came out that W World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help help us look at decreasing says ... and\nAnd one of the things that they have recommended is what the UK does which is to have a collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have midwife and some women had an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed\nIn the Lancet also published a series on midway free very extensive review of the evidence and they found that midwifery was associated with improved outcomes increase the including decreasing C sections and so one is what I'd like to just mention is in the United states\nThat study came out this earlier this year that mapped the integration of midwifery across each state to see how ... how friendly the state was in ...\nAnd so if you look at the at New Mexico which has the lowest sea section rate of of just about Eighteen percent twenty six percent of births are attended by mid was in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent of birds are attended by midwives\nAnd then they met that without comes and uh if you look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst maternal and in and out comes in the country and only one percent of births are attended by midwives so that's not a causation it as an association type study\nBut it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um we do have a model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with their midwife midwifery ... than they feel respected um you have better outcomes\nA tornado when you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital dealing after a decade went from forty to twenty nine percent in a in a decade what did you do there\n[noise] well first we recognize that we had a problem and I think that's step one and trying to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence but the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications forces areas and focus very narrowly on primary says Erin I'm first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are in labor that kind of monitoring called fetal heartbeat monitoring is very tricky\nIt's quite an accurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but does not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well\nAnd nonetheless obstetricians base decisions on this test um I often say that and no other area in medicine would we make surgical decisions based on such a on such a faulty test\nNonetheless it's ubiquitous and people use fetal heart rate monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing the fetal heart rate chasing using\nScience and objective criteria rather than subjective words um we focused on our documentation our communication\nWe also really tried to make sure that people were using scientific modern definitions for progress in labor\nOr old definitions were assumed that women would move much faster and labor than newer more modern data really prove to us we wanted to make sure that people use modern definitions for what we thought was normal labor as I mentioned\nAnd then also some other operations issues for our unit to change the culture of our unit\nFor misspoke here at the Beth Israel and to do with your family is from so blown down here in Boston and so does this all mean to the to the hospital you go to determines moralistic you'll have a C section or not\nUnfortunately it does a and so uh one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on sit there and delivery rates is that if you look from one hospital to the next event separated by one or two miles from one another\nWho take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics\nThere's is there and delivery rates may vary by as much as ten percent\nThis is unexplainable by any other reason other than the environment the unit that you work in the people that you work with and the general enthusiasm for ... birth\nOr we have a tweet ... that's relevant to this and services I have to wonder how much of the increase has to do with how much money insurance companies make on them versus a typical delivery did did you study that your your your report Holly\nWill ... a ... not specifically except that it is the recommendation is that the financial strategies women who are having more money or where wealthier\nWe'll have more C sections so which implies that\nUm they can get you know reimbursed for that and one of the recommendations that the series made was to not pay more for ... to really um level the playing field and an end in addition to liability reform\nUm many in studies that I've conducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do a C. section but all I can get sued if I don't do one in in time or perceived to be in time\n... you're you're ...\nIssue of reimbursement as is interesting here in the u._s. ah where by and large physicians are obstetricians do not get a a vastly different amount of money for ... delivery than necessary and delivery however the hospital does\nAnd that is something that I think isn't quite transparent for patients on and probably reimbursement itself\nDoesn't influence a lot of obstetrician decision making here in the U. S. Adrian person is greater but it really goes more toward the ...\nHi I'm I've had two C sections and um they were mandated by the doctor due to complications real Crohn's disease and so I I really appreciate this nuance discussion but I just wanted to get a perspective of how this is actually playing out I'm\nAmong laypeople and patience and um I think a lot of the talk about this has become very anti woman um when I told people that I was having a plan C section\nDue to my chronic illness complications I had male friends think things like well are you sure you don't want to just labor for a little bit maybe you could just ask if you could labor for a little bit and I really interpreted that\nKind of questioning you know can I be a woman if I don't you know push the baby out ... and and that was really upsetting to me because my two beautiful daughters wouldn't be here if the C sections were not available to me\nAnd I you know I think um I just think it's really important for those at the academic and and provider levels to understand that that people are hearing these discussions\nAnd I think taking them and sort of inappropriate um in different directions slides I'd love to hear the response\nOr I got about a minute to Tony are only\nWould I Would I Would completely agree with you that one of the most important things in this in this conversation is for the provider and the woman to talk through what is important to her and and so that she can make an informed decision about the best strategy for her so it it is\nI Would completely agree that it's important that\nYou have that conversation and and the risks and benefits of both ... since the Syrian or fully ... fully discuss\nI'm Antonia what about this and the charge of sexism their\nPoint well taken I think you know any extreme is going to be dangerous I think it is important to realize that regardless of how a baby is born\nI'm the person who gives birth to the baby becomes apparent uh after that happens on it's no less are no more regardless of what the motive delivery ... delivery I'm certainly makes you just as much as the mother on as having a vegetable delivery", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "19", "locations": [["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Mexico Guatemala", 15.83106, -88.77719], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Russia", 60.0, 100.0], ["China", 35.0, 105.0], ["Iran", 32.0, 53.0], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Turkey", 39.0, 35.0], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["bay county", 43.59447, -83.88886], ["Panama City", 8.9936, -79.51973], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["North Carolina", 18.38078, -65.95739], ["Washington DC", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["the U.S Virgin Islands", 17.72751, -64.74698], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Puerto Rico", 18.24829, -66.49989], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Brazil", -10.0, -55.0], ["Brazil", -10.0, -55.0], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Boston", 42.35843, -71.05977], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Kentucky", 38.20042, -84.87762], ["Venice", 45.43713, 12.33265], ["Whitney", 36.57849, -118.29194], ["Boston", 42.35843, -71.05977], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["UK", 3.51342, -132.1875], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["New Mexico", 35.08449, -106.65114], ["New Jersey", 40.72816, -74.07764], ["Alabama Alabama", 32.75041, -86.75026], ["the Beth Israel", 32.83875, -83.63351], ["Boston", 42.35843, -71.05977], ["the U.
