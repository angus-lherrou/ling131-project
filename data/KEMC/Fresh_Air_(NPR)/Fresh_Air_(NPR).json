contributing editor for Rolling Stone where he's written for more than thirty five years to Curtis new read and considered him a friend although not a close one\nAs part of his research Curtis interviewed many people read new including his first two wives Lou Reed cofounded the velvet underground which you played with from Nineteen sixty four to Nineteen Seventy\nThe band was initially managed by Andy Warhol and was part of Warhol seen well many bands of the time or singing about peace love and losing the Gen x Lou Reed was writing songs about heroin street hustler and transcripts of sexuality he continued in that direction as a solo artist\nBut he also wrote sons that had a spiritual quality to Curtis says other than Bob Dylan the Beatles and James Brown no one has exerted as great an influence on popular music as Reid has read died of liver disease five years ago at the age of Seventy one\nTo Curtis says he wouldn't have written this book while Reid was alive quote this book does not at all times see Lou the way he wanted to see himself\nAspects of his sex life his drug use and is cruelty that he came to be embarrassed about or discussed here in detail as our his generosity and his kindness his talent his vision and his genius unquote\nWe recorded the interview last November when the book was first published and started with the song heroin from the velvet underground first album\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nThat's Lou Reed and Anthony the Curtis welcome to fresh air and congratulations on your new biography of Lou Reed\nMakes you so much it's a pleasure to be here so let's start with that song which sums up so much about what may may Lou Reed different from other music\nAt being made at at that time um give us your take on heroin and how it fits into not only ... career but into the larger music of that time\nIt's I'm such a daring statement you know especially was recorded in Nineteen sixty five it came out in Nineteen sixty seven [noise]\nAnd you know lose various outrages under which they would certainly have filed a you know he's going to gay bars and acting out as a gay person you know we're elements of that but it wasn't like we're going to make him straight you know I don't I just don't think that was part of it\nBut it was mentioned when you mention gay bars and and him being gay but he's also with a lot of girls at the time I\nWell yeah that's true and that there are people I mean this was a really I mean it it's a very it's an issue very much at the moment interestingly because I'm kind of gone around the block\nThe anything he was on a like fluid in his actual alley yeah\nI mean one of his girlfriend's a describes him as inter and [laughter] it's the kind of interesting usage I think you know there was part of Lu I think that was up for anything and\nBut I've had gay friends gay male friends like write to me and say you know you describe this element of Lou but he was really gay\nAnd the other day I got one of those and it was you know it was a pretty stern email that you know made me think about what I had written I had lunch with one of his former girlfriends she was saying look there's no way Louis gauge\nHis sexuality with something I think you know as you gauge the adage you so you wanted to see you know and I I think Lou was kind of hoping to go and wherever that was\nAnd I think everybody had a language\nFor it then well that's right they didn't that language didn't exist [noise] yes I did want a guy I just didn't want to say one thing about his parents because you know there really was this sense you know after the shock treatments of of lose never forgiving them for that\nBut when ... left the velvet underground he went back and lived with his family\nI Am here girl price on Iran or exactly yeah\nKnow and and uh I once said you know his first wife was talking about Lou being cheap introducing a guide you ever wanted to spend money we were living in these all these small places he would never ask his father for money and at that point in my research I I took loose story as you know the truth\nAnd I just said well with his father ever given their money and she said of course he would have given him money\nYou know his father was a very conventional man who would have loved to have a son that wanted to take over his accounting business you know he didn't get that he couldn't get around you know a lot of what lose life and you know even his art was like but you know on the other hand whatever Lou needed anything he was there and\nYou know that was one of the complexities Lou dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his sister\nYou know a ... you know it wasn't as simple as a\nYou know as it might initially seem\nAnother thing that really just like amazed me\nA reading about this in your book is that after the velvet underground split up and he went on his own you didn't have any money not eat set so he got a job working for his father typing up in his father's accounting office yes extending have trans grass have is that [laughter]\nI Try to let it they don't have any I always would say goes you know well my mother always said you know like a you know you should have something to fall back on and kind of typing was not for me\nUm you know I think it was just a way to to buy time in making money and if they were already ... yeah exactly yeah somebody told me a story I wasn't able to confirm this but that the night Lou ... with the velvet underground you know after a show at max is Kansas City\nUm that his parents were waiting for him in the car to drive and back to Long Island I mean I could never get that confirmed but it's certainly possible and he certainly did move back there immediately and you know they had that kind of relationship it was a\nYou know along with a you know this kind of you know festering anger that Lou felt I mean he would never meet with them without his sister being there he always refer to them by their first names it was never like mom and dad\nUm and you know he certainly would characterize them in song you know in ways that you know must have made their skin crawl\nBut ah yeah but in real life you know got along with them fairly well so early\nIn um the velvet underground period\nThey team up with Andy Warhol like Andy Warhol brings them under his wing he wants he wants to have a man she I'm kind of have yet to kind of expand his his his his reach\n'em and what worked and what didn't work about that connection with Warhol what were they ... didn't work for lead\nWell let's you know that's very interesting question because you know um [noise] yeah ... or ... Andy wanted a band in the same way you know it was just like oh you know\nKnow rock and roll is getting to be a thing and so they found the velvet underground um you know through some you know ... you know artists who had gone to see them and thought they might work for Andy\nI'm you know a Andy Warhol and Paul Marcy has kind of like right hand man at the factory their studio\nDecided that the the velvet underground more kind of too boring looking so they got Nico yeah who is a you know a German model an actress and soon to be singer to you know to be their lead singer you lose not crazy about that\nBut I think he felt like Warhol was going to bring 'em a degree of visibility\nThat was good it was important and that he would just go along with it he limited Nico sports as patient as much as he could you know um she only saying you know a few songs\nOr the band was pointedly called the velvet underground and Nico you know like that is she's not a member of the band\nAnd as soon as he could he got ... you know he kicked Nico has the band as well after having an affair with her\nAnd well that's very true [laughter] exactly you know\nPart of those times um and\nThat was a you know so that was one of the issues of Warhol\nA Warhol was great because you know back then you know I was a kid in New York around that time where I was in the newspapers all the time they're not\n... you know not art critics reading about it and although that too but it's just like a this crazy guy you know he thinks that Campbell Soup cans or art and he went to this party the other day I mean every day was in the newspaper so whatever he did got attention\nAnd uh you know Lou took advantage of that but that also hurt the velvet underground in that\nYou know rock and roll certainly back then was pretty Ernest thing and the war whole seemed like a put on like a joke oh this is like an Andy Warhol version of a band you know for for people who hadn't heard them yet you know unheard I'm amazing there so\nYou know I think eventually like once they made you know certainly the first album and we're in the process of making the second one I think\nLou felt All right we've kind of established a baseline here now and he's got to go I you know this needs to be a more professional operation and you know there's no way Andy Warhol was you know a rock and roll manager of you know any note\nGas is Anthony ... is the author of the books we read a life\nIncluding his wives and his trans partner Rachel I'm Terry Gross and the expression that\nRight [noise]\n\n[noise]\nDrive\n[noise]\n\n\nAround\nThe new power Family Foundation supports WHYY fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation support for NPR comes from this station\nAnd from Amazon Prime video with the Roman all the new theories from the creator of Mad Men starring Diane Lane Noah Wiley Christina Hendricks into Andrew rattle a new episode every Friday on prime video and from ...

I'm In the sun the lyrics are inspired by some of the trans women he knew from Andy Warhol was a factory so so let's hear it and then we'll talk about [noise]\n\nHoliday from Miami ... hitchhiked away from us they loved her eyebrows on the way to shave their legs and then he was she she says the the\nSick along in the wild and said hey honey ...\n[noise] Mm [noise]\nCandy came from\nActually read walk on the outside his album transformer which was produced with David Bowie I'm\nSo that so that was actually a head friendly but it sounds from your book like he was ... he wanted to hit so badly finally has any\nSounds like he was actually kind of ambivalent about it\nWell that's you know there were you know he was pulled back and forth by you know his desire you know look Lou Reed grew up in an era where there was no I mean the velvet underground sort of created this you know where it was possible they're good to be a rock band had have credibility and not have hits before that you either had hits or you went home\nYou know more than more than that yeah yeah\nPrecisely and even if you did have hits you know you gotta\nLu I mean I learned that um ethics kind of in his DNA\nAh but at the same time you know he saw himself as an artist and he saw himself as want us to do serious things and\nAnd take left turns and you know go in New directions and so the degree to which you know the record companies like oh okay great we've got ahead like now let's do take another walk on the wild side or walk on the wall side again and that kind of irritated him and you know of course he made Berlin which at the time was vilified\nOr you know later to be you know resurrected and and uh I ... but you know at the time it came out it was regarded as a you know just an outrage and crazy move because it was you know such a a harsh and depressing records [noise] um [noise]\nSo you know he would turn it on himself you know he would he would do whatever he needed to do\nTo to restore his standing once you have destroyed his standing you know because the next thing was rock and roll animal which was you know a big FM radio record of a big success at a big seller was alive album at a good one [noise]\nUm yeah but then after Lou made that you know a record or two later remade metal machine music which nearly destroyed his career it was just an hour of just you know deafening guitar feedback you know it was again a gesture that with ... before Lou did it\nAnd um that's how they wanted he wanted to have is music rich people and be loved and be popular but at the same time he distressed and that and wants to be like outside the mainstream and outside of that kind of acceptance\nAnd exactly and it's almost as if he wanted to punish people for like [laughter]\nHonestly I mean I think that was I think that was an element of it mhm mhm [noise] um so I'm In his ... he said that that album basically ended the period of his life where he describes himself as gay what what changed\n[noise] um well one thing was the end of his relationship with Rachel which was a which is documented quite movingly or in the song street hustler part call slip away\nWearing you know he says you know she took the the rings right off my fingers and you know he in an interview on you know at that time you know said\nNo that was real she did that I mean essentially you know saying like Rachel you know\nThey had been falling apart there's some\nLots of\nLots of theorize about why that is in some sense of I'm Rachel wanted to make a transition that she was taking hormones whether Lew did or did not approve of that but one thing that happened was Lu met I'm Sylvia morale is sue became his second wife\nAnd you know began moving more into that relationship and getting serious and that was\nUm [noise]\nYou know over the course of two or three years Luke got clean a got straight\nAnd um and his gay life became something that\nI mean he's still honored in certain ways a song like Halloween parade or a you know there would be references to it but he would never speak of himself as gay after that you know I think he had very complicated feelings about his um his homosexual life\nAnd even if he was out there as anybody could be he also turned on it and are often not with that\nYou know that much um [noise] bitterness but uh but still we would never discuss it [noise]\nYou know so I I Want to play a different accept at St ... the ... not to slip away part that you referred to sure where the part that's about somebody overdosing\nUm and the person narrating the story is like so called just so indifferent about it it's almost had setting to listen to you but it's it's yeah it's great music and it's great writing um so ... this is the middle part [laughter]\nA a street hassle trying to say anything about this this part yeah I'm\nDrawing on the story of a a guy who used to be around the factory he was found dead\nOr industry a as an thought to be kind of that he was hit by a car I mean that was the official story the unofficial story that was that he had died of a heroin overdose in somebody's apartment and they dragged him out onto the street and just left him by the docks\nI'm as if he had you know had an accident of some kind\nI'm Lou turns that male character into a female character and then you know describes the guy who is the host of the party 'em urging a his guests to get this girl's body out of his apartment\nDon't live in and it really was nice jogging and I really wish that with ...\nWould you know can be a hazard trying to sell to police shows how was your old guys and it's not like we did ... there was this new one to do and that was made you know I Would have been the first\nWoman to the moon during that we're within a universal choosing ages\nAnd [noise] the way that is really something you see that as long as we would you be more around the girl\nIt's either this is the worse it says I don't have to choose I get a loan and I knew I knew in\nTreating is when you ... when the weather being just lay around the yard is driven by mornings you know they hit and run [noise]\nNew people new chores and then move on to\nTalk of the things even colder all those things that they see that\nLevel than the right to be one they follow it you know it's called bad luck", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)",

you illustrating books for young people you know I picture books I I have graphic novels for for the middle grade reader and middle grade as you know seven to eleven years old\nI got to go back to school [laughter]\nThey were so lovingly crass though you know they curse around but it was never directed towards me and I remember they want to say like you know we were okay if you Kurds but if you ever course at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men you know\nUm they smoke two packs a day each nah or and my grandfather just be moans this movement of uh having places be non smoking\nYou know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like what an inconvenience to the point we said Jesus Christ by the time I dying to get to heaven and they're going to say sorry no smoke\n[laughter] he died of lung cancer you die yeah you'd actually well at eighty one [laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years there's also a heavy smoker also heavy smoker yeah and I should say to\n'em you know she she died the summer before my wedding and unfortunately she died ah she died on a friday or my wife's wedding story was that Sunday\nAnd the months leading up to that you know my fiance at the time Gina now my wife she'd be over and and uh my ... my grandmother is hooked up to oxygen and we always had thought that she just had a bad bladder 'cause she was always excuse herself to go to the bathroom and you know like you know she's smoking\nRight with the oxygen around her and oh it's oh gosh that's deemed as though they were so lucky the hosted and explode\nYeah so do you think your grandparents were different people and they were raising you then when they were raising your mother and\nI Know they were I Know that my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and I and I think a part of it was a ... my mother was their second child there first daughter\nAnd I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother still this that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had for my mother Leslie because\nThat took Joe's attention away I'm Joe when Leslie always had a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always front\nAh surely was also drinking ... a lot of them um she should drink quite a bit\nYoung you know have recurring nightmares as a town about monsters would you describe a nightmare [noise]\nThis recurring dream where I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know where they're just force\nAnd these tall lanky monsters like like almost like naked alien zombies would would slowly come out but if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters\nAnd so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but that of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping in every dream ended the same way in which they were just on top of me\nAnd I vividly remember those dreams and and yes there in there in the book and and those were difficult to drop because um you know you're writing out scenes is one thing when you have a series of letters that make up words and make up sentences\nBut visually they don't look like anything but sketching out this book was difficult because you're facing these fears are facing these these nightmares or you're facing these people once again\nWhen do they stop these nightmares [noise]\nProbably some time just before high school I imagine I met remember how I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then it was kindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same school same building for all those nine years\n[noise] your grandparents later told you that that they often open up the bedroom door and find sleeping right outside of um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone that any of the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and so they certainly were the kind of people who thought he should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now in them open about that to help a distant ties you seeing someone is talking to somebody\nOn a professional level um and that's where for me are was such a saving grace because I I did work out some of these issues in my sketchbooks and and in my drawings\nWhen you took art classes and you're in high school\nYou are with your with your drawing you were really proud to tell your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have the reaction you expected what did you teach you say\nOh he was the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I I brought in this book was so excited you know I thought I was get extra credit I read the whole book\nAnd without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just had like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned\nAnd and by that what he meant was ... that that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive ... this is how you have to draw muscles [noise]\nThis is how you have to ask\nAnd so he as an as a as an educator of the art and specifically use teaching comic book classes you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that like a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artist or drawing them professionally at and in that moment ah and and back then this was now the early nineties\nThe thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and dressed somebody else's character\nSo that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh I could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that's a possibility\nAny tells you you had your own style and that you should develop that he did that upset and what did you learn anything nevertheless [laughter] from the marvel comics books Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics ... that that was actually useful for you\nIs certainly a there's a lot about gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know that the punches like really real back or the punch has been fully blown but not right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise]\nYou know framing you're shot you know there's still a lot of value in that book and I still have the book um\nBut in regards to art style I think any sort of how to draw book I think Paige wants to\nEverything about your [laughter]\nMy guest is Jared J. ... his new graphic memoir hate kiddo how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with family

looks\n[noise] I'm\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his songs or read his homes\nThere was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of existential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is traveling you by the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time\nAnd that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so

grew older that was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\nAnd you grow older than you than you sort of see I remember um\nI remember I myself was making a record at the

confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record and was expecting him to\nRefining but instead he turned to me and said man he's scrap you record that's an amateur move said an amateur

occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from him at all but just to follow her own whims and uh my father would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road

Saturday we decided to postpone are scheduled interview with Jonah Hill we'll hear that tomorrow today we're going to talk about how ... views echo the rhetoric of the white nationalist movement\nAnd about the threat that this movement poses\nI guess ... a Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter who is the author of a book about that movement titled rising out of hatred and focus is on the story of Derek Black\nGehrig's father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan\nCreated the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nDerek was seen as an Arab parent in the movement but here we now says racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties\nIn a few minutes we'll hear an excerpt of the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with Sasha ... this morning\n... welcome back to fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program\nWhen I heard about the massacre the synagogue I thought about your book ... black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father Don black is still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front he did not pull the trigger the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that\nBut do you find Don black story relevant to the views that were expressed\nBy the shooter Robert Bowers\nI think you can draw a straight line from dawn views and gone to work in this movement to the views expressed by the shooter um you know not straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooter spotty yet attached to a fourteen eighty eight to white nationalist slogans\nFourteen refers to a fourteen word for the statement of purpose that is central to what storm frog does about em securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children you know in and saying things like I'm here because of a white genocide and I can't stand by and watch my people get\nGet murdered 'em as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language in the motivation that exist on store front and that's\nThe way that they speak about this a quote unquote race for that they believe is under way\nYou know the um uh ... hours had had said that um\nGenocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believe the Jews are committing genocide\nThey do and both Don and Derek were central to the the sort of creation of that language even the term genocide that was one of the main things that Derrick and Don tried to spread and popularized on the radio show and it was and the idea behind it was that instead of speaking about ah you know\nMinorities and slurs or things like that that they could appeal to white people by the idea that their race was slowly disappearing and more than that that this was a genocide that somebody else is doing to white people or you know it's it's a ludicrous idea um but unfortunately it's had huge purchasing this movement and and now\nWhite genocide I Would say is probably at the top of the paradigm of white nationalist ideas\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front\nTo the shooting and synagogue I'm In ... is the site that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founders son\nSo so what are you reading on storm front now\nThere are some really vile I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say\nThat the largest reaction on storm fronts um is is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storm front over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that\nWell this probably isn't quite the way to go about it uh he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself\nBut our our global is and that choose who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so have you spoken with either done or Darren black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nI've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um you know and and I think that he's\nHeartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels in small ways Gulf War and he wanders um you know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism plays into\nYou know incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating the phrase white genocide and said to popular icing on the movement said to then have somebody going to a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio um\nIs the author of the book rising out of hatred about Derek Black a former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Derrick black and ... will hear that interview after a short break this is fresh air\n... ...\n... no no no\n[noise] [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air the social media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nWe're going to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Derrick black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we noun sing those views when he was twenty two he helped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nBarracks father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm front\nDerek Black is the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli sass low who we heard from earlier in the show I interview with black also included Sasha though the first question was addressed to Derrick black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to it's like it's not that we are better than but we're all better off being separated by by race is like\nMy dad popular everywhere and white nationalism in so that was his thing\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was far it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he founded storm front and called it a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy is being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that was not about superiority it was just about the ...\nLooking back on it there's it's totally irrational I how exactly do you think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nCandidate for a second I've always wanted to know\nThe early people who rebranded white supremacy to white nationalism whether they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream movement and make it more palatable or whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did believe they were not doing bad things to other people that\nThe uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better\nUm the the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race and their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confidante way\nInception was everybody is basically all white people are basically race if they're just afraid to express it so let's give them a language in a safe space\nSo they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insult or they lay\nClaim to word [noise] um\nIs racial out all over the years if you look at the language in terms of how many people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively\nPursuing an cause of separating a\nYou know races into into different homelands am white supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is so if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguished movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures\nEffective in useful for us as we talked about it [noise]\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Jared black a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who was since renounced those views and Washington Post reporter ... who wrote a book about black called rising out of hatred we'll hear more after a break and Terry Gross and this is fresh air [noise]\n\nUm ... um\nThe new by our family

a\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nI'm Talking about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme than it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kittens and the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against at every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire\nIdeology the end point to the ideology is built on a fallacy an end\nFor me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on what you mean that you want to separate people have different races and different places like ... percent what percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at so\nThat is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining\nThere was a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public\nUh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to are we going to do this or that and one of those with how are we going to define who is white because only a white person can be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white\nAnd so that was very clear there's no way to say the what's the twenty three and be a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white in and were something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to as to who is white was that you had a\nGenerally be considered visually white by most people in America and you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're

who would you know Jewish and gay and who were very upset when I found out who you really are um you had Jewish friends who reached out to you\nEven had a girlfriend who ... who didn't initially no was Jewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends said to you\nThat made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nBut I think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to met through about dinners took the strategy that I think it was very very smart\nOf ... are not talking to me about it or I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up well every this other thing that we were possibly interested and did\nA and I think the Matthew said that the reason for that or was that it would have\nBeen a not as effective at allowing me\nTo see him and dinners as people\nThat when my family is talking about something anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or talk about his life\nThis is very human and he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish\nJewish people in having Jewish friends did you see you know\nJewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that the Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermined the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups that are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all of white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where\nEither this is this is crazy when you to stop attacking Jewish people back off\nIn addition to being the story of Dexter information I mean I I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on this campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYou know profound change and they did that in a lot of different ways I mean there was\nA civil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of cast Derek out and made it clear to him how how awful and how he'd for and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who ah\nWho won one is trust built in a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like point by point went through and and\nAh and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited Derek over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build a relationship hoping that\nJust by spending more and more time with them he would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes to the people and to the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in of itself can be transformative\nAnd I think it's important to note that that did not happen quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the beliefs of this ideology and the things that Derrick had said Matthew in ... in between these dinners would sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site\nAnd they would see the horrible things that you said about Jews and and ... yeah\nUh Jews warm their way into control over our society Jews must go all Jews Moscow and you're in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid and beliefs Jews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe\nThe Jews have propagated a scheme of multiculturalism and uh\nMatthew in ... had also in their own lives experienced large degrees of anti Semitism in ... case he's a from a family of Hungarian Jews there was all but wiped out by the Holocaust that in Bergen Dawson and that was the definitive experience of his\nYoung life was growing up in an orthodox community that was largely defined by\nA by by an an incredible history of anti Semitism and and the Holocaust and\n... had had gone and traveled to these concentration camps and had had learned German to connect with his father's history and Derek and also learned German because of his very divergent family history and the fact that the two of them a week after week we're sitting at the same table sometimes having conversations and the Germans they learned because of\nBecause of these incredibly diversion family histories and began to have an effect\nThere's a lot of Holocaust denying within the white nationalist movement can you explain to me how it's possible to believe in the first place that the Holocaust didn't happen", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)",

campaign and Russia\nIs my guest Greg Miller he covers intelligence and national security for the Washington Post\nThis year he shared a Pulitzer Prize for national reporting now he's written a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia innocent version of American democracy it's a chronological narrative connecting many of the most important stories on the subject and adding new reporting to those stories\nGreg Miller welcome to fresh air is your story that you helped break the you consider the most consequential story of candidate or President Trump and his administration what\nI mean there there are several um stories of obviously many stories of the Washington Post broke that I had a a hand in one way or another uh ... obviously working very closely with some terrific an amazing colleagues here\nI think the one that jumps out for for many people as the story a that said that that former national security adviser Mike Flynn had not been honest about his conversation with the Russian ambassador Sergei ... that\nWe wrote the story saying that he in fact had discussed the lifting of sanctions on Russia in those conversations and then lied about it to the White House or to news organizations including our own and to the American public\nUh and this was the sort of just one of many huge stories that we broke during that time and a couple of others that I was involved and include\nThe revelation that the CIA had reached to a ... a secret conclusion that Russia was not just trying to disrupt the election was was was trying to help elect Donald Trump\nAnd then later when Trump was in office I broke several stories about his rough conversations with foreign leaders ah we had the transcripts of some of those calls and the story about his um revealing\nLet's start with a ... I guess that I really do have consequences Flynn was fired\nSo and was fired within days yeah yeah so you know you helped write the story\nThat Flynn had calls with the Russian ambassador to the U.S surrogate Kislyak telling ... that the Trump Administration would lift sanctions to like don't worry about it uh the sanctions imposed by the Obama administration and these calls happened\nAfter the election but before the inauguration\nI'm All right so how did how did you get onto this how did you start investigating this story\nWell I'm you know so\nAfter the post reported that about this secret CIA conclusion that Russia had in fact sought to help elect Donald Trump had had essentially had a candidate in the race\nI'm On the other hand we're things happened that had never happened to me as a reporter um several of us started getting carts ... actual letters in the in the mail a thanks for readers from far away places\nUm notes on on our even on my doorstep at home I Would walk through the neighborhood and suddenly people would stop me and thank me and\nI mean that was ... that was felt great too and it was odd it was something I had never experienced\nWell let's take a short break here and then we'll taxing more if you're just joining us my guess is Washington Post reporter\nGrant Miller he covers intelligence and national security he's part of the team that shared a Pulitzer this year for national coverage his new book is called The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy we'll be right back this is fresh air\nYellowstone public radio

[noise]\n[noise]\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us I guess as Greg Miller Washington Post reporter who covers intelligence and national security he shared a Pulitzer Prize this year and now he's written a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy\nAnd it kinda brings together a lot of stories\nAbout candidate and President Trump and the company administration stories that have been reported by Miller and other reporters that the Washington Post now you write in the book that Trump has avoided consequences for offenses that were long considered politically fatal often by lying\nThat you used the word lying lying when used in the same sentence as Trump [laughter] is very controversial and the journalism world because mine implies intent\nYou know a fall to is when you speak something that isn't true line implies that you know it's not true and you're saying it anyways so people are just weighing ... is is worthy of using the word lie or not so you've used the word lie so I Want\nTo ask you about how you decided to use it\nYeah I mean I feel like um it is a difficult decision and we don't we don't throw that word around lightly we um we often get criticized at the post for being\nToo reluctant to use that word and I think that's true to other news organizations as well but at the same time\nI mean we're here at this moment are you know we have a fact checker at the Washington Post to his documented\nFive thousand or more fall swords from this president since he's taken office many of them are false words that he repeats despite repeated corrections public corrections repeated efforts even by his own staff\nTo um to correct his misstatements I mean there is an intent to I don't think there's any doubt that there is an intent or that it is part of it's part of Trump's per se car very complex personality it's part of it and it traces back to\nHis origin as a as a as a public person um I mean we have run fascinating stories here at the post about\nA times earlier in his career when he would adopt phony persona and call reporters for Forbes on the phone and try to lobby them into inflating his net worth for magazines in magazines annual rankings I mean there is a\nThere is an intense here and I don't have any doubt about that or or real any hesitation when appropriate from using the word lie\n[noise] after Flynn resigned under pressure um each spoke to Devin noon as the Republican chair of the house intelligence committee\nAnd you say that what he told you was basically the opening of what became an ongoing CJD by Trump and his allies to discredit the FBI what did he\nTell you\nThis was at a time when we're trying to figure out well we now know that Flynn had discuss sanctions would the Russians was basically cutting a deal behind his government's back with Moscow\nWhat the Kremlin during the campaign if anyone right so we're we're digging by our news organization and many others and this was a conversation with the chairman of the house intelligence committee Devin Nunes has who has who is read into all of the most sensitive intelligence on questions like this\nAnd I was asking him you know what else is there we are seeing lots of indications contact between Jared Kushner and and officials for Moscow and other members of the Trump Organization we already knew about Paul Manafort of course\nAnd he says that the FBI has been looking at this and all and it's all a dead trail\nAnd I pressed him because I could not believe that he was saying that there was already abundant evidence of contact you could say that that was incidental and meaningless and harmless but you couldn't say it didn't exist but\nHe says it you know when I pressed him not even pizza boy delivery contact and it just struck me at that time that that was\nSo implausible um that he was you know he was trying to throw sand in our eyes basically uh in my eyes as a reporter he was trying to um protect Trump\nAnd that that was um more important to him in that conversation that adhering to the facts that had already been established\nMy guest is Greg Miller who covers intelligence and national security for the Washington Post\nAnd has written a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia innocent version of American democracy we'll talk more after a break and TV

I'm not going to trust and not and I don't know an anonymous source [noise]\nUm so what are your own rules what are your guidelines for using an anonymous source and for how to use them and and and also like who knows within the editorial hierarchy at the post who those sources are so they\nCan be confident and do any fact checking that's necessary\nSo that's a great question Terry and it's really an a really important one\nAt this moment because we do depend on anonymous sources um for a lot of the stories we do and frankly if we weren't able to use anonymous sources\nWe would really be unable I think to give our readers in the world an accurate picture of what's happening in the U.S government inside the Trump Administration inside the CIA or abroad\nAs Bob Woodward says over and over again I Want when we say anonymous source the reporter knows who the source as it's the readers who are kept in the dark about the SARS but it's not like you know ended up leaving yelling you the information\nThat's absolutely right the sources are not anonymous to us um these are sources that um we know who they are um many in many instances their sources we have known for\nGiven us information um and you know frankly even in that case when we're writing sensitive stories I we talked earlier about the the Mike Flynn story and how we ended up\nHaving nine separate sources there's no magic number nine was not the magic number we had to get to to be able to go forward with the with the publication of that story could have been two or three\nIt's more about the caliber of the sources their their positions and whether they have access to the information that they are providing\nA how trustworthy are they how much do we know about them inside inside the Washington Post there are lots of conversations at varying levels of specificity about that sourcing\nSo sometimes you might be asked well what is the position of the ... whereas the sourcing coming from from the story um who are we talking about here and you can you can basically described their positions in government\nSometimes if it's highly sensitive senior editors are going to want to know more they're going to want you to identify your source and that you know that sometimes can get a that can get touchy depending on the nature of your agreement with sore say or source be but\nIt's something you know ultimately despite you know we we all of these accusations and criticisms that's our reliance on anonymous sourcing\nI mean the the record just sort of holds up the stories that we've written over the past two years attributed mainly to anonymous sources\nHave almost all proven overtime to be accurate I mean there might be mistakes at the margins here or there were a news organizations aren't perfect and ... and we do make mistakes but boy we've gotten a lot right\nUm and I know Marty Baron the executive editor at the Washington Post talks frequently about you know the post and other news organizations um are always trying to get it right but at this moment in our history where we are under such attack all the time and accusations of fake news\nYou know there's extraordinary care\nGiven to getting the facts and even the nuance exactly right it it's really it would really be damaging to not just the Post's credibility in my credibility as a journalist but to\nThe broader um journalistic community if whenever we get things wrong there's a lot riding on the media right now in its ability to do its job and do it well and do it right let me try to give you one more example of\nThe reporting environment that we're trying to operate in just how much pressure we're under as reporters how much pressure our sources are under a as well\nThat former FBI Director Jim Comey had kept every time he met with Trump every time he meets with Trump something happens troubles him he goes straight to his computer types up a memo to record what ... what transpired\nOne of those talks about a conversation he had with Trump in the oval office and most of the coverage about that memo focused on their interactions about what Trump wanted him to do in terms of backing away from the Flynn investigation\nBut Trump is also complaining to call me in that in that setting\nAbout the leaks that are plaguing him at that point early in his administration he's complaining about how are people Howard news organizations learning what I'm saying into this phone and he points to the phone on his desk in the oval office\nHe's complaining about stories and he's talking as I read this memo I realize he's talking about me he's talking about the stories that I had written for the post combing is talking about yes I agree with you sometimes it's great to put somebody's head on a pike as an example the Trump goes on a joke about putting\nTrump goes on to put joke about putting to say he believes reporters should be put in jail or in jokes about how once reporters spends a little time in jail they're making new friends suddenly they're willing to talk\nIt's a really disconcerting moment for anybody in journalism anybody who cares about journalism um but for me it it was just eerie um to to think that he's talking specifically about stories I had written for the Washington Post\nThey're talking about heads on pikes reporters in jail chasing down sources it was it was unnerving it make you afraid\nWell\nLet me let me ... ... ... it\nIt made me afraid I I was confident enough in my ability in in how I approach sourcing that I wasn't worried about that I work for a news organization that has my back um and that's a good feeling\nBut it is frightening in a way Terry and I remember talking about this at home um when I saw this memo\nDescribing this document to my wife and what was in it\nAnd our seven year old was at the table with us and he heard me talking about it and using words like jail and he's following this conversation and I maybe it was being too careless as a parent and bringing the subject up in front of him but he started to cry\nUm it is frightening it's um\nWe're just trying to do our jobs um we're just trying to get to the truth we're trying to fulfill the role that the founders and vision for for the media in this country and it's an important mission\nMiller thank you so much for talking with us and thank you so much for your reporting\nThank you\nGreg Miller is the author of the new book The Apprentice Trump Russia and the subversion of American democracy he covers intelligence and national security for the Washington
