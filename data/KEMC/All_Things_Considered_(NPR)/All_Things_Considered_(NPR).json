Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly the defense department is sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nAs well as an order from President Trump last week when he said the group of migrants from Central America moving toward the border poses a national security threat here's air force general talents or ... who's in charge of northern command\nReno border security as national security and the U.S military will eventually be these capabilities to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom ... says something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border right is this fifty two hundred active duty on top of those exist in two thousand\nJust goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops were providing support duty switches transportation aerial surveillance are kind of thing and the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities in these additional five thousand or so active duty army troops\nWe're told but this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first still do do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas creating more car bear a barrier is more razor wire fencing of crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agencies to more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter there's also a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so\nThese soldiers were also builds camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all legal there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders and the U.S this is this is all legit\nAt well that that's what the officials say they make clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties ah there were only in a support role again and the policy come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen seventies and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used in former Confederate States and that law prohibits military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would be carrying arms or have any others are we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty trips to the U.S Mexico border uh I don't recall\nThe president for sending active duty troops have been some sit in the past and again in a support role\nIn this case uh you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot these troops who are doing everything again from constructing camps flying border patrol agents Soviet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks\nEven the lawyers in public affairs staff and uh again general are shown as he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the ... the same number of troops now in Iraq and maybe not as many

tell us what you've learned about him\nWell he's fifty six years old he is a resident of South Florida are you registered as a Republican in March of twenty sixteen he has a pretty lengthy criminal history in Florida that includes charges of a felony theft and drugs he was also arrested over a possible bomb threatened two thousand to\nA he appears to have really kind of struggled for a very long time to find a place to maintain a steady income uh for example he filed for bankruptcy back in two thousand twelve or on that for him he said that he lived with his mother that he didn't own any furniture his occupational on that for him that he listed as store manager\nToday had kind of the hallmarks of a climax of the investigation with the FBI Director the attorney general all talking about it now that he's in custody is that what happens next\nWell the FBI but wants to know whether it's the talk was working alone whether there was somebody who was helping him with this the last one to know whether there are any more packages that were sent but aren't accounted for yet ah because remember there were more discovered justice morning there could still be more out there\nAs things stand now a race says that each of the Thirteen devices that have been confirmed had six inches of PVC pipe a small clock a battery there was wiring and a potential explosive material\nSo that lab analysts are still examining those but he made clear that these are not hopes devices\nAnd of course one big question his motives do you have any information about why he allegedly sent these packages to prominent Democrats CNN critics of President Trump and targets of President Trump's criticism\n... attorney general Jeff Sessions was asked that exact question this afternoon he did not want to say much on the topic all that he would say is that ... appears to be a part isn't a but that will be determined by the facts of the case I'll say that I've looked through his Twitter

in Ann Arbor the national\nUnemployment rate is lower than it's been in half a century three point seven percent\nThat's a huge turn around here in Michigan the rate was close to Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy we wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry\nGM plant just outside of Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plan under one roof it was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM shut it down in two thousand ten it's odd standing here\nSee motion all\nI'm sure it is it's crazy what is the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear today\nA sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on the freeway on the way here and\nYeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of the local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but ah yeah it was a dark and scary and\nYou know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and step son that has that each of them have taken since then reflect larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall and took a buyout [noise]\nNow at age sixty he helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburb\nBeautiful here too yeah very elevated you ride the lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry the days are over them good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM's pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nAre not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people and all these great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck current workplace policies that eighty see you again today Don green is a nurse at an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scribes\nThat everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nAfter she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than forty\nStreet jobs went away the health care field group and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really going to be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to ... when the plant closed ... did the thing about marriage have anything to do with all the people that was going on in your professional life\nYeah I Would say because um I at that point\nWas used to being independent used to being able to to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that wasn't there anymore I felt like\nI had to depend on him\nI think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about the work family that you had a willow run\nHow many of them would you say\nAre in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled in on their feet\nI'm not going to say that percentage of them\nIn and it gives me kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoyed your life after that but I Do see around town people that\nI worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don green son Peyton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot Peyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift at willow run when\nHe was a tea do you have that job for about three years\nIt was like a tease really you know I feel I can kind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and doing all this you can just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired and just live a normal life but\nThat was not the case\nAs you say when it went down the drain a little bit\nPeyton has struggled since he left willow run he's been in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and came back he just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts there he's doing seasonal\nThose are fireworks going off overhead at wired nights hair haunted thrilled part\nHating runs around in a full body costume all night with seaweed dripping off a snack all to face [noise]\nSo a decade after the economic crash each of these three family members has a job they're all making less money than they did at willow run\nAnd what about the plant itself it seems like a fantasy world or something or you know the current owners invited us to take a tour along with Don Skidmore who was one of the last people to leave when it closed down this is his first time inside the gates since that\nDay [noise] controlled say him six hurting the freeway\nEnter our tour guide is Jeff Rupp he's chief technical officer at the American Center for

this little circle Dr ... office buildings right there yeah so we\nWe left it\nLike the trees like the leaves on the street\nIt's kinda cool kind of eerie and [laughter]\nYou know I remember when it was real it's like two worlds overlapping past and present we pull up to what used to be the front entrance to the plant it's now cut off from the public Skidmore gets out of the car he stands on the ground where he used to lead union members picketing traffic jams talking horns\nCars are driving by themselves are crazy world\nA big sign like a billboard looms over his head the GM logo is long

N. F. or the intermediate range nuclear forces agreement\nThen President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed the treaty in Nineteen eighty seven advance oh short and medium range nuclear and non nuclear missiles NPR Shannon ... has the latest the\nUs says Russia violate the treaty to developing a medium range missiles that is able to have NATO member countries at short notice\nDefense secretary James Mattis has described Russia's breach of the agreement as untenable Kingston reef the director for disarmament research at the arms control association an advocacy group says the Trump administration's withdraw from the treaty will allow Russia to continue the deployment of that type of missile and revive Cold War tensions\nAll constraints on the production of feeling that missile have gone away thereby increasing the threat to our allies particularly in Europe and range of those missiles\nCompetition with China was another reason for the U.S withdraw China was\nWithout constraints hunch Christensen is the director of the nuclear information project at the federation of American scientists which promotes international transparency and nuclear disarmament\nChina has taken a rod modernized version of its military forces and as part of the modernization has increased its own inventory of weapons to fall into the on air fringe\nReach says the end of ins may portend us withdraw from another agreement the new strategic arms reduction treaty or new start which limits nuclear warheads deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles for each country\nThe apparent breakdown of the agreement and the uncertain future of another bilateral U.S Russia arms control treaty the twenty ten new strategic arms reduction treaty or new start creates the most serious nuclear arms control crisis we've seen in some time\nChristians and says withdraw from both treaties with sperm military competition globally\nYou'd be the first time especially since the Nineteen seventies the would be no nuclear arms control agreements regulating the nuclear powers of the world and so the door would be wide open for potentially a new arms race between these countries\nThe last time the U.S withdrew from a major arms treaty was in two thousand two when President George W.

going to return to a difficult and for some people a traumatic subject that's been much in the news we're talking here about sexual abuse we're finally starting to hear from women and some men who've experienced this far more rare though are stories from people who have witnessed sexual abuse and stayed silent about it\nDon ... was in high school when he attended a party and he says he saw a young woman being raped through a window that was in Nineteen sixty nine and over the ...\nFor the Washington Post and dump ... is with us now from his home in the Pittsburgh area Mr ... thanks so much for talking with us thank you you wrote this piece after Christie bossy four testified about what she says that now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both in high school is that what made you want to write this piece after all these years\nYes that is what motivated me I watched her testimony and I thought it was genuine you know I felt she was really telling the truth plus ah the things that she forgot wore the same things I forgot you know so I said well I'm going to just write something that but my experience which was very similar\nI did something bad I said in the article I committed a crime and I did\n[noise] you know what you wrote is hard to read and you know for some people it's going to be hard to hear about this so this is where again I'm going to say that for some people if this is too much to listen to them you know take a minute and step away from it but I'm going to ask you to recount for me what it is that you said that you saw and you were at a party right\nYeah let me start by saying this was an unusual\nEvent for me because I never went to parties never and so I don't even know why I went\nI I didn't know anybody that all of a sudden a kids came upstairs and said hey go outside and look through the basement window sill about ten of us went out there and I happen to be right in front of the window and I'm watching and as soon as I look through the window I see a\nA girl just lying on a sofa she looked like she was passed out and so the kid went down and he looks up to us any waves to us and he starts smiling and then he starts to take her genes off and then he he he took her paintings off\nAnd then he he pulled honest than\nAny one on top of her and as soon as he did that he was starting to have sex with her she kind of came to and started hitting him on the shoulders he jumps up right away\nAnd all of us at ... at that window was outside we all just started to run\nMhm you also write that you and other boys are the party started touching another young woman who\nWas also passed out on the on a bed but then you you left\nYet this was later maybe twenty minutes to thirty minutes\nA she was laying on the bed and uh what one kid was doing was when the lights were out everybody was touching her he would turn the lights on and everybody would pretend like they weren't touching her\nBut uh it was enough\nYou know you wrote about why you think the girls would never have said anything about this they would have been blamed and shame they would have been told it's your fault [noise]\nBut you never said anything either why do you think that is\nAh [noise] you know I I think I wanted to forget about it and plus later on it was just just plain guilt you when you're guilty about something and I was guilty and I admitted in in any article ah you you don't want to tell anyone\nOne of the things about your piece that I think struck a lot of us is that you said I wanted to tell this story because I Believe it's time for men to tell the truth about the ways they've abused women and what role has been in creating a culture that tolerates this we've all seen things we've all heard other men talk and you wrote about a couple of examples where you just heard\nPeople say these crazy things and you know nobody did anything and why do you have a sense like why do you think that is that why do you think this has been tolerated so long\nI I don't know I I don't know why we've kept quiet I had a quote from somebody some man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder instead of admitting you committed a sexual assault\nAnd uh I I Can't answer that I don't know I I really don't know why men have been silent\nOn this issue but I think men should be part of the me too movement I think we should come forward and uh talk about what we've seen what we've done\nI think that should be part of it [noise] how did your family take it when you told them [noise] [noise] well [laughter] let let me tell you when I originally told my wife I told her just the rate part that I witnessed I did not tell her my\nParticipation she didn't know that to this article came out ... let me just say it's a it was tough for her to say let me tell you but everything's okay now everything's good and how did you explain that to your boys [noise] well\nJust I was truthful with him and uh they were very receptive on their dad you know dad's can you know we we kinda can't do too much from in the in the eyes of our kids\nAre they both told me that my two older boys they don't think it would happen now they said everybody at that window would have had their phones al videotaping it has to but that\nOn film you say well we film everything you know what they were kinda alluding to\nWell how do you feel now that you got it off your chest you know [laughter] and I have mixed\nFeelings I'll be honest there there are days when I regret\nIt and then there are days that\nI'm Glad I did\nYou know my kids showed me some comments on Twitter from people some women have said it's about time someone it it's almost as if I was the first guy to admit this\nA lot of women ah said ah they were glad I did it and they felt better about themselves a few women who have been actually a salted\nWho wrote notes to me said that they made them feel better and so that made me feel kind of good you know\nYour piece was very moving and I one of the things I think I was like every paragraph of it I could quote but the fact that you think about these women I mean now and you wonder\nWhat happened to them like how this affected their lives I mean if if you could say anything to them if by some miracle they were listening [laughter] what would you what would you say\nThe only thing I can say is I'm Sorry I didn't help uh you know few women had called me a hero but no I wasn't I Would have been a hero if other help these women then but I didn't do it Don ... thank you so much for talking with us thank you\nIn recent years have been many disturbing stories involving male athletes and the women in their lives so it may be hard to remember just how shocking it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine when Carolina Panthers wide receiver rake Ruth was charged with orchestrating the murder of his pregnant girlfriend shriek Adam's\nApple [laughter]\nGr Ruth was acquitted of first degree murder and that supported the death penalty but he was convicted of planning the murder carried out by a hit man she was able to deliver the child named chancellor but she died weeks later\nCould Ruth was sentenced to more than two dozen years in prison but with time served he's scheduled to be released tomorrow from Sampson correctional institution and Clinton North

it's called careers and it's got Fowler is with us now from Charlotte Scott thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you so much for having me on the show really per se\nAuthorized his attorney to speak with you it's my understanding from your reporting that to this day he's still denies that he was planning a murder he says it was a drug deal gone wrong in essence he says that he was a coward not to kill her that he thought that van ... trying to kill him\nAnd he left the scene but that he didn't do anything about is that about right\nYes van Brett Watkins was the hit man that truth hired to commit the murder or you know drive by shootings sort of situation\nAnd truth yes I have spoken to him on the phone for about twenty minutes but off the record so it helped inform my reporting some but\nIt was ultimately his attorney who who I most recently spoke to for the the pod cast that's exactly what he says it was violent retribution van ...

B. S.\nMeaning he wants them replaced a new era gold\nIdeally I think you would like NBS removed or at least weekend in terms of removing his de facto powers on on the foreign policy side\nSo is this speech directed really add to President Trump the U.S is that the the nation that could bring this pressure to bear\nA air to one certainly recognizes that turkey doesn't have the potential to do this on its own and so it really is going to be as you say the United states that is going to have to do this\nOr to one has been quite quiet over the last week and a half and a lot of the information that we've seen coming out has been leaked from Turkish government sources and I think it's not an Turkey's interest to have a complete rift with the Saudis\nBut I think this weekend when there was a very weak admission from the Saudis about what happened in as you noted some\nQuestions about their their claims about what happened the effort has shifted from showing that it was a premeditated murder by a professional team who came to sample a to providing a possibly in are the ones who remarks tomorrow more evidence of direct link of these operations to NBS himself\nWhich then it would put further

very prominent tool in a lot of pop R B and hip hop\nProduction\nTo me auto tune sounds sort of like digital stretching are flexing your shearing a singer kind of slide up and down the register\nWell

has been following the buzz around\nThank you a pleasure to be here I'll say how controversial is this in the art world or a painting to be painted by a non human and then auction off like fine art\nWell I think every couple of generations you have something that happens that begins to redefine what we consider art\nYou can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the euro and oh by Marcel Just shop where he literally took a men's urine on hung it on a wall right\nAnd this completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what are actually is for the twenty first century so I don't think that it is I'm a once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen\nAgain and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you price a painting that is not the product of a human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand it things like technique and the uniqueness of a piece of work those are the factors that drive the price and art so\nHow do you price art where those things don't really apply\nWell they still apply but let's add to that let's add to that the market ability\nOf a painting let's add to it the hype that's created around a painting or any work of art really I tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price it in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is\nAll are within the same wheel house in terms of number\nAnd does that or just ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process the rollout\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the voters who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artist ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the ... the collective\nAnd maybe even a little bit of a nod to Christie's for helping to create the frenzy around it and\nGiven that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garner the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so I think\nTime and a I generated art work hasn't gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off and so this is the first is the absolute first time this has ever happened because this is a Kansas print\nIt is absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it at a smaller limited and numbered edition after the sale\nI don't

New Hampshire state Senate thanks for being with us pleasure to be here well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae BP to people to run for

believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think guy finally I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an allergy ... woman being a first generation American being a veteran and\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people are going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my

served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nWhen I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell us so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so in a little time um but it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way it says he and twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world look like Thirty years ago for someone that's my agent uh [laughter]\nAnd I I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard to murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been\nMade altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term\nProcess the Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for our advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae beauty cue candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance\nWas saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community stepping wants to run for office kind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there um were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future LTV tiki candidates as well do you know\nYeah I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what it merely disgust which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think it's less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nOne of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just want to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper\nThan we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene and Amelia do as well to those young people that are falling behind us [noise] I Want to thank\nAll three of you for joining us today Dan in is is running for

created by masses of microbes growing up from the floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of a total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland we're even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should fall from MIT [laughter]\nHer ... and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our for lack of a better word that kind of look like ... bars they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist\nAt NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they use the proto type of an instrument that NASA\nIs planning to send to Mars to look for signs of

Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters\nWho had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use our ground be found in the midst of all and to the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis we reached out to win Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on\nWho you listen to that whole conference call yesterday\nCannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied them entry based upon that\nJust to parse the SAT there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister 'cause right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state\nBut they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable you know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation of less chaotic going forward\nWhile I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or do what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which is\nHuge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\nLens ... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nThe state of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state\nThe rules are less stringent in the

knock down walls quite a few gates is the former head of FEMA and a long time urgency management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities in the panhandle\nIn many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nThey just as a part of Florida that's what I call it the old Florida is not a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction\nIs all generational of Florida families many of them or just said that Trump folks that fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard

the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise] you know I think mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump for sure on immigration policy health care and other friends\nBut he's a lot more measured and cautious about it the most Democrats running for Congress this year\nNear where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to
