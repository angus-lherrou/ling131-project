social network on the planet\nReference let your Harper an Episcopal priest is the executive director of green face a groundbreaking national interfaith environmental leadership coalition river and Harper estimates there are about three hundred thousand houses of worship in the United states\nHe says that if only ten percent were to upgrade their facilities with lead green building certification it would result in huge reductions in energy use and greenhouse gas emissions Reverend Fletcher Harper spoke at a recent buying New Year's conference\nVery often religious communities are strongest where environmental leadership is weakest religious communities are are frequently very influential in the moderate to conservative wings of cultures around the world it's not the only place that they're influential but it's definitely one of them\nAnd what we find over and over again is that when the unlikely messenger such as a conservative religious leader steps up and speaks about climate change it's worse than I mean this literally in terms of the impact it's worth ten of us liberal getting up and speaking about it for the simple reason that it's an unexpected messenger\nYesterday and the Orlando Sentinel we had a an op ed place by Reverend Richard size that can pastor Joel Hunter pastor hunter is the pastor at one of the largest mega churches in the country saying that Florida needs to wake up\nAnd deal with climate change and recognize that climate change the massive threat as soon as possible\nAnd the fact that you got [noise] the fact that you've\nGot someone of Joel Hunter stature investing his time in his energy and his political capital and that is really significant\nTo educate faith communities about the value of creation care Reverend Fletcher Harper finds universal religious teachings that speak to the ancient wisdom of our ancient connection with the sacredness of the natural world\nEvery single one of the world's great traditions has multiple stories that are absolutely central to the identity of\nMuslim tradition Mohammed was on a retreat outside of his home city you know he's on he's on a mountainside in a cave in the middle of the night in utter solitude and all of a sudden angel Gabriel\nAppears and and commands and to listen because he's about to receive the Koran in when the Buddhas first and lighting whereas these meditating underneath a boat tree and you know to this day Buddhist monks go out in the forest to meditate 'cause they get it [laughter] um [noise]\nYou know you see in in the Christian New Testament Jesus as baptized in the waters of the river Jordan he comes up out of the water is driven\nOut into the wilderness by the spirit to wrestle with the devil and to get clear about who he is and what it's all about and then in the Hebrew scriptures Moses first here's the call of God to lead the children of Israel out of bondage into freedom he's\nHe's tending his flock at the far edge of the wilderness it says in Hebrew and that's where he sees the burning Bush and I mean these stories they cascade through the sacred writings of the human family and they all point\nIn this same kind of direction which is that there's just something that's absolutely irreplaceable happens outdoors there's an awakening to who we are of what our purpose in life is and it's not an optional part of being a human being\nAnd lord knows the indigenous peoples of the planet have grasped this for [noise]\nFor millennia I mean for far longer than the actual religions and that's a heritage that's of tremendous significance\nBut I think also it's it's not only about safeguarding a place for human consciousness to come to its fruition it's also about recognizing that that we need to extend the moral canopy that religions cast so that they cover not just human beings but the entire created order\nReverend Fletcher Harper through\nCoalitions like green faith and interfaith power in light people of faith are expressing their deeply felt reverence for the yours just as morally guided religious figures led the civil rights movement creation care is an emerging movement for sustainability as well as justice\nMore when we return [noise] this is church without a roof keeping the faith with creation care I mean Harvey you're listening to the buying year's revolution from the heart of nature\nTo explore more ... radio shows and video programming please visit media Don buying New Year's dot ORG\nLike interfaith power in light green faith in powers houses of worship across the U.S to become centers of sustainability and their communities again Reverend Fletcher Harper\nThese buildings are teaching tools and we've seen over and over again with our work that when we help a religious community when we get financing for religious group to install solar\nIt gives the members of that community a place to go kick the tires so to speak and to see what this is like and to see that it can work and it's the same thing it can be the same thing with waste management with water conservation with the use of less toxic\nCleaning and maintenance ... you go down the list and and these facilities need the model that as part of their reason for being in and we try to help them do that with\nResources in in all those different kinds of areas um and then and then also we try and work hard to help them integrate these themes into advocacy\nUm a lot of religious communities have done good advocacy work over the years on issues of hunger and of housing for the homeless and things like that and we work with them to say you need to be advocating for adoptions in diesel emissions because that's killing more people around the country every year than guns are\nYou know you need to be advocating about climate change because that's gonna be devastating poor communities and the natural world on a global scale you know so we we try to work the advocacy piece in as well because at the end of the day we've got to have things happen at a policy level individual behavior change isn't\nI mean it's important but it's not ... it's gotta happen on a massive scale to make a difference so we\nWe try to help faith based groups do all of these things and we find that they are increasingly open to it\nOne example the reformed church of highland park in New Jersey\nWe started working with them they had never engaged environmental concerns that all it wasn't that they were opposed to it they just had never done it\nAnd so we went in the first thing we did was an energy audit which enabled them to reduce their energy usage by about twenty percent through very simple lighting retrofit temperature management installation and programming of programmable thermostats mean basic stuff but stuff that really makes a difference\nWe did away started for them we went out into the law in the courtyard outside of the church we got a big tarp laid it out in Port a week's worth of trash\nApart and they realize that they could probably recycle about fifty percent of what they were throwing out so they put a very well structured recycling program into place for composting and separating everything else out you know dropped the amount of solid waste that was going to the landfill dramatically within a matter of months\nThey started installing low flow of reduced flow toilets and Fawcett flow reduction devices to start conserving water and then we were able to get financing for solar installation and they did a solar installation with us so they were getting through that about half of their electricity from solar\nAnd they've done on a regular basis they've done education you know they've integrated is into their Bible studies they've taught about the biblical basis for it they've had a lot of members of the church taken ecological footprint quiz so that they start looking at it at the household level they've organized\nElectronic waste recycling events in the parking lot outside the church and collected I think three or four truckloads worth of waste that I mean it's just you know it it's taken off and and what's great about it for this church is they attract new members because of this I mean they you know they realize that you know it's smart for them to do this not only because it's the right thing but it's\nThere's a mission in it there's a tremendous spiritual energy in it and they get that and they do that\nI'm so they've been a wonderful place to work with and what you see over and over again as these places\nBursting through these barriers that day and and realizing that they can do it and then getting energized by that and it's just the it's the coolest thing in the world\nAnd there have been barriers for example Reverend Richard size it suddenly lost his position as the head of the national association of evangelicals after he advocated for evangelicals to address climate change as a moral responsibility\nBut you also see a certain number of very well respected mega church pastor is like Joel Hunter who have you know tens of thousands of people who are connected to his ministry and and he's been very clear very consistently about fighting climate change as a moral responsibility so you see\nThe beginnings of of high level leadership and the ... community starting to take this on you also see some resistance to that from the old guard more conservative", "show_name": "Bioneers", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "27", "locations": [["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795],

speaking truth to our experience and by seeking recognition and accountability\nWhere better to raise gender truth and reconciliation than in South Africa where it is estimated that a woman or girl is raped every twenty six seconds\nBricks and keeping learned what was often expected for boys and girls growing up in a township in South Africa as a boy your mother would fear you become a gangster as a girl your mother would fear you'd be raped at a very young age\nWilliam keeping recalls the story of one young man changed by hearing a woman in a workshop she had been raped and was working through her own trauma preparing to confront her attacker in court\nShe told her story and graphic detail which was very rare and none of the minute ever heard such a story\nAnd it took all they could do to stay in the room and one of the men who is one of our trainees and it pretty astute young men mid twenties was quite shaken as everyone was in a certain way and he said I\nI don't know how to be a man anymore he said I feel traumatized\nHis very identity as a man was being transformed\nAnd she was that his heart had been broken open and he was now carrying\nPart of the pain that this woman was carrying on her own and that women sense as a group carry all on their own in terms of that level of fear that women live in from the day they're born\nThat men don't live in in the same way and now he was carrying that with her and that was transforming is very identity as a man in South African culture there\nMen are socialized into that way of being with women and not even realizing that there's another way to be so there's a whole confusion of that sort of aggressive sexuality with being a man\nAnd that's why it's so transformative for them to actually hear the effects of that kind of sexuality but there's no foreign for that to happen so this work is radically transformative just by creating a forum where men can truly here women's pain and vice versa\nThan bricks and keeping found their forum suddenly getting much bigger\nWe were invited by the deputy minister of health who later became the deputy speaker of parliament in her vision was to have this work introduced to all members of parliament and so we worked with a group of about thirty many of them were workers in the parliament and then we had a few employees who were actually members of parliament\nIronically the week that it started the chief whip of the a and see was charged with sexual inappropriate behavior towards one of his interest and there was a huge crisis in parliament itself and several of the people who are supposed to be in a workshop drop out to fight the battle that was the emerging in parliament around the sexual violation for which he was eventually can\nWell I mean than men while the workshop what's going on the woman who had charged him with texting people in our\nWorkshop about what was going on and she was in hiding so it was quite a dramatic whole drama that was unfolding right as we were doing this work so it's kind of highlighted the importance of the word\nBut that was a watershed event for us because at the end of the ritual where the men ceremonies that women ended with an unbelievably beautiful declaration so this is the declaration\nOf the men to the women\nThe bonds of humanity have been broken we acknowledge that we have shared in the unfair and unjust advantage\nThat is upset the creators intended balance of human relationships for love companionship and cooperation we further acknowledged that we have been complicit in breaking the intended dream of equality\nSo now we come forward to say to you we're sorry we have from that we want to start a new and we asked will you accept our offer to take responsibility as we committed ourselves to live out\nAnd challenging support all men everywhere to live and work for gender equality and thereby seek reconciliation\nI mean the women were weeping they were stunned\nVery beautiful moment and coming at such a high level of political engagement these men were leaders in the country and a beautiful\nWilliam keeping and Cynthia bricks said with the greatest male privilege is not any of the social
