the ...\nAnd my dad or they're both violinist listen to you both\nAndrea what's it like being in the orchestra while your son is the solo as\nWell to be honest I think I'd rather be sitting out in the audience it's difficult because um when you're in the audience you know you have parental janitors and nerves on but when you're on stage and you're actually functioning and trying to play or violent you're trying to concentrate on what drew is doing but at the same time not dropping my bell jar\nYeah exactly drew growing up with such amazing musical parents I'm guessing there must have been a tiny bit of pressure to achieve\nYeah that's a question that a lot of people ask me I'm actually it wasn't as bad as you you would think they obviously [laughter]\nWhen I was really little they obviously like hammered in practice practice practice and I was like you know right [laughter] and it was it was hard at first and slowly slowly year after year I came to do it myself and have the drive myself but what really I think\n\n\nThey should leave\n\nNation would have been to leading and witty performance thank you so heavy on the edge of my seat and I was just trying not to crack up all those beautiful sort of moments that you that you gave us just now you're such a talented musician but you don't come from a musical family tell us about your folks\nUm my dad's a doctor of computer science\nAnd so he's very oriented towards math and science and my mom stays at home than me and my brother and honestly I think she has one of the hardest jobs in the world and it's even harder or because she has to travel with me wherever I perform because I'm a minor\nSo she's she's ... she's got her full time job just keeping up with you and you've got really quite a quite a career going I don't know what is your brother do I know he played for a while but now he's in a rather competitive endeavor\nHe's very smart guy ... amazing that academics and everything and as a hobby he speed skates and he's quite good at it [noise]\nExcellent so your brother's a speed skater but you yourself I I hear what you tell me you're not very athletic tell everybody has to read about what happened on the first day of pie in seventh grade\nSo I Walk into the gym or starting off by doing some warm up exercises specifically this one was a tiny running exercise and I somehow manage to smash me\nKeep in mind this was one week before a huge competition that it was taking part in that he can and I think as you can imagine I ... I was terrified\nAnd at\nHome I ice made them and I practiced away from the piano by looking at the music and studying it\nIt's kind of like looking at a textbook memorizing the information and I think it was a great learning experience because I was able to develop a new way of practicing and the competition turned out great so\nMalls or will ... will I mean gosh take care of those is my man I Love them tested we wish you all the best of luck thank you thank you so much\n[noise] big\n[noise]\nOur audience today is made up of junior high and high school students from all around the buffalo area one of the schools were welcoming is from east Aurora and it just so happens that our next teenage performer is from that town please welcome Seventeen year old violinist Christoph ...

Joanne you've been a champion of new music and new composers and we're going to continue that tradition now or would you introduce the teenage composer whose music we're going to hear next\nYes we're delighted to welcome to buffalo Ethan try him in for the buffalo premier of his piece welcome\nEthan or we're going to hear a short piece of yours called Saturn's rings tell everybody about the workers ration you came up with in order to evoke that image\nLarge part of my thinking in this piece was trying to trace sound physically throughout the orchestras pitches are passed around in a way that sort of mimic the orbiting of Saturn's rings around the planet\nThe other thing I was thinking was trying to make each part really comfortable for the player who's playing and I'm In the program back in Los Angeles that I'm In the Los Angeles philharmonic composers fellowship program\nProfessional musicians from the Los Angeles philharmonic come and speak to us about their instruments\nWe should stay away from that composers things that make their life needlessly difficult or things that a function really naturally on their instruments so that's something I tried to think about\nGreat knowledge to catch up on Joanne anything to add about even these\nJust that we're delighted to add another new piece to our repertoire Ethan and we hope to see more of you in playing other pieces as well\nThis is a beautifully concentrated miniature speech which gives us a spin so to speak is Saturn's rings by eastern climate\n\n\n\n\nOoh [noise]\n[noise]\n\nMm\n[noise] buffalo\n[noise]\nBravo beef and I understand this one of your first or casualties isn't it just sounds so masterful in the way you command and various different colors of the orchestra and I could hear that\nIntense sort of sending around in in terms of Saturn's rings the sounds the notes from one section of the orchestra studio they're really quite a brilliant concept of in the great tradition of composers just starting out\nI Know you started playing piano initially your first couple of pieces were in the style of famous composer so who were you emulating\nWhen I first started writing my own compositions I was playing a lot of uh WC and Gershwin\n'em and sort of by happenstance but actually just because\nI was accidentally plagiarize in my competitions would incorporate um elements of their work um until\nWeeks after writing and I listen to a piece that I wrote and go oh that's directly from you know this piece or that these and sort of", "show_name": "From the Top", "year": "2018", "city":

special from the top today we're going to visit one of the great competitions were teenage classical musicians in the U.S the stole bird international string competition\nYou've heard plenty of ... medalists on from the top over the years because as we search the country for talented young string players were drawn to this competition and the incredibly gifted batch violinist violist cellist and bassist who show up every year in Kalamazoo the home of the stole Burke\nI sat down for a brief conversation was Margaret Hamilton the executive director of the competition after the semi final round to help set the scene Margaret telling me briefly\nViolinist and teacher yes\nYou are so right it's an author of Julius stole Burke who was a long time resident of Kalamazoo\nMusic faculty member here at western Michigan University School of music directed the Kalamazoo junior since any for decades and died unexpectedly or too soon in Nineteen Seventy four\nAnd it was his family and friends and community members who literally gathered around Esther Spellberg kitchen table saying how do we commemorate the life of this man [noise] so they came up with the notion of a competition and\nThey hoped at that point in time that it might last for five years but Julius had extraordinary ties to the greater string community at of course his work with strings students he was the violin professor at was legendary here so we're just so lucky that that legend lived on much beyond five years\nIt's just an amazing thing so described the process to me ... you know how many kids apply every year\nThis year we had an all time record broken we received over two hundred applications so each year it's been growing and I believe that there are a number of reasons word of mouth happy contestants happy parents extraordinary performances that come out of this\nPlus the support of audiences here and the Kalamazoo community\nA young person will apply anywhere between the middle of October to our February first deadline and then those applications go through two rounds of screening here in Kalamazoo it's an anonymous process\nSo if we take this year's numbers as an example those two hundred applicants were whittled down to the twelve semi finalists that we heard today how is\nThat even possible I mean you know just you know the proof is in the ... of course the ... that I heard today we're more artist than competitors I think uh so what does that process like or do you have a a hair splitting moments you know getting them down from two hundred or is it really obvious I mean the the level must be astronomical at\nThis I think the level is astronomical and I'm always grateful that I Am not the person making those decisions are screeners who do remain anonymous they are well versed in the literature and the profession or in what the field is like\nA there are multiple screeners at each level they listen very carefully they proceed with great integrity that is you can imagine there are some really tough calls said at the end\nAnd what is a ... when a kid's apply until how old can they be uh our rules\nSo the kids you work with are very much eligible to appear on from the time as a matter of fact this year there's a large overlap yes\nThere is a huge overlap and I think that's what brought us together and we've noticed that overlap over the years that alumni out from the top also ended up being alumni of the stall bird it's a wonderful connection and of course the missions are so similar\nTo what we've had a wonderful or you've had a wonderful legacy on from the top with all the kids we always send to shut up to the store bird for for your support and the knowledge of this great great talent so thanks for talking with me and best of luck
