[noise]\nThe Nobel Prizes were awarded this week and for the second time and only three years a Canadian physicist has been awarded a share of the prize\nDr Donna Strickland was honored for her work to quote the Nobel Committee for the generation of high intensity ultra short optical pulses\nThe technique she and Gerard mood developed to create super concentrated bursts of laser light has proved enormously important for everything from laser eye surgery to industrial laser cutting it's also proved to be a useful tool in scientific research which is the work that she continues to pursue today\nDr Strickland is in the department of physics and astronomy at the University of Waterloo Dr Strickland congratulations on the prize and welcome to court some quirks thank you very much now you've had a little time for the news to settle into how are you feeling at this point\nUh it's still overwhelming and I'm Still sort of tired from it [laughter]\nWell I understand or when you got the call from Stockholm you actually hung up on them\nWhile they asked me that they said it was a very important call in that I should stay on the line but I stayed on the line for full Fifteen minutes and then thought either this is the cruelest prank or something was wrong so I I hung up and then I got on my email and they there was a message to call back [laughter]\nYour prize winning weren't ... to your ph D research um so how did you become interested in laser research in the first place\nI'd just as a high school students McMaster University had an engineering physics program\nAnd I thought that was sort of I couldn't decide between physics and engineering so I thought that walk the line for me and inside that they had a program for lasers in electronics and I just thought that was really sounded says so cruel so much fun I thought that would be something to do\nI I can tell you that what my mother would say he's no longer life that she when she was she would say that I I was taken to the Ontario science center at the young child\nAnd my dad was electrical engineer there was a laser there at the time and he's he's supposedly set to me but I don't remember this Donna lasers are the way the future you want to see this\nThe sorting hat in the enormously popular Harry Potter books and movies was a remarkable magical device you could look into the minds of students and determine their strengths and characters and we're up their magical schools they might thrive\nThat probably wasn't the inspiration for our next guest research but there are some interesting similarities doctor a ruined the money has developed a new technology to evaluate the skills of aspiring surgical residents he does it using a kind of ...\nAnd it does look into the brains are those wearing it but it's not magical it's a high too\nThis it seems to be the best way to test whether surgeons in training or good enough to be let loose on the patient population at large Dr no money develop this idea for his PHD and biomedical engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Hi welcome to court some quirks\nThank you very much thanks for having me\nHow or surgeons generally tested now\nBasically there's a set of training tasks that are let's say residents in the journal general surgery population would have to complete in order to become board certified\nAnd what we found is that there may be a lot of novices and experts that unfortunately share similar scores but may not have actually\nDevelop the motor skills required a to translate that into the operating room\n... so it was the old technique that a an expert would just watch a novice and say hey I'm ... and and give them a score\nA that's right you know there's a human ... subjectivity that's incorporated into these metrics\nSo why did you think that using brain imaging would improve this current system of testing\nSurgical skills are just like any motor skills really requires consistent practice and consolidation of these motor skills in your cortex\nIf you have that competency uh for fine motor skills you're going to have very specific activation in the brain that correlate to that fine motor skills activity [noise]\nSo how do you measure brain activity\nWe measure brain activity or using a technique called functional near infrared spectroscopy\nWhat we're doing is essentially tuning a very specific laser to shine infrared light into the brain and depending on how that light scatter as we're able to detect a lot of different interesting metrics or such as hemoglobin concentration\nAs a indirect way to measure brain activity a and the cool thing about this approach is it's real time non invasive and it's relatively easy to conduct especially in a conducive environment or such as a training environment for surgeons\nWait a minute you're ... you're saying it's noninvasive but you're shining laser light into the brain\nYou're you're absolutely right um it's it's just as a invasive is shining a flashlight on somebody's scout\n... what what does the person to have on their head\nReally uh it's just stay an elastic cap and that cat has just to set a probes that we're shining very tiny bits of infrared light a directly\nThe laser light into their brain measuring their brain activity what did you see in your experiment\nWe saw that there's three specific regions that are highly correlated to motor skills and they have very different activation between an expert at a novice these three regions are the primary motor cortex uh the supplementary motor area and the ... cortex\nExperts for example have very high activation in the primary motor cortex as opposed to novices who have very high activation within the frontal cortex\nAnd these are important indicators of not just motor skills are but also expertise and so we use these regions and were able to differentiate whether they fall into the novice category or the expert category\nWill will take me through that why would there be a different center motor the motor cortex obviously is what we used a controller hands correct yep that is correct All right so what's going on in the prefrontal cortex\nSo the prefrontal cortex it's basically the region where you utilized to actually think about the procedure or that you're performing for the first time\nSo I'll give you an example let's say you're driving and you're learning how to drive and your lane changing on a highway you're heavily utilizing your prefrontal cortex during the initial stages of learning that\nAnd as you've been driving for years or even decades it becomes an automatic process you're no longer actively determining or thinking every processed and every step of lane changing onto highway becomes automatic\nAnd that's where you no longer start to see activation in the prefrontal cortex but instead in the motor cortex the primary motor cortex\nAll I see a whereas the the old pros they're just doing it automatically they're doing it automatically you're absolutely right so now that you've seen this difference in the brain activity between the novice and the experts surgeon how does your test compared to the current method of testing surgeons\nWhat we found is that if we use the consistent and it already existing metrics there's roughly a forty percent chance that that resident as actually fall asleep you know past or has been classified as an expert\nAnd so with our approach if we say let's take a look at what's happening in the brain with an accuracy of Ninety five Ninety six percent will be able to tell you whether you have actually mastered that motor skills\nWow that's amazing so even though somebody might look good on the surgical table you say well I can see in your brain you're not really as good as you say\nTo exactly right and that's why\nSays seeing surgical skill competency uh and the big thing is that we want to make sure we always ate surgeons in their training and how they're performing these procedures 'em and you know we really think this is the way forward\nWhat to surgeons think about being tested by machine rather than another surgeon\nWell as expected you know if we've got some embezzling feelings a lot of them are on board you know we have had depositions come up to us saying that this is fantastic we think that this is going to be very important for assessing training competency\nI'm at the flipside we've also had many surgeons that are incredibly skeptical and they say you know what how dare you say that you know a machine can tell me a if I'm Better or not\nThat well how could this technique can be used in other fields of surgery\nI think the biggest impact is right now we've shown that this is a clear case for a training\nI think one of the area that you know this may impact is basically measure motor skills competency near the latter years of a surgeon or are there objective metrics that we can determine for retirement\nSo I I really think this will be an a solid approach to be able to objectively determine motor skills drop off a centrally\nSucked into money thank you very much for your time\nThank you very much Bob thanks for having a\nDoctor a ruined the money is a neural and data scientist his research was published in the journal science advances [noise]\nThis morning all be just hearing well ... ... close to swimming including this one where the shark attack occurred as officials trying to figure out just what kind of shark it was that young man's life\nIt's remarkably rare but every once in awhile the jaws nightmare comes true last month a paddle border was attacked by what is thought to be in a great white shark in the waters off Cape Cod Massachusetts [noise]\nUnfortunately he died of his injuries another well publicized attack occurred just a few weeks before that [noise]\nThat white sharks don't normally feed on humans very rarely they will bite us defensively or after mistaking a human for prey like a seal or possibly even just out of curiosity still those attacks are a huge cause for concern among surf\nWater when potentially dangerous sharks are around the problem is how do you know sharks are stealthy and off and all we have to rely on for warning is the sharp pie of a lifeguard watching for the un and the water\nWell Dr Kevin ... thinks she might have a better way rather than trying to spot a whole shark he's testing for miniscule traces of shark in the water\nDr ... marine biologist with the United States Geological survey at the University of California Santa Barbara Dr laughing to welcome to courts in courts thanks very much Bob\nFirst of all how surprising were these recent shark attacks on the east coast to you\nWell we have been seeing 'em increased supports the white sharks certainly where I live in California and other places around the world and and in part due to restrictions on fishing but also do the increases in their natural pray populations the seals and sea lions that the large adults feed on\nAnd so we do get a tax they happen infrequently and in fact your risk of being attacked by a shark in the ocean is really really low um what surprised me most frankly was that it was a fatal attack because most white shark attacks are not fatal\n[noise] so how then or are you planning to look for traces of sharks in the water\nThat we're receiving from the store and that's what happens when the planet passes if there's a moon there we expect the moon of course to to block out a little bit of light as well\nSo we initially solve this a signal when the Kepler data it looked tantalizing but it was not really enough to claim a discovery so we ultimately are asked for time on the Hubble Space telescope to follow this up\nObserve it again and see if we could confirm it when we get a we had that observation in October twenty Seventeen and we've been working on it since then the Hubble observation uh really is is sort of convincing that like I say we're stopping a little shorter claiming into discovery here but we see basically two lines of evidence\nThat suggests that the moon is a good explanation for what we're seeing we see gravitational a perturbations to gravitational hugging on this planet that makes the timing of the planets transits\nMove around a little bit of time sometimes it comes in early sometimes it comes in late or that's what we would expect the moon to do and then the other thing that we see in the Hubble observation is this little dip in the brightness we see the planet transit and then we see a secondary little ... right now where we're attributing to the moon\nWhat will it take to prove that it really is a moon going around another planet around another star\nWell if we could observe this object again when it comes around again in may twenty Nineteen we're hoping to use the Hubble Space telescope for that we've asked for the time we don't yet know if we're going to be awarded bedtime [noise]\nAh we've got this time around a pretty clean prediction for what we ought to expect when we make that observation and so if the moon holds up to that production\nI think we'd be a pretty convinced um but you know ... we have to see this target to this uh event that we're looking at the the planet itself takes Nineteen hours to pass in front of the star\nSo that's a lot of time and if you think about it the earth is rotating so you can't observe this event with any single telescope on the surface of the year\nWould be to stitch together data from multiple instruments and that would be quite challenging so going to space is really what you want to do and there's only really two telescopes that I can think of that or a remotely capable for forming an observation like this the Spitzer Telescope but really a Hubble is is the best game in town\nIf it is proven to be a moon do you get to name it\n[laughter] uh I don't think so I'm afraid of the planet of course already has it has a name kept or sixteen twenty five be the historical convention for naming moons around planets has been to give them a Roman numerals\nSo uh we've taken to a to saying this would be Kepler sixteen twenty five be one\nThat come out you could come up with a better name for that so I don't ... yeah well ...\nAround the office we call it the ... moon [laughter] that businesses okay never moon yeah which is kind of a silly name but I don't think that one that will fly ultimately\nThis is teaching thank you very much\nThank you very much for having

Johnson on thirty eight years old or just about thirty eight and I got diagnosed as being on TALK of the spectrum I thought five years ago\nKelly Johnson lives in Montreal she's a mother with a couple of other jobs to keep her busy as well she's been diagnosed with autism but you can certainly tell she's what some people call high functioning\nThat's not unusual for people with autism they're often enormously productive incapable what is unusual about Kelly Johnson is that she's a woman and she's been diagnosed\nIncreasingly autism researchers are coming to realize that there may be a vast population of women with autism\nWho's disorder hasn't been recognized\nWe'll get into the wine later it may have much to do with autism being perceived as a male disorder ms Johnson wasn't diagnosed with autism\nI Would have panic attacks and what I didn't know was that my anxiety and panic attacks were actually being caused by sensory overload\nUm I didn't realize that I was going into like a note download or having sensory issues and that could be you know I I wasn't very good at regulating I still am to look good at regulating but St ... temperature being aware on getting too hot\nLighting can be very um I guess oppressive is the best way to put it a a lot of noise things like that so I was having symptoms but not knowing what was wrong\nBefore her diagnosis miss Jones who did see various kinds of help she had therapy it didn't work she suffered in confusion and distress\nI just figured it must have been just me because nobody else was having a problem so I figured well I'm Broken there's something wrong with me I couldn't understand why it was so difficult for me I just figured well I'm just beyond a help I'm just I'm Broken\nThe confusion deemed to it in things to someone else's diagnosis\nI sought out diagnosis when they sell 'em after my son was like no I just saw too many similarities in the way that we both kind of behaved um I found that I almost in the we understood hands and what he was going through\nIn ways that don't you know the cat quite be explained by maternal instinct\nThe diagnosis of autism has been life altering for miss Johnson partly because now she's getting the right kind of help\nBut mostly because she now knows who she is\nIt was a relief and absolute relief you know I stopped blaming myself having that self understanding has liberated me because I think a lot of a lot of my my problem was is that I spent a lot of time trying to make my health normal\nAh and realizing now that I can cut myself some slack but I I actually I don't have to do it the same way that other people do\nI feel like I'm living fear I stopped seeing myself is broken it's now I can just see myself as different and understand that that that's OK and have kind of a of pride in that so yes I Do have struggled but I Do have strength because of my brain and that's something I also try to share with my son\nCan be drawn to this one of the lucky ones one of the women whose autism has been recognized but according to Dr Francesca happy a leading autism\nWith autism who's condition is undiagnosed their social deficits struggles with sensory information and behavioral problems\nAre all too frequently mistaken for other modalities or simply ignored a doctor happy thinks it's time we started paying much more attention to this problem doctor happy as a professor of neuroscience at King's College London in England Hi welcome to courts in courts thank you very much\nThough autism is a spectrum disorder or some people are affected more than others so when we talk about women was diagnosed autism what kind of autism are we talking about\nThey typically would be those who have good intellectual functioning for example and they've managed to Moscow camouflage some of that or to them difficulties in different states at least when they're in public well\nWhen did the autism research communities start to suspect that there was a large group of undiagnosed women\nI think the key piece of evidence is that we've been operating with estimate\nOf the male to female ratio being maybe a full five to one and that that high a intellectual ability end of the spectrum maybe ten miles every one female and that being the kind of estimate in the late ...\nBut I'm very recent a review that looked at all of the epidemiological ... up to date\nConcludes that the ratio is probably three to one\nSo that in ... in the estimates so we were using and the accurate uh say good from really good epidemiological studies gives us this stock conclusion that there are thousands of women and girls who are going on diagnosed or misdiagnosed mistreated\nWill take me through this more recent research how did you get a handle on what the real numbers between men and women were\nSo this is that we're such ... headed up by ... and her colleagues and they looked at all of the studies in the ... that have reported the male female ratio\nAnd what they did was look in the different kinds of studies so some of those studies will have um looked at individuals known to clinical educational special services because they already have a diagnosis\nAnd in those cases we get those high on male to female ratios of maybe four or five to one but that other studies that have taken a much more rigorous approach that epidemiologic studies that have gone out into the population they've screened everybody for autistic traits and they've ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Quirks and Quarks", "city": "Billings", "day": "09", "locations":

Shannon at all and he had a a with it all a very badly injured leg was probably blind in one night and probably ... death\nAnd and really we can't imagine hand being able to make much of a contribution to exclude but he was attacked for about ten to Fifteen Years but when I say that you know broken legs or other breaks I quite common as a kind of other kind of inflammatory problems\nAnd so it was funny comments to say that in the hands of time I have you know more than one even to like say sequences of sort of severe injuries during their lifetime\nWhat then does that tell you about what's happening in the ice shelf\nWill just tells us in the case of the melting event there's been a permanent alteration of the near surface snow structure above the ice shelf and the the snow is very important because it just sort of a blanket that protects the deep arise from the atmosphere [noise]\nSo it's very important to know when melting is occurring and what steps it's occurring and analyzing the seismic waves you can get an idea of how the ice a profile if you will and snow profile has changed a due to an event like for me\nWhat we're hearing a lot about the ice shelves in Antarctica breaking up or do you are are you able to use this to sound from the wind\nIt'll be a useful tool and monitoring the changes that may occur in the near surface of the Ross and and other ice shelves we do know that ah\nThese enormous floating glacial masses can actually come apart rather quickly from observations of collapsing ice shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula where it's quite a bit warmer and in those cases a key factor was the uh initiation and propagation of surface melt near the top of the show\nWill take me through that what happens\nWell one mechanism that we believe is important as if you actually get to the point where you start to foreign pools of liquid water they congregate into ponds and these pawn sort of fracture they're way down through the ice and contribute to breaking it up it would be a\nA probably valuable to monitor the propagation of cracks across ice shelves as well with seismic graphs\nAnd when we think about Antarctica I I think we usually think about the huge glacier that covers the continent but yet these these ice shelves center around the outside that's floating ice how important are they in in monitoring what's happening to the ice at the south pole\nThe ice shelves in Antarctica play a critical role in helping to restrain the glaciers are in the interior of Antarctic are flowing more rapidly into the ocean and the Ross ice shelf is the largest of them all so it's extremely important component of the Antarctic ice shelf system\n[noise] what's your next step\nWell we hope to put some more instruments are like this out on ice shelves and a further study the process now that we've learned a lot about the basics of the signal and what we can do with it\nAnd it it's my hope that eventually will be able to use them to ah understand a directly what's happening to the snow column or in enough detail but we won't have to dig still pits and use other invasive techniques we can we can monitor important features of the snow and ice just by listening\nDr ... thank you very much for your time\nMy pleasure thank you\nDr Rick ... is a professor of geophysics at Colorado State university [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSo your body but ah there's nothing like cooking a big one apart from the thrills there might be the promise of a dinner of the freshest fish you could imagine [noise]\nOf course lots of conservation minded anglers these days wouldn't think of actually keeping the fish they catch they carefully unhook their prize and return it to the water in the hopes that it will survive thrive and maybe provide the same phone again in the future\nBut there may be a catch to catch and release new research by a young marine biology student at the University of Alberta suggests that hook injuries could be helping the ability of released fish to feed [noise]\nMost uh Thompson has been an avid angler herself and she was two and did the research while taking a marine biology course at the battlefield marine science center on Vancouver Island this Thompson welcome to courts in courts hello Hi so what kind of effect did you discover the catch and release fishing can have on the fish themselves well\nWhat I discovered was when they're hooked correctly in the side of their mouth it can decrease the suction performance of fish so when they go to catch the food and they suck it into their mouth when you finish them and when you here's a whole and cause an injury inside their mouth\nTaken a decrease their feeding performance wow well how did you figure this out well I caught\nTen little tiny shiny perch around forty grams and I also each scene so I took a big way to net and I grabbed him all of the weather and Ayelet which is across from ban field and I basically compared how they've captured food with a high speed camera\nWill take me through that how does a fish capture food for section feeding fish they open their mouth and they increase the volume and basically the back of their throat by doing that it causes all the water in front of the fish to rush into the mouth and any food or shrimp or tiny fish in front of the\nIn front of the fishes mouth get sucked into the mouth\nSo they literally just sort of feeling like yeah there was that\nYeah [noise] so what then was the difference that you saw between fish that have been caught with a hook and those that were not\nSo fish that were caught with a hook actually had a slower velocity intake so it took a longer time for the piece of food to actually get in their mouth than the ones that we caught that didn't have injuries around their mouth was causing that\nHave you ever been to like got us larvae or McDonald's and you accidentally bent the straw too far and called little hole and then it was really hard to it's like a ... the soda it's basically the same principle of that so\nAll through the side so it just decreases the amount of water that comes from the front of the mouth so it it just doesn't go as fast into the mouth I guess\nI see the the whole in the ... the Russian isn't as strong as of yet you know the whole is made by the hook some fisherman was saying well we use bar blues works the ... don't have the little piece on the very tip that keeps the hook in the most of the focus move all the way around does that make a difference\nSo if you hook a fish optimally in like in the side of the mouse where you where you want it and says like down deep and like the the ... in the gills you're still going to cause a hole through the ... of the hook through the membrane but ah barbed jokes do a lot more damage than ...\n[laughter] so what does it mean for the fish if it's got this whole side of his mouth and it can bring in as much water and feed is more has officially\nI Believe that the fish will feed less and suction feeding fishes need to be very precise\nWith when they open their mouth and how fast they do it so they need to be very precise because you can only bring in a certain amount of water so if they have less of a suction then they're not going to be able to get those really fast freight types like little shrimp through a little fish there have a higher chance of escaping it'll lead to them catching less pray\nWhile in your experiment how much less efficient where the fish with the holes in the side of their mouths at feeding\nSo the difference between the injured and the ah an injured fish with about a hundred centimeters a second\nSo the uninsured fish had two hundred and fifty thousand meters a second and the injured fish only during the pizza to where I'm at a hundred and fifty centimeters the second so it's a hundred centimeters second difference\nWhich has substantial does the speed of the water going in their mouth that was the speed of the actual food item that I use which is a little three millimeter Cuba to worm\nAnd that's how fast they drew and into their mouth I also did notice that the injured fish were less willing to feed than the uninsured which was very interesting\n... well it's hard when you have a sore most yeah that's true [laughter] so then does the injury from the hook fully explained or reduced ability to feed\nFrom um computational data model that another person made on the same paper that I worked on no the whole by itself doesn't explain a hundred percent the observed things that I found in my study so what explains the rest of it I Believe it's stress\nThe unwillingness to feed because of the ...\nNews and the fish being caught and then released again\nA very big factor when you angle of fish you're bringing it in on the broad so you're fighting against it so you're exhausting to fish before it comes in you're taking it out of the water suffocating it when you were holding it out and taking the hook out and then you're releasing it back\nSo if the fish is above the surface water for thirty seconds the stress hormones and its blood don't go down at for two hours after\nSo it has a very large effect on the um the stress hormones and then other research shows that it's less likely to breed it's less likely to if it has a\nLike a brood patch or a bunch of eggs that it's protecting and it's more likely to abandon them it's less likely to feed and um it's also at a higher chance of getting preyed upon so it has a bunch of factors to the fish is survival just like catch and release alone\nSo what effect would it have on mortality rates in the fish two thirds\nOf fish actually survive from catch and release ones that are just die outright or a delayed mortality so like they get an injury and it just gets infected and then they die\nIt's adapted to massive climate change to planet killing asteroid impacts two tectonic shifts where the very ground has changed as continents are remade\nWell now life is adapting to what might be the tricky a set of new conditions of all\nWe built giant sprawling city's a brick glass and concrete Kenyans made a great buildings in a men's deserts of at fault\nBut evolution is not to be denied as we've made this new urban landscape natural life is found a way to colonize and adapt to it a few examples urban songbirds have changed their color their sound even their mating habits in order to survive\nFox's have adapted to living in the busiest cities in the world\nAnd plants have developed new types of seeds that allow for growth in cracks in city sidewalks those are just some of the examples Dr mental skill housing illustrates in his new book Darwin comes to town how the urban jungle drives evolution\nDr skilled housing is an evolutionary biologist ecologist and professor about diversity and lightened University in the Netherlands hello welcome to the courts in courts\nHello book thank you very much for having me\nWell first of all what fascinates you about this question of life adapting to our urban environments\nWell a couple of things to begin with it's very rapid evolution we've we're we're really observing species adapting almost as we speak much faster than than we tend to think evolution takes place and that's because\nCities are so different from natural environment that it creates a situation that requires ferry drastic adaptation that usually means very fast and ...\nBut also because cities are really expanding rapidly on the earth and it's really becoming a habitat in its own rights really becoming part of the earth's surface that is there for species to colonize it can be ignored anymore so I think\nIn the in the near future we're going to see a lot of wildlife being forced to adapt\nThe species that managed to survive in cities things to Darwinian adaptation\nWell it it is remarkable in your book how many species have adapted because we tend to think of cities as kind of a sterile environment where we clean away anything that's living you know there's something growing we cut it off or ... how have city has become so rich and by the diversity\nWell it's a number of things first of all not all species can live in cities there are lots of species that really need pristine natural habitats and they cannot survive in city so a lot of species do disappear when a city\nOr arises in a place but also a lot of species managed to survive and there's several reasons how they could do that for some are simply\nWe call that pre adapted they find something in the city that resembles their natural habitats think of rock pigeons for example the city pigeons are originally rock pigeons they they live in very very rocky cliff ... environments and to them our city with with its buildings is not that different from their natural a rookie environment\nBut also cities are actually quite diverse if you compare them to the rural countryside nowadays especially in North America and Europe where almost every maximum productivity squeezed out of every inch of land there's not much natural habitat left in the countryside for species to stir fry where whereas cities are full of\nInteresting little pockets of vegetation a gardens I mean the the cities are consist of thousands and thousands of backyard which are all different and especially for blondes and insects that creates a lot of diversity of habitat that they can live in\nAnd then of course you have the real evolution of species that are invading city and adapt as they invade and evolve new ...\nWell you say in your book that cities are like mad scientist creating their own ecological concoction\n[noise] what do you mean by the ...\nYeah that's another thing that of course we we humans\nBring in a lot of species I mean some species come into the city under their own steam but but some are brought in by us of course our gardens are planted full of species that come from all corners of the globe\nPets and ... and ... are introduced accidentally or unintentionally by people and cities are really a melting pot of species from all over the world which are forced to find a way to live together and and so a a blonde from South America can suddenly meat\nOr an insect from from Europe in in a in a city in China and find out that that the insects\nMet before that haven't evolved to deal with these species so too but to to use those opportunities they must adept than they do that well\nYou mentioned how cities create their own sort of micro ... little ecosystems of their own such as ah the parks in New York City were mice and they're doing quite well and and the parks are all different tell me about that\nYeah one of the things about cities is that there is a little fragmentation going on so in in natural environments will scores you can find vast forests that are sort of uninterrupted over large area\nIn cities these bits of vegetation and very much fragmented so New York city is a good example where of course four hundred years ago there was a continuous forest covering Manhattan and the five boroughs\nAnd of that forests all that has left now our our city parks likes like Central Park and Prospect Park does our bits of origin of vegetation and they're still bits of original phone that survive isolated from each other in these are ruined in these pockets of of forest in the city\nAnd the white footed mouse is one of the native\nRodents that live in in the east coast us that are surviving if that means surviving in these isolated bits of forest\nAnts in ... to ... living in the countryside these mice in New York City are adapting to their individual parks that they live in\nSo that their genes are actually changing to suit the conditions in those specific parks for example in Central Park demise have evolved genes that help them deal with a very fatty diet which\nOf course has to do with all the junk food that people leave behind in the park and that these mice eat in another park there's a gene that has changed their immune system probably because there was some some epidemic possibly brought in by by humans or other animals that has spread in that park and has has made this population of mice resistant to that particular\nDisease so every pockets of habitat in the city has its own signature it has its own little little a Darwinian landscape that species adapt to\nWell you have so many examples of plants and animals making genetic adaptations for urban life in your book it's ah we can't go through them all do you have any favorites\nWould I really like is an example from Europe that the the European black birds\nWas one of the first birds to invade cities already in the early Nineteen century in Germany and in Rome and from then on they'd have become more and more urban even though the forest like birds still still survive they still exist and it turns out that those urban like birds and the forest like birds overdose two hundred years have become more and more\nOf differences in the way they look for example they have\nShorter ... in the city and the shorter intestines also the way they sing they sing at higher pitch which probably has to do with the urban noise from traffic the also seeing during the night which the forest like bird doesn't do\nIn the urban situation they don't migrate anymore they stay in the city the whole year round because there's always food available whereas the forest like birds they migrate away during the winter to the south\nTo the extent that these urban and tourists blackbirds are not really into reading any more than a mixing with each other which for example has to do with the fact that migration is different as I mentioned so by the time\nThe forest like birds come back from their winter quarters to urban like birds have already started breeding because they're yeah there's it's warmer in the city because of these so called urban heat island\nAnd there's food to year round so it can start breeding in March already whereas the forest like birds only start in may so there's no genes being exchanged anymore because between the forest and the urban like bird\nSo this is really a bird that's on the way of becoming a separate species\nSo you're seeing the same thing in these black birds with their different beaks and all that between the urban in the rural that Darwin saw with finches and the Galapagos Islands exactly now there was another bird that has adapted to city life by using cars to crack nuts healthy felt that\n[noise] yeah that's right those are carrying the crows in Japan\nOr they have for a long time have been using the Japanese walnuts as foods and they've been dropping those from from a great high there picks them up from the tree and then they fly\nTo send me to sign that dropped them on the rock and then the ... and they can eat the inside then cities became available and this continued doing that but then dropping to the the walnuts onto ... onto onto the streets to correct them and at one point in in the Nineteen seventies it was discovered\nThat in the city of Sendai in northern Japan a there was in a population of carrion crows that wins one step further and they started dropping these knots in front of the wheels of passing cars\nOr which was much easier to correct them of course they didn't need to fly high up and drop to not repeatedly to until it broke into just place it in front\nOf the wheels of a bussing car and even stationed themselves at but Estrin crossing so when the car stopped that would help into the streets drop a few of those knots in front of the cars and when the lights turned in the car started moving they would", "show_name": "Quirks and Quarks", "year":

because even veteran bird watchers might not be aware of where actually the sound is pretty because you can often see birds moving their beaks or um heads wild well vocalizing but that actually isn't wears down it's coming from\nWhere where is it coming from what's the Oregon so\nIt is I'm actually if you think of our wind pipe going deep into our chest and then branching to go to the lungs the bird vocal Oregon is right where or when the windpipe branches to go ... towards the lungs but it's not just the two blanketed than us it has all these new structures and it\nWill take me through that how does this hearings actually make sound\nWell the statistics of the sound of dump production or not that the similar in that you do have like a flexible or floppy vocal foods that are going to be located in the new place and there's a whole bunch of muscles that are around the structures so you know we know from like\nBirds that have simpler searing says maybe only have two muscles that are are kind of stabilizing the earrings and\nKind of influencing sound production but in things like songbirds you can have a ton of muscles so these are very complex structures and the muscles themselves are among the fastest ever described in a in an animal\nSo how unusual is the structure of the shootings in the animal kingdom\nWell it's kind of crazy unusual I mean if we think about it like there's lots of different kind of\nOur group vertebrate that makes down there are our code\nThat produce down in uh larynx we produce down in ... whales do as well um so you can think of all these disparate kinds of animals that all use the length based on sort [noise]\nSo what's really bizarre to saying why within dinosaurs did this completely new structure that's not really ... if not derived from a wearing it appears to be a new combination of structures and and developmental programs that are implemented deep in the chest\nTo make something that can also produce down and it um yeah it's kind of bizarre\nWell you mentioned going back to the dinosaurs was what's the connection there\nBirds are kind of dinosaur where with in that group we had all these other things that are are mostly extinct today that are not birds that are things like\nState as thorough and I'm over raptor and velociraptor and T rex right those are all dinosaurs along with birds\nSo we know that the structure of the change would have arisen some time with in the branching of all of the other dinosaurs and what we've been trying to figure out is what might have led to that change and when that change might have occurred\nOregon to make sound so does that mean that does this horse had Larry ... and and like this this came along as a new evolutionary experiment\nWell that's what this new paper is really about um [noise]\nThere are two potential scenarios that occurred within dinosaur yeah most likely dinosaurs it could have happened slightly earlier in that lineage where terrorists George branch off but we think it occurred within dinosaur ya\nAnd the two scenarios or that you have a ... face down or that is in its normal position like we see in the closest relatives to to this group ... billion they produce a variety of noise is using their larynx\nAnd you have ... based on trust it's fully functional it gets lost for some reason and in New Oregon developed that would involve presumably a quiet period where at least vocal sound production would not be occurring\nThe second scenario is that you have co president of two vocal Oregon in radically different places in a radically different origins and this is a kind of biological novelty that is actually pretty rare in the history of life where you have\nWhat they're inside are made of and how squishy they are and they are the densest thing this side of a black holes event horizon so all four forces need to be put together to understand them and we don't have a unified theory of physics yet and I think\nIn a way neutron stars might be the the observation of key to linking these not now but maybe sometime in the future [noise]\nSubject capital thank you very much for your time it was a pleasure to be here thank you for having to Bob\nDr Matthew Kaplan is an astrophysicist at McGill University is research was published in physical review letters [noise]\n\n\n\n\nOf the paradoxes of life in the ocean is that the biggest predators eat the tiniest pray the largest whale sharks and rays eat soup plankton almost in visibly small crustaceans and fish larvae\nAnd they do it by filter feeding ingesting vast quantities of water and separating out the tasty little creatures from it [noise]\nJust feeding strategy is clearly successful it's allowed filter feeders to become some of the largest creatures on earth\nAnd that also means that the way they do it might be worth copying that's what's inspired Dr Jim strolls or in his words with men to raise\nIt turns out these giant creatures with wing spans of up to six meters filter food from the water in a uniquely efficient way and he thinks it could inspire a revolution in filtering technology for things like water pollution that we desperately need\nDr ... there is an assistant professor of integrative biology at the Oregon State university's College of science I welcome to corks in court\nKnown for a while that a ... for a filter feeders\nA boat when we started to look at the filtering apparatus we hit a bit of a puzzle it doesn't look like a standard shelter\nIf you look at a typical ... felt a lot of them are just to play with a large number of holes in it so that uh any particles larger than the holes get a stock in those holes and then filtered out\nBut when you look at the filtering apparatus of ... what you'll find is that it's comprised of a larger re a intricately shaped when white clubs\nAnd so looking at that structure we really started to wonder how is this thing working and how are these animals able to filter out these open to\nSee movies of a man to raise and they they look like these big bats in the ocean was wings flapping in their mouth is a huge oval water coming is how\nThey actually eat well how does the water generally go through their body\nSo are meant to swim with our mouths open and they bring in huge volumes of water into their mouth it's hundreds of leaders of water per second the water passage essentially through the respiratory tract so in through the mouth and that out through the ... ... and where are the ... the lights are on the underside of their body\nAnd how small are the particles of food that they're reading uh they range in size but anywhere from say a grain of sand to a grain of rice in size\nSo how did you go about studying how they're actually filtering that water to get the food at\nWhat are we did was we measured the morphology of the shelter and apparatus and then we created a plastic model and then put that into a full tank where we could observe the flow patterns that developed around the apparatus and measure how particles interacted with the shelter\nWell what does the maturation filter actually look like when you get close to it\nIt's almost a ... pattern you can think of it like a vertical lines you have an array of plates one after the other water passes from the one plate to the next to the next to the next ah and then it passes out through the guilt flips\nOkay that's water now how is the food separated from their\nWell what's interesting is that the solid particles interact very differently with the er filtering apparatus they initially followed the water\nUm ... what we found was that they were being pushed away from the filtering apparatus how what we found was that the solid particles were being carried with the water but\nThe filter structures and then Rick or shape back up and away from the filter\nSo that water use are able to pass relatively easily through the filtering apparatus but solid particles are plankton are getting pushed away and then bouncing along the surface of the filtering apparatus before ultimately being swallowed by the animal\nOh I see so the the water's going through these these places you're talking about but the food particles are separated they don't actually go through the filter they go over the top of it\nYeah they go over the top of it but uh they're not trapped on the surface of the shelter instead they bounce along the surface or before ultimately beans followed by the animal and our digest it\nIt's amazing that you talked about little ... I think of a vortex like a a little tornado or is that what's happening there\nUh yeah there's little swirling Eddie's that are trapped between the filter loves a and those that little eddies um caused the ah the solid particles to hit the filter logs and then ... away\nNow if the manager ray is doing this in its in its mouth or does it have to be careful how how fast it swims or control that slow in some way\n[noise] uh yeah because uh the flow over that's held during apparatus is really important for setting that does flow patterns in that dynamic and said if the animal swims too slowly than the border to seize that don't develop\nA and if the animal swims too quickly than we think that the flow becomes too turbulent and that the filter also doesn't function effectively and so we think that the animal controlling swimming speed is an important part in a it's a function\n[laughter] so how does this filter systems that demands a re is using compare to filters that we use in our technology\nWell it's very different because in a typical ... felt there you have this sheet of holes or if you think of a\nA kitchen call under that you would use to string pasta or a coffee solitaire and as the particles are trapped on the surface of the filter because they can't pass through the poorest\nNow the disadvantage with that is that as the particles are trapped on the surface they will accumulate and accumulate a until they reach a point that water is no longer able to go through and the filter becomes less efficient\nWhat's interesting when we look at the mantle re shelter is that the particles are bouncing over the surface of the filter and so\nFilter so even after a long periods of time the filter stays clean and continues to operate at high ...\nWow so the ... raised don't have to clean and replaced their filters like we do with our coffee\nNo we really don't see ... stopped the clean air filter\n[laughter] so what lessons could we take from this to adapt to our technology\nWell that's what we're really interested in exploring now\nAh we're interested in seeing whether or not these principles can be applied to solve some of the engineering challenges that we face so one of the areas that we've been thinking about is and waste water treatment\nA micro plastics are an important and an emerging threat and so we have been interested in exploring whether or not these principles can be applied to improving wastewater treatment process these\nOh so we could catch micro plastics and prevent them from getting in the ocean\nYet we're interested in exploring whether or not does not to potential application\nBut well it's just amazing we think we're so clever but there's usually a case where nature does it better than we do\nThat's why these animals had been traverse in the oceans for thirty million years there's plenty we can learn from the\nDr ... thank you very much for your time I I guess Dr Jim stroller is an assistant

others would be fifty fifty into a city that others would be you know eighty percent ...\nThe question we asked was was there a correlation between the reported ancestry so what the grower or the seed

about which varieties might be better for pain relief reducing anxiety or for sleeping problems\nWe've had years of people using legal medical marijuana for therapeutic purposes and this has led many people to focus on what some think is the ingredient in cannabis that has the most medicinal potential it's called can dial often referred to as CBD for short\nThere's been a lot of hype over CBD lately and we're starting to see it in medically focus products not just something to smoker vape but in oils are creams that are meant to be applied topic late so let's bring back Dr Martin where to help us get at just how much of this has good scientific backing\nDoctor where what does the science say about CBD and how effective it is and it's a therapeutic drug\nThe science of CBD is in its infancy right now it's it's a substance that's been around for a long time the Brazilian research community were first looking at CBD for epilepsy in the Nineteen eighties or for anxiety disorders it's been administered in humans in clinical trials for a number of years\nBut it's only recently that we've begun to explore it therapeutically and this is most illustrated by the use of can dial for childhood epilepsy\nWere not reached a point where CBD as an approved medicine by the U.S food and Drug Administration will be seeing these scheduled and it's now available medicine\nThis increase in CBD and this interest in CBD has fuels an enormous interest because it is considered to be the non psychoactive cannot annoyed\nIt's sort of cannabis without the high if you like and so this is an enormous appeal not only to patients and people who are looking for a way to use cannabis or looking to treat different symptoms\nBut also to lawmakers who can pass laws that allow cannabis but only high CBD candidates this has given rise to a tremendous excitement and then as with many other drugs do sure it's received a lot of hype people have been now discovering the potential for CBD the problem\nAnd any pure pharmaceutical grade form for studies and so the science is now trying to catch up but it's fascinating to hear people tell us what they're experiencing when they use CBD assuming they're getting access to a regulated product that we know what's in it\nIt will be very important to listen to these experiences and follow that up with confirmatory research\nCannabis as a notoriously inconsistent as a plants were sent meant for researchers like use you try to study it\nWell we have to find people and I'm cultivation systems and frameworks where we can actually standardize that production this has been a challenge from a botanical standpoint until relatively recently where\nWe now know that there are systems and mechanisms to cultivate kind of is under tightly controlled circumstances\nMore slowly by smoking flour so yeah it's\nIt's nice it's sort of in your [noise]\nSo Dr where what are your concerns around the use of these high potency products\nWill impart the concerns are simply that we don't have access to them to be able to identify what the effects are if we can only assume that when they're that concentrated you are taking a very large quantity of the drug THC in particular I'm In a very short space of time\nDoes that change the effect does that change the risk profile we don't really know think shooting alcohol in a shot versus drinking a ... a cold beer slowly over the course of an hour different effect different potential impact we need to understand these better\nThank you Dr where Canada is of course not the first jurisdiction to legalize cannabis the state of Colorado famously was a pioneer\nWhich creates a strange legal tension because of the u._s. cannabis is still an illegal drug under federal law this makes life complicated for American researchers studying cannabis they have to do a delicate dance around federal regulations\nSo one research group in Colorado is taking a unique approach to learn more about how these highly concentrated products effect users [noise]\nThey've converted a van into allowed to take their cannabis research on the road\nMy name is Dr send them ended well an assistant professor at the Institute of cognitive science at the University of Colorado Boulder we're in a pretty unique situation in Colorado in that we have\nLegal recreational and Medicinal Cannabis in our state so as an adult and my state I could legally purchased a range of wide range of kind of its products are potency is all the way up to at times Ninety or Ninety five percent THC but as a researcher in my state\nI have to comply with federal law in terms of the candidates that I could bring into my lab to test in terms of the effects on people or analyze in terms of the plant content in order to actually research their products that people use in everyday life\nWe can't bring the product into the lab we have to take the lab to the people\nWe shouldn't freelance radio producer dengue\nI'm going to walk him out to the band they should be ready or if it's a white van\nDoes have the University of Colorado logo on it [noise]\nThey did they I'm Leah Leah ... nice to see you guys well that is a tribute tapestry\nSo that mobile labs really critical for that acute time point what happens immediately after somebody uses\nAnd so the steps were taking to collect the data even though unusual\nWe think will provide some very helpful and critical information for a public health [noise]\nSo one of the things we're testing is whether or not people change their patterns of youth so when they're using higher potency products do they temper or modulate their use\nAnd ultimately result in the same level of impairment as as these lower potency products or do these high potency products represent a unique level of intoxication where people are are much more impaired are much more intoxicated another piece that\nHappens is the question of how the brain and body adapts overtime to hire potency products and so if people are continually exposed to much higher forms of teach C do they end up just needing more THC in order to experience any intoxication or potential medical benefits that they're using for [noise]\nUm so what else have you do is I Want you to blow into the white plastic mouthpiece until you hear a click and they feel like you're running out of breath and there are a couple of events on the back so just try not to block those with your hand so we start every mobile labs session with a breathalyzer [noise]\nAnd that is to ensure that there is no alcohol that may compromise our motor control or cognitive measures\nAnd move on to the blood draw\nAnd so we drop blood and were able to get a very acute measure of their ... exposure [noise]\n... how much\nTHC is in their blood so we kind of get a peak measure as well as at a later measure of that in terms of their full THC exposure\nThen we also have a a balance task that we do with participants so\nSandoval so and so we have things like motor control battery where people perform reaction time test they perform balanced tasks they performed motor coordination tasks\nYou're going to that piece of paper with your eyes open for thirty seconds once you feel a tap from me they'll close your eyes and do that for thirty seconds\nAnd so we look at both immediately after use as well as a re evaluation about an hour later to see if any impairments are recovered\nOvertime All right we could go ahead and start again in three two\nOne with your eyes open\nUp a pig and\nWe also have a set of cognitive tests that assess working memory or things like sustained attention how long you can focus on that particular task particularly with distraction and different forms of a recall or memory that may be impaired under the influence of cannabis\nSo the next one will do is we'll play a couple of games on the eye pad\nFor these sort of university sanctioned games\nSo they're actually from the national Institute of health so their\nStandard across\nDifferent studies I Want to use it\nAll right so in this past year going to see a role of arrows that are going to be pointing different ways so you should always choose the button that matches the direction of the middle arrow so just go as fast as you can\nBreak or data are still very pulmonary but we are noticing that people using a range of potency use for concentrate so maybe all the way from Seventy to Ninety percent that within that range people seem to\nModulate up to a very similar levels so their blood intoxication levels are higher than they would be with flour but they don't differ across the sort of range of potency so it does seem like once you get to a very high potency products\nPeople are using sort of the right amounts for them to get to a certain intoxication level that it doesn't matter whether it's Seventy percent or Ninety percent for our data in terms of how impaired they are are having to do that\nAlso seeing a sort of a tolerance of facts that in these users of have high potency concentrates their impairments at least acutely does not look a lot different than people who are using sort of typical potency flower products however their blood exposure is much higher\nSo we're getting lead levels that are higher than I've really seen in the literature in terms of their teach the intoxication level\nAnd so that raises a concern as to what their exposure is like over time in terms of teach see how their brain and body are adapting to this very acute first and the very high level of teach the exposure\nAnd what might happen if they try to cut back on some of our data suggests possibly higher dependents or problem use\nMore abuse liability or clinical dependence is why it's head for users that these types of products [noise]\nOne of the things we absolutely need to think about this we embark on the great Canadian guns experiment is that we're legalizing a psychoactive drug\nAnd while we're long past the days when we feared reefer madness that doesn't mean pot is completely innocent as with any drug it'll have risks and costs compared to our other favorite recreational drug alcohol [noise] so we need to understand the risks of cannabis use\nAnd the first risk that comes to many people's minds is the risk of addiction so let's go back to work in the studio Canada science expert Dr Mark where\nNow Dr where you talked to his earlier about the things we know and don't know about the effects of cannabis on the neurobiology of the brain so what do we know about this question of Canada is an addiction for recreational users\n[noise] I think given the opportunity of legalizing in regulating kind of is coming up we will have a better idea of this question and it's an important one how likely is it that somebody using cannabis will have a problem with its use\nThe currently bandied about statistics suggest that of regular candidates uses about ten percent meet criteria of cannabis use dependence which means that they spend a lot of time thinking about it they spend a lot of their time trying to get it\nAnd it may affect adversely their social and work functions insulin\nThanks Dr where\nTo get a better picture of this we'd like to introduce you to someone's struggling with this problem we've withheld his name to protect his privacy Mm\nI Am a bother thirty eight years old living and Victoria, BC I'm a hardworking government employee I own a home here and I'm struggling with marijuana dependency\nI've been a daily smoker for probably twenty here recently kick the habit and just to kind of struggling with leaflets nights and changes in my emotions that are\nKind of a shocking sometimes in computer then [noise] you know if you have a bad day or you're stressed out by your relationships or you know any number of things in your life it's really easy to use pot to just kind of forget all that", "show_name": "Quirks and
