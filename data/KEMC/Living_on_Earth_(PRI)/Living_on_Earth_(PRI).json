of the American Medical Association has found what many people have long suspected eating organic food appears to reduce the risk of cancer\nAmong some sixty nine thousand people tracked by French scientist over several years those diets contain more organics at about twenty five percent fewer cancers overall with thirty five percent fewer breast cancers and older women and the more than Seventy percent reduction in them focus\nThis study suggests but does not prove that pesticides and other chemical residues in foods cause cancer but there's no reason to wait for\nCan group can cook Ken welcome back to living on earth thanks Davis great to be here so when this study came out it showed strong evidence in support of the long held beliefs that organic food is better for us how do you feel that this study is out there\nWell you know I guess I feel as if we should have been doing studies like this a long time ago we really do need to be much more careful about the low levels of carcinogens that we still have in our diet the fact that several cancers here\nDid show or a market decrease to me tells me the organic food is probably targeting the mechanisms that are associated with those cancers and the other thing that's interesting while they speculated about pesticides\nThere are other chemicals in non organic foods that are not allowed in organic certain chemical dies a certain color rings\nA certain flavorings that simply are not allowed in organic food manufacturer that in addition to pesticides may be another reason why there's lower cancer rates amongst\nThese mostly women who are eating more organic food\nAnd of course if the product is made from genetically modified organisms it's not allowed to be labeled as organic\nThat is true as well and there really are not very many chemicals that are allowed in organic manufactured are packaged\nFood compared to conventional where there are thousands so there are lots of questions raised by this study but to me it goes back to the basic point a cleaner set of ingredients closer to nature fewer additives less processing is probably in general playing a role here\nSo how excited are you by this study and how much of a game changer do you think it might become\nI find it very encouraging it's just one study that's often said from time to time and they're right one study is just one study\nTo me this opens the door to doing more types of analyses like this a big populations and refining even further what we know about the diet of the people that are are responding to the questions what we need to do now Steve is we need to scale it up we're still talking about organic with a\nVery small footprint on the agricultural landscape and unfortunately still a very\nSmall footprint as it were in our diet but the other thing I I just have to say is you know this\nDoes not mean that eating conventional fruits and vegetables is a bad thing we think that's positive the real problem we we have in our diet is

happiness that we are not going to jail and quite frankly that an off bail and may have the opportunity to do civil disobedience again because I\nHad to be very careful while out on bail because if I got arrested it could be revoked and I could spend all my time in the Clearwater county jail awaiting trial\nBut um you know we're disappointed that we did not get to put on the climate necessity defense that we wanted to with you know the very well respected experts that we had lined up to testify it for us like Dr James Hansen you know former climate scientists from NASA and Bill McKibben so it's a mixed bag\nEmily yeah I I'll go being stronger about it than that and say that you know I was really heartbroken not so much by the acquittal of course which is a good thing it was to sort of second best scenario we could have had\nBut by the denial of our expert witness testimony on climate change and on civil disobedience you know it would have been the dream trial it could have made a really big difference so they thought that this kind of trial might happen in that courtroom in front of those jurors and that might make set a precedent that would really\nHave an impact nationally on the climate change debate seemed like a really important thing to me and of course until four days before trial began it looked very much like it was going to happen\nSo you know it's it's a real shame that that it did not\nKnow as I understand that you could ask the judge to let you use the necessity defense\nAnd he had granted that to us\nList for for about the last year and a half\nSo at any point in that time period he could have\nConstrained us constrain the number of witnesses said you can't talk about this or that and he chose not to so the fact that he did that for days before trial began with stunning at the lawyers who couldn't have been more surprised we couldn't have been more surprised\nUntil that moment he'd been very very reasonable and it seems like all systems were go and to be clear the thing about that that was so striking apart from its sudden his\nWas the facts that normally speaking defendants do not have any burden of proof it's it's the prosecution that has the burden of proof normally\nBut because we were going to use a necessity defense and say that what we did\nYou know was essentially a necessary under these circumstances that we find ourselves in to prevent the greater harm of climate change we did have the burden of proof and all of a sudden he knocked out our ability to defend ourselves essentially because who is going to listen to a poet a retired lawyer and a software engineer from Seattle\nOn climate change you know we're not scientists we have no authority so no matter how articulate we had been it wouldn't have had anything like the same impact as the former head of the NASA Goddard Space Center talking about climate change and how urgent it is or about Minnesota scientists talking about how urgent it is and how much is already changing in Minnesota\nSo you know again we had no ability to defend ourselves without experts to testify to those things\nAnd the software engineering or co defendant was\nThat was ... a young father of three who was our support person or support people were all arrested they went in knowing that that was a possibility but it was certainly our hope and we're planning the action that they would not be arrested so we're very very happy that he's acquitted and home with\nHis young family were happy that he's acquitted but I personally am very sorry he didn't get to testify you know in the necessity defense hearing a in August a year ago when he testified there was not a dry in the room\nYou know when he talked about his young children and what they were facing\nAnd then the case becomes even more confusing I guess because the judge was on the one hand you can have witnesses to make your case and then he proceeded to go ahead to quit you of the charges\nThat was after the prosecutor had presented his case which was only two witnesses the sheriff who arrested us and and local Enbridge employee\nAnd all he proved was that we had broken some chains that were holding the log into the enclosure where the emergency shut off valve was and we never disputed that so we were charged\nLegislatures right now by the fossil fuel industry to give them you know further penalties against protesters and the statute we were charged under was specifically damage to pipelines and the judge ruled and he was correct that the prosecutor had not prove that we had damaged the pipeline and anyway yeah\nIn the ... century he was ruling that there wasn't evidence for a reasonable jury to convict us basic right that as a matter of law then that was because of course we hadn't damage that pipeline right\nI'm going to ask you to speculate about both of you in a ... about judge Robert Tiffany and the decisions that you made in your case how do you think the judiciary might have been influenced by outside forces politics sentiment\nThe fossil fuel industry\nThis is Emily in terms of you know what kind of pressures he may have been under or what he may have been I'm thinking you know whether his mind might have changed\nAbout what kind of precedent he wanted to set and so forth you know it's it's impossible to know and and it's you know distressing and it certainly something we've been wondering about he seems like a very reasonable guy he gave us a necessity defense he wanted to hear what we had to say and he wanted to let the jury hear it so\nYou know the about face was quite extreme\nWe know for sure that Enbridge provide something like two thirds of the budget that county so I you know they obviously have some influence direct or indirect we don't know I mean we have no way to know what may or may not have happened behind the scenes but\nThey fossil fuel companies have terrible amounts of influence and power in this country and you know that's why we have to fight them and the ways that we have to fight them because they do on and control our political system all on all levels\nTo what extent did you understand what do you do this direct action the law enforcement could bring felony charges against you know\nAbsolutely knew that that was not only a possibility but a strong probability and we accept that risk\nI personally feel I'm sixty six years old and I feel that it is my job as an elder and it is my job because I Am an old white woman who has the privilege of not having the cop show up and shoot me on site if I Do something like that\nThat it really is my job to step up and do these kinds of things I Know from my you know young activist of color friends that it's far more risky for them it's far more risky just with the police showing up\nWe're likely to treat them harshly [noise] we can look right now what is going on with the prosecutions of indigenous folks who stood up at Standing Rock and often were arrested for no more than standing in prayer and yet or getting felony convictions right now and getting very harsh sentences [laughter]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Living on Earth (PRI)", "city": "Billings", "day": "27",

requires really clear explicit direction from Congress when it comes to rules that impose costs on American businesses he's quite pro business\nAnd he's quite strict when it comes to interpreting environmental laws against broad protections\nSo what is it important to her an outstanding case that Brett Kavanaugh has ruled on regarding the environment from his perch in the circuit court of appeals\nWell he recently ruled that EPA does not have the authority to require a substitute\nChemical that's used in refrigerant and a fire prevention devices that is a very potent greenhouse gas that chemical was adopted because it doesn't deplete the ozone layer so it was one of these non\nOzone depleting chemicals but the problem is that it's a terrible greenhouse gas in EPA tried to say well we're not going to substitute a greenhouse gas for an ozone depleted let's find a different chemical Kevin all looked at the language of the clean Air Act and said no it's it's limited\nFor [noise]\n\n\nReally [noise]\nComing up little known and in trouble our breasts race to save the butter not tree just hours ahead on living on her\nSupport for a living on earth comes from the Gordon Betty Moore foundation and from the ... sailors for the working with voters to restore ocean health\nLiving on earth is supported by Joel ... dedicated to\n\n[noise]\n\nIt's living on Earth I'm seeker with hurricane\nMichael quickly blew up into a devastating category for storm as it entered warm waters in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico is yet another example of the increasing number of major weather events linked to climate disruption\nAnd according to a recent report from scientist with the inner governmental panel on climate change the IPC see we can expect more and more dire events such as Michael but only seemingly small increases and the globe's average surface temperatures\nThe twenty Fifteen Paris climate agreement call for no more than a two degrees centigrade increase from pre industrial conditions and suggested limiting the rise to one point five degrees would be beneficial but this new report finds that half degree difference poses huge risks\nKeeping below that one and a half degrees centigrade goal is going to be tough but the impact of failure will be even tougher says Princeton professor Michael Oppenheimer professor Oppenheimer has been a lead author Frye PCC reports for years and joins us now welcome back to living on earth Michael\nTo be here again I mean to cut to the chase how scared are you by this latest report from the IPC see\nI don't get scared about this issue because I've been living with it for thirty five years and that if it scared me I Would have gone crazy a long time ago however any sane person would take away a very very sobering message apart and reading this report\nThe effects of climate change are already here\nAre projected to worsen over tie\nThat the possibility of very big impacts starts to increased markedly is not\nToward the end of this century but very close a matter of a decade or two away if we do nothing or more or less nothing like we're doing now to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases that are causing the problem\nSo what's the basic premise of this report it and and why was it issued in the first place\nThis report has an unusual origin the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change producers thorough assessments of all our knowledge on climate change\nEvery six years or so and then in between those major assessments that produces very quick and pointed assessments of pieces of the problem\nFor instance I'm working on the next these are called special reports that I'm working on the next special report which is on the oceans and the icy parts of Earth like the ice sheets\nThe report that just came out is on the question of what is the level at which we should restrain warming in order not to enter a danger zone where the risks are just so high\nThat we may just as a group of societies not be able to cope with it\nThat's unusual because it's pointed at a single very specific issue that has high policy relevance\nNow what are the headlines from this latest I PCC report is that we have just a dozen years twelve years or twenty thirty or so to get our act together to reaching net zero output in carbon emissions to what extent do you agree with that finding and how do we possibly get there\nBe Frank about and I don't think we're going to get there and I also think that partly because of that\nThe framing that we have twelve years left or else is wrong it's counterproductive it'll just scare people in the report they frame it that way that's been a framing that the media has\nHas put on it is sort of like twelve years we don't do it we should do the world comes to win and that's not the case the reality is at every step you do the best you can and if you don't quite make\nThe target you try to do a little better in the next decade or the next couple of decades the world doesn't come to an end costs that is the risk just increased markedly and it becomes very very hard to cope eventually that doesn't mean that society's will completely disintegrate some well I can tell you that sea level rise is going\nWe'll make life just miserable expensive and uncomfortable for the rest of us\nSo what are the biggest challenges in this report or in terms of limiting warming to a degree and a half century\nContrary to what most people think ah the report finds that the challenges are not primarily technological the costs are going to be decreasing overtime although they're never going to be entirely negligible but\nThe real obstacle is a social and political one how do you get societies organize to actually reinvent themselves to be not independent of fossil fuels\nYou're saying the primary challenge to limit warming to one and a half degrees centigrade is us what in fact do we need to do then as society is as governments to to limit this morning I I Know there are many many aspects to it but but briefly what do we need to do\nAt the most general level what we need to do is abandon using fossil fuels as primary energy sources that means getting rid of coal the primary source of carbon dioxide from electric power production for instance as soon as possible\nReducing and eventually eliminating our dependence on\nPetroleum based products like gasoline primarily for transportation and\nProbably the biggest challenges that there's so much carbon dioxide or writing\nIn the atmosphere that even if we slow down markedly are ... and ... eliminate dependence on fossil fuels we need probably need to find a way to remove some of that carbon from the atmosphere eventually not immediately but as we get towards mid century\nIt seems we're going to need a way to suck the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and people are working on that so that those are two things\nThe third thing is becoming more efficient and that means not just efficiency and production it also means societies organizing themselves efficiently for instance in the United states we have a very spread out\nPattern of development and that pattern automatically guarantees high energy use\nSo tell us why two degrees centigrade will be even worse than they already ambitious goal of one and a half degrees centigrade why does just half a degree make such a difference according to this particular report\nSo when the report was\nFor two thousand and Fifteen a lot of scientists were skeptical that they would be much of a difference\nScientists went out and started doing research focused specifically on the difference between one and a half to two degrees it's become clear that particularly with regard to extreme heat\nAnd flooding that there were a big difference is between one and a half and two degrees let me give you an example already by one and a half degrees there are places a particularly islands in the Pacific and megacities all around the world for which the incidence of the benchmark hundred year\nStorm or a hundred year flood event I should call it increases markedly even by one and a half degrees so that you're getting\nAt that level what is today a wandering a hundred year event becomes a yearly events think about that we don't deal with those kinds of events effectively now even though they're very rare what happens when they're happening all the time\nWhat's missing from this report in and tell me why there\nReally isn't much of a\nSocial and political analysis there isn't much discussion of the political and social obstacles there is discussion of the need for transformation but not that much discussion of how you go about it\nIn particular places and why it's difficult to do and the reasons for that our number one it's different in every place in the IPC she can't do a special report for every place on earth\nFunding for a living on earth comes from you

O R G\nI began the second part of our talk by asking Secretary Kerry they consider the issue of stranded\nAssets as it applies to climate change\nLet me ask you just to think reflect on this for a moment looking at American history in Eighteen sixty\nIn the south there was more monetary value in slaves than there was in the land or Eighteen sixty five that was a classic stranded s at all that valued disappeared to what extent today do you think we're being held hostage by folks who think\nBillions of dollars and it can't all be burned if we understand the science correctly\nTo what extent are we headed down a path I mean to solve the problem that we had was slavery I mean does the moral question there just like we have today with climate as well as the economic question to solve that problem we wound up in a pretty in a very bloody war\nI don't I mean I don't think that's the choice for for America now I think that I think uh most of the executives I Know at the higher level of the oil industry are all diversifying\nA shell BP they're all investing in New energy they're ready to move where the market we'd go and uh\nI mean we're not going to be able to transition fast enough that you suddenly dry up and not have oil or gas and ... there's going to be on the gas for a while it's just the nature of the beast we've got to try to guarantee it's not for to allowing why\nI'm simply listening to the scientists I mean I'm listening to the end and understanding the science if we don't move off fossil fuels fast enough we could reach what's called a tipping point where\nThings begin to cascade down words in a spiral of destruction and dying\nOf dying sees dying trees dying species of various kinds because it's not sustainable and if you get into that kind of a spiral nobody knows nobody can tell you how you break out of it I'm just applying the precautionary principle of the idea of governing\nMean we buy insurance to make sure our of our home burned down we're going to be able to rebuild it we by car insurance to fix the rack and hope in our life insurance and then somebody last of life\nThe family's okay why are we buy insurance against the death and destruction that will come with increased storms and increase climate change\nIt's beyond my understanding why are we going to have a president who is a desire of this science\nNinety eight percent of all the scientists in the world who ever watch this and looked at it with peer reviewed studies peer reviewed studies all say this is happening happening now and it's caused by not exclusively but largely by human beings\nAnd we don't respond to this whoa whoa to sending them we're entering into the sort of suicide packed\nIt could be worse than the United states civil war that right now we are heading I you know the goal in Paris was to keep the rise of the earth's temperature to two degrees centigrade and we were going\nCurrent rate we're not meaning that standard we\nAre heading now towards four degrees centigrade rise in temperature the average temperature of the planet that's catastrophic\nYou'll have water battles you'll have refugees moving you think we have tough migration challenges today where people can produce food and various parts of the world will their water dries up and they're not able to live what happens when the oceans change and you have a migration away from certain stocks that people have relied on for food and so forth [noise]\nThey're just so many unknowns here I'm not willing to just throw up my hands and sail someone's going to take care of this\nBecause that's just not responsible given the input\nBack in the day as lieutenant governor of Massachusetts which is not exactly ordinarily a very exciting position you made your mark jumping on the acid rain but tell me what did that teach you about the politics of environmental protection\nThat reasonable people with a reasonable purpose in public life\nAre able to work together Republican and Democrat in order to do things that are good for American citizens I was lieutenant governor but Michael Dukakis are allowed me to be the chair of the governors task force for him I worked with Governor John Sununu in New Hampshire I worked with Governor and Dick's Alaska of Ohio\nAnd we put together the three of us a and approach\nDrawn up by the way by the American Enterprise Institute is conservative approach to how you use the market to be able to\nAccomplish something you want to accomplish and there was a market incentives for people to actually buy in trade sulfur which reduce the amount of self or we we got acid rain under control through the system and then when I was in the Senate I was able to use that and put it into the clean Air Act\nAnd so it became part of the national program so you don't hear about it I said right now we could do the same thing for climate change if we had the leadership that was willing to recognize\nThe greatest market the biggest market on this planet is the energy market it is today\nThey're four to five billion users they're going to be about nine billion users next Thirty years 'cause that's gonna be a population of the of the world and we have the ability through the deployment of sustainable renewable alternative energy to be able to limit our emissions and control climate\nWrite in your book that a despite President Trump's role backs and attempts to roll back to President Obama's signature climate environmental policy\nWell I Am optimistic I'll tell you why first of all because living without optimism would be miserable [laughter] I don't want to be miserable but more importantly because I see what's happened in my lifetime which what what I write about in in in the book every day's extra mean",
