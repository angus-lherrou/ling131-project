I I I I mean to me that is true that is not writing as much as it is torture\nGroup episodes I mean there's another thing they always end up being sort of the best because you have all these weird over the voices reading all these storylines you put it together and it's just very pleasing patchwork\nWhat TV shows are you watching challenge your assumption\nMake you think about things in your way\nEmail us comments that philosophy talked on or gee we may see through your suggestions on our blog\nWe're joined now by captain told me she's a professor of philosophy at northern Arizona university and a contributor to game of Thrones in philosophy\nLogic cuts deeper than swords Katie welcome to philosophy talk Hi thanks for having me so Katy I Know you've been a fan not just a fan of game of Thrones but you published about game of threats so so what is it about this show that lends to a philosophical analysis [noise]\nWell I think that I'm particularly drawn to the different characters in game of Thrones and how they represent different an ethical issues or even a different ethical principles so in a publication that I had for game of science and philosophy I talked about the nearest and her\nSort of encounters with just rocky and cultural relativism um I think in more recent seasons I'm interested in um portrayals of um gender and race on inability um that various up the difference\nRich character is that like lend themselves\nReally well to philosophical discussion I mean the issue of gender is fascinating because you know if you think about the way the show's evolved it starts out with\nMost of the female characters being presented as basically passive victims of succumb to their circumstances and by now we're living more or less than a ... right you have all these powerful not necessarily always morally pure so the other is the right\nBut you got serious the ladder to the nearest star during the ... are a great joy REO to some extent right or is that something has been of interest to you Katie is sort of a gradual evolution of a plot over the the seasons that we've seen\nYeah I have to say that one of the things that drew me to a game of Thrones\nIs the fact that there are like are so many rich female characters like I have you know grew up reading fantasy and watching fantasy movies where women are often lacking in in game of Thrones you have so many interesting female characters and that's not to say that like representations of gender always like\nI don't know praise but um it's really interesting how like we can take the nearest is the sort of classic example she starts this this like you said passive character who's just sort of\nYou know a victim of circumstances where all these different in her life her brother um called robo um are just\nTelling her what to do essentially and then we see her develop into an individual and the kind of moral decisions that she has to make later on and how she becomes a leader that people both love and respect without losing any kind of\nUm I guess like stereotypical femininity so like the nearest represents herself as a as a mother she's the mother to everyone so she's post like fully feminine and has the masculine qualities\nThat well I haven't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were food\nThe rocky hadn't crossed the\nThey did for me\nI was born to ... and\nLet me ask you a question about ... ... you mean a how many people has she burned with her dragons I don't know and be any by what rights they had it coming can buy what rights does she rule\nIn in in West rose I mean what's her what's her what she comes with a dragons and force and see too many many many people with their army right so it I mean she does have a complicated ark and sometimes her art looks like\nThe evolution from a victim to kind of liberating hero but then she makes all these mistakes he makes\nDoes she claim any right to rule over the people of West rose ... to whom she basically says submit or die I don't know about that I don't know the classic femininity I that's something else that's the monster\nWell I think that um will do a lot of lot of things um you said they're they're interesting so I think one thing it's like she always sees her people at in terms of the sort of like mother child relationship you know there's that scene which is highly problematic at the end of season three where everyone is calling her her my\n... mother [noise]\nOne of the great things about game of Thrones is that you have a character like the nearest one the one hand is like a super sympathetic character we really want to like hurt in season one\nAnd she has these dragons in this like mythical background and it's really cool and the other hand I'm like you mention what right does she have to go and like conquer all these cities um this is something I talk about with my my students when I when I'm teaching ethics like\nIs it OK in sort of white colonialist fashion to go and demolish these civilizations even in the name of like anti slavery\nBut does raise it I mean it's a question I think it feels like a general question the show which is the question of legitimacy\nHow does power if at all or a ... you have all these different models exactly have social organization you kind of loose affiliation in the wild wings you all the way up to kind of a tyranny under Joffrey and even if a tiny little bit of democracy of the wall\nSo is there any positive mobile hear\nThe question of legitimacy and ruling is really um especially interesting with the ... so it's the same thing with the wild things where it's like they kind of electric who is going to be the best\nRuler that was man's man's raider but um\nAnd then they you know refused to be a part of like the the west coast\nUm seven kingdoms and on the one hand we think the wild things are bad because they killed Stark's and and you know trying to catch them or whatever um but then also with with John's art we see oh they are actually like really interesting people and maybe this is a better style of government than white where we're seeing elsewhere\nSo I I think game of Thrones makes it kind of an open question about what sorts of\nEncounters with otherness are um things that we can accept and things that we can't so like when we encounter other groups of people maybe there are certain practices that we should say like okay you know maybe you eat\nPillage as part of your um your cultural practice maybe we should draw the line there and it's not entirely clear where that line is and it seems like it bends throughout the show um but I think that's also true with with life in general so I don't think it with her and says like giving us any answers but it is raising these questions that are the for interesting\nThat leads me to cut costs are consequential is question if the world is really messed up is it bad to be good because you know next dog is a good terrible world than you might think that if you compromise a little bit and just being a little bit corrupt in the long run things would have worked out\nBut yeah yeah there's a scene where I'm friendly brass and you know goes up to to net and it's like hey what we need to do Robert is dead we need to you know capture surfing and take her children\nWe must get jewelry away from his mother into custody protector of the ... hopes the kingdom [noise] every moment for like your sister of a moment to prepare\nFor the ... the troops with both of us\nAnd your mind like yes take ideal it's a good deal but you know I don't know I think that's\nThat's a that's challenging because you I think like OK well would that really work out is it okay for net to sort of stick with his values I mean obviously it's bad for him he ends up compromising a little bit because he lives in order to save his children so maybe that's like some\nKind of middle ground I don't know um I think that the ... many of the stark women represent a different kind of morality so you have catlin um who seems you know she isn't this kind of consequences list or\nThe onto logical thinker if we were to peg catlin in a sort of moral theory she would be a carrot assess which he really cares about her family and what's close to her\nUm Enron I mean maybe ... is sort of similar\n[laughter] and this in the sense that she's fighting for like her family I don't know I'm is revenge apart of care I think so I don't know so what are you up and to me\nI so starting in the beginning I had this like beautiful story in my mind like generic is becoming their rightful rule or Syrian by her side\nUm I wasn't really into her getting married I kinda liked the idea of hardest being on her own but I don't know I I think that she's going to like sacrifice herself I think that'd be the best arc for her\nUm and I think maybe most of the characters will but I I honestly have no no idea I just want to be surprised I wanted to unlock hamlet carnage everywhere\nBut even at the end of hamlet there's like a couple of people who were like oh you know reflecting and being like oh we can learn from this\nKatie tell them I'm from northern Arizona university helping us think about philosophical themes in game of Thrones\nYou're listening to philosophy\nAnd we're thinking about the new golden age of television\nAnother courage that philosophically fascinating\nIs Wes where [noise]\nYou know if I can stay right here with you I Would [noise]\n[noise]\nMarine [noise]\nStanford colleagues George ... is a huge fan and he joins us now sure will come back to philosophy tug Thanks Ken great to be back here\nSo Jarrod we'd love west a book but what do you think makes it a philosophically interesting TV show\nProgram what else to talk to someone who is being of all things a philosophical consulted on major TV show\nPhilosophers on the set in our audience when a lot to be talking to [noise]\nThe staff and friends of why PR thank all who contributed to the overwhelming success of our fall on air fundraising week with your generous help we raised two hundred Seventy three thousand nine hundred sixty two dollars from Nineteen hundred to pledges\nAs a five pm friday September twenty eight almost thirty thousand dollars beyond our minimum goal even with special coverage of both the presidential press conference and a day long hearing of the Senate Judiciary committee airing uninterrupted in the midst of our fundraising effort\nAll of us it why PR thank you for your trust and your support the success of this fundraiser means y PR can continue to bring you the best in news music and information on air on line and on our smartphone app thank you [noise]\n\nLooking back I'm Josh Ninety and this is the last time the program the questions everything except your intelligence I'm Ken Taylor and we're thinking about some of the most philosophically compelling programs in the new golden age of television we're joined now by Pamela here on me\nFor NBC show the good place Pamela welcome back to philosophy talk thank you so much so ... maybe it's\nBecause I don't live in LA and Hollywood but you know I don't know too many philosophers who a bit like had a hand in ah making TV or movies or anything like that so how did that happen is that just that just something you uh LA philosophers do\nNot at this level um so it is a case that I often at once or twice a year or get a email from somebody who's interested in an idea that they have for a TV show or a movie and if I if I have time I usually um like to talk to them just 'cause it's fun and interesting\nSo I got an email I'm like this about what turned out from Mike sure who um I didn't know who he was but I I said sure I Would be happy to and then um and then as I was preparing for the\nMeeting I looked him up and I thought wow this this is the person from parks and recreation of a big yeah I'm\nSo we met at a local coffee shop for and and just talked about his idea for um for maybe three hours which was extremely fun fun topic and then uh when when the show a came up for the second season they invited me back or they actually invited me to the studio to the writers' room\nAnd I got to speak with the uh the entire room full of of writers which was which was also extremely fun\nSo tell us about the premise of the show and tell us a little bit more about how you help them a shape the show\nOr so the the premise of the show opens with Eleanor I'm who arrives at quote the good place I'm so she's died\nAnd she has met by Michael who was the architect of the good place and ah Michael explained to her that she's arrived at the good place and um and starts to show her around but a Eleanor knows that there's been a mistake because Eleanor knows that she was not a good person and so I'm really shouldn't be in a good place\nI honestly think I Would just by mistake because my mom called me Allen herself strapped so he knows I'm Me he's just wrong about my overall quality level\nShe's hooked up as everybody is with her I suppose it's soul mate who is ... ... is a professor of ethics and moral philosophy when she introduced himself in that way on the show when I watched it I cracked up a so so tedious her soul mate and Eleanor convinces\nHe will help her to become a better person so that she might stay in the good place to wait a minute\nGD he's a moral philosopher ... he and cages with is not good person to hide her not good news\nTo help her yeah so then things start going terribly wrong and the good place and Eleanor I'm has the suspicion that it's because of her presence um and the show takes off from that\nBut what makes sure was interested in when he was conceiving of the show and and I think the reason he um reached out to me was the um puzzles and difficulties about how to become a better person when you don't start with the motivations to be a good person and and so I had a\nA draft about that puzzle on my on my website and I and I believe he just came across that and then wanted to to talk to me about it\nThat's great that's a lovely question right so it's not just a question about what the moral principles are and how you to bootstrap yourself into any kind of moral sentiment\nThat's the real question and a Eleanor has had led a very problematic life\nAnd then none of them are good people there they're all problematic people here's my question though why the afterlife why don't why not tell a story about people struggling to become good through their lives so I mean what was the point of setting this in this problematic afterlife\nIt's a great question I guess I so I did not speak with Mike about that question but my guess is that he was very interested in having this points system and thinking about how much good a person had done in the course of their lives and comparing people\nWhen your time under cars and we calculate the value of your life\nUsing are perfectly accurate measurements and only the people with the very highest score the true cream of the crop to come here to the good what happens with everyone else us to worry about it\nLater in the show um some contractual is that philosophers show up and um and I like to think that was some bit of my influence to to get them thinking\nYou know not just about I'm producing good doing good things are producing good outcomes but also\nUm you know several of Eleanor is a first flashbacks are ways in which she's a what gets called the free rider where she's trying to never have to be the designated driver or what have you and especially now\nThe importance of that to the original question of how it is that we become better people is really starting to come together so it was very pleased to see that\nI thought you might say because it doesn't play so much a little bit with\nThe nature of divinity and all that right I mean no right\n'cause you know she even gets in there by mistake and what kind of divinity as that but a great play with that very much but ah but they're not it's not really she's in a bad place by design nothing good place I mean I Know but we do know that really that was the spoiler [laughter] that deal the but here's the thought of that maybe\nI think there are several system where you can't judge a life\nUntil you have the whole life before you do write edging the goodness of a life is only after it's done and maybe that's part of the thought\nIt could be it could be um I think\nThe idea was just that um we're used to thinking about judging a person's moral goodness from the standpoint of the eternal judge or from God or from religion and so that just gave a a real focus probably to to the question he wanted to consider\nNot make sense plus it lets him has that flying shrimp than you know crazy things\n[laughter] so I Want to ask you another question that's going to depend on a a spoiler again you know listeners close your ears for a second if you haven't caught all way out but\nI really I I Love the way in which a GED starts out the show as a kind of authority on moral behavior but little by little you start to realize that in fact all of his moral knowledge hasn't or help them to be\nA morally good person and in fact it seems as though at certain points it's actually being in the way because he thinks too much over analyzes see as experiences moral dumb founding and and and so in fact the oldest moral philosophy isn't any good for us Marley so I I was really curious whether\nAny of that uh you know is is is part of your thinking or maybe part of your experience around marvelous though\nUh it was something that you talked about ah with Mike or um or did he just pick it up by himself", "year": "2018",
