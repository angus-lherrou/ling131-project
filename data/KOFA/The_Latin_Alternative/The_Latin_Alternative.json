the different jam sessions reflect the individuality of the different musicians who respectively lead them it was a time in the Nineteen fifties when the music was evolving everyday in Havana everyday woke up to a different rhythm\nAnd the musicians they prided themselves on always inventing and competing to create new with them they were of course influenced by the dads out on guard in the United
