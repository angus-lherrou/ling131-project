singer Warren Haynes is founding member of government you will plays with the Allman brothers\nOne of the biggest lessons I've taken from listening to the music is or how to\nSnatch up the spontaneity when it's their window creative juices are flowing ... kind of go with it and see what happens and don't be scared to leave a lot of the rough edges because that's what makes the music\nSpecial its own way you know you start changing everything that you're not perfect and music and you wind up with music so the one of the lessons\nTo learn from from sly which was also a lesson to be learned from James Brown is\nIf the the musicians making music or great musicians than their first impression is going to be quite amazing it if there is some mistakes and blemishes that go along with that the kids second guess it you got to let that be part of it because a lot of times that's\nWhat makes it even\nYeah well when I say now they're around that day I'll pay by the\nDo and then we'll know may say yeah\nTo bail me\nOut\nHow about\n... they meant by ran in ... how\nDo\nSee again I don't know how\nSpending really on\nSpain had\nYour mom and dad and\nMy\nPlan how to find out when you know\nHow

and there was always this great music kind of like come over they have this amazing how I'm I'm from just dreaming about it because it was you know Nineteen sixty nine but it seemed to me they had like a volcano rock problem in the front and all kinds of stuff going on anyway there was this music coming out there and\nLater on when I found out that that was lost music\nHe arranged many it's like ... for the nineties and Tio\nYou go on a YouTube when you find those first TV appearances where do you have like three and a half minutes and in that three and a half minutes you'd ever intro\nBut that was referred to one song and then they do maybe four or five songs and ... with key changes on everything and you know it was a lot of harm and going on in the interesting thing is not as if\nYou know if you start really appreciating music you know that's associate with rock and roll 'cause his music really had no the gospel thing in the wrong thing and the Jesse\nYou mean like a simple song when both my mind is um everybody's a star because has what I think it's pretty pretty neat [noise] aggression which is very rare to find\nA pop music girls seem\nTo be said to myself\nSuffering to new ... will harm is very unique and then when it goes in and of course is amazing to me when I'm aware of solitaire what it'd\nBe better and it's a flat and then you\nI Can't stand about many songs Muslims or just a variation of\nOne especially in rock and roll racial one for fun\nI Can't say that menthol most malls or just a variation of more especially in rock and roll

wanted the name to be known by the public as if she was I don't know whatever\nKind of you know Brazil do that sort of nickname ... but that's not what a mental health I don't want to go in for\nIt

a swing and if they want it to make some money by having bad\nThat they had to have this integrated ensemble but I'm sure it was a huge challenge you know the first Hollywood film is banned made was the big broadcast of Nineteen thirty seven\nWhich was filmed in Nineteen thirty six and they want it to put the trio when there but they want a government to put his white piano player on the screen and just have to be playing in the background the government said no you can't have the trio so the band appeared in the film but not be integrated trio when we went back to Hollywood the next year\nFor Hollywood Hotel he was already such a big star that he said if you don't take the quartet which now had two black musicians and two white musicians\nThan you can't have the band and we're not going to placing sing sing and this and that so he was able to have that in that scene from Hollywood Hotel what the court tat really should be an all the film history books because it's the first time that you had to black people into white people in uh Hollywood Warner Brothers movie as total equals\nI mean there's not even the slightest ... of the endemic racism of any other thing of inter

showed the film down south they could take that clip out and it wasn't part of the story\nBut nonetheless no I think was a tremendous thing that they did in those days and there was only because of

Wilson\nBecause they're the ones who couldn't stay in the hotel and they're the ones that probably other stay on the bus and they're the ones that can use the men's room and and all that kind of stuff which makes the which makes the music that they made all the more of a trial\nAnd I think the one we listen to the music we have to be aware of what the reality was at that time than it has to be

Carnegie Hall I mean various jazz artists in the black performers bans have been part of various things that garden evil\nBefore January thirty eight but haven't out and out jazz concert was quite a thing because America was still in the walls of it's tremendous cultural insecurity and in doing that somehow this\nEuropean based music played on the concert hall where people sit like they're in

nonetheless it was a tremendous country that was recorded of course the recording came out and buy a dozen years later\nAnd I think it was really the peak of that first part of Benny Goodman is career you know he invited for this big valedictorian cartridges invited the Goodman banding by the people from the base the band\nSo it was good with the height of his fame showcasing people who did what he
