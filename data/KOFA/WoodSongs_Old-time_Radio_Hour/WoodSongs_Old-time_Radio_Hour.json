and\n... this is an amazing form of music not necessarily lending itself to Vogel so how do you how do you how do you get to interpret this as a as an artist cars that you are brilliant or about to find out how brilliant you are but but lending the human voice to music like that's not an easy thing to\nDo well and during that she had to think of myself as a part of the band you know and it's not just talk to the band and you know so there isn't guitar and this is really who I Am on the band member so that's how I think that you know well whereabouts or find out a Paul or a\nThat you are you did that when you were in Paris\nRight you went up to what you did your soda and you did the uh busking thing you'd be played on on the streets now that's something that a Django did as well he had in his early years is so so I mean what was that like for you as an artist performing\nBut and you know so there isn't guitar and this is really who I Am on the band member so that's how I think that you know well we're about to find out Nepal or a\nWhen you [laughter]\nThat you are you did it when you were in Paris\nRight he went on and we did your soda and you did the busking thing you'll be played on on the streets that's something that Django did as well he had in his early years or so\nSo I mean what was that like for you as an artist performing in the streets of Paris kind of a romantic sending me yeah I I Am kind of a hopeless romantic but what was really funny about it I had a ...\nAnd I'm a lot of people took my picture and then they would come up to me and say excuse anymore\n... blue photograph bay she's it okay and I would do my best French impersonation ago [noise] [noise]\nI made so much money can people think that I was French planes yeah\nSo it was the beginning of you know you're you're saying the cheetahs speaking French is to sound annoyed that how that works if you saw the movie sweetened loaded on there was a character an actor that\nPlay Django Reinhardt and that was the one I don't want I don't want French folks listening to us on American forces ready to be upset the beautiful language survivor Leo\nAnd and and is value a growing up in France where are you familiar with the music of Django when as a young\nGirl not so much actually I came to Django after learning about jazz which is kinda weird that um [noise]\nYou know I was growing up in France and listening to French radio and there wasn't much Django Reinhardt undifferentiated even at the time and he really\nHad his second term to feign a and the year two thousand where I'm a French hop artist sort of an hurts and an hurts yet what you see what any and uh and brought it back to the public actually well\nIn recent the ... the last Twenty years a lot of his music has been used in motion pictures which is another way of of introducing his his music to the\nTo the public but I don't think his back story is really well known Paul I mean the whole idea of the other being so severely handicapped and us being in being almost superhuman on a trip board right I mean that\nThat that is as as brilliant a part of his his aura as the music itself yeah superhuman that's it that's all you need to know that's that's all we're going to talk about\nThat's fine so we're going to get back to Isabella here you have a wonderful CD coal live at your she's where a lot of this music is

incredible singer songwriter from Nashville to introduce to you and amazing would songs kid\nFirst up we're going to dip into some genuine American music history\nAs based here in Kentucky it's the sounds of jug band jug band started at the turn of the century became very popular around Louisville, Kentucky and continues but you have heard the sound in popular music it start in the Nineteen sixties with the sound of a great group called the loving spoonful John Sebastian and\nHis drug ban well day for a day during\nThe dream and no and written\nLong ago Jerry had a huge what the judge sound sound summertime\nMy great music great sound coming from a historic kind\nThese guys carry on that tradition we are very very proud that they could be here we're going to talk to them about jug band music and what it means to Americana an American music they're going to do a tune from a brand new album is called jugs up this is called washed board man please welcome from Louisville, Kentucky the juggernaut jug band on the song\n[noise]\n\n\nPlay ball with their lives on his hands grains around the time and often it's kind of music saying\nTo hear that ... man\n\n\nYour neighbor thing is due to the hospital\n[noise]\n\n\n\nMm Mm\n\n\nTell you to take a long time\nBad news makes you feel just fine\nLives do real smart man\n\n\n\n\nThe the odd thing is that you actually accomplish did you superseded all the expectations in you became a big success\nSo you're driving\nIs supposed to talk about the the L and Jackson cut because a lot of times a lot of times um you write a song an artist likes it and they kind of put a hold on it for a while yeah that is sort of precludes another artist from recording it so you had an artist technically put a hold on on a song\nThat came to Ellen Jackson's attention told\nMe how that happened that sound was actually on hold for two other artists for the year proceeding when Alan heard it I had a a publisher at the time who played it for Allen's producer and he put it on hold his for another artist at first but it turned out they weren't sure about the timeline for that album and what was going to go on\nSo he goes out to lunch with Allen one day and said I got a song I Would love to play for you only get back to the office in\nAllen really liked it and the other artists was gracious enough to say you know what I don't know exactly when it's going to be cutting so I don't want her to miss that but that was a song Monday\nOffice in Allen really liked it and the other artists was gracious enough to say you know what I don't know exactly when it's going to be cutting so I don't want her to miss that\nWhen I was a song Monday morning church ... beautiful beautifully written\n[noise]\nWaiting for something that you knew that there were art is interested in the song and you're waiting and waiting and you it was a killing\n'em know again I didn't really know anything at that point in time Alan actually ended up hanging out on spring break my senior year in college\nThat tell me about the first time you heard it you're you're probably in your car like everybody else and listening to the radio\nIs actually a dairy Overton at him I was kind enough he got a copy of it because he's worked with Allen for years and he's kind enough to invite me and to hear that cut and you know it's really it's a strange thing it's almost like\nYou're watching a TV show or maybe somebody hooked up a computer and ran ears song through it and made it sound like somebody else it was it was really amazing\nWhat about the first time you heard it on the radio you heard Allen singing your song on the radio\nWell I I don't know if he's seen a movie called a thing called love but it was about like that\nI'm driving down music row and heard it and\nWe were actually on music growing her yeah wow the talk of the serendipity those stores were lining up for you that I\nSaid another claim to fame that you had and this is kind of important in Kentucky and all because he was the voice of Kentucky tourism now but you were a Chris Stapleton upstairs neighbor I was yeah so so what was that like he must have been a interesting uh fill a dancer probably singing and working all the time really helped me carrying a wardrobe upstairs nice guy\n[laughter] so what let's talk about the changes in the music business because I mean the last ten years has really\nAffected the ... not the music and the musician so much because they're still there and they're still passionate and they're still working and trying but the music industry itself has really changed music row has really changed it's interesting\nAh you know there are good things and bad things about it it's you know technology is changing so fast\nYou know I think about my granny growing up she didn't even have a radio when she was born and are what all we can do today and it's really amazing to think about all the innovation that's happened and I to me I think it's a good thing because I think there's a lot of possibilities for independent artists that maybe weren't there before\nAnd you you have a lot of independent nature in your career and so I mean you're getting major cuts with with important artist but but you are a singer songwriter that also views yourself as an artist as as one of those performers\nThat's what I moved to Nashville for I\nI really I started writing songs to have things to saying and I'm I think I was lucky in that way because maybe I didn't know who are thinking when I was trying to write I just tried to write something I Love that I'm\nKind of fell into it so now you have a you you have the series of of\nSingles that you sort of releasing on your own one of the time told me about that don't tell me what you're doing there\nBut I put out an album last fall called wiki town crier that I'm really proud of Jamie Johnson and Jim is brown communities did not say that I was a kid in the country music candy store get to do that I got to have all my favorite players into play got some friends of mine a critic came in saying on a couple of songs and rainy Hauser and Ricky Skaggs\nI was just a really special experience and then since then I've been recording some\nKind of one off more acoustic bass songs or just because you know as an artist it takes a long time to do an album that you want to have something new and fresh you want some fresh baked cookies out there and share with your audience will\nJackson even set in one of the songs lordy don't the wheels turn slow and hey let's say that it is true and it takes a lot of uh there's a lot of work being patient through the through the process but speaking of whiskey town crier which is great\nIt takes a lot of uh there's a lot of work being patient\nThrough the through the process but speaking of whiskey tell cry which is a great great title because that's that's what they used to call people who shouted out the news yes back in the ... is that how you view this album is sort of like a ... claiming in the news or on a state of a community\nYeah it's actually it's a theme to record and so it's basically supposed to be an auditory newspaper for a small town and I'm really big into characters and stories on so each one of these songs could be a little a article\nIn the local paper a lot of places that we can recommend living things that are really bad like well a heartache\nSo pretty good these days so now you've got this beautiful album is called whiskey tell cry or you're going to dip into that album for this particular song is called ... just like a cowboys Aaron enderlin on the song soul tired\n[noise]\nThere were days it did\nDidn't know\nI Love you know\nDied my knees redone\nBoots word in the kitchen ... this\nIs a\nAnd then he you know many times these ...\nHill bull\n... you are huh\nThey all those pretty big no ...\n\n\nRelated ...\nMm Mm\nMm Mm\nMm not been in those\nHe ...\nHe loves the

record label that introduced\nSo much incredible music to the world back in the early Nineteen fifties about uh about Nineteen fifty one a young Nineteen year old kid named I\nCharter this was before Nineteen I\nCame to the Memphis recording studio to record record\nAnd it was called a rocket eighty eight [noise]\nAnd the studio put it out under the name of its own record label\nAnd it became a huge number one hit and this is rocket eighty a\n\n\nAnd that wasn't the only Nineteen year old kid that came across the attention of Sam Philips the owner of the Memphis recording studio you know this one\n\n\nAnd this became a massive massive record for them\nThey introduced artists like Johnny Cash and Roy harbor sin and and Carl Perkins in so many others and that is what this show is about there is a new album out\nCalled the red hot it is a celebration of this amazing record label called son records we've got these four beautifully amazing artist on their own right here to help us\nOr

her a shot showing camp is on the lam and a really cool to a a sort of is the selection of artists all kinds of related to Memphis the current in contemporary a kind of tackling that material I and I\nI thought it was a cool selection of material there's some really well known stuff but there's also some some pretty obscure stuff on there too which I thought was cool to sort of represent\nAnd giving props were props or do we know who Luther is a camera as a a is a true a patriot of of a mini artist she supported guy Clark\nOr working heavily with Chris christopherson right now and she's really supported the legacy of many artist so the idea of her working on the tribute to sun records of certainly appropriate for her\n[noise] and I and I\nIt and so you're you're taught to tell me about your interest in the Memphis Sound in ... as an artist your interest in the Memphis Sound you're interested in the music that Sam Philips brought forward or through the vehicle of sun records or is this something you were interested in is a little kid or does come out yeah\nI mean I wasn't fully aware of what's on records was when I was a kid I was familiar with some of the music but it wasn't until I was you know a teenager that I and I was playing music already that are sort of study did and dug in and started realizing this was all under one sort of umbrella you know the stuff that\nTom tell me about your interest in the Memphis Sound in ... as an artist your interest in the Memphis Sound you're interested in the music that Sam Philips brought forward or through the vehicle of sun records or is this something you were interested in this little kid or does\nCome out yeah I mean I I wasn't fully aware of what's on records was when I was a kid I was familiar with some of the music but it wasn't until I was\nYou know a teenager and I was playing music already that I've sort of study to Doug in and started realizing this was all under one sort of umbrella you know the stuff that I heard was vaguely aware of it as a child\nI became obsessed with and then when I realized it was all one thing I was like oh wow I'm not\nCompletely completely changed my whole way of saying about music like it does for anybody that really delves into that catalog but um that was a before I ever moved in Memphis and then I moved here about twelve Thirteen Years ago and uh\nI'm just really got to be a full time student Memphis music and get to be immersed in it and an around some of the people that made it and it's just been a real uh\nUh it's been an amazing sort of experience as a musician living there and soaking up the Memphis things kind of being an outsider but now can totally considering you know I'm you know but ah yeah it's a and the ... the Memphis Sound is so broad you know you talk about another sound but there's more than one son records is one thing that ... stacks records Iraqis are to\nYou know there's the the there there's not a Memphis down there are meant the sounds you\nKnow well and here we are celebrating one of those sounds as as delivered by Sam Philips and has a record label son record Amy you worked at son record as as a tour guide let's talk about the recording studio room where all of this magic happened Roy orbits and Johnny Cash\nJerry Lee Lewis a course Elvis recorded his stuff there's not a big room\nNotice this stage might need bigger than the actual tracking round one car garage really radiator shot it was the radiation [laughter] small\nIt has these uh white acoustic tiles I'm a raw and for whatever its best is that this child on the front and the ceiling or Israel odd it had to fill that hole peaks and valleys all along with half of the room like\nHelp to sound in there and then one big glass window and family ... looking through the window with the band\nAnd the way was the way the room was portrayed in and walk the line which you were part of the motion picture and one of the actresses and in that that movie that was a very accurate portrayal of of the room and the way Sam Phillips work with the artists\nAnd why they actually and I actually knew senator set\nBuilders and they built it\nPretty they'd built a whole nother studio down main street meant they were the storefront to look just like it inside their advocates say the owner is signed with respect for the people that come from all over the world\nTo the sun city out that he didn't want to credit to the public\nFilming said they had to build the\nThey had to build their own\nWe had to record the sun sessions at night after seven after they've finished the tours through so we did the daytime so she's been operating studio\nAnd I have only at night do they do they have the do they have the same\nRecording board that they had the old arc deal to this whole new stuff yeah yeah all staff knew all\nHave the actual\nThe actual game they do actually have one of the portable recording devices that seem to go around and make field according to British added that to me again and it's really cool things in the studio knew all\nThe actual console that same ad is at the rock console museum\n... operating studio at night but only at night do they do they have to do they have the same recording board that they had the old dark the old so this whole new stuff yeah ... yeah staff knew all they don't have the actual\nThe actual yeah they do actually have one of the portable recording devices that can you to go around and make field according to bring it back in the mean ... that's really cool things in the studio\nKnew all the actual console that same ad is at the rock and roll museum\nThat they actual it still exists is just just not they're not operators amazing I give props were props is due again I mean it's amazing how good those records sound even today on the modern sound systems with the gear that they had to record back then\nSo it's a combination of really great songs really great musicians and Sam's ears and the engineers that he\nHe worked with well it's a it's an album that does a fitting tribute to that legacy it's called red hot it's a tribute to Sam Philips and the music of sun records and we're going to turn our attention to John Paul ... this is a tune called the red Cadillac and black moustache right here on the woods songs old time\n\nAh then no one alone

Burgess back there are [noise]\nThe artist for grandma voice Smith gratified to have you here for our we overlaid to ...\nWhat an amazing projects that are that in a ... this this era of America's history someone would turn their attention back to this incredibly dramatic time in American history so where where did your interest in the depression era and the dust bowl I'm situation in America\nWho was actually kind of an accident I was running its own one day and you know I'm sure you're a songwriter much of a song writers and you just throw out ideas and I just had this idea for a song that\nEventually turned it into something that sounded like it was about a drought and I thought well that's I got changed that because no one wants to hear some of the drought but\nNo matter what I tried I could not change that I had to have those words and so I thought well there was a big drought one time what was that I went on the Internet and I sat there for seven hours\nFor burst in the first five minutes refreshing whatever I learned in school which wasn't much and then I expanded my knowledge I over the next two three years it took me to write the album and like I could write a book about the death toll now but it it really opened my eyes when I read and listen to interviews of survivors that they take their record on film in the Nineteen seventies I was just amazed\nWell it it it is truly one of the most dramatic moments in American history especially what happened to its own\nIts own people I mean you know Woody Guthrie which you know he made his name uh supporting the poor people of the dust bowl era but he was from there he was from Oklahoma eat at home and you were born in Jacksonville and you ...\nThree years it took me to write the album and I think I could

amazed\n[noise] well it it it it is truly one of the most dramatic moments in American history especially what happened to its own its own people I mean you know Woody Guthrie which you know he made his name was supporting the poor people of the dust bowl era but he was from there he was from Oklahoma City bombing\nYou were born in Jacksonville and you kind of moved up north to Rhode Island and and you've been like all over the place having you having you interpret this is really kind of a neat thing because you're really opening your\nAnd you took your time on this album he spent almost three years putting it together I made it twice\nI recorded at once and threw it all away and start all over again so what why why wouldn't you throw it away it wasn't good enough well that would be a good reason and\nI didn't have that song I just played just now I didn't have that one yet or the other one another one that will still I'm caught in my ... my prime pronouncing that right you can't pronounce it right because the the Choctaw people by the way they taught me how to say how do you say how do you say ... but they use L H A T H like\nThey use our alphabet because they never did have a written so let's let's give them ... to properly again astronomical\nMeans have strengthened the Choctaw language and I actually I knew a friend of mine said you've got to write a song about the Native Americans during the dust bowl\nThis was after I threw in the first version of the record and I said oh man you're exactly right but I don't know how to write such a song because I'm not a Native American idol\nI think if I Want to just wouldn't be true enough so I contacted after I realized the Choctaw were the first of the five tribes marched and the trail of tears a hundred years before the dust bowl I contacted the Choctaw tribe and they helped me so much right the song I have to give them a giant thank you and\nThey deserve a lot of credit well it's nice that you are\nSo you are you do this and you put the put the album out I mean\nWas it trying to get audiences especially young kids today are not there may not be really aware of the dust bowl or what was happening in America at that time so this is like a whole education thing\nGoing is actually created a one man show or have a twelve foot video screen behind me I've got hundreds of the pictures that were taken back then and I did it for the high school in Bakersfield, California about seven months ago and I couldn't believe I had some some kids now they're just kids understand they haven't learned about it yet but they live in ...\nTheir whole lives and they came up to me a couple of them and said how come you're how come you mentioned Bakersfield a few times in these songs we don't get it so there there's a lot that needs to be I think informed hearing\nWelcome Bakersfield was the site of a lot of the grows that supposedly advertised for workers and and your hands up thousands of people from
