against any non white group\nUm and people have a non Christian faith and immigrants and it was a real threat because in the south they um\nHad a lot of lynchings so people didn't live in fear of them because they were unpredictable and you didn't know what was going to happen next\nAnd so there's a lot of research that went into this I it took about three years for me to write for\nThree years so the racism angles came from your family and I would assume also the musicians you interviewed\nYes and then there were documented documentation to stories in the newspapers and other um local um that journals historical Karen ...\nEspecially the media of the times you've got you've got several different things that are ... bring this story out\nYes and then my ... and Dan Wakefield he attended the same high school as I did I like about Twenty years earlier than me and he became famous author\nYes I see his book is called going all the way\nYes and he's written numerous books and several um then my reward winning books and show he\nAdvised me on documenting many aspects of a book and especially that racist\nOh okay very good very good and he is a generation I had a view or so as you say did his book deal with music or what was his topper\nNo his deal with like life and times of young men coming of age like I'm\nGoing all the ways like a coming of age story in Indianapolis and he's written other books\nI'm telling you yeah was he dealing with the African American experience\nNo no he's a white and um but he's always wanting to pat balance stories and history treat\nTheir that he

Larry Larry ... he's a retired Rutgers professor of jazz and so for three years we spoke on the phone about Indiana avenue and indeed to document the music and the history because he\nKept saying well Indiana avenue didn't do those spending like other cities like Kansas City Orleans in Chicago and Harlem and so you know when somebody tells a writer but it's something is not documented it's like well tell me more\nHonestly honestly learning Ridley he's a professor as you say it in a university or isn't he also a bassist\nYes he's a jazz bassist and he's he's still performing in New York City\nGoes well he should I I I think I saw him I think I saw him with Billy Taylor in the seventies or eighties somewhere in there I think another slide Hampton man that guy there was a guy\nYeah and he's in his eighties said he still performing and he still composing [laughter] oh he's a greater ranger too in history\nYeah he's a\nVery humble man and he just loves to\nPerform and make people happy and so he he he\nWas an artist in residence at least ten different universities around the world no kidding\nWell it really doesn't surprise me\nYeah in Germany and Amsterdam Paris\nAnd he took his family overseas with being some time and so on and then there's David Baker who was born and raised in Indianapolis and attended Christmas addicts high school\nAnd then later went on to a Indiana University and started the stars are almost for jazz music program prior to that there were there wasn't a\nAcademic curriculum for jazz and people kind of look down on it and Nate stereotypes about jazz players as being unreliable or\nAlcoholics to drug addict so he you know at a respect to it and added standards\nAnd not only did each each it Indiana University he had conferences\nInternational conferences around the world that he ... thousand\nSongs and his name is David David Becker\nYet David Baker yes\nThen people are familiar with strategy covered and uh Jay Jay Johnson and then and Wes Montgomery and I was told by a kid he felt sick\nAnd in and and Wes Montgomery [noise] and I was told by a kid he felt that he has to work with age rich water in Europe\nThat when she introduced Chanin says that each from Indianapolis that the European audience just chant India\nWow isn't that great to be appreciated by another country maybe more so than here\nYes and then they start painting
