that I was going to do for a living and I want to play basketball and so I Want to go to college and play ball and do all that kind of stuff and then I started ganging probably like when I was like sixteen Seventeen around that start to interfere with basketball my senior year too so I didn't play my senior year\nAnd then that's why I really started getting to the idea of weight I'm not going to go to college to play ball but I can go to college for music\nThat kind of when I really started falling into the ideas being professional thing that I wanted to be a jazz singer\nLike so many of those are my predecessors and the people that\nIndirectly indirectly spoken to who I Am the arts\nOf uh from my predecessors and the people that\nIndirectly indirectly spoken to who I Am as artists like it was one I wanted to be a jazz singer like Nat King Cole right that's where I Am cook one and that's what Ray Charles wanted us with Marvin Gaye morning [noise] and eventually\nHe and the other individuals [noise] you know find my own voice I think I'm getting closer to really finding out who I Am\nVocally barring from a lot\nMost of the things I'm doing my life right now I never really was

and I was doing artist who had an influence on me\nAnd the approach was to treat them as if they were a college course and I was getting my doctorate and then so I was like really wanted to study um so it's like Ray Charles and Otis Redding Sam Cooke and Marvin Gaye\nAnd then for some reason around that same time I was getting into Johnny Cash and I was like I Love 'em as a writer\nI can echo Johnny Cash on so many different levels especially on a spirit from the spiritual side and alert the him that he did with ... brothers and the ... like me I'm going to do Johnny Cash show so when I did the show [noise]\nYou know I always try to stay true as I could to the way that the artist performed it from for the most part\nWhich is easy for the other stuff 'cause a lot of it was already in my voice [noise] now I Do a decent Johnny Cash but the problem is that unlike the other artist that I mentioned his voice was lower than mine so there was a part in the show where it was walk the line with keeps modulating [noise]\nAnd I was like I cannot go down\nLike I Can't what am I going to do so literally in the show I was like [noise] you know anybody remember the show's fiancee crossroads would be like yeah yeah like well you know it wouldn't be so cool to do cross roads were Johnny Cash I Wonder what would it sound like if I if we did that well let's find out tonight\nSo to get around\nThe lower modulation I Would just seeing it the octave up in my own voice\nSo someone came up to me after the show and they said I Love the show everything was great my favorite part is when you saying Johnny Cash and your own\nVoice I Would love to hear you do a whole show or an album would you just named Johnny Cash in your voice yeah so for this entire record the keys are the same as Johnny ... the only thing I did is I changed the field and I think it up to active [noise]\nDon't do ... I don't do I just like and really it really helped me\nMy voice in a deeper sense of who I Am as a vocalist because it wasn't there is no comparison about saying Marvin Gaye this comparison yeah if I if I Would do that Sam Cooke record our Nat King Cole record their comparison because so much of the pallet of\nMy voice is made up of those colors [noise]\nWhen I say the Johnny Cash there's nothing compared to 'cause I Can't think of like him\nSo truly I had to get like myself\nHere's more from Brian and one's in the deacons of all live on ... street care they and\nOne from my solar cash records [noise]\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Beale Street Caravan", "city": "Yuma", "day": "12", "locations": [["Prescott", 34.54002, -112.4685], ["Memphis", 35.14953, -90.04898], ["Grammy", 39.66956, -75.82799], ["Memphis Tennessee", 35.14953, -90.04898], ["Cleary", -76.45, 161.96667], ["Overland Park", 38.98223, -94.67079], ["New Orleans", 29.95465, -90.07507], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Ferguson", -54.78333, -35.83333], ["Missouri", 38.63162, -90.24925], ["Galveston", 29.30135, -94.7977], ["Cody", 47.43727, -73.56791], ["Galveston", 29.30135, -94.7977], ["Russia", 60.0, 100.0], ["Galveston", 29.30135, -94.7977], ["New Orleans", 29.95465, -90.07507], ["Memphis", 35.14953, -90.04898], ["Louisiana", 30.12595, -92.00939], ["Dallas", 32.78306, -96.80667], ["Dallas", 32.78306, -96.80667], ["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["Iran", 32.0, 53.0], ["St Louis", 16.01793, -16.48962]], "not_found": [], "ep_coords": ["Yuma, AZ", 32.72532, -114.6244], "in_country": ["Prescott", "Memphis", "Grammy", "Memphis Tennessee", "Overland Park", "New Orleans", "U.S", "Missouri", "Galveston", "Galveston", "Galveston", "New Orleans", "Memphis", "Louisiana", "Dallas", "Dallas", "Arizona"], "out_country": ["Cleary", "Ferguson", "Cody", "Russia", "Iran", "St Louis"], "in_state": ["Prescott", "Arizona"], "out_state": ["Memphis", "Grammy", "Memphis Tennessee", "Cleary", "Overland Park", "New Orleans", "U.S", "Ferguson", "Missouri", "Galveston", "Cody", "Galveston", "Russia", "Galveston", "New Orleans", "Memphis", "Louisiana", "Dallas", "Dallas", "Iran", "St Louis"]}, {"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KOFA", "content": "Eighty nine point five FM McKay Jay Z a Drake Williams Ninety point one of them cage easy Pete Prescott Ninety point seven F.
