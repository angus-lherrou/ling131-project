I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a legal case\nWell it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal\nCase this case it's it's um like my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away it it gets under your skin this is Lisa ... I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nAt the Columbia school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she sat down not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna feral who brought us this story and under whose skin it also seems to have gotten yeah\nIt it just made me\nNot know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nSearching Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist some newspaper guy for the post ... he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think there is and he's he's been so focused on the Internet it's pretty close down for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the Adirondacks which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people do they tend to twenty three three men and women go camping in the Adirondacks pulled off the road a aside wrote off route thirty they made up of ...\nThree men and a woman go camping in the Adirondacks pulled off the road a aside wrote off route thirty they made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up too tense and went to sleep for the night\nAnd then Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM\nTo campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they saw was his middle aged men peering into the tent\nLooked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on it sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he got the\nOther campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing in semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen uh of killed before and I'll kill again I'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods\nTook them into the woods near brook in pairs of two with him behind them are the kids of course we're scared out of their wits he pulled out some real ups basically he had he had each them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun at him and then the last one he type so after we had the four people tied he went back to\nThe first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski and because the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled voice\nGet really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happening to him\nWhat was happening with the man stabbing don't believe ski with his back and I\nUsed to have been five times in a cat\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running Nick ... ran to his car Carol Ann ... ran through the woods [noise]\nBut the man caught one of them David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had them lay down in a ditch next to\nTo kind of monitor the situation I guess\nSo Freeman in um the killer laying in the dead chapter then our men come\nMen that the other two camps are the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert\nLocals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted done a killer and Freeman laying\nDown in the ... when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun and he's going to shoot\nAnd the manner the gun get kind of stood up\nCalmly a coolly walked into the forest and us began what was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road as you can see when the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies and state police standing by it was the scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down on manpower into a roving patrols men\nArmed with with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods\nThey eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and they come back with an id have\nThirty seven year old Robert Darrow Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York as a fugitive police are looking forward today he was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape seven years\nNow armed with a thirty thirty rifle a knife and the story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday to feel at night when the people got panic when you're all are well one of the\nDoors are short of our people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving round here but people left the area so fast I don't care that lasts\nA short of art people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fast I don't care that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they love\nBarbeque smoldering they left behind coolers so as a man has dragged on what happened was Carol was able to use those camps and that food and those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men now\nThe police follow her lead that he had stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on him\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest summer\nThat day a conservation officer named ... spotted Guerra\nDeep freeze or drop your gun something to that effect and Carol started running\nLow block fire four times got 'em in the back\nThe arm in the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but they took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\n\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with him there and the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing but he wouldn't talk and it's at this point\nThat the story that I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this law professor release alarm and again is\nThe conflict between what a good lawyers should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording it so the guy at the center of the conflict was a man named\nFrank our money frankly each arm many Brenda the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or urban that Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use it or even a but it is or money\nA couple of months ago pretty through Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York the Germany now in his eighties he's retired\n[noise] my name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert girl\nUm where I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like ... how did this whole story start for you well were there just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk away\nThe Pfizer I like ... flights go fights like standing up for the little guy and that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for or defend it you're fighting the state and tear it\nAnd he was doing really well he was well respected had a good reputation but then he met Robert De Niro\nYeah life you're strong to take him out you need a forty five and uh I just had the feeling that this guy is dangers and love of the things are going to happen\nThe car and we take off to go look for the bodies Guerra\nTold the lawyers that Susan pets was in an era event of a closed up mine shaft\nThe mine ... mine ... about an hour south of the hospital ... federal runners so in that moment where you scared were you excited like oh you're a ... it's a high but you're scared you're concerned yeah fear ... food\nIf you do in fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little that we thought we were being followed by the state police\nSo eventually they pull over get out of the car\nWent into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out\nFor about thirty minutes bells you talked to her ... her car\nAnd then we went up the back door [noise]\nTook of driving that lady friends car to try to lose the trails\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here\nWhich may be as far as we can walk up to the old abandoned mine [noise]\nI went out there last February with reporter Lauren my chemistry and Tom supervisor of ...\nI went out there last February with reporter Lauren that chemistry and towns supervisor of Mariah Tom's 'cause the father because it's on a road that goes to the mind it or what have you have to their minds [noise] it was then it's sort of hilly area off the side of the road is is a\nTrail of her own or you're just very icy that day this hair is used to be an overall [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hills fairly the there were no leaves and all the trees were\nAnd I'm Sorry skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are many and this is the only way they came in\nHere so right up here we are in our Sunday suits and rebuild tragedy choose for is looking for the\n[noise]\nYes but we're looking [noise]\nAnd then [noise]\nWe found this for ... well\nYou see the air shaft there they find that the air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off the carefully this or get any such thing yeah you don't want to fly down there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then they'll see how my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak the blue shoe and blue sneaker [noise]\nAnd and a leg I said to myself this bitch does it end he yelled back up to Belgium get me out of your boom ... backup do\n\nEventually they'll gee found the other body ... she was in a cemetery where Carol headset he left her but our money wasn't there when delta G founder so what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls ... yeah that play that out what what are your options sure so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor these are missing kids\nWere the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right no you can't\nYou just can't we took her to know to keep the confidence is over ... under the current rules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that is yeah it can be or we'll be\nRight so so in this situation the two girls are dead than there is no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up and even if they have hired detectives and even if local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's\nAnd and waking up when even if they have hired detectives and even if local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's no if if if people are already dead than you do the the lawyers [noise]\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is\nIs to to play this part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates\n... even if everybody hates you even if maybe you have yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person\nThat fight as hard as they can for the client the lawyer is the agent of his client only only the\nAgent of plant or also a citizen and a member of the ... and part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and family seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right because there are ... you're building on on the side of tell just tell tell\nOf course soon and I knew Mr hawk from bowling [noise] who's who's the de other daughter my daughter were in the same class and I knew him from church and\nWhen you have to be and then I'm On a few ... the parents of the family and yet you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\n\nSo now with this [noise] coming up that hard spot gets even harder [noise] we'll be right back [noise] [noise]\n\nHi this is worthy from Arlington, Texas radioactive supported

I'm I'm Ron I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab\nAnd now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right there was I knew this thing but it was a client was very guilty of something they had found the bodies of these two girls and a no brainer what is it what's their next move well so they decide that pretty bird plea bargain\nThat take this information to the prosecutor and say\nI have information that will help you solve some cases some cases yes and in exchange I Want you to give me a better deal for my clients\nTo get Guerra into a mental hospital instead of a prison Oso right away they are going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give her Lulu and you're going to take it a little\nWell that's kinda gross oh yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank's perspective he's got this information\nSpelled G started drinking heavily abandoned his law practice and moved to Florida or money toughed it out but he suffered a no one wanted him as a lawyer anymore or loosely well what else can I Do\nTo make a living he was just barely getting by for a little while I think the ... all over the stress and pressure\nTo choose to do\nIn fact he has a heart attack um while this is all going on but eventually\nThe criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and the state bar the Belgian our money\nDid was write what they did was good exactly\nAccording to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAt least it told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room most of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love feast\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that\nI don't go was here or there was a lawyer to do this job [noise]\nUh I mean I was a good lawyer\nWas I thought so art everybody um and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and bell gee did a good body is case\nIt's taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone\nWhat people think what if what if what if you will face\nSo I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham\nWhy don't you stand up um I agree um his duties to his client who represents his client's best interest if you've\nBeen sitting in on these classes and and talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely is because professors can point to that they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n...\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story\nI always wanted to talk to the families involved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing her mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on a phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nI'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm\nI'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nWho's been with the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing marching camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so it's sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that you knew the law schools were teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nUh 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical class is\nTotally and comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes it was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you did I Know that is maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they're trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal shot in their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um did did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes and only ... my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and uh\nWhen we were there sitting with the police men they received a policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call that Danny's my daughter's boyfriend what his body was found and that's that's\nAll we knew and we never really hadn't any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just\nGetting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was or some authority I Can't even remember who was um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later and in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my\nMy father as a matter of fact I even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how how important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a total Eli the lawyer\nMaybe he considered it to the ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband\nAnd causing us more months of horror and [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law schools\n[noise]\nSo anyway\nJust to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professors law students there um when they approach that says it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are\nThey're struggling with the pain they I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it and so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to\nCommunicate some of that experience\nWell it's impossible to really communicate and words\nBut you have a chance to communicate some of that um experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate more I made forty years later and skills\nI I get ... and it's a struggle to it because you don't ever go away as long as I Am so\nI don't I guess\n\nI'm Wondering what we've been talking a lot of I'm sad stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of that that you would want people to know that you would want to share I don't know you don't have to but\nWell\nWhat can I say she was she did receive her degree past my sleep I we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where was it difficult for us and down\nAnd Danny what's your boyfriend had bad just that summer and he had a full scholarship Herbert any uh graduated just before and so to live and I'm sure the other two children get great future\nHad a true and it's just a horrible tragedy\n\nIt's it's so horrible you know to be in the president's shoes\nTo live [noise] I mean how do you really lose your your daughter you know\nWhat what are the ... for you to protecting the person to kill her\nNo justification you couldn't just apply in my mind\nI don't expect him to accept it but that's the way it is\n\n\nUm I'm going to get to the minute of silence up here if that's okay you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Albany", "day": "29", "locations": [["Utica",

somebody\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Tom ... what's the warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com\nIs the one I saw the platforms of the major party candidates that were running and the words war and peace and poverty did not appear anywhere on any of those platforms and still do not appear even right here on this podium today that we're talking about middle class people working people we have forty four million Americans in this country living below the poverty line\nAnother fifty million living just added and nobody is speaking to them or nobody is speaking to the question of wages which have not grown relative to inflation in the last forty years and contract into one third of the part of GDP that they were forty years ago [noise]\nUh I majored in economics in college I think we have enough corporate lawyers in Congress and an all the halls of government today and I think\nPeople claim to vote on their pocketbook issues and if that's really the case then maybe voted for someone who's training is in economics is the way to go for at least one seat in Congress or this year\nWe're not being serious about pretending we care about lowering taxes if we're not lowering the one point five trillion dollars we're spending a fighting wars we're not serious about lowering crime and drug abuse and improving education\nUnless we're lowering the rate of poverty because the cost of not lowering them as much more expensive than the course of course\nA cost of addressing them ah I also want to talk about climate change because both parties are science deniers when it comes to the timeline that we have available to act\nA and most importantly I'm kind of\nHard hard to believe that people come here to talk about people getting too much corporate money when they're here themselves about seven billion dollars of corporate money so let's be serious about these things\nDie and Neal thank you guys so much for inviting me I really appreciate it really um unlike Antonio and John and even even Steve I'm I'm not a polished politician I Am not a lobbyist I Am not a lawyer\nI was not created by committee in some a dark room in DC by power brokers\nReally all I Am as a resident of New York Nineteen\nI'm your friend I'm your neighbor and I wanted to run because I thought how desperately we needed an advocate\n\nThe big corporations the big parties the big money all of those people they have a lot of advocates in DC they a lot of people fighting for them\nWe we don't and a lot of people are suffering because of it and the thing about New York Nineteen is friendly unique we saw the fission resilient\nWere independent minded people even her biggest voting bloc they're unaffiliated voters because that's who we are we don't buy into all this divisive stuff we decide who's backed and that's who we vote for\nWe don't like a division I don't like any of it the hysteria it doesn't help anything and it doesn't help I\nAnd in his life of a wide variety of experiences I have learned that everyone believes what they do for a reason into them it is a very important\nBut when we're fighting among each other and ourselves we can never figure out without raising it to work on a solution but that's not a problem that we have we're OK speaking to each other lifting to each other talking to each other\nIf you live in New York state Fifteen to twenty percent of your property taxes right now is going to public employee health insurance on the private market and both of their plans would continue that and drive there continue to drive their costs up and challenge the two percent tax cap enforce the firing of teachers um\nIt would you if you're if you're a producer twenty percent of your product costs is made up by your health care costs for your employees\nAnd that's why our products are not competitive on the global market anymore the world has moved on we need to ensure everybody we need to ensure the minute affordable cost for businesses and our property tax payers alike and we need to get started on that right away no more delays single payer Medicare for all\nThe same question Daniel\nThanks for asking there are a lot of false things that go around when it comes to like single payer universal health care or you know Medicaid for all\nAnd there's one basic thing that you can say and it's really easy to say when you're not taking money for any of his company basically health care should not be a for profit industry in many ways it does not make sense and people that profit off of illness and that should not be involved in the decision making profits as to whether or not we have health care it doesn't make any sense\nI'm not a big fan of Medicare for all although it's more efficient than most private health care insurance has [noise]\nBut [noise] there's a way that we can do that then again this is going to take people that aren't pot there are paid for that can just tell the truth they can sell it in a truthful late to both sides\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no joke no poll Doug harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog harness dot com\n... so small businesses right\nThey have so much trouble providing health care costs so much money they limit the amount of employees they have right they don't have to go over that threshold you make sure that we can provide that\nThey can expand their businesses people's hours are being held at a lower amount so they can't get those benefits they have more discretionary income or spending they can pump back into the community and we're spending all this money on it any way we subsidize everyone that works at Wal Mart's healthcare we sometimes almost everyone's health care we streamline that we take out the people that are profiting from us being ill\nIt's a system that feels to both conservative fiscally and an appeal to people on a more level where and when we both agree on it that's the only way we're going to get it done\nTime thank you Richard oh God Oh yes I like to point out how profoundly dishonest a congressman fives those\nUh characterization of my health care physician is and it's been pretty much laid bare by the fact that we have individuals on the stage you've made it clear\nSpeaks a lot about how one is not we'll just have a true debate on what I had been advocating now for for over a year and a half on a very consistent basis\nOr we don't have time for games here or we don't have time for misleading people people are dying and they want answers and they want answers now\nAnd I want you pass a public option now I Want to make sure that we are no longer the only developed country in the world without some form of universal healthcare a public option will do that it'll drive down premiums they don't drive down the ... it'll free up the cost for small business owners have to apply employer business employer based insurance and it'll also free up\nEmployees who often times people trapped\nOr where they work because of a fear that they might lose a kid that they want or there's currently receiving do other pieces to drive down costs I think it's absolutely critical was to make sure that Medicare has negotiating power with big pharma again keep in mind congressman ... never owners these words\nHe never said Medicare should have negotiating power with the farm and yet we all know that would go a long way\nAnd cutting down on these costs why not is it because he takes thousands and thousands of dollars a quarter pac money from big pharma I submit you\nYes we can't have the games here we can't mislead about our respective positions I've been clear my position for very long time let's just have a real debate on the facts\nRight now I'm going to address ... Greenfield with his third question your platform includes cutting one point five trillion dollars in military spending unquote avoiding international hostilities how would you practically accomplish either of these concepts elected\nOkay first of all I'm not proposing cutting one point five trillion I've explained that one point five trillion is the actual size of our current military budget and it's really important that we acknowledge that because of our discussion about military spending is drastically skewed by the seven hundred billion dollar figure that people toss out\nBut that figure is only the Pentagon budget and does not include that our nuclear arsenal was under the department of energy our international weapons transfers programs are in the department of states\nAre and that the legacy costs of operating a two hundred billion dollars a year and the Veterans Administration and that the entire homeland security party a a a homeland security department as part of the defense budget\nSo we have a budget of one point five trillion dollars okay the majority of that budget is is a capital budget and exist because of\nYou know the bases we have and about eighty countries and the active war operations that we have going on in the three major theaters in about a dozen more minor theaters so the first thing that I Would do to bring that under control is to just stop starting\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of perks or health systems providing orthopedic services in the Berkshires including ... robotic surgery sports medicine and anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero zero\nOur military budget is more than the next eight largest military budgets combined and six of those countries are our closest allies\nMilitary spending is the most inflationary form of spending and a government can can can enact other than simply printing money and had to get out to people and that in turn a forces us to use a um inflationary suppressing interest rates and things like that so yeah we're going to stop start in wars and\nA question do you favor more or less military spending over our current defense budget\nFor the interesting thing about military spending as it can be done in in a bunch of different ways obviously we need to be the care we need to be safe but there are a lot of things in our military spending that don't make any sense either so we have hyper expensive\nExpensive obsolete equipment things that take tens of billions of dollars to make over so long by the time they're actually in production we don't need them anymore\nAnd then we're doing things that aren't important like a lot of our servicemen and women many of which I'm related to don't even have the equipment they need or or the kind of best protection and a half to death by themselves which is also ridiculous\nSo I'm One of the things are there lots of different ways we can pay for that the largest employer on planet earth on the entire planet earth is the U.S department of defense I think the biggest employer planet earth\nAnd so one of the things that I've been thinking about doing for a long time it's a version of selective service it's civil education and employment where kids are from like Nineteen twenty three they can give back\nTo their communities and they can do it in a bunch of different ways they can do AmeriCorps they can Peace Corps meals on wheels which is a program that was a visceral rated by Trump recently or they can go into the military the police force\nThem which is the amount of extra bodies ever going to have who get the chance and its opportunity to travel around things were going to have a lot more investments in war is because everyone's going to be connected to someone that is actually going to go over there fighting and I can tell you that someone has to deal with that it's terrifying Everytime you watch the news [noise]\nSo we get that money back that's another way we can get some of the money back from the budget without actually cutting our efficiency in any sort of way\nAnd then at the same question to Antonio Delgado on military spending cutting are increasing\nYeah I think we've certainly um be gone a trend in the wrong direction on this tours are emphasizing militarization at the expense of actually making sure we allocate our resources to prop up our state department and make sure we do things more from a diplomatic perspective I mean we're spending probably what less than one percent right now\nI'm actually making sure that our diplomats are properly uh supported and do the work in a very\nA toxic world that we're living in a study came out a couple of years ago Pentagon study\nThat showed that I'm a hundred and twenty five billion dollars that's how much a bureaucratic waste that is right now in the department of defense a hundred and twenty five billion or there was almost a quarter of the budget and so the fact that we have a waste of that magnitude that is more than how much money we spend the department of education\nThat that's how much waste we have right now so it isn't important be militarily ready no doubt about it it's a dangerous world we live in\nBut at the same time we should be a lot smarter about how we focus on our money and the way we spend that money our futures conflicts not pass oriented conflicts we're still putting money in outdated modes of defense or we have cyber security issues to be thoughtful about we have\nThe fact that we're being attacked by Russia a you know being hacked into our systems what are we doing to actually make sure that our protection is no defense systems are modernized for this purpose and ultimately our strength is in our values and we got to keep in mind is not in our military\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no joke no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com\nThe military spending budget um has been under a sequester over the last eight years and that's the question has greatly hollowed out our readiness\nFact just last year we lost eighty three service members in training accidents that is on heard of we lost about twenty three\nIn military engagements the notion that our planes can fly forty percent of our planes cannot fly because of lack of spare parts that the after action report of the tragic naval accidents in the Pacific waters near Japan\nShowed that our sailors were not getting enough rest but that our ships were not important enough for repair and refunding and that we simply have hollowed out much many aspects of our military now there's no doubt\nThe solutions to the problems we face don't involve higher\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of Berkshire health systems providing orthopedic services in the Berkshires including ... robotic surgery sports medicine and anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero

dollars in our district alone he's against it he just doesn't understand what the problems are in upstate New York why people keep believing\nDo Greenfield same question do you believe Mr Dole got those rap lyrics are relevant to today's election\nNo I Do not and I really wish that this question we're more about whether both of their careers is corporate lawyers were relevant to this election because I think that's really what we need to be talking about because that's what the each of them would bring to the halls of Congress if they get elected\nI've been a musician all my life and I guess I'm considered non threatening enough as electoral forcing here that nobody's going back to examine\nMy recordings nor do I think there would be any purpose\nFor doing that but I invite everybody to go do that because it might actually help my career if that's what we're going to be bringing into the political arena um you know I I when I mentioned to my union officers I'm a junior officer myself when I mentioned to sort of higher ups in my union that one of my opponents worked for ah for akin Gump in New York they cast\nYou know they asked about the implications of that for for labor union people\nAnd I think that's the kind of question we need to be asking Antonio Delgado about I think we need to be asking Congress been ... about the corporations that he lobbied for during his lobbying career\nBut most of all what's troubling me is this mail I get every day that I Can't believe in mail my mailbox that shows blue eyed and blond women clutching their blonde children in dread fear of a black man who's come to their community [noise]\nScholar a Harvard lawyer and every day my mailbox is filled with things that my teenage daughters have to see about a scary black man who's a threat\nTo blond women and I am and since that my children had to be exposed to this and I actually asked congressman ... to renounce these advertisements right here and right now I [noise]\n\nCaution members of the audience a about this you\nGive us your word at the beginning that it would be at the beginning and the and\nThat's where it should stop please\nNielsen question I don't have any problem with like ... I mean the truth is everybody on the planet wants to be a musician here's Lee everybody everyone every actor wants to be a rock star who wants to be something and you work in the genre in which you are using that your medium that you're All right so if Antonio with the country singer\nThere'd be a lot of pickup trucks and broken heart that's the difference right so\nYou can't penalize them or that especially as other someone else that worked in the creative industry hum\nAnd anytime soon and ... as he was saying earlier to add to your experience as a human being I mean all of the things out of your qualifications to make it more well rounded person I think of all the things that people go after him before I'm On the board of these giant things I'm On the board of water keeper for many years and the board of the urban our partnership or fried education\nFor one point two million city school kids you all these different things that are paid Center for human rights\nThose are still more positive but they add to your experience as a human and I agree with the the other thing that is always very bothersome to me is that people think that you need to be a lawyer to be in Congress that somehow you can only legislative your actual or that's not true at all all you needed experience smart and you have to be literate because you need to read information you can make good decisions for the people\nAnd I'm really not okay with that more lobbyist lawyers being in Congress we have enough\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of perks or health systems providing orthopedic services in the Berkshires including ... robotic surgery sports medicine and anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero zero\nBefore we go and I want to reward or both or Antonio ... and John fast so an extra thirty seconds in rebuttal to what's going on here as far\nWell let me listen I I I'm the only thing I Would add I'm blessed and said ah\nThere's nothing in my music and I want to be clear about this um was denigrating to women or nothing in my music was denigrating to law enforcement and I can promise you nothing in my music when the anti American\nUm and I think it's unfortunate that uh individual have decided to drip lyrics out of their proper context to feed into divisiveness and hate a clear a that is my view those are my lyrics in terms of uplift ... an empowerment um and I am always going to be standing on what I Believe in\nKilling testing well let me be clear as well are those are not my advertisements those are done independently I have no control legally or otherwise over those advertisements and let me also say this\nI Would reject the vote of any person who would vote for me because they don't like Mr Delgado is race or any other reason\nLess vote on the issues and that's really where I stand and uh I just think that at the end of the day or if we want to talk about just store it meant an ad that are distorting look at what Nancy Pelosi and Mr Delgado are putting up against me\nThis question goes to John fast so during the debate over Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination you felt that Dr Christine and Christine Blasey Ford head credibility but you also said the allegation she may uncorroborated\nAnd quote apps and country proved that they should be no doubt unquote the capital or should be confirmed Senate Democrats however who read the FBI report before the final vote that it was anything but a comprehensive investigation do you stand by your public support for now Supreme Court justice vet Kavanaugh and if so why\nI I Do stand by my support for now justice Kavanaugh and I think that Senate Democrats or did not have a clean hands in this process they had the anonymous letter that came from Dr Ford\nFor six or seven weeks before they did anything with it um and then they leaked it\nAnd news media sources showed up in her classroom and that's how her identity became known a that was reprehensible to me the fact of the matter in this regard is that these were allegations from thirty six years ago and any allegations like this should be taken seriously and they should be reviewed and looked at and that's exactly what was done\nAnd what the Democrats did\nWas they turned our concepts of justice on their head\nWe're not in this country guilty until proven innocent\nWe're not in this country in the business of a condemning someone in convicting someone without corroboration without real evidence\nAnd we're not in this country or abandoning all of our concepts of fairness and rule of law and that's exactly what they did they try to destroy the character and the reputation in a political assassination of justice cabinet and it was very apparent when you when you watched it\nA Senator Feinstein Senator Schumer should be the ones to take the heat on this issue not Dr Ford not justice Kavanaugh and not anyone else they manipulated the process they abuse and undermine the rule of law and unfortunately they undermine confidence in our courts and I think it was an outrage and it remains and outrage in my mind\nSame subject Steve Greenfield\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of perks or health systems providing orthopedic services in the Berkshires including ... robotic surgery sports medicine and anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero zero\nAnd I have to bring fall to both of the major parties for what happens\nFirst of all it's important to remember that the allegations that Senator Feinstein had in her portfolio she had for many many months and she waited until the very last second to present them\nAnd the reason for that was that she wasn't simply trying to scuttle the Kavanaugh nomination she was trying to scuttle it at a time when there wouldn't be time for President Trump's denominator replacement while the Kurds said it was still sitting in an office and so she was not acting primarily out of concern for women\nBut in but primarily out of concern for blocking a nomination until after January and I think that was reprehensible because people are playing to their teams instead of playing to the interests of the American people not to the women that might have been victimized and will continue to be victimized because of what happened during these confirmation hearings but more importantly\nIt will always be very challenging to prove something that happens thirty six years ago especially when only the people in the room where the witnesses\nAre much more concerned that the vote went ahead and approve justice Kavanaugh when you've repeatedly lied under oath right now this month on television in the hearing room about things that he had written and and was directly lying about his past and his vocabulary\nUnder oath that should've been an immediate this qualifier and I believe for the first time in history we have a proven\nA perjure under oath now sitting and the highest court of the land I sure wish the more the conversation at focused on that\nThank you Diane nailed I had a lot more concerned than you know originally came out like his dad you know the FBI they do background checks and the vet people because the things that they look for like drug addiction and dad and gambling that and a fair things like that so people can be bought and paid for especially someone who is a lifetime appointment to the court\nSo you know my greatest concern before any of this came out was that you know for a couple of baseball tickets right he was going to go like yeah you want me to vote I mean that's an exaggeration but still [noise]\nAs far as the hearing\nI Am I was absolutely shamed by both parties and how they behave it was an absolute cost or you know poor Dr ... for for worst nightmare came to exactly what she protected was going to come through came true and at the same time and you know the and the Democrats just let it happen and the Republicans just\nInstead of letting things work out in a natural way it became just a display a science show it was a way for the increase faction led them to

national\nThere was a lot of ... and the press how many people do is be killed in the United states about why the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national

shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what would we react to is all anecdotal once in a while one of these things will catch fire and they arrive Jason Harris than double John and will become sort of a national story\nI personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trending one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply yeah the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part\nI said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police for an itself in the police\nDepartment it does on the local level however it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency it and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida in two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally\nBut everything that's done so far is incomplete\nYou know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database most of them rely on media reports so the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that's right so Ben and his editors thought\nLet's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented burned\nSo burst study had Florida is the third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records laws and\nLegally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places ... invent sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nI think three hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five\nYears worth of paper any\nPaper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting not for this involves a year of work how many police departments is getting lawyers involved as as a massive thing that involve probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nAnd then put together\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of Bush of that\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here to check it out yeah how many how many documents you think you have sitting on this stuff is probably five thousand pages\nI have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me ... six feet tall\nWe've got um broken down by county but you can see uh\n[noise] so a or B bay county\nBook or a Tom boy and beach uh all the way through\nThe alphabet and you basically just have a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across the entire desk\nCombination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represent a eight hundred and thirty one shootings\nI Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and in six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise]\nSo we did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team didn't involve a an armed suspect was chase\nAll the demographic information for the the firing officer or officers and the people were hit by those bullets than we thought let's like learn from these\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the

organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national ... agency to keep track of the stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it\nYou know kind of surprised us well the\nBiggest and sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they study about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it\nSeem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers showed that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category and he says you know what you see like on the most basic\nLevel are are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is a case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence in the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds at the time of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases the whole suicide by cop which is where somebody who's usually a mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally person is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door\nAnd raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon so it's ... I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's\nConsidered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know they're the news briefs that you see\nOnce or twice a week but it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line in dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question what do the numbers say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black and that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nAnd your what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nSouthern tell us much right now but the breakdown between fake ... for their same demographics and his without they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest\nYou know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent you know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty the numbers themselves don't really get you very far\nIt's up to lose somebody that cancer of lost a friend that cancer recently in fact\nThere's a horrible thing at a very you know ten ten times a hundred times worse for his for his wife children than it is for me\nI think it's a different thing when you're a person has killed by another human being and that human being is returned to the streets with a gun in a badge in a you know in a position of authority\nAnd it's something you do see impacts numbers even though the numbers themselves they they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear is that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer\nHad never been charged ... so it's it's this weird sort of like double grief yeah it's like past and present at the same time\nLike you can't put it away because it's every day is another insults kind of right Senate if I'm\nTo get into cars to brown\nThan something happened in you know here in Florida\nIn the clubs and\nSo after the event ended up the community center crystal took a bunch of the mom they all got in their cars and drove over to this little gem shop\nLike you guys do this every every event or you know I just wanted to know the ones and has been telling everyone about then\nThere's the energy to her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nBut no we didn't know anything about this but it it must be part of the different types of learning as part of just hoping ... right right we all just simply trying to find our way is a personal gathered\nLike probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because she wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the largest age at certain point because it was talking to these two women and she had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like some deep [noise]\nThen I open my windows and I just knew really I go through my house she says the age comes her down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to crystal [noise]\nMid sized one story house in the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured

hung out in the living room were drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin where the kitchen\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together they like they bring with them or their own stories these stories of grief of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\nAnd the night before they'd all gone out dancing together [noise]\nThere was some earth wind and fire [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing that I'm getting motel rooms again this is talk of the Clintons we start to stay over eight inches of houses\nWe see each other bad on the couch you know a air mattress it's it becomes like a huge sleep over and the rest of the policy for up talking you know getting to know each other you know some are the shows with a with like therapy for\nVictims let me ask but there was this moment when it's spent the day with these women that really stuck with me I Believe or add I'm Marlon problems to\nAnd it was when crystal let some of its over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlene was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or a brother or a child and we're basically just in someone's backyard just walking through the patchy grad so we usually the video that\nMom's house probably over like right now\nAnd then the police car that came behind him was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here\n[noise]\nAnd that's why we call the execution of vegetables I says to the garden was here in\nIn that that I Am then cause a when a when you know when they took him away in released and sit down and say we came back here it's all you can now what's going on\nAnd so now like when you have any like it's it's not as it's not as bad now but just the association Michael went unpaid onions you get that smell like it just you get slapped mhm and your\nAny brings you right back here mhm\nYep in the toy was just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\n\nSometimes for sort of you to read some of the other one that started to cry [noise]\n\nThen you don't want me to a Texan my find the best what about appalling to me\nOf women handed me the phone\n\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu [noise]\nThen you don't want me to a Texan yeah my find a lot of what about let me\nA couple of women handed me the phone my\n\nIt was probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera with this sort of straight face a\nThree to one\nThree two one\nThen we all started walking back to the cars [noise]\nFirst of all I just want to thank you for just sharing\nI Know yeah we haven't been I have\nIt was a very fine we saw that last week\nAnd I threw o'clock in the morning [noise]\nThat's what I remember the and I used to tell you all the time how do you live so far away\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\n\nLives at home I have to go there all the time of course\nYeah that was for how could you not\nThen I Know what you want to go take a chair\nAnd sit there yeah\nAnd it's crazy because like if a if a cemetery like a little bit further out\nAnd it's crazy you know about is like a certain time every\nDay and it's this little white man we share everything like that like he literally I think he does he liked to have lunch every day\nI mean I Love the way I like going on and all of that is a little white guy that always did not do\nYou take his chair I get home\nI never [noise]\nSo that trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happened to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip\n[noise] or you\nCan either repeal with some other Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one year ago\nShe was on stage with Michael Brown's mother Eric Garner's mother\nI watched as my daughter\nWas loaded into the ...\nAnd it was around this time of the few these women started to call themselves the mothers movement [noise]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC\n[noise]\n\nAnd it was weird because in the short amount of time\nThing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nOf felt like at the time a support group had suddenly become\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency

felt like at the time a support group had suddenly become\nComing up and down a cop with a gun a man with a knife\nAnd a look at the razor thin life or death moment between them\nSo stay with us [noise]\nCause for a guy who's running around with a knife tried to stab people it was off his meds if he was on a crack cocaine binge if I remember correctly\nThey park neighborhood street and you can see down the street half a block away\nFrom this shirtless black guy and you show up there\nThat's the kind of talking on the cop were in the body can and this black man goes on race pretty big knife in his hand and he's walking towards the ... once\nYou start learning from crazy [noise]\nLike I get closer and closer and closer and finally the cop when the body can pulled out the taste of the other officers out it was added a free is behind him with his firearm out and the guy\nDown is approaching approaching approaching approaching\nMe get within like ten feet of the cops and then [noise]\nThe guy was a buddy empires dictator the guy holding the night he falls onto his back onto the cement driveway still got the knife in his hand hey\nHey you're going to\nEnd the cop who's got a gun out he hustles over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabbed him by the hand turns them over\nAnd then he changed central four cups and then\nThere may not have it's not a smart idea to have a nice coming out of the police\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me do\nReal lucky you didn't just shut your best shot you want to die if you want to die [laughter] you can't guy\nHe tells the officer was um Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police boats can't kill\nMe [laughter] you know kind of counseling on T.\nV. to pick 'em up walk them over to the squad car with a man and the UN's ...\nSaid this is the thing that you guys will use this video for what it is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we at home or the officers used timing distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans unicorn judge that when I mean you know you have to resort to deadly force right away to use verbal commands first warn\nThem let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\n\nIt's important because there are guys partner was holding a gun and have you heard that hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun so you know he's deployment\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nThe deadly force right away they use verbal commands first warned them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that\n... and it's important 'cause there are guys partner was holding a gun have you heard that hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest and communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead them and it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek\nIsn't just a black man shirtless with a knife and at the end when there's no connection there is a lot easier to see somebody whose name wasn't faceless and I got scared and I shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that in established some kind of or a poor that made the officer think\nOf how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nActually after we finish watching the video and I was packing up ... told me that just a couple of months after that incident\n... through the neighborhood if you want to miss it on the front steps waves of hatred what are you doing man ... does your stupid son of a bitch you and how close you tend to be in that wouldn't be back with us medication he wasn't doing drugs and he was as ... as normal as me and you are right now [noise]\nNow again are almost kinda like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\n... primary election among the winner states ... has now ... county sheriff would was elected sheriff of\nLinn county [noise] friendly\nWhich the county that Daytona Beach belongs to him and the other thing to mention is that a ... organization called her which has decreased executive research forum\nIt's a big coalition and police chiefs and it twenty six team ... put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for the use of force and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is the sanctity of human life [noise]\nYou know just a month after ... put out this principle two of the biggest pleasing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job and some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive conversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago\nHuh I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women\nWho have I have become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing the way police things done in America or at least maybe slowly but cumulatively it\nDoes I hesitate to use this word but it does make it does feel like

Kennedy Airport of course will place wants to go get away from it all\nUp there with her producer Alan Horn we hadn't actually meant to come to a guy that we had been interviewing\nDaughter for a large it'd be portrayed by demeanor and the rest of your heart emotional right in the middle of the interview he'd gotten a call [noise] hello said he had to run or that's why they are really crap we have more questions will do so we decided to jump in the car with\nFriends men with guns\nIn the garage to look like they're in combat uniform for Iraq have automatic weapon\nIn case this Paul act man when he carries a a security expert and that's what he would be called nowadays and speaking of the reason he's here today at JFK Airport is to talk with Jet Blue security\nTeaching the few things about how they might do their jobs better okay we have fought over in a building\nThat fought over in a restaurant [noise]\nNot a general Bobby security kicks is how\nWe are really the terminal and the only place\nIt seems we're allowed to stand other right here on the concrete nearing two lanes of traffic accidents finally pulled out the thing he'd been hoping to show the folks that jet\nBlue has your or a little you're very stylish little laptop just starting up simple computer program that he promises about forty minutes\nTeach here into a person\nHas to start start start\nStepping forward to the computer hears loading image is either way the best way to reach the ...\nI see that one again that was so fast [noise] oh knew what\nHis happening I promise I'll tell you but let me just keep going\nTo explain Paul ... studies faces the human face he's probably studied the face more than anyone\nUp until my work that was person certainly hey\nWe didn't really know how many questions that they could make and there was nothing like a musical notation for the face\nSo about Thirty years ago he began by examining his own face very closely to see how many muscles are in there and there are roughly fifty then he spent the next couple of decades trying to figure out how many ways those muscles can combine to form a facial expression\nI developed tropical official action courting system basically a muscular scoring system you can apply to photograph film realized PA right you just did a a one to for\nYour your numbering my facial\nExpression the one to the most common fingers were just raising your eyebrows are just weren't too far as just raising the upper arm it says in this country and we're\nAll in all the human face is capable of three thousand different expressions that's what he thinks it's\nSeven is concerned are all in all the human face is capable of three thousand different expressions that's what he thinks and as we sat in his publishers office in midtown Manhattan is about an hour before the airport incident run example yeah he demonstrated if you\nAre very few fabricate anger very unlikely you'll put in what we call the anger reliable muscle which most people can't voluntarily movie\nAnger reliable ... I Want to see her as\nYour ten senior I'm touching their red margin of our lives are we just looked you looked fierce when you do that instantly so if you're in someone's mad look at their lips

joins while that skin moose lightly down\nHard to to to buy visible you know what\nYou just didn't when you said that anyway the reason that we're talking about him here an hour on lying is because with all the attention\nThat's being paid these days to finding life by using fancy brain scanners X. men is kind of on a crusade to remind us that you don't have to do that you don't have to look in the brain because the brain is actually directly connected to the face in ways that we can't control\nAll of these muscles are activated involuntarily when an emotion and curves without your choice\nOr the things happening on my face on her face on any face but you know we don't even know I also amount of my garden for naked face [laughter]\nWhich brings me to my new favorite word leakage leakage leakage yes it is a word you will hear again and again when you talk to anyone in the field of like catching take for example burying mammoth area el McManus em CNN us longtime CIA interrogator\nPhysiological leakage could be anywhere from sweat gland activity when someone knows that they are misleading you and they break out in a sweat\nThat because of ... nervous system that you have no control over basically telling the truth is easy that is the crux of courting Steve Silverman a reporter for wired magazine the truth is kind of sitting there in your brain your brain knows it you say it no problem but your brain has to work harder to generate the line there is an effort\nAnd with that there is always leakage even in an instantaneous moments sometimes you even hear it were a person's breathing pattern will change or the size that people do and what particular time did they do a you're not trained to look at it most people ignore it but if you've been trained and you know what to look for ... minutes it it will strike you right in the face\nSpeaking faces really talking about a particular brand ... specializes in had to do with something that he called micro\nFacial expression or very fast ... expression about twenty fifth with a second\nOkay just to just as an example let's just let us imagine that you're smiling\nGames but on the inside of us to know you can attest maybe you got some rage a little little being all that but on the outside you're smiling now a microexpression is went for the tiny tiny moment a little bit of that in a rage slips out onto your face\nAnd then what happened\nWell I don't remember when it turns at some point she started to have a lot of problems small crises started to come up a whole series of things they were me problems insurance problems\nYou know I've got a situation where I Need to move out of place from currently living as it was because my roommates you know crazy\nHe's felt temp felt sort of pulling back yes yes until one evening he gets a call from her and she's totally panicked\nOr do you have to come over we have something we really need to talk about him at this point I have no idea what it is now at this time [noise] but ah\nShe said hey I'm pregnant [noise]\nI think I'm pregnant\nWell what did you do well he basically stood up and do the right thing\nThere really was a part of me that we're thinking well here's the test of a person\nWho is going to stand by her and support her through the pregnancy and he said okay let's go to the doctor together\nI Would say where when I Want to be there and she would say three o'clock at the doctor's office than I Would say okay and I would go be the early you know to forty five\nAnd uh she would not be there three Fifteen would roll around at three thirty would roll around there I Am sitting sort of alone in the perception is ... ... can I help you\nShe would say oh well that that one was at one o'clock where I Would notice on the sign in sheet that she had actually signed it and I could see the handwriting and we're talking dated was hopes and um she signed it two hours earlier\nYeah so yeah yeah and as this\nFolks and um she signed it two hours earlier\nYeah so yeah yeah and as discontinued I Would say repeat that for me three okay so three o'clock I mean these are moments in principle clarity of life you're not losing track of stuff\nThen he gets a call from a woman named Leslie\nI met hope off Craig's list actually put out an ad for a roommate and she moved in with no furniture she showed up with just all of her stuff in trash bags and then she disappeared\nLeaving the back behind so it was right around that point where it check bounced and I was like oh now and so through mutual friends she tracked down shoot I was kind of like OK well she has this boyfriend she called them called them and sort of wanted like is he in on this she had no idea what she's talking about no he didn't even know she had a roommate me flatly\nI mean who the hell was who are you know who were you you will mean money annoyed Joan and she you know it was all very confusing\nNot knowing what else to do Leslie decide to go into hopes room and start looking through her style I just thought you know I'm just going to go through this see what's in here and that's when I found those no books\nAre about a new book an inside literally pages upon pages of different names with different social next to them\nCredit card numbers mother's maiden name birthday page after page of that kind of information on what exactly was that these are like crib notes for con woman that's when I called Jude and I said get over here what did you do at this point well Jude knew he had to do something\nAnd I finally got up the courage\nTo confront hope and say\nThis was over\nMy own responsibilities you're not withstanding to be um\nYou know the pregnancy and what about Leslie at this point when she\nWell luckily wondered how many people in that notebook hoping that through Craig's list which is lovely but her so she went back to ... and started posting warning\nMany times a day think single white female statistic I mean the Gray Thursday meal they twenty something got close by to blue eyed blonde right away run away in fact when your hairdresser she's hosting morning after warning if you have any information about the person is simply want from that day please email at ... I Hope at Yahoo dot com\nAnd took them all down as in Craig's on Craig's list ... remark soldier frog so he thought that they were inappropriate they were unfairly the right thing that everyone has rights she would pose no drama and not even take down\nShe would pose a fact of the matter is that hope is out there somewhere he would take it down but within a few days in those moments where Craig within the bathroom away from his death [noise]\nPeople respond to stories and you get multiple reports and she wrote people off\nEvery different kind of person from all over the place yoga instructors landlords car mechanics fact flower shop owners boss\nVeterinarian car rental agency cashing place if the dollar\nNot functionally ten thousand dollars and everybody was the same story one\nFor among seems to be moving with tons of stuff on the part of the task to check out of a closed countenance boat when it comes over the\nCourse of several years there were posting on her and there were people who were trying to find stuff\nShe got kind of a celebrity\nFollowing by the way we used to get emails like every day for people who were just like is there any news today loves the nose put you tell us anything I'm like no she's in hiding sorry\nWho was this woman and can I get you to introduce\nYourself to save you are and what you do my name is Terri Larry on the special agent with the Louisiana department of justice\nLouisiana how do we get Louisiana well after a few years hope resurfaced in New Orleans\nHad a cold and complained to from a lady down in the New Orleans area to her credit card had been used\nHope pre surfaced in New Orleans\nWe had a call and complaints from a lady down in the New Orleans area or her credit card had been used someone had tried to purchase Dell computers and it just started from there every time we talked to one victim lead to one or two other bit of hope has a almost like a cult following you know hurry ammo was that\nShe knew she got to know him really well\nI talked a lot of victims and they just don't trust people anymore a lot of these people did some good human open heart things with her and said this to pour girl I've got to help her out\nAnd there were there really let down there just don't trust people anymore and let's say you know not only do you have to worry about cleaning up your credit than getting your money back from the your bags you know you've got to deal with with people in the surf now that you don't know you know who you're standing next to\nDavid had that feeling\nOne of the houses that help at Blount tree in San Francisco he had found something that was really upsetting\nI had come across a letter that she had written to my parents would never mailed just sings and very very terrible things\nBut ... says we're totally untrue\nIn this letter to his parents\nAt at one point during\nPregnancy she was having complications and the the main symptom was like severe ... bleeding and bad news is that she was on somebody's living room or at a minor hers in this terrible condition and that um that I had that I just left\nTotally abandoning the situation in my responsibility is just a graphic and ugly depiction of an awful scene [noise]\n\nJesus traumatize\nThe whole experience he compared to an earthquake [laughter]\nHave you back then that's great you know never well one of the things that happens is that there's these aftershocks after the earthquake and there for a little while after the earthquake you're not sure\nThat when you put your foot down the ground is still going to be in the same place so that was a minute ago there were days\nI can tell you there were days when it was significant to hear anybody say anything of any consequence there was just\nI have a carton of milk in my refrigerator that expires in September seventies and that was true\nBut it didn't say the Denver nineteenth or September fifteenth September Seventeen\nTo other people crying on the phone talking to me about this situation and they were victims six seven years ago people are embarrassed they're embarrassed and then they become mad\nYou know and that's when they become detect it\nAllowed me perhaps\nWhere are you know front of her mother's house in a bad\nNeighborhood in New Orleans of around midnight what's your name and her mom Marcia Valentine and why are you there exactly I kind of gotten a little obsessed with how you kind of stuff\nNo idea [laughter] I like the having technical\nThere was something about imagining\nHow she was doing this so it was like really fun to imagine but maybe also happens Leslie to it like once I started looking I was able to find a lot of victims a lot of information and I wanted to meet her [noise]\nMarcia Valentine\nAround for around here that are looking like they have what you mean every before where I'm at [noise] I'll come back there\nThey're not around here\n... ... ... ... [noise]\nI'll come back later okay next right we hold up but what did you know about hope at this point well I knew she had had a daughter\nReally know anybody\nYou know not choose the timing was all wrong\nAnd I had located the father well I'm standing outside of hooks mother's house stairs through clockwork track piled up against the ...\nI don't see anyone inside the house\nNext morning I went out to find a woman a ruby\nRuby moon I live in New Orleans Louisiana revealed the coffee shop I live down the street from hopes mother the one who came to New Orleans um her mother you know\nIntroduced us really has a kid who's about the same age hopes daughter and they go to Montessori together and when Rubio opened her shop a year ago\nHope to car pool today she would\nPick them up and when we got home about five thirty six o'clock we'd all eat dinner together and she would spend the night sometimes and quite frankly I enjoyed\nIt's ridiculous I mean her idea was that lives would be over represented at a temp agencies\nYou can probably imagine you know people who need to go to the temp agency are\nUsually people who cannot remain one job for very long period of time\nThat's not true of all people who work at a temp agencies most of them are just fine but some of them she figured keep ending up as a temp agency because they just have this\nProblem with their you know their lifestyle the truth ... are let's keep going I Want to hear how this comes out to make it\nSo yelling in her crew went to a couple of temp agencies in the LA area I interviewed a hundred and eight people that's them all kinds of questions not just about their employment history but about their past\nTheir childhood history about their families very personal information you checked their answers to those questions against their family and friends against their court records just to see if she could find people who story and you know inconsistencies big ones and then the hundred and eight books that she ... she found a pathological liar\nTwelve actually twelve twelve out of a hundred and they'd say abortion or they've pathological Arizona depends on how you define I Would hope that she found twelve people that you wanted to look at further she said to them\nWould you be willing to come on a purely voluntary basis into the lab\nAnd uh let me scan your brain [laughter]\nJust another day you're going to involve\nIs basically put people in the scanner and then we scan their bang\nChicken everyone's ... all one hundred and eight or participants the liar than the non liars no one knew which group there and ... and she was looking at a particular part of their brains just beyond therefore it\nCalled the prefrontal cortex and this is the part that the brand that part of the nation is where the real thinking up making decisions and more judgment for example\nYou know if you do me into that place just behind your forehead [noise]\nYou'll see two kinds of brain tissue you've got gray\nMatter and then you've got white men I've heard of gray matter yes well we think of the brands being gray but actually to to think gray and white the great stuff kind of things like the computer processor part they're these little clumps of neurons that process information\n[noise] computer [noise]\nThat's the great where's the white white matter it's like the the connection between all these cars on the computer the way met her in other words is what moves the thoughts around gray is where the\nHappened and why is when you move the thought from here\nTo there exactly yes\nThey transfer information from one end to the\nKids have got your grave white what y'all lean thought she would see when she looked into the brains of people who ... I\nFound out we would see a reduction\nSome piece of it not they're missing something physically she thought she would find less gray stuff less of the thinking so why would why would\nWhy because that's what she's seen in other um mental disorders are kind of like this and if you think about it in a really simplistic level the graves where you think your thoughts and it's also among other things where you crunch your moral calculations and liars she figured have trouble in this department some maybe they have ...\nThat was okay but when she got the pictures that what you saw was\nSuch a great increase in [noise]\nAnd not the great more white matter [noise]\nWhite stuff a lot more twenty five percent a quarter\nTo ... they have twenty five percent more connections in their head the non liars yes\nBefore we get to what that means what were you thinking when you saw this\nI was really bubbling [laughter]\nI thought this was this was something something something\nSomething shoe here's your idea so far ready if she thinks that these extra connections play a crucial role\nI think something should here's her idea so far ready if she thinks that these extra connections play a crucial role in a kind of in the moments storytelling that's essentially what lying is coming up with a story on the fly let me give you an example kept mhm you're leaving work you're ...\nAnd joining but nice co worker corners you hey Sallie corners you in the elevator\nHey asks you out on you know I Need to ask you maybe want to go out with me on friday\nSo there you are questions dangling in the air it's more so for most of us right at that moment inside her head and our brains were thinking [noise]\nHow shall I say you're busy saying and indeed one from my point when he was I think I think they would reach out into the void trying to form a connection with some ideas that can help you come up with some excuse I can say I'm like well shoot\nAnd really what you need to do at this moment is you take a bunch of disparate thoughts on different sides of your brain like 'em me tonight teeth dentist and connect them altogether\nOver flick that book okay we can all do it given enough time but for the pathological liar she thinks that because they have so many more of these connections to begin with they get\nTheir factor at night and you do you think of wanting to start writing glide path and yoga I have to filter I thought he loves it the more connection very beekeeping that factored the speed of the processing skins jump from one idea to another and you can come up with more um random stories\nShe thinks the brains of most of us we have trouble making those connections we have would you have trouble as I said do you like do you want to come out with you know friday night would you not be able to come up with a ...\nI Would say um yeah I Am\nI have to ... straws to assert searching district county we always we have about three hundred and sixteenth stress over and uh I'm only I'm only doing ones with with um with little red circles on them so that's there's you know sorry\n[laughter] I don't know I did this happen there you go see you've got you've got extra white men are prone\nTo she's saying this is a cause of lying or an effective line like well she's\nNot sure and this is a big debate in which he can say is that children as they grow from eight to eight ten there is a big jump in the white\nMatter oh and that's actually the same age that they give up the skill to lie\nAmong the\nClothes ... given everything we've just talked about how do you square this\nInformation with being a new mom I mean is this your first good yes it's my first one a boy or girl a girl what's her name ... doesn't it make you wonder a little bit about Zoe and what's what's going on inside her head\nOh yes I Wonder about that all of the times it's still too early to scan her brain but eventually I Will do it are you serious yeah\nThis is a moral to this never if you were a little baby have a social psychologist as a mother who to the very very dangerous thing anyway if she does is maybe a little bit more about the nature nurture of liars but until then\nThis is radio
