said to his momma he still live\nWith his momma\nWhich might explain some things but anyway\nHe said to his mom and he said momma I Want to marry me a real mountain princess but the rain any around so I'm going to go out\nAnd I'm going to travel through all the mountain ranges of the world see if I Can't find me a real mountain princess so we set out and he hiked through the Himalayas any ascended the Alps and the Appalachians any cruise through the caucuses he roamed through the Rockies he went to this year I was looking\nFor ladies in the air as\nHe went to glass mountain looking for ladies with one shoe\nBut he couldn't find any real princess when he met a lot of ladies that said they were princesses but he wasn't sure that they were real princess is that they were probably fraud because let's face it you know princess costumes just aren't that expensive so\nHe went home and he was depressed and he said to his mom and he said momma I couldn't find no real mountain print stuff he said I did meet some frauds he said now I cast some of those frauds [noise]\nTo see if they would turn it into princesses and his mom and dad don't kiss fraud and\nNight it's terrible storm blew up there was wind and rain and snow and hail enlightening and in a hurricane and and as you know I mean and what not and in the midst of all of that\nThere was a knock at the door and the press wants to open the door and because this is a story when he opened the door there on the front porch good three beautiful prim prime princesses and he was so excited until they said trick or treat

she said howdy\nI'm a real mountain princess well he wasn't sure if she was a real mountain princess because he wasn't sure real princesses walked around and hiking boots with calico dresses and their hair and a mouse that she did have a stash that said mountain princess [noise]\nBut who knows right so he joined her home\nAnd he introduced it to his momma momma this year lady so she's a real mountain princess well the momma wasn't so you're either and so she said to the sun and this is where if you haven't already you'll figure out what their stories based on she said to her son she said I don't know if she has a real mountain princess or not we're going to have to test or\nHe she said here's what I Want you to do she said I Want you to take twelve mattresses\nStreaming support for
