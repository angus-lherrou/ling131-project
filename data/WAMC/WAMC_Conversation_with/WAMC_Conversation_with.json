the studio is the claim movie director Arthur Penn\nMost of you will know Arthur Penn through his legacy of films like Alice this restaurant little big band night moves and the pivotal master work Bonnie and Clyde well at least films alone amount to an amazing career\nThey represent only a fraction of Arthur pins life and work through the years we'll be talking with Arthur Penn about all of this and hopeful\n... career they represent a only a fraction of Arthur pins life and work through the years we'll be talking with Arthur Penn about all of this and hopefully revealing some things about him that you don't know but first let me thank you for coming all the way over here from the bridges Arthur and for being with us Arthur Penn\nIt's a great pleasure to be here I listen to your show very often and it's it's always wonder if we done Arthur let's start at the beginning when were you born and I was born in Philadelphia my parents divorced early on in my childhood\nI went to live with my mother and brother where\nIn uh New Jersey briefly and then into New York city and the New York\nIn the Bronx and in Brooklyn and\nWe kept moving on because puns were non existent in those days it was a defections are deep in the depression and uh and how did your mother make a living she did a sort of janitorial job at a hospital called the good Samaritan and then gradually worked her way up to being the assistant to the director of a civil war\nSo there were brains in the family where she was a extraordinarily gifted person did you keep in touch with your dad at all or was that no they were there it was quite a bitter divorce [noise]\nI Would occasionally see perhaps three or four times during my early childhood and then at fourteen\nShe decided quite wisely I think for me to go and live with him with my brother who had already been there my my older brother and what did he do he's urging pen a great photographer of course I had no idea\nAnd what kind of an impression did that make on you if you can go back in time in terms of your future as a director in other words detail laying out scenes and posing people nothing\nAbsolutely nothing [laughter] survivor who was the essence of it and that was not a bad childhood you know it was on the streets of New York\nYou live by which you know but you got to high school when I was sent back to live with my father at fourteen I went to high school in Philadelphia a highly high then came out of all and not that sure they'd been within a year ago I was in the army and the war and what'd you do that serves Europe most like\nWell I was an infantry man\nI didn't see flat out Syria's infant reaction I did all the training\nAnd was separated at the last minute and I have no reason to know why it happened\nThat I was taken out of this basic infantry company\nAnd brought to something which was called the fifteenth army headquarters which didn't exist there was a group of people group of soldiers officers and we were stationed in the our Denver's really in a kings hunting lodge\nAnd bang that's when the ... of the bulge came surrounded us what do you remember that all I remember quite a lot of it because we're literally scared to death or I was one of the few men in this group\nBecause they were army specialist of a fairly high order having come most of them I think from the national guard it was a non existent army I think it was a paper phenomenon I've never really read anything about this but you don't know what they were doing there\nWell I I only know that when we escaped this hunting lodge I was sent back with three other guys to get both a Spanish couple who were the housekeepers\nAnd take the remaining files that had been left behind in ... and bring them to Brussels and ... years later\nPeggy and I arrived in Brussels to be celebrated for the first time by the Belgian film critics and we walked into this\nThey're paying I arrived in Brussels to be celebrated for the first time by the Belgian film critics and we walked into this hotel where I had brought these people\nWhat do you feel it can you remember your emotion isn't that what she describes it as having seen me just go white and dropped into a chair and it was true I I I\nI suddenly had a flash of what it was like that day when we came in a weapons loaded everything ready to go\nAnd it was really the G to intelligence headquarters to give up the fight I mean literally get enough I might did not and then you are in the middle of that I was in the middle of it I had set up a machine guns to protect us but the great good fortune that we experience was that the Germans were\nOn a dash to anti war that was a real game plan which was they would recapture and be able to use that as a porn and and showing back again through Belgium and then the French and ... get behind the allied forces [noise]\nFortunately it was a terrible periods of weather\nAnd on Christmas morning the sky cleared and from all over Europe they were caught trails of bombers coming in and the ground shook as they blew all the fuel tanks and the whole or you're lucky they didn't get you well we were well enough away yet by that point\nBut the sky black and from from this and the German attack ground to a whole\nYou know are there to ... but it occurs to me that somewhere you know this whole sort of mystical experience of being assigned to a unit there really wasn't and all the rest of it might have been a great film summer [laughter]\nMaybe I should really go through some military histories and try to find references to the fifteenth army headquarters that if that is because there was no army yeah you know it's so whether it was designed as some kind of ploy to deceive the Germans or what I don't know\nYou could find later in life that you still harbor some prejudice towards the Germans\nAs a result of that experience what I did certainly should after the war I was very difficult for me I couldn't go to Germany I went with my family and my very young son at that point\nEventually to Austria to ski but it was still\nVery difficult for some people think they were worse I Know when when when we would be where we're on the train and and in Cambridge customs officials\nWearing a uniform far too familiar\nWho was pretty upsetting experience because I ended up the war in Germany but what happened was there was a very there was very bitter fighting during the month of January my old unit which was a hundred and sixty Infantry Division lost two thirds of the people\nHuge huge loss\nAnd that was that was the bitter band of brothers foxhole to Fox or fighting that took place until the air superiority of the allies was so firmly established that they were able to finally cut off the supply lines to the soldiers\nAnd they create the the great numbers of surrendering I remember them just you know walking terribly and at that moment I have to confess I had a terrible sympathy for them because you live here I mean yeah\nIt was very difficult period very difficult so my attention was clearly not on academics but I got two black mountain and had a wonderful series of experiences\nWith people\nOf course one has to call them teachers but teachers as well as companions we live together we ate together we talked there were no classes as such you were in some credit dialogue with the people that you were they issued degrees no no they weren't accredited\nSo they didn't even pretend to know you got no grades you got no degrees you got nothing you were simply there and if you could live and stand the amount of freedom which was not always true\nBut it was pretty a difficult for so long ago I got what did you say I stay too full years the last part of that was John Cage decided to do a play of Eric sat tease\nThe route ... and Merce was going to do the staging and they decided to have ... played read well Bucky was paralyzed by that\nJust terrified so they asked me based on very little bit of theatrical knowledge I had to work with him so we started and the only thing I could figure out to do is to make as big a fool of myself as I possibly could happen\nTo work with him so we started and the only thing I could figure out to do is to make as big a fool of myself as I possibly could have been joined me so\nWe get down on the floor and start rolling around and laughing and jumping and pretty soon as this armor began to fall away from her many played it perfectly splendid why did they want him to be the lead well he was perfect for me it was a very small population\nAt any given time there were probably no more than a hundred and fifty people\nFaculty and students but the beauty of this experience was now he's the author penned a director for the for for the first time\nAnd then I thought well but that that's not really what I Want to do I I think I Want to be a writer I think I Want to be\nI was reading TS Eliot and thinking about Italy and Dante and I thought I've got two more years on that you had bill why not go to Italy so I did and they just had no problems with just putting out the money right could go anywhere in the world than it was Seventy five dollars a month\nPlus a small ... and tuition\nAnd you didn't need accreditation or anything like that nothing\nNothing there was a magnificent response to the war\nAnd so I went I went to federal Jeff first and learn the language and then I went to Florence for a year and a\nRed sort of Italian Renaissance poetry to the best of my ability which was not very good\nYou know you have to have grown in that language is like reading Beowulf but nonetheless it was a very pleasurable experience more than anything I discovered that I was more visually attracted to things and I was through the literature\nSo when I started traveling to museums to sites to following paying these paintings and\nAnd you know cracking down on hold is a massage show which belongs in the Florence museum but it's been moved to Naples [noise] so I get on a train or hitchhiked town to Naples\nSo that was the ... you know one of those this for years\nAnd then men I came back and I now I needed a job and I wouldn't know over a kid\nI thought I've got to be a stage manager on Broadway like that era\nOf course that didn't happen but I did run into somebody who said NBC is hiring for managers\nAnd a former manager is a sort of equivalent to a small time stage manager except it's very simplistic your stand off camera and you point to the person to go on the air and go off the air and speed it up if they're going to slowly or et cetera [noise]\nFortunately I had this credential from the army as having been head of this program so when I showed that NBC I got hired like that my first job was holding cue cards from Milton burl a\n[laughter] which went on for several days not all that pleasant because whenever anything we'd go wrong he would say it's a good guys ...\nOh God but it was it was fascinating and then very quickly this is really the early days of televisions fifty one fifty in fifty one television is just beginning on certain shows to be profitable\nMany shows were not profitable yet and there weren't that many sets it they were and black and white et cetera\nAnd then they completed the collection of cable across the country and a show that I had been assigned do as a former manager was the Colgate comedy hour which was in New York was Martin in Lewis and you know any candor and all those people and they all\nDo as a former manager was the Colgate comedy hour which was in New York\nWas Martin in Lewis and you know any candor and all those people and they all wanted to be in California desperately so a lot when Norman Lear and ed Simmons who were the writers for Martin and it was so we all were transferred out there\nAnd ... and I were sent out to sort of be the stage manager for managers of the show and train for managers for bigger shows than they had been doing locally in LA\nWell naturally if you had any sense in those days you could move very fast and very quickly we both became what's called associate directors at sea equivalent of an assistant director in movies\nWhich meant and moving in the control room and then very quickly after that the opportunity was offered to me by Jerry Lewis and I had a cat or\nTo be the director of the show like season how did that happen extending opportunities just doesn't happen that they must have known you they must have had some sense of oh sure they knew because I was with them or through each week's reversal well what was it like\nThere was a mad house it was perfect madhouse\nEach comic who would have been a week's worth so at the hotel Roosevelt would first of all be very impatient with their writers because they had to come up with comedy skits and then they would rehearse them then that was not the right thing to do then Jerry would say that in Norman Lear and ed Simmons\nYou show me you've gotta get up and do it you know and you yet so they would have to get up and I remember in Norman\nAnd Jerry would say no no no no no not yet let me and he would dive into the middle of it showing Norman Lear how to do with Norman Lear we had written for him who knew what the next quiz it kind of bad behavior it ... it was\nIt was wild in many respects Jerry particularly was ah\nThey were receiving sums of money that they had not ever dreamed of and a freedom because NBC was living practically on this show that CBS was living on the Ed Sullivan Martin Lewis Jerry was the real brains that yes or no well he was the real brains of it in one respect\nThat at that time the quality of their act was as a tour Muller you know\nThere were no limits he would break the line of cameras go out in the audience will all those things were sort of frowned on on on the other shows because television was trying to develop an orthodoxy of of the suspension of disbelief so you didn't violate the medium for amateurs\nBut actually for my taste the real brains was dean ... he was the funniest man first of all on his feet than I ever heard\nWith the we saw that much later we so that later after much much that he was pretty badly hurt by that period of juries dominance and then they broke\nUp and it was a Jerry was in ascendancy and dean was would've left behind as is\nRecruiter which was certainly not a description of and he was in an extraordinary man in any event prior to ... ever getting to direct these shows\nI got a call from New York from Fred Cole who is the producer of the silk go play house which was the dominant\nDrama show because I had four managed briefly with one of the directors Vincent Donahue they were doing a new show called first person that Fred had designed which was an attempt to do the first person shooter\nA new show called first person that Fred had designed\nWhich was an attempt to do the first person short stories of all the great runners Faulkner and Hemingway et cetera and so they were going to have this new program and they asked vents and to recommend somebody and he kindly recommended me\nSo Fred cold man said would you like to come to New York\nAnd try to be the director I'm going to have two of you be the director of this show and I said I'll be there tomorrow and that was the end of my comedy days until much later on Broadway and so I came to New York\nAnd there I first show first show I was the director who is at each other ... script\nJoe Anthony Mildred done like an Kim Hunter unbelievable unbelievable\nI simply said that job I said Joe you you're a director I'm not I I Can't talk to Milly dynamic and you know those people so I called the cameras and new directors\nSo that's how it started really and it was not that I didn't know more than I Am legend I did but I didn't dare express it yet because I had not found the language of the actors particularly the New York in group and this is Joe\n\n\nAnd he went back to California and came in response saying ten thousand dollars on the way to bill\nAnd we did the miracle worker on television live before Broadway and before the film\nWith Theresa right playing the lead with Patti McCormick\nI can come here of but it was a lie and from where we had been you know using only three cameras in the east here we were in this new studio with magnificent equipment using five and six cameras and it was a gigantic event and\nMiracle worker was known success as a live television\nShows no can scope of that either yet there is a few minutes but then there was this huge response from people around\nAt that point I'd ended my other three shows and\nI went off and went to Warner Brothers to do my first movie with Fred from a script by Gore Vidal\nWith Paul Newman [noise]\nDo you belong to the mall\n[noise] are you on them all those men what's your name say hey my\nName's William ... says he wants to work [noise]\nHe's one of the city show is against is about to get on the main gear canteen of selling it for about a scene that he gets a little ... will make camp here a Johnny, Johnny that here is that\nWhat you thought you were on fame binding vote again I'm Thomas alive O M ... valley for sure\nThe script was leader rewritten essentially by Liz ... Stevens me\nBut we had ... and we made a film called west tend to gun which was a\nA western it did nothing in the United states who was dismissed by all the critics is be to Artie and not western enough but there were critics are like that for there there were critics in Europe yeah on Dr ... wrote about the poetry of this etcetera but\nBut that was all year and a half later and when I finished shooting at film a guy came up to me and said hello I'm from a blind date I'm the best editor in Hollywood I'm going to edit your movie and I I just want\nBecause it seemed to me impossible I was editing shows there's one in the air how could you come in and and what I shot\nWith that was Warner's wife and then next thing I knew my parking space crews go on and I was off wonders what so I came back to New York city this is not the medium for me I have no interest in it bill\nIn the meantime with that money finished too for the CSA and read it to us to begin me and I just was knocked out I just thought it was wonderful and so low and behold he attempted his age and attempted to sell it to Broadway producers\nNo response no response nobody liked it I said I Know the guy the producers I took it to Fred co Fred took it over the weekend to Bucks County came back and said we're doing it and that was it\nYou give them ten thousand dollars for the first TV show when he gave them for that he didn't you didn't have to buy it\nSaid we're doing it and that was it if he gave me ten thousand dollars for the first TV show where they give them for that he didn't you didn't have to buy it what it did was he took an option on it and he raised the money and what he did was he set a script to Henry Fonda who was in the south of France and found that was the biggest star on Broadway\nAnd back came a telegram from fond of saying I'm yours\nWell with that he could raise that anything you what you know there was no limit\nAnd that was our our big task now was the task to find a girl a girl to play the part we tried every which way\nNot with a great deal of success but I had worked with this girl on one of the playoffs nineties and then somebody told us about her again the base hard I think Richard Bass said this this girl and Bancroft you oughta see her and she came in and bang\nThat was it she's not really been on the stage in our life she trained a little bit of the American Academy of dramatic art so there she was a first timer with Henry Fonda [noise] you know who was I don't know Hank Aaron ... Broadway\nWe let me get this straight this was on Broadway Broadway\nOn way so we're out of town with that show to people and bill said to me you know I think I'm going to write the miracle worker as a place for Hannah and I said oh bill you're out of your mind let's get this one on we were working day and night my\nFirst child was being born you know it was just a terrible pressured period so he can he really hit the lifelong partner whom friends we open to for the seesaw my son was born\nWe open to for the seesaw and it's a big hit and am bankrupt does this star overnight and then a short period later I get the script from bill and it's a script of America or this guy really knows how to work bill getting nose at work is a superb drama this\nHe has an skill dramatic material that I think is really virtually unparalleled American writing\nThere we were we were sitting on top of the world well at this point [noise] may I just boast for a while what happened was I did see saw I did the miracle worker\nI did ... homes toys and the addict ten rows of all the way home\nAnd an evening with Mike now was all I Am right now row bang bang bang bang bang and all on Broadway and on Broadway and four of them at one time or four or five of them running some of that is [noise] it was a really hard\nTo tell me a little bit about what it's like to direct I think those of us who are sitting out there have no idea really what a directed does when he gets there you say do this do that what exactly do you do\nWhat you do is you realize about a hundred and ten pages\nOf words that are put down as to be spoken and that's the text but as heroin Kerman would say that said text it's not a play until the actors do it and in point of fact it is that marriage of getting the actors to not just\nSpeak these words but really live the circumstances under which these words emerge so that you encapsulate the text with human behavior human circumstances and in vitamin D\nThat permits us when we sit in the theater then too deeply believe that we're having to it\nIn other words you say stand this way you look this way you know what do you do it's more mixed\nTheater then too deeply believe that we're having to it\nI mean in other words you say stand this way look this way you know what do you do\nIt's more mystical than that in his in a sense it's giving confidence to an actor to treat these words and not in the very conventional way that they might be spoken but\nTo personalize out of his or her life something that was equivalent to this kind of emotional experience and lo and behold\nWhat happens then is that the material begins to live in a way that is the conjunction of the actor and the text\nAnd it's a difficult process because until it happens it's painful\nAnd filled with gloom a million home and when we were doing to Asian addict I Jason robots Maureen Stapleton Irene Worth\nAn review or you know a wonderful cast but really in never understood theater process and she sat at those first rehearsals and every time one of those lines would come out she got\nThis painful cough and finally I said lily and go home and then come back in four or five days\nAnd if you don't like what we're doing fires or and start all over again if you have that right yes rewrite belongs to the playwright in theater\nOr have they have the absolute right with the most important person and all of it it's still a director if you know you know the most important person as the drama really the director is very important particularly if they have a comprehension and the trust of the play right\nThat ... what will happen is that out of this mixture of panic written actors and dry text a life is going to emerge\nYou know but that takes a lot of faith on the part of the play right\nSo is that true that the playwright is that's important I think the answer to this is going to be no in film as it is on Broadway\nNot at all you know just the rivers in film it is the director is always the director because film is so non dependent on the spoken word one can generalize that\nThat yes the content of the dialogue is very important yes the description of the actions are important but how their realized is really what makes a difference and that realization of the material is the director\nThere are a lot of people in film writers who tell stories about how they walk away they don't want their their name on it or they don't want\nYou know like I said yes but I I've always enjoyed a very good relationship with with all the writers except Garvey now but then you know I've been invited them always to be president to be part of it but by the time they've written it and then it's gone into production and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "WAMC

I grew up in ... interesting little time to actually come and well they\nAre all those of us who know a little bit about Binghamton also know that Johnson City an Endicott exactly now three the triple

dinner\nSchool well sort of make well that's impressive that was like a forty hour week we'll think of all the job brains that were there and you get to be the editor says that's pretty good or if you have to fight for that I Know I had to be talked into it oh is that right [laughter] 'cause I was about\nTo get married and had to marry me and my junior and senior year and I thought who they're going to be very hectic care if I'm editor of the paper in my first year of marriage\nIs a little bit marry him a wonderful woman how did you meet up\nBlind date at pass or she was a pass or studying Greek I was at Yale studying history and the arts and others in Europe my roommates monitor at a sort of a mixture came back and he sent out a way of saying that got us you've got to meet her and\nI

McCarthy I'm Russian jeep\nFrom a New Haven from New haven to the Harvard\nTo ... and we called up to a room and it's like my dad were going out and drink and you know you should meet this guy and she ... she had some paper and doing it and she looked out the window and she said I saw this funny looking car jeep with a Red Star I thought that guy must be interesting\nSo that's how she at least came on the day and um I started during the Vassar every weekend for two years I'm lost and when she graduated a year ahead of me I thought she was\nCame on the day and um I started during the Vassar every weekend for two years I'm lost and when she graduated a year ahead of me I thought she was going to go to ... be an archaeologist\nAs out of if she goes to increase its summer I'll numbers here again I better ask her now to get married he Christie at our parents were were very cooperative up that helped us to pay the rent first year Ninety dollars a week\nMonth I didn't Ninety dollars a month on our for fourth floor walk up in New haven right across from the Yale art gallery in about a half a block from the elderly and so we had a strategic location\nIs yeah the great fun I'm going into a morning class sneaking into literally into morning class with a man named Bernard Knox is a great classical philosopher teaching and yell at the time reading Greek plays using the grapes you learn to Vassar and it was a real idyllic first year\nThat he knows that she was a ringer\nOh sure oh have everyone else was men that were like well there are no girls at Yale that this was Nineteen uh fifty nine sixty\nWho else was prominent we've come to know today you know I Know that Bush is where they're at different times who was there when you were there that you could name\nWhile the future president ... ... less Aspen became a congressman congressman and then a secretary of defense and it was in my class they've been Hoboken roommate became a head of a marsh the clown insurance company in in the U.S\nLooking back on you how is it your sense that it's an elitist institution which trains the best and brightest in the country\nWell at the latest in the sense that it's very hard to get into its meritocracy though today if you or you can have an income up to I think it's a hundred thousand dollars and go free of charge tuition for they have such a huge dominant yellow he's been good about that\nWell and good but in recent years even better it wasn't until the last five years that this kind of need blind admissions was taken up by the ivy league some of the links that could afford it so now it's it's a it's almost the roulette wheel of people who all have eight hundreds and their SAT exams math and English\nAnd have done well in the writing\nAnd uh they turned down more people with the eight hundred and accept\nOr something like twenty two thousand people apply and they accept for the freshman class about a thousand so this is true at Harvard to him as a shoe\nBut what do you make of that I'm not being critical I mean what do you make of that you think that that's healthy I mean that there aren't people who are very aggressive who'll do very well who never would approach anything like an eight hundred score and well in like\nObviously that's Joe ... not everybody running the world is so much to Yale or Harvard\nWhat Mary and I discovered living in small newspaper towns are my early life was working in Danbury, Connecticut Strasburg, Pennsylvania paper that we had their ten thousand or can I have is the editor twenty five Middletown New York and New Bedford Massachusetts\nWas that in every case there was a community college or state college like turning into a nearby and Mary ... courses and she always found great teachers who are as good as people she had an ... I had an yeah who just didn't happen to have the have published three great books\nThat you have to have you know you have to publish or perish if you're going to be teaching at Harvard or Yale\nPrinceton arrest or even oop all these days yes or no go demanded that pressures on a that's a good point pressures on scholars everywhere who in teaching but we learn the basic fact that there's so many great teachers in America\nThat there are many good colleges were which may not have the greatest you know I mean the reputation\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness

place to be here for the student\nSo loaded [laughter]\n\nAnd then you have to win the roulette wheel came\nWell you've been I don't want to take your cracked but you've been wonderful Sunni new polls you live in Naples but you bring a scholar every year to teach there and a lecture series and you've been extremely supportive why\nWell you can see that I think er an education is really important for everybody and then there are many bright students coming from so many new fault for many other places in the country who do well and make major contributions\nOr be really good citizens you don't have to run the world to be in and out to be important in a democracy everyone is important and everyone should be as educated as possible it's curious as possible about what's going on is interested in listening to the news on NPR and I mean I Am saying is\nTo be good citizens it's a we have to educate everyone or you can we can function in a democracy\nWell I asked that because you know every once in a while I'll talk to somebody and let's see what did you spend your career teaching in say new false and they'll say\nThe [laughter]\nOh [noise] you know I Love\nThat institution that assignment they're ignorant is yes it is I Love that institution there are many good teachers and that really first rate people yeah it's great to town to limit to because they make it a lively place\nGym on away what's happened to newspapers I was so struck as you spoke about your father is philosophy of acquisition and he was there at the right time obviously we're in the glory days of newspapers right now we have something else going on can you tell us about what's happening\nOf the biggest the some numbers that hits you in the eye and when you talk about what's happened to the newspaper business ten years ago two thousand to all the newspapers in America there are about one thousand four hundred had total advertising revenues of forty four billion dollars\nWas bigger than almost any other advertising stars ten years later two thousand twelve\nThere's been an implosion an advertising in huge decline last year two thousand twelve the total ad revenues and check this within his paper advertising bureau or twenty two point six billion twenty two point six billion almost exactly half what they were ten years ago\nAnd that's in use ... ... dollar dollar because we know that the dollar's worth\nMight and outs of enjoyed a dollar ... like I was even tougher the result is there are about thirty three by the third fewer reporters in America than there were ten years ago\nI think this is a disaster for our society sure I can talk about that one out because fewer public bodies are being covered by reporters\nWhen I was a kid a reporter and in Middletown Nineteen sixty two and one night I Would cover a school board in Chester zoning board in Florida and um maybe a planning board and worried and sending you know short stories of people would know what's going on in their town\nUh now the many of these ... just don't get covered and I'm used to sit in the courthouse in her in Goshen I remember covering my first double murder trial I sat there for about a week covering a murder trial was great stories great company and all that\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog hardest dot com I choke no poll dog hornets in that did to make

knows if it's on the weekends comes up the rock climb\nAnd get away from all the devastation of a of the newspaper newsrooms\nIs has a ripple effect into our society that most people most people don't realize because it means there's fewer people doing the original reporting on the scene\nAnd um while the Associated Press says uh makes up for that to some extent in Albany and\nDoesn't cover mental town just can't we don't have a you have to look to the local newspapers were during his weekly newspapers continue to do this\nQuite well as a kind of an inverse ratio of economic decline smaller the paper the healthier to his financially the bigger until you get to the New York times\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog hunt S. dot com\n... in a liberal city like New York city I think he sees that as a kind of a mission he has he's interested in ideas in politics as well as making money\nHe got into terrible trouble in Great Britain to the point that you know his subordinates of arrested you know taking in all the rest of it but that has not jumped the pond as we say has that trouble\nAnd I wonder whether some day\nThere is a for a company like News Corp which is I'm legally in a American Company based in New York is subject to the foreign corrupt practices act you know I think sooner or later something's got to come up or you think would have to come up\nChallenging the company from the inside of the pond because of the truly horrendous things that has people on there and their papers did and in London you know threatening people with stories if they didn't give him the news about other people\nYou know really nasty stuff paying the police for stories before someone else got them things we wouldn't think of doing in America and so far no one's found the New York post going to happen you wonder how how they're\nWell the late ... corporation owned the British papers I'm as American corporation and then I I agree with you set it in a number of times wouldn't stand to reason that the corrupt foreign act would take ... wouldn't have happened already is my question\nOr is he just too powerful to take on nobody wants to do it\nThat's a possibility and the other thing is it's not politically popular thing to do and the other possibility is that they're waiting to see the outcome of the court cases ... years and then they'd have an even stronger case maybe\nYeah so I wanted to say there's another side to you and that other side is that you have a lot of interests you're an environmentalist I Know that and you have an interest in something called storm king one feels that\nWell the storm hang on center has had its fifth anniversary in two thousand ten\nIt's one of the top two or three\nOutdoors sculpture garden a museums of modern sculpture and the world you know it's really ... world class place of where the unique beauty of it is that you're seeing large outdoors sculpture some endorsement mostly large large in some small\nOutdoor sculpture in a beautiful landscape that incidentally was created by moving a lot of earth up to make the New York thruway that goes right but I see there's a sign that says Don King art center as you go north right as you pass it and that was that he had just got up last year\nSo it's really a unique place when my wife and I were living in Goshen when we

some of his works are going to be shown in San Francisco this may just got a lot of money to run a place like that\nIt does about the money takes a lot of fundraising thank God we have artists and collectors are interested in the first the first the artist are interested in showing there because it's like a one of the great stages for public outdoor heart\nThey'll often work with us for a lesser feed and they would somewhere and to a private collector because they're getting a huge benefit from all the publicity but even more important Peters turned over the years and John now\nAnd

Khamenei Beth thank you Alan it's great to be here the book one go a coach a team and a game that bought a divided down together let's pretend I hadn't read the book what were the book about\nThe book is impossibly local story in Lewiston, Maine about a soccer teams quest for\nThe schools FIRST Championship title and soccer and the interesting thing about this team is that all but one of the starters on it the varsity roster are African immigrants um most of them are Somali refugees playing for a coach that his fourth decade of teaching and coaching Lewiston born and bred\nAnd it's a story about this team coming together in this town that has experienced this unusual migration influx immigration influx of Somali refugees and setting an example for the community to follow\nAnd he gives them a speech which is a speech that he gives them all the time about about soccer which is this game that is you know a team effort it's it's building it's a it's a game that builds long plays and you have to move the ball together across and an enormous amount of space and he talks to them about you know you have five each other in the hallway\nAnd if you're going to the movies you see who else wants to come along and if you're going to a football game I Want you and your team jackets and I want you visibly as a group um\nAnd it was something that they were really waiting for it was something that they talk about in retrospect as as being relieved because he gave them the opportunity he gave them a path that allowed them to understand how they had to work together\nWhen this book was being composed by you and written by you was he is founded that he was going to be pretty famous as a result of this\n[laughter] that's very optimistic in terms of the book and its success God writes excess yeah go to a lot of attention along\nWay the team has had it was an interesting thing because then there are two thousand Fifteen season which is this historic season this undefeated season they out score their opponents a hundred and fourteen to seven in the two thousand Fifteen season it's just you know people in America who say I don't like soccer 'cause it's a low scoring game\nThey've never seen Lewis didn't play because this is a team that wins by fourteen or Fifteen points it's a lot of goals\nAnd so my grandma had attention that season from a lot of different places they got some notice they got nationally ranked rights that suddenly they're in USA Today as a nationally ranked team I think the only one from Maine and and one of just two or three from New England so it was a team that had a lot of attention\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nMaine had just never seen before they had this top twenty national ranking and they had this roster that caught a lot of people's eyes\nSo he had some folks talking to him and he thought for a while I reached out to him you know we did the CNN piece which was quick and then I reached out to him and said I I kind of want to go deep and he thought about it and he should have thought about it because I was asking a lot I was asking for access you know flash forty year I'm sitting in the locker room thinking I Can't quite believe I'm here\nDid you establish relationships with each of the players or how does that work\nYeah most of the players you know it was interesting because I created as you should do and as you know you're taught to do it created a research agenda and I thought these are the people I Want to interview and these locations they want to see and I did do those interviews but I also through a lot of my game plan out the window because one of the things that I realized\nWas that I needed to just be in Lewiston I needed to be there I needed to be visible I needed people to feel comfortable to come up to me and talk to me and tell me their stories\nSo it wasn't just I'm going to go to a lot of soccer games and then I'm going to have you you and you sit down it was I'm going to go to the youth track practice today and sit in the bleachers and talked to some of the families and and watch some of the soccer players sisters Ron\nI'm going to go to the football games on Friday nights I shattered my grandma's bio class a lot which when I was in high school all day every day I started calling it the art of hanging out as a research and that's it because I just needed to be there\nAnd relationships crew and I felt really honored that I was trusted with these stories because these are stories you know that the kids would talk about their time and the dog which is you know the largest refugee settlement in the world it's in Kenya\nAnd those who grew up there and remembering their stories of being in the ... remembering their stories of of coming to the United states and what the vetting process was like as refugees thinking about stuff like that and sharing stories about that you know I was\nI was invited into their homes breaking fast with them at Ramadan and and learning about food and I was taught all the time you know how to pronounce this what would you say about this what do you call this and they were incredibly generous an incredibly trusting and those relationships grew and from those relationships the cast of characters sort of found their way\nI've lived here for roads I could go down here but I Want to go down the one where you just raised with it which is that these folks and these kids and their parents had a rough time tell us about\nThere is some stories it's interesting if if you first asked you know what was it like and I I guess this is kind of a stupid superficial\nQuestion and it's not a place you should start what was it like in the refugee camp almost to a person all of the guys would say it was nice and I learned that nice was sort of a cover word that there was a lot behind the word nice\nThat there's things that they don't remember there's things that they remember because people have told them about it and then there's stuff that they remember and they don't want to talk about you know there's some sixty million refugees in the world right now there is a nation full of refugees if you if you look at numbers\nAnd so you know it was the struggle for some of leaving Somalia fleeing Somalia as it was being wracked by\nCivil war and by famine and by drought and by takeovers infections and wars you know war is within wars it was getting family whoever was strong enough to do it over the Kenyan border and\nThen it was surviving in a refugee camp which is a tough thing I'm not doing a justice by saying that but the memories and and some of them are ... who is now a community leader and in Lewiston he's part of a group called main main immigrants\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nImmunity in Lewiston I could do an aggy spent almost two decades right he grew up in a refugee camp in Kenya before finally getting to an Atlanta suburbs and then getting on a bus blind almost and and going to Lewiston because that's where people said that they should go\nSo it puts a lot into perspective thinking about what's important and what's important is family and then what you want for your family which which is you know education and security and safety\nThey play soccer you know they\nDo you play soccer soccer volleyball or the two big sports in the camps because there are simple but they don't play soccer the way that they play soccer in Lewiston necessarily so malicious app do who is\nOne of the stars of the book and and is\nFamous because of his stunning ability to do what's called the front hands spring flip throw\nIn in which instead of just throwing a ball back into play over your head which is the way Ninety nine point nine percent of all soccer players do it mullet actually takes a running start puts the ball down flips over and then propels the ball coming out of a front hands sprang ... grew up\nPlaying soccer in two different refugee camps but they didn't have balls and they didn't have cleats and they didn't have shin guards they would ... material\nAnd plastic and sort of make a makeshift ball wrap it all tight and cloth\nAnd played barefoot in the sand and there's actually a picture of one camp in Kenya of boys playing soccer sort of in the horizon it's a beautiful picture that was taken actually by another Bush or local stash was lucky who had done some work there and the generously gave me some of his photos so in the lives in Lewiston you know his father is a rabbit soccer fan\nHe's playing with his brother there in one of the parks\nAnd the idea you know putting on cleats putting on shin guards putting on a ball having an organized game with time it was a different kind of soccer but there were these use leagues that were largely you know they were there were Lewiston youth leagues there were Somali run youth leagues and these coaches\nThese volunteers people like object here you know taught kids like molested about the regulation game that said\nThe best games to watch in Lewiston and and as much as I Love the list and blue devils and I'd I chair for them as hard as I cheer for the red Sox are the pick up games they play these rock is amazing thirty thirty five people on a side pick up games in the parks\nThat are just joy to watch because there aren't referees making calls and calling penalties and their celebration and\nYou know defenders are scoring goals and goalie exert are running so there's all different kinds of soccer that that these guys are playing and and some of it it's still very much rooted in the the games that they played when they would you know sort of hide from they talk about hiding from police and skipping school to play soccer and the alleys are in the fields\n[laughter] he's just a little a little bit of a media bass about the way in which soccer is structured you just gave us a hint you talking about defenders for example now you know in baseball your first baseman or second baseman that kind of thing do people have positions and soccer\nAbsolutely there's often in defense and then sort of in between those things there are midfielder then midfielder is can go and a couple of different directions there are midfielder who are very attack minded\nSo they are going to create killer plays\nAnd score and more than midfielder is who are more defense minded who are going to hang around near the box the goal you know there's the back line which loosens back line again in two thousand Fifteen only let seven goals through the net there is the goalie who is calling plays the eyes and ears of the team because he has the whole field in front of him\nUm there are the strikers who are that front line who are scoring\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nPlayed soccer as these kids began to fill the rosters I'm In the old days of Lewiston soccer it was very much what's called a direct game um which is kicking chase or or more politically called boot and scoot\nIn which you kick the ball as far as you can and everybody runs as hard as they can to get to it and then you kick it again and you're just moving the ball down the field\nThat changed because the skills that these kids who play all day every day changed it to what's called the possession game and possession soccer is really what we call the beautiful game\nIt isn't about one guy kicking it as far as he can getting it down the field you move the ball laterally horizontally backwards sometimes it's not about distance\nIt goes it's it's one or two touches right per person until the ball moves to the next person and it's fast and it's hard to defend\nAnd he's not a pirate which is something people assume about Somalia and he's not a terrorist and he's not a drug dealer he's a soccer player\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nThousand five hundred people at that state championship in November two thousand Fifteen it's the biggest crowd to assemble for soccer and Maine ever and and that means that it wasn't just the parents of the kids on the field or the friends of the kids on the field it was everybody everybody was there\nAnd show about talking about it as this we moment I think you know it's it's a quiet moment it's not a goal and it's not what have you but I I think it's I think it's the most special moment of that game\nSo I wanted to ask you about coach yeah obviously this group who show up and coaches now got to get to the plate mhm but they're playing their way and he had the old way you described ready who ends up coaching the team\nWell it's interesting because coaches coaches coaches are in charge and I think it speaks volumes as to what kind of person like McGraw is that he make some changes he makes changes and a lot of different ways\nOne of the things he realizes he has to do is listen to these kids that it isn't just him barking orders anymore he needs to hear their feedback he needs to take in what they think you know they play all the time they play in all of these different leagues so they have they have perspective on other players that he needs to listen to because they're constantly scouting\nThey are watching English Premier League all the time studying the game you know they they're constantly replicating moves that they see in the ... which is some of the funnier parts in the book when they bring them to the field\nSo he's got that he also has an assistant coaching squad that is very much part of this story his defensive coach Dan gash is someone who comes from a possession soccer background not a ... not kicking chase\nAnd they will say you know we had a lot of words about this where where ... talks about what kind of soccer he wanted to coach and McGraw is always learning he's a student and it's an amazing thing he's always teaching he's always listening he's always learning and I think it's a very special kind of coach that does that Sudan Gish has an enormous influence\nOn how to utilize the skills of this team to capitalize on what these players are bringing the other amazing component of that is a digital are her see an object of our her seat comes on as an assistant coach um he is the first\nSomali coach hired by Louis athletics\nAnd here's the son of Abdullahi ... D and ... D is really the father of soccer in the new age and Louis and he's the middle school coach so he's the guy who's priming these kids including his own sons to come to McGraw ready\nSo I'll get your bar played for ... and then comes back as an assistant coach and that's an amazing moment for this team because coach can now say something to object a bar who can yell to the kids on the field in Somali because they're talking in Somalia and Arabic on the field\nAnd that's a real weapon because then your opponents have no idea what's going on so I did Jabbar is it is an amazing addition to this team he's a he's an incredible soccer player himself he becomes the freshmen coach so he's taking you know his father of the law he coaches the eighth graders\nEighth graders come to object to a bar in the ninth grade squad and that and some of them make varsity right away um right now one of\nOne of them across great players is below her see who is I'll be Jabbar his little brother and you you have this really strong set up an McGraw understood that he he talks about you know I knew I had to go into the community I had to talk about who these guys are playing with and who these guys are playing for\nAnd I think it speaks volumes to both his head and his heart\nWho happens to how come the ... year colleges that do soccer\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu hear what you do there\nAnd I think you'd have to ask him that but Mike McGraw loves what he does make McGraw is a guy who is up before the sun without an alarm clock he loves teaching he loves coaching and he loves Lewiston and he loves main you know he's again he's someone who gets up without an alarm\nOkay so you know at the end of the movie they always show you what has happened to the various players you know later on when went on to be a Supreme Court justice when we're on to what can you tell us about what has happened to some of these players\nSo some of them like Chabot went off to college and came back that are now working in the community of the age who is\nThe top scoring soccer player in Lewiston history is currently in the middle of his freshman year at the University of Massachusetts low which is a division one soccer team so he had his first season a with low in the fall others are I think the two thousand Fifteen team graduated some fourteen seniors\nAnd I think all of them either went to community college\nCollege or they did a postgraduate Iran prep school I'm In one of the amazing things that you learn from being an athlete from being a really good athlete and being a student athlete in Lewiston really emphasizes the student athlete part you know eligibility academic eligibility citizenship eligibility are very much\nAn important part of what Jason fuller as athletic director and forces with these guys\nIt teaches discipline and it teaches you know they have goals and and these guys are out there getting it\nSoon we go to a different plays soccer is really in in New York but in the United states you think about it we got the baseball we got to put before we got the basketball and we got all these kids everybody my kids everybody else's kids goes out and played soccer how come that doesn't develop into the national sport these other sports are\nYou know [laughter] you know there's a there's a lot going on right now with the men's national team having failed to qualify for the world cup and the firing of you know your inclines been and and things like that I think that way or the United states\nGrows its players from\nYou know in terms of of programs that are in the United states is is something that needs to be re looked at bringing in players versus versus having these development programs in the United states has development programs it's just that you know I think that these kids leave either hopefully the future of of where the United states can go with this because\nYou really can't say that soccer's not popular in the United states anymore it's hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people playing every Saturday and again we're talking about tens of millions of people watching\nThe world cup if you were told me ten years ago that NBC Sports was going to have a contract with the English Premier League I Would have said you were crazy but they do and it does very well on NBC at that\nEvent also have to remember that in women's soccer the United states has been a global power since the very first women's World Cup so\nSo when people say things like well the only safe isn't very good at soccer it's like well the United states women are the best in the world and I've had a strong program for a long time and and that's often been true of Women's Sports because they don't have the\nSame professional outlets that men do so that the body of of who's on a team tends to be a little bit more elite you know the majority of of metal that we're just one in Yung Chang work on for the U.S Scott are women so I think there's a lot of things at play\nIt took a long time for American commercial television to figure out how to make a profit on a game that has no brakes soccer is is a game where you can't very easily modified to to go out for twelve minutes of commercials\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nViable after World War two so soccer is a game without brakes and\nIt's a game that if you don't really understand the intricacies\nOf it you think a lot of nothing happens for a long time because you do have games that ended in ties which drives Americans crazy they want to win or a loser and you have games that might be one to two or something like that because it's it's not necessarily about the scoring and one of the things that I always say is you know if you took American football\nAnd you took away the amount of points that you get for a touchdown and a field goal would be a very low scoring game for the most boring thing that the slow thing that it's nothing saying\nI think that people need to learn how to watch soccer because while their kids are playing it and you know it's a huge sport it just doesn't yet have the commercial cache\nOkay so now let's talk about the R word a little bit you know you got white mane and you got or were being race now you got the Somali kids coming in any reflections of tension over race\nWell yeah it just you know it's interesting because the kids will say like it's so funny and the United states I'm not black I'm Somali\nThat that like they'll talk about you know there are black friends meaning African American um so there's there's interesting sort of divisions that are that are made in terms of identity but but yes if of course there is racial divide as part of this conversation I think that's true for any community um\nAnd I think that that in Lewiston it might\nFeel more overt especially for I think Somali women who who don't necessarily have the same kind of flow into westernized dress as the men do but you know one of the I remember one of the one of the young women saying to me you know it's just\nOne of us walks down the street someone might think that there's a hundred of us\nThat it just gets magnified because of sticking out like that\nBut they don't feel like they stick out anymore and a lot of ways that said you know America had a had a pretty significant turning point in November of two thousand sixteen and in terms of what's considered polite conversation and what isn't\nAnd they feel that they absolutely feel that there is a tension there is an anxiety in this America where the president of the United states might defend a white supremacist group and they feel that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "WAMC Conversation with...",

South Carolina camp outside of Spartanburg said was known as the time as the ... century camp in the country\nBeautiful place but I mean is hell when you say mean how many times can you tell us something of that yeah well it slipped when I got there to slip the third place and they brought in a new commander whose job was to bring it back up the first place as the meanest you mean yes as tough as strict and um\nHe went too far the other way so far the guys were ended up in the hospital he was actually burning the guys out and just it was just thinking I see a nice\nYou were a young Jew and yet in the south [laughter] I've heard a lot of stories about how that was was it was it different\nIt was different and I had been in the south before on the road with a band right so I had already been indoctrinated everything being black and white\nAnd I got thrown off a bunch ones because I like to sit in the back of the busing bus driver threw me off [laughter] and we had a few words besides so I Wish I knew about that I never had any problem a method to as a Jew and the army maybe because uh\nI was good as anybody else in the area was a wire every\nHot tempered character myself and uh I had one incident at the cost to street after that I just never had any problems after that was a it was one fellow was real\nNice guy from Alabama who had never met a true before in his life and this is kind of strange strange to me\nAnd when his wife came to the camp to visit he broke his neck getting us together and the explaining ... heard that this guy is a Jew\nStreaming support for

problems so you're a trumpet player has yeah and you had to audition to get into James he picked fellows union didn't Oh yes indeed and how does that work I mean you you went down down there and they tested you didn't\nYeah back in those days are they too were I think there were a little harder on me because of my brother but I sat in front of the three guys and they just kept throwing stuff on the music stand and you cite read it off you play it that's it theoretically\nThey say if you carry your union card you should be able to go to any kind of a job and play any kind of a music because you're a professional and that's the reason for it\nSo here you are a very fine trumpet player your brother was in Harry James is banned yet rich and you met her games oh yeah nice to nice guy and a new now drafted did you ever think that they might use you in an army band\nWell when I was drafted you take a bunch of tests and after the chest I was sitting in front of the sergeant and he was going through my papers and he said are you did very well on these test you can do almost any job you want in disarming I should I Would like to get into a band [noise]\nAnd he said they're all closed I said well uh ... what do I do now he says well you can be a builder that'll keep your neck like\nI said fine put me in a zip uber you see this was actually a very stupid move because on your part oh yeah yeah because I really didn't know that if you were in World War two was your scout and message center runner how really that's not a good job to have\nDid you do Los ... or unraveling\nEnough I was kind of lucky I didn't touch the horn during basic training because you're bringing with you know I don't know I didn't bring it with me 'cause I didn't know what was going to happen\nAnd we were sent to the specialist side of the camp so the first seven weeks you'll get the infantry training you're supposed to get in fourteen weeks\nAnd then the next seven weeks you're supposed to go and learn the code converter and Mr center where and how to scout and all this other stuff or after the first seven weeks they said you have a ... for a weekend to go to town\nBut on Monday we start to seven weeks over again because they need rifleman overseas they don't need special rush so it took a few days to gather the troops who went over the hill right\nBecause of that first seven weeks was a killer so I don't regret it because I was flying to and I was hired as a rock and I did everything an inch think and it really helps me when I got into the eye and her up and show\nWell not jumping ahead too far but you saw a lot of guys die in that and that actually live right next to you right now all our platoon had a Seventy five percent turnover whoa\nWe'll Richard and I think I should point out that we're talking to Richard Mara which who for one of the better description is the man who found Hitler's hat and who took revenge on that hat and that story is coming up as we go further so now they send you over right I mean you've just\nTo say I think there's a high percentage of choosing I end up with two of the twenty eight men three were Jewish herb Herman should Schaffner in me and none of us ever had a problem\nI listen to them with a twenty eight guys who got jeeps and who went to find the enemy to recall pixilated if you're just joining us at that come back and report where the enemy was but to engage the enemy or just supposed to look at them you're supposed to engage\nWell yeah well I mean you find them and sometimes they find you before you find them you know you've come out of the woods or on the road and you make a little turn on the road and then they on somebody's firing at you you know she's just happens that way should was or was it a kooky guy but dead serious\nIt was like one solid group that uh there were no weak spots now you had a German and your platoon oh French I had to go back to the CPA to pick him up he came over as a ... a command post [laughter]\nI had to pick him up he was a replacement so I've gotten a jeep went to the command post and a bunch of guys on a two and a half ton truck and I called out to Fritz crank color\nAnd this guy came out of this truck\nHe looked German he sounded Germany still had a little accent\nHis father got them out of Germany at the end I mean the ... after that the doors really playing chef so he went to the states she went to school um it wasn't a German Jews the German German yeah German and\nHe's got drafted in center back we needed guys like him because he was a great interpreter so I picked him up on a jeep going back to the platoon he should to me what am I supposed to do I have family here I have\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family

I'm the next day we get into a skirmish\nThe Germans have is pretty well pinned down hollering for us to give up popped up gay but and and the fridge didn't know what the hell do first he dropped his weapon\nGetting out of the jeep I had a forty five which I wouldn't wish on anybody I didn't want to have a French what was wrong with the forty five to forty five automatic you couldn't hear the bright side of a bar [laughter] I'll tell you the truth I fired at the brush started up a barn and missions [laughter] actually half\nDejected from the side and it was such it kicked your arm you know way over to the side and and um I picked up a German Lugar\nThis was a gorgeous beautiful will machine magnificent weapons where'd you get it off of the German that didn't need it anymore and if you and if you take ... votes to OU Idaho thing holster has a couple of extra clips couple of extra grips in a\nGreat piece of work and somebody in my wife's family was undergoing business for a while and he paid a visit one day and I should take a look at somebody if it's any good\nHe says it's phenomenal he broke it down\nAnd you know those things are hand their hands in their hand finished that was a\nLugar's and departure all numbered and all the numbers matched he says this is a great place he says you don't lose this he says if you get rid of it get a lot of money for it so um it was great that I don't give away you know that is\nBut after we got through it you will the getaway jeep took off and came back with\nYou you jumped ahead won the getaway huh the last jeep and the line is called the ...\nThey are driving down the road there are several how many ... twenty eight men seven seven James and the last guy school to get away get why\nBecause if I mean the first jeep usually what you know gets the problem the from the beginning of the column or that's where the lieutenant rides and I'm no\n... no no no most of the time to return it is with us I see most of the time believe it or not we don't even operate full strips we operate to squads three jeeps twelve men in each squad\nUnparalleled roads and the lieutenant follows behind keeps in touch with ... by radio and follows as we've given the grid coordinates and all this other stuff and he knows approximately where we are\nAnd if he gets a call from somebody else because he's got the big radio to six Ninety four from headquarters that or something else should be looked at and he'll swingers but we've we get into Jim ... whether it's a squad or whether it's the whole platoon\nThe last cheapest called a getaway jeep and\nThat jeep generally can get away and go back for help so in this case\nTo get away she took off came back with a rainbow rangers and together we were able to wipe out the machine gun shy and whatever else was around and that same day I was in the morning that same day we get into this village they didn't give us too much trouble\nThere were a few snipers around push arrested a village where it was a very small village and Fritz was running up and down the\nStreet crying and screaming and German calling them everything you could think of and I'm from that day from that day on Fritz was not bashful he would shoot at anything that moves relatives are not so\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and

saying that evidence in other words instead of saying we used to we did you say we and then you use the present tense we've fire it than we do this\nWhat is that you know there are ... are you still was it had second impact that it is still present for you um maybe some things but I don't think all all of that job but these are you know you you just can't possibly forget um how that you can these guys I bet you can't so\nNow here you are and you're advancing food Germany and uh I'm interested in something I've heard a lot of stories over the years about not taking prisoners about ss men who you\nFound in essence man or people found as men and they killed I once had a music teacher who would tell me some of these stories from the infantry\nIs itself it happened not with everybody and not not all the time it happened on occasion\nEverybody ... you know talks about atrocities like we never cause any you know which is nonsense if you are you go ahead and you draft\nMillions of guys and you train them to kill some of them would have been killers if you didn't draft him and train them in the first place [laughter] now you're giving them the ammunition and the equipment you\nKnow some guys you're just a fraction off their rocker show you put them in in in a situation where they can do damage um\nWho's controlling it show there were atrocities on both sides nowhere near what the Japanese chairs or nowhere near what the Germans did maybe button there were things that happened\nWe were able to differentiate between the common German soldier and a stopover ss person\nOh it was a huge difference in the regular German soldier to very much they were like gosh they didn't want to be there either so [laughter]\nBut the S. S. were impossible\nThey were just absolutely impossible and they try to get away with stuff too and if I'm if an ss men step that align most of the guys wouldn't hesitate you mean after they were captured yeah do we tell you to do period and ... and they say but at ... let me give you\nBack a little bit because people tune in and out and I just want to announce that we're talking to Richard ... who's an American soldier from the intelligence and reconnaissance with two of the rainbow division during World War two\nBut he's gained some fame as the man who found Hitler's happy not to trivialize that at all because the rest of your experiences may have even been more important than this highly symbolic thing which happened then we're getting there\nNow you're moving ahead in Germany\nIs some dramatic things happened what were some I think the most dramatic or was um concentration camp and not something you knew nothing of right no no no no no\nLittle villages had three or four\nPrisoners who they use to clean the streets and all that stuff mhm some camps are cold there were hundreds if not thousands of sub camps that we ran across those are who are those prisoners Jewish or China in Greek um\nOr maybe even German surely Israel's labor labor really she actually of labor they even had the striped uniforms as the same as they had in the concentration camps but there were relatively good\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot

a little easier and we're getting more prisoners used more easily\nPeople who are sort of falling and yeah I've heard stories that a lot of those prisoners wanted to make sure they were taken by the Americans and not by the Russians the investment\nOh yeah oh yeah because the Russians were knocking 'em off like crazy we weren't anywhere near that area of the guys who are\nCloser to Berlin you know closer to where the Russians were ... you know more about that than I Would because we didn't come in contact with the Russians really should but one very early in the morning we were shook out of\nBed in and brought into the command post and um there were two German soldiers there and they gave us new maps and they said these two Germans were recently over the road from where we are to jacko\nThat she will [laughter]\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC

was no no real resistance no problem but it was it was on the other hand it was very\nEerie blue or the other Americans in there before you\nKnow buddy we were the first ones in no kidding just love of his well now the bridges were blown I forgot the name of the river that goes through Munich a there was one Bridgette wasn't blown and that was a foot bridge just wide enough for a cheap to go across and you had to go up a lot of steps [laughter]\nYeah like the steps in front of the Capitol in Washington\nTo get to the bridge so we put the ... in four wheel drive low low and we went up the steps across the bridge and down the other side and we got to Hitler's house and we've been down to the door and finally this tall stately woman with pepper and short hair\nCalling us from rough eons\nShoes and wanted to know what everybody's why everybody was so mad and Mr Hitler he was such a fine man so herb shed rich I'm throwing her down and he is another word I Can't use in between there just stares and um\nI should forget about it let us do we have to do and get the hell out of here so we are in it's a different rooms or by the way\nIt is an apartment house it was it was it how it\nWas it was a an apartment really it was a I don't think it was quite a like maybe a townhouse not even a town I was more than an apartment I it was nothing classy about at all do this is the place where he met with Chamberlain and all of the other big shots\nAh this was his favorite place to Munich was his home just as you know this was this\nThis this is where he was comfortable to furniture was plain but rich I mean he stole the best there's no two ways about it but it wasn't or ... or ... or anything like that everything was there the pictures were on the wall so I ran into a bedroom and I didn't know which is although the furniture was great\nAnd I pulled open all the drawers and they were empty and I went over to the closet which was empty and I saw something dark on an upper shelf so I dragged over a chair climbed up cut this gorgeous had looked inside saw age now this is a top hat top hat\nShop at ... H pictured is heading had showed on the floor jumped off the chair on the hat and stops at too about when it was about\nEight or nine inches high it ended up about three quarters of an inch high have you ever regretted that moment of something I had no no as a matter of fact you're angry owing more than that\nAnd then afterwards after I realized you know still but it was um when I walked out at a room with his hat on strutting around\nAnd I didn't remember it as either Herman Herman reminded me of this joined a little stick on of\nCharlie Chaplin doing a Hitler Hitler I don't remember it but that's what hurts it I guess so I Believe her the whole day was a strange day you know of course shortly after that the rest of the troops came in and uh that was the end the Munich\nRichard you've been quoted many times is saying that you think you may have indirectly been responsible for Hitler suicide I Know what you go but could you tell us about\nYes sometime after I got to ... somebody said to me what about to go incidents of view stumping on Hitler's hat on April thirtieth\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nFive the same day that Hitler and Eva Braun his girlfriend committed suicide in a bunker in Berlin and I should naturally when he heard that some skinny Jewish kids stumps all over his favorite heck he committed suicide and which do it ...\nWell I put it in my duffel bag word got around and it finally reached division headquarters by this time the war was over I was wondering if that was part of it\nAnd finally reach division headquarters and I'm just like two or three weeks after the war was over and as a photographer for division photographer showed up at regimented headquarters company and\nInquired who is not that had had and they pointed to him and me and he uh uh I was in the house that we took over for our bullets and he took the picture me with a hat on\nAnd which ended up in the division history book and that's pretty strange too because for years for fifty some odd years\nPeople were looking in the division history book and seeing this picture of this cuckoo with Hitler's head on they didn't know if this had with a hat on for the head with a cold ... knows\nFor those who are listening simulated Charlie Chaplin and you know the little dictator looking you looked like Hitler yeah the ... the ones that in ...\nMustache and they didn't know what the picture was doing in the book because they forgot the caption it ... and it wasn't until\nNineteen Ninety five actually\nWhen I went to a reunion reunion that year was in Seattle is there any and every year every year and nobody machines if they can if they can get their anyhow like Howard is on oxygen twenty four hours a day and he comes to every ... really yeah and it comes with an oxygen tank no you you can't bring your own oxygen onto an airplane\n... brings them to the airplane with the accident and he has to hook into the airplanes oxygen Denny has to have to call the head make all the arrangements ahead\n... ... where every child he's in for example Seattle some oxygen and play some Seattle has to meet him at the plane and hook 'em in and let me ask you go to the hotel where they have already delivered all the oxygen bottles of the knees but he would not miss every will not miss you know will you\nUnfortunately I've been getting um in contact with a son he's been having you've been very sick for the last\n... months he's been in and out of the hospital in his last three weeks he's been in the hospital and so\nHe is in bad shape but he's a hell of a guy\nSo you're in possession of Hitler's that did not last question I've always been interested in since I found out about you did the army have any feelings about people taking things like Hitler that\nWell if they did they didn't say anything [laughter] I'll tell you first of all I don't know if anybody um I Know the division headquarters and do it and I know all I got to do it but but everybody's got souvenirs and nobody tried to muscle and the only thing you had to do\nIt would have been different if you took a van Gogh off the wall right\nWell you know I Know some guys with that too [laughter] well let me put it this way general Harry James Collins yeah from Howard I received a he was our division commander I received a um\nOh by the way after the war never came back to the states who did general heritage a column no kidding of the rainbow division yeah and I never knew why accepted he did marry a German woman okay but that's still snow excuse correct\nBut Howard sent me an article out of out of a mid western newspaper about Harry James Collins\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot

in these castles he dead he's that\nThat's always his wife or and what are the guys went to Europe last year and he's he brought me back a picture that he took of we call them Hollywood Harry 'cause he wanted a scarf and all that [laughter]\nAnd ah of his grave I says I really didn't do shit [laughter]\nBut now you've found Hitler's hack mhm and you have used it first of all the Jewish war veterans exhibit in in Washington they voted for a couple of years right yeah and they told you to hold onto it as I remember the story because because what\nOh what it was supposed to go down I I received a call from the museum and they said don't send that down yet\nBecause some skinheads walked into the museum and she had been on ... searching three local channels or the night that we had the little ceremony get the Jewish community center at one time when he was at\nWhere I was officially M. lending the hat to the museum of museums and show all the three channels showed up show the ... the skinheads the Nazi organizations to far right they all have\nTheir own sophisticated everybody owns computers you know and I'm sees a skin has walked into the museum and we should we should we understand that you have something coming down from Albany New York and so the museum said we're going to beef up security been rebuilding a special case for your head\nOr so waiting to recall you that it's all done before you had to do that and then they did it and did you go down to watch the I went down I went down for the opening of the the new exhibits that it was part or people interested in it\nUh yeah I kept getting called first they said they wanted for three or four months and then they said they do we hold it a few more months and then you just kept going on until till two years
