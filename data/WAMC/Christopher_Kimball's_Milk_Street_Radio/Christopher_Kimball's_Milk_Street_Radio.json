in our family settled in Texas before Texas was part of the u._s. um that using the local ingredients and more kind of\nMexican influenced cooking styles and dishes and food that\nIs Mexican but it's also Texan and it's really fundamentally a regional cuisine of\nTexas so there are a few ingredients that really a defined Tex Mex ... versus let's say traditional Mexican cooking what what would be some of those ingredients\nSo interestingly one of those ingredients is human in San Antonio there's actually\nA small but significant population people who came from the Canary Islands and the thought is that there's so much human in Chile and therefore started moving forward a lot of Tex Mex cooking because of the influences that specific cuisine of the Canary Islands\nAnd the chili pit

lot of people have written the Taco Bell et cetera had an adverse effect on Tex Mex\nBecause branded Tex Mex is being fast food or cheap food so Tex Mex whether one direction at least for a while and

knows but ah in December Seventy five you became to food critic clear at times and uh the person who hired you was a woman who didn't think a woman should be the food critic for the New York times is that correct\nOr not quite the woman who wouldn't hire may was a woman of an ardent feminist and it took five more years for Joan ... men who was then the editor of the section to call me up and asked me to come in for an interview\nThe woman who wouldn't hire me did not hire may name where Charlotte Kurdish the woman who did hire me was Joan Whitman and of course hired by the editor of the paper Abe Rosenthal\nYou still remember both of those names [laughter] well ... fortunately for all votes you became a critic uh first of all it's a very artificial way of eating 'cause you go with the crowd everybody wonders different foods you get to taste you can't just enjoy one thing or two things you have to try to eat everything obviously has critic [laughter]\nIs that something you eventually get used to and and get to like or is it always a a burden that as you would prefer not to have to do that\nI never mind that I rather enjoyed it because I was really interested to know

not to have to do that\nI never mind that I rather enjoyed it because I was really interested\nTo know what I Would find out and I think when you do it that way you kind of know how to separate flavor is in your mind it was however something that I knew I had my husband and once in a while when we went out together he said do you think we could eat the same thing tonight and have a ship experience\n[laughter] yeah well it sounds like me [laughter]\nSo we did but unless it was a restaurant like Chinese or in the end where people often do go with crowds uh\nWas never more than four people and usually just my husband and myself on the first try to see what's going to be worth reviewing before we filed a lot of people and expense into it\nI Know that other critics after you at the times got a lot of ... about dressing up in disguises but you were the I think the first one to really do that I I Love this quote a ... you said even before the Internet and I was recognized a few times\nThey are very few things more embarrassing to show up in a way glasses and have the owners say quote good evening Mr\n[laughter] exactly I I Would say [laughter]\nYou didn't know what should I flip off they'll do eggs should I you know play its ... third and I had glasses and wigs I didn't I didn't wear strange outfits though\nNow let's talk about one of my favorite topics a crowd sourcing vox pop you lie cetera you're pretty clear that today I think you quote we have a lot of voices and I think are not worth listening to particularly ones from consumers which really like Yelp and so on are\nSo right I I actually agree with you but maybe you could take on the burden of explaining why you think you're right\nWell first of all I don't know how qualified they are to have a trustworthy opinion but even more I have never seen and I'm willing to be wrong on this I have never seen any such service require proof that the person has been a good point\nI have gotten in the past not for a long time justice on a mailing list for example many years ago\nThe question asked from the gap saying asking me to be a response to do with all the things to fail and\nAnd I thought how do they know if I'd been there I've even asked Tim's that gap that and he said we have a way to which I say baloney because you could just a ... if it's a friend who owns the restaurant a relative\nOr if you just want to sound often use you repeat that kind of rating from your local credit just to have a voice in there so\nI don't really care what those people say\nYeah that that's true I mean social media you see all sorts of strange comments and their access to the ground all over\nSo let's talk about casual dining I think you and I come out of the same place you walk into a restaurant in the first

of help on the floor\nI might notice if a lot of people at the table seem agitated and I'm moving around a lot I Would certainly notice how many tables are empty\nI might notice the overall age of the people I might notice if there are serving stations around the room I'll tell you a funny story about that there is a super\nGreek Dinah in Chicago known as little Mitchell's and it's right near the Merck until exchange in the stock exchange and it opens four or five in the morning because the traders are working with people in Asia and so on\nAnd the food is just larger than life at the breakfast and I went one morning alone because I was writing about Chicago restaurants I went around eight thirty and I have to stand on line a little and does he does the owner or his manager gives out little boxes of\nI'm a\n... a candy what do they call it any way to to women\nStanding on the line and finally after about Fifteen minutes I became the head of the line and the manager came over to me and said where is your place\nAnd I said what place and he said you're a restaurant I said I don't have a restaurant what makes you think so he said the way your eyes were working the room\nThat I really didn't for [laughter] it's like Campbell or in a casino like [laughter] you know look around and milk\nThat is what they gave out in the little boxes to any lady on the line\nAnd you know it was super food everybody who ordered breakfast Scott cooked prone in a slice of orange and a little cup of yogurt no matter what you would if I imagine it's still the same but it was wonderfully observant of this man to notice my eyes working\nThe room mark I I'm ... you'd like Joel rubber Shaw or in his cooking when you talk about his famous potatoes with a pound a butter and a pound of cooked puree potatoes but he had a great quote I'm a ...\nAnd will always be one could you just explain what that means and why you thought that was so wonderful\nSo I don't know how they're used to do it in Italy but it doesn't work now here so we bought this in the kitchen would we do\nSo critically really took the wind out of the equation in fact we took all the liquid out of the equation\nAnd so we have really hit pieces of beef they're two inch chunks of these really heavily seasoned with salt and especially pat her and we put that in a pot with some aromatic and no liquid here the only liquid that we're going to use to ... comes from the meat itself\nThere's no wind no water no bras nothing to kind of do the flavor so you end up with a really concentrated meat juice\nAnd you're not such a thing that made before you put it in just you cook the ... a little bit then put the meat and when you're not doing anything else to leave before because\nNot we found a really cool way to kind

just you cook the ... a little bit then put the meat and when you're not doing anything else will be before because there\nWere not that we found a really cool way to kind of get the flavor of saw tend to me without actually having to do the work which you know we love around here\nSo instead of cooking at the whole time covered we take the cover off after a couple of hours and let it cook for the last hour uncovered and that allowed us to get some browning underneath there that you would have gotten if you were taught to hate it at the beginning but without all the work\nSo what about the one to the ones not in the ones waiting in the wings but it's going to come back to the right to be at the end I Hope\nIt does so what we found was if we added the wine at the beginning really diluted not only the flavor of the sauce economy the meat tastes a little weird as well\nSo we waited until the very end to add that so we take the meat out of the pot strain off the juices we had the wine let that cook for a little while and then add those strange meat chooses to that and really creates a really nice flavorful rich sauce\nSo this recipe the trucks can be from peppered through almost no prep work cook a little use tomato paste the beat in three hours of the up and take it a reduced some warning through that in and you're done\nIt's amazing and it takes quite a taste so good when

I really appreciate all of that you and Chris expose this too and provide thank you I like to cook and I really um I read something new and I want to try you know these new global type recipes\nMy question for you is what some pantry staples that would bring in a more global fair that I could use regularly and like\nOh boy yeah we're going to have to pick and choose you asked us to limit it and that's hard it's like well you want to start with spice blends first and then move on those are I mean I think\nThe spices the most people don't have the sitar which is based on while time but it's got lots of stuff in it I think is the most versatile youthful spice blend in the world outside sesame seeds and for Mac\nYeah ensue Mac would be another thing it's a very used to be used almost in place of lemon it's our but it's also lemony great on tomatoes you can use it on almost anything\nCoriander seed not ground coriander is something most people do have around I think is also really useful\nI'm going to put in a bed for a pet ... ... that's really great also because for vegetarians you know when you can add bacon or smoked salmon or some sort of port product you can add smoked ... had to give it a little bit it's nothing you can\nBuy India they have these little tens which have smaller tens in them for spices ... and you can buy one of those tell them it's all and you can keep in that ten sort of the old purpose spices and spice blends so for example\nAt breakfast I'll take the ten out and put some sitar and some pepper or something on it and you can dress up eggs you can dress up anything\nNext is pantry items I think teeny is literally a must yeah and me so\nDanny by the way it goes gray with chocolate hurry to yes absolutely mix it with Greek yogurt for ... for example or as the sandwich spread me so it was a great soup base white meat so for chicken or ed and isolate the fish when you're young yet\nAnd then my last generation would be pomegranate molasses which you can find almost everywhere it's our and it's sweet you can use it and I use it in a salad dressings just a little bit any kind of dressing or you can drizzle it over meet after its cook\nOr ice cream or ice cream anywhere you use a good quality ... can you see a pomegranate molasses I also want to throw in a vote for ... ... can they provided smoking is Anna wonderful heat\nTo other simple things if you buy whole human seed if you get a pepper Grider putting coarse salt and then putting human seat\nSo instead of salt and pepper your rights seller in human yeah and that is just for a general purpose way to improve your cooking you really can't beat that\nAnd then the last thing is have really big Critz seat Salter Florida seller molten salt\nJust to finish food or would that crunch and you get a lot of mileage off that that's a good start yeah okay that is a great start at one life thing if you want to be a little exotic bite or if a pepper you are FA you have to bite on line it's a soft damp pepper in sort of flakes\nAnd chocolate ... and rich not too hot you know it goes on a lot of dishes just a few little tricks like that can\nMake your cooking so much better so

might get range recently went out and needs replacing I got it bad for how much it would cost ... kitchen which is going to be about a hundred and Seventy five dollars\nSo I'd like to know your opinion I never cooked on a gaffe strange but I Know it generally preferred by professionals that knowing that extra cost I Would encourage half is luxury is it worth it\nWell when we built out the ... street kitchens a couple of years ago for a variety of reasons we couldn't use all gas cook tops we had to use ... for many of them\nAnd I was not a fan of that but we did in Seoul induction it turns out induction\nWorks very well it heats up fast uh it's not any slower than gas I prefer dial you know and I like to see the gas but once you get used to the controls than it does a terrific job it's also safer because you're not going to buy yourself so I Know anyone ...\nChristmas you know an induction is yet and that it ...\nAnd the point is that it heats up the pan through magnetism through the metal\nIn the pan so that only the pan heat's not really the burner and it really hates it efficiently and you can get it high and get it low very quickly and here's the thing about induction you'll save money in the long run because\nIt's the most energy efficient of all forms of heat and cooking 'cause the heat only goes into the pan gap is the least efficient cars the flames go out on the side that he goes out on the side it's not contained and electric it's better than gas but induction hands down the best so you'll probably save money and otherwise\nIt's just the one thing I Would look out for is the controls 'cause I've used a bunch of these some of the control you know used to be like in my day like in a car you'd have a radio which has station control in volume

a on a small budget so\nThis whole concept of cooking from scratch with foreign because I had to be creative I had to think of a new way to create this food that I Love and I want it to taste but that

recreate the dishes that I end the generally due to lack of the continued gradients\nThat clearly I'm having issues with the issues that are in their smaller slightly sweeter and of course anchor the north American ... but they don't just color like red onions do after long cooking and they're far less sweet than the daily as a ...\nShow with onion for ... like a ... or even something in the background like a butter chicken\nYou end up with a great career you if you attempt to lead ins or accordingly me\nCurry if you go with ... or something like that or just something that's true sure of it usually is just too many onions you're using standard larger American yellow one\nLet me ask a question ... yellow onions are sharp when they're raw but in our testing it milk street we find they actually turn sweet do you find is just the amount of on you or do you find the yellow onions are still two overpowering when cooked a ...\nYou know what it's a bit of both but you just end up with a completely different volume of onions solid\nI Know is there is going to say so yeah he knows what I'm saying well how about ... ... you know they are sweeter than a yellow onion but not playing Lee sweet\nI you know we tried to ... it's just not the same the flavor is very different\nI mean if you're big complaint is volume I Would think just a yellow onion and to use less as simple as saying\nI Would think getting the spices right and using spices into teaching them and doing all the things you should do will make much more different than what they're using yellow or to paint canyon right I mean that's really the crux of it hopefully next to you agree with that assessment I\nWould agree with that and you know as the sort of side bars here is also the total lack of availability of genuine Kashkari chili which ends up being introduced many of those careers where you've got his division that color and everyone tries to approximate it with a kind of the past week blunt that's what you\nKnow yeah I got to make sense you know one serious cook I Want to come to your house [laughter] wow [laughter]\nWe're ... we do our own fermenting I'm I'm building a salami cave actually out

[noise] I didn't find them hard [laughter] but I was ashamed that I did that and um [noise]\nI thought that I was I was being let go from the school because of that incident but in fact it was instead because I was wearing rather risk cake blast [laughter] a see through blouse [laughter]\nAnd then you went on to other things so let's talk about your parents you said um there was a wonderful thing you wrote about your mother before she dies you said speaking to you you live the life I wanted to live so ... what what does that mean\nWell she was a communist [laughter]\nUm and um she just felt very strongly about how much money people should man he can and it sort of ... really was I'm thinking about [noise]\nAbout distributing things equally among everyone and I think she saw me\nTaking those ideas I had to learn them during the free speech movement in Berkeley in the sixties and she was she instead of other parents other parents were afraid of their kids involved in those demonstrations and my mother was so proud of\nAnd as it turns out his personal chef was really teach me basic rustic facility and cooking and this was one of the dishes she taught\nThe minute I walked into her kitchen I was just blown away by the richer Rome is a federal and Rosemary and garlic and it turns out that what she had done is frozen ... into a pot that had been soaked overnight\nFor some while federal but she grabbed from the driveway of the winery\nA ton of Rosemary and garlic cook them away and when the deans were done to Austin some pasta started altogether and it was a rage is good for such a simple collection of ingredients that have such an amazing flavor profile there were layers of richness and ... and yet there was no dairy and\nSo why is different than the eighty nine versions we've all been through\nI think the problem with most versions is that the focus is on the basics here the beans are kind of like a starchy counter punch to the rich federal the rich Rosemary and the garlic I mean those are really the dominant flavors that you're getting and they're married in this kind of like starchy liquid from the beans and from the pasta itself\nAnd said the result is really rich and creamy an aromatic and again for such a simple group of ingredients it just has an amazing impact in flight\nSo I assume when we got back here did you make any alterations so that we did we made a couple of\nFirst of all we simplified it for week Nike's we use can beings and we were very happy with the results because in part the can't have that structure water you need to get the creamy sauce that we were looking for\nThe other thing we did was we found was a little heavy and we wanted to lighten it up a bit and I'd eaten the dish a second time elsewhere is asleep and that time the woman making it added some tomatoes which we like so we borrowed that to kind of bring a little bit of a city to it\nAnd finally we felt that a little bit of lemon juice and lemon zest also help tie everything together is right and also really played well with\nThe Rosemary so political social and like I say I'm you know a basic recipe but now authentic and a much more interesting yeah and also not very difficult no very simple jammed thinking if they give you can find this recipe in all of our recipes one Seventy seven milk street dot com\nI'm Chris Kimball you're listening to milk

million different kinds of things if you were to describe it is there a way to describe it to make sense or is just too diverse\n[noise] um the way to describe it makes sense says to accept that it's complicated and a moving target somewhat um and and that you can shape parameters around it but those parameters some time shift also ah the territory that I looked at\nEnded at West Virginia and it goes down and shoot the northern edge of South Carolina I'm In the mountains of north Georgia and Alabama and of course ah Kentucky and Virginia and Tennessee and North Carolina\nAnd if I left anybody out please don't hurt me [laughter] um and so so even the geographic definition a can stretch and come together\nDo you you drove a van regular right you're driving I have a van it's a Chevy astro are [laughter] so how many miles how long you set out to do this trip the pilgrimage um what were you looking for and how long were you doing\n[noise] honestly I'm not sure what the ... which is at one point I said four thousand miles and then I started looking back at my records and it's really a lot more than that so it was quite it was it was very literally in Germany you know the subtitle is an Appalachian Journey what's recipes\nAnd that was important to me because a lot\nOf what is written and has been written about um the people in the culture and the food ways of Appalachia\nWell a lot of comments from one person's perspective and their family but there are their experiences in Appalachia and I wanted this book to reflect those as well we hear the mythology of Appalachia is that we are right this monoculture hum\nThe current iteration of this is that we're all scotch Irish and we're all irritated\nUm [laughter] and we are irritated but mostly because everybody thinks Rob scotch Irish [laughter] um so they're they're actually the last census\nThere are more people in southern Appalachia who identify as Latino are African American men are who identify as being predominantly scotch Irish\nAnd part of my point in my interest is that if you look at the food way\nYou can start to pick apart the complexity and see all the strands of it and see how it comes together and it will challenge um some of the sanctions that we've made many of the assumptions that we've made about ...

com\nBack yeah [laughter] and and let me let me explain\nA chili Brian is not a chili dog that's the first thing to understand there's no hot dog in it it is a very fine grained spicy\nChili mixture hamburger mix here that it was packed into a hotdog bond with onion and with mustard and the texture it's extremely important that it's not like a sloppy Joe if it's not kind of slurping around the area it's in there being I'm\nFrom and the best way to think about those as this this this is a dish that was to my knowledge born in the pool halls and what you want to think about is if you're in that pool hall and you know the other guys running the table and you need something to eat\nYou don't want something what Chile on your hands right yeah you don't want to get something hot and and that but a little bit of Greece won't hurt you know might make your slide a little better\nSo let's talk about some more food you know this really through\nThe ... sweet and savory banana pudding it had powder jolt of the custard okay I can forgive you though but has red meat so red ... no no wait a minute now that's that's a that's a ... thing but you're from red meat so into a savory banana put in what's going on\nAnd well we are being first of all true to the Appalachian palate one of my mother's favorite terms\nAbout taking a food food that went from pretty good too oh yeah yeah buddy ... she would say it had a wind to it and I and I think joined me Chris I'm campaigning to make that an official coronary term ... what is weighing mean\nWell I think that the best way to describe it is it is kind of those\n... accent a sour and salty and maybe a little bit of sweet that just elevates whatever you're eating up to another level doesn't dominate you know it comes in underneath and it sort of raisins it up\nIt's like a good bluegrass ... singer\nRight now I'm heading into the kitchen milk street to chat with editorial director James Hirsch about this week's recipes pesto general\nJim how are you I'm doing great today it's pesto day it is a and many of us and the food world and made it Eighteen different ways over time\nBut it never is anything like what you get in Italy and I always thought that was well kids are base was better than ours but you went to Italy you have to figure this out the general and I guess it turns out it's not just the ingredients it's how you make it is it is and\nYou know one of the the most important lessons as always was that we do everything wrong [noise]\nFirst of all our ratios ingredients for way off in general walk garlic is almost an afterthought in pesto in the United states it tends to be very dominant flavor but it's really supposed to be more like salt and just heightened the other flavors we don't use nearly enough ... they tend to use it by the Bush will we tend to be much more minimalist with that\nAnd we use way too much olive oil they use much less and that's because they spend their pesto with pasta coconut water which of course produces a thicker more luxurious sauce we think we have to finish beforehand that doesn't work\nI also learned that we get the order wrong and the order in which you add the ingredients are either ... or ... or in our case into a food processor really matters because if you put the nasal for example into soon you're gonna over process that are over ... and that's going to give you the wrong finished consistent\nSo your goal here is to get a pass to this pretty dry it's not the green sauce right it's dry\nIt's actually spread about whether it's before it's been married to pasta and we think of it\nAs a soft before it touches the pasta but really if it's that lose then you've added to much olive\nOil and in general pessimism custard done I feel it's been added to pasta with some of the pasta water then it's considered pass or not is considered a complete but that's why I say we are way too much all of them are we supposed to be dinner at an earlier state so\nWhat's the order of the ingredients okay the order is very important again 'cause you don't want to over process the ingredients you start out with the garlic to find out to salt and you're going to reduce that too and I find face that he's usually distributed through the faster\nThan we had our cheeses you want them finally ground add those in and again you add those to the high end up in the garlic you make a nice smooth consistency with a little bit of granular already from the chiefs now the biggest will goes it but what are the things we learned is that we couldn't just dumped the biggest ally and like they do in Italy reason is they use smaller more tender base and there\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com a no ... no ... dog harness invented to make

but\nThe solution is pretty simple we just chop it up by hand on a cutting board and then added to the food processor give it a couple of pulses and we're done\nI Would assume anyone in general we use food processors just as probably persona non grata so is this is good as what you had an journal\nWrote it lacks the romance of ... with a mortar and tough so but I Would say we're Ninety five percent of right there we modified it enough with the war that we're getting really close and I got to say it is delicious so\nJim ... converted to the food processor Ninety five percent is good at least as

also for the sesame oil\nIs she ... to nuts or just sucks for me\nTo the actual sesame seed\nSo ... you know an almond butter would be okay for example\nOn better I think with the okay the hummus I think was a little bit easier question we also heard that if you ate potentially that could help with the flu is I don't know if you ever heard of that\nIt's also a flavor issue though I think a little bit right yeah like a lot yeah\nYou know um I agree I think I'm In butter would be great for some other nut butter yeah\nAs for the component in Asian cooking you could try toasted pumpkin seeds oil\nOh it's okay it's a wonderful ingredient added dark and it's just you and me and I think that would work but I Do is very strong now so but you know be light toasted sesame seed or I'll be

I mean what do they do within that yeah I Would go get the right stuff\nBut by the way I Do have a question I assume it's a very specific type of corn growing for this right it's a field corn or like the kinds of field corn I mean who's to say\nRight that was another thing that came up we grew and Italian variety\nI Can't remember the name of it off the top of my head but I did notice the colonel's look a little bit more like popcorn but it's marketed as a Flint core and like something you know what you are or pull into we've made cornbread with it and things like that so that was another thought that I wondered if that\nWould make it more difficult to make most of what the the colonel's we're a little bit smaller points here kind of help popcorn is\nYou know you can buy muscles [laughter] I mean you're you're ... let me just to understand that you're doing this because it's in either perfectly agree with you this is just a cool thing to want to try to do right\nRight yeah I think it was an episode of fear is that they're talking about corn tortillas and how the flavor was better if you made it at home fresh compared to like using Moscow her you know like the stuff at the store that's dried\nNo I I don't think we were saying grow your own field corn boy you know by mixture pouring off getting rid of the ... boil it for four hours I think we just meant that if you made your own mixture at home instead of buying the pre made\nHere's a thought there's some wonderful our kids no uh companies that make rats and ... corn finance and mills is it it's an ...

favorite foods peanut butter and then I teen fifties many companies were doctoring their recipes with untested additives\nRoof does men do Washington area homemaker decided to fight back and she changed the way food is regulated here in America reporter Krissy Clark produced a three part series on the peanut butter wars for marketplace and she's here today to tell us the story of the peanut butter\nGrandma Chrissy area I'm great thank you\nSo this all starts the late fifties people are manufactured peanut butter that's not all ...\nYeah often in significant amount not peanuts uh at one point in the Nineteen fifties right after just came out these rumors started popping up that ah\nThere were in certain batches of Jeff at least only Seventy five percent peanuts and then other suspicious ingredients making up the difference\nSo is it the ... percenters is a problem or the quote unquote suspicious ingredients wait what if the rest of ingredients were perfectly healthy wonderful things does it really matter\n[noise] well I think that is a big question that a lot of folks were debating at the time the the ingredient in question that I think raised a lot of alarm bells was ah\nChris go there was actually in the factory formula [laughter]\nAt the just plant it was up to twenty percent Crisco and peanut butter and for some consumers this was a shock um and some folks described it as if it wasn't a tantamount to having peanut flavored cold cream jobs are\nReally doesn't hydrogenated vegetable oil doesn't sound like a great concept so the\nConsumer reaction was fairly substantial 'cause you just tell us about it and how that happened and why did that happen and and how upset where people\nYeah well it all kind of\nComes down to this um one woman named Ruth Desmond who had started an organization a few years earlier in the fifties called the federation of homemakers here's we've Desmond daughter Janet swap her\nShe said that's terrible they want to make money industry by putting less and less peanuts and the peanut butter and uh it's children that are eating these peanut butter sandwiches mostly in here it's just peanut flavored cream\nDesmond was a homemaker herself a very spirited very determined woman and so she got really interested in this issue she started reading up on a lot of the science just about food in general and food additives in general when her husband got sick with bladder cancer and she was trying to figure out\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Tom bio mass words to warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com\nAmerican history where food was really transforming that was after World War two and the two biggest industries coming out of World War two where the food industry and the chemical industry and they joined forces and so there was a lot of stuff that was showing up in our foods that\nEither people weren't aware that it was in there or if they didn't know they didn't know what it meant\nA and so one day when she was probably in the halls of the FDA she ran across this notice\nThat mentioned that they were proposing a standardized definition for peanut butter and uh when she discovered that what prompted this was that some peanut butter companies big peanut butter companies had put\nA lot of the hydrogenated vegetable oil into the jar of peanut butter that she was by and she was shocked so she had a newsletter that she would circulate among homemakers\nAnd a flood of consumer comments started coming in to the FDA hundreds literally hundreds of letters here it's Janet again\nHe said I Will tell everything I Will get all the facts and I will laugh it to everybody because everyone needs to be an informed so she called herself and the ... and that's what she got and that's what was in our news letter you know telling people all the\nHearing and what was going on and the bills in Congress she put it in her newsletter and [noise]\nSo uh one of the things you pointed out is that from the FDA point of view this was a labeling issue in other words if you just honest about what's in it it's okay and roof I think at a different point of view she didn't want\nStuff other than you know to peanut butter so is the FDA still dealing with regulation in terms of truth in advertising in the label more so than what's actually in the\nBottle well one of the big things that the FDA was tasked by Congress was doing was promoting honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers when it came to food\nAnd so that covers a lot of things but one of those is that labels should be truthful and and missile labeling something as a crime\nUm\n... you're listening to ... radio coming

what's the warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com\nAnd I read up and I it's I guess that's how it has and then they get killed and I think something\nThat's right yeah Cal powders just coal pressed cocoa beans that are not roasted as opposed to Coco which is roasted beans that are turned to pattern records the fattest removed as well\nI've looked it up actually once someone said you have to use more Dutch process cocoa than ... powder is kept powder maybe stronger taste thing but I don't I've never tested it I Would try one to one but I Would think the press is going to be stronger flavor\nYeah I Would imagine that a good thing yeah and I I think Alex oh and please get back to us and we'd like to follow up\nOkay well I have had my path so make something that\nWe like that but uh so yeah I well I ... I ... I\nWelcome to the street who do we have on the line I my friend and they can hide ... how can we help you today\nI got some green coffee beans from a friend of mine and I just have to do I try to roast 'cause that's where I needed to do with it really know what to do it either\nSo I tried to ... pair for a while and uh they kind of started letting off these real paper ... skin is worth it yeah it is to go from green color to burn it yeah\nThat's what they do crates you've done is now about ten years ago I went through this whole process because I Love coffee and er I bought a number of different roasters sort of the the popcorn popper where the their air rated and they they go up in the air and swirl around\nI did the rotating drum roaster the more expensive one and here the problems first of all a lot of smoke so you have to do it underneath the hood of some ... to New York city apartment secondly I found that every batch of beans had different roasting time and temperature\nAnd it's very complicated to get a roast right 'cause otherwise some of the burn and some of them are green and he has this problem\nAnd then at the end of the day I discovered that when I make coffee it wasn't any better than actually was worse than beans I could just buy at the local louder may play for like a so I think the problem is you need a professional expensive roasting machine to get even roasting you have to get the timing just right\nTo get the roasting the flavor right\nYou know and the good thing about green beans is they hold you know they can keep them in the freezer or something for a long time\nI never had much luck these things are expensive and it's a huge amount of smoke given off so\nI really wanted to make this work but I just go to who gave I finally well yeah I mean and also the quality of the green beans you're buying you know that's a different issue to laugh I think buying roasted not ground beans and there's so many good suppliers out there right now but that's the easy way to go well\nLet's bring any kind of guy who likes to get involved in long projects\nUp on that kinda stuff I've only got a couple of pounds of these green beans I don't think it's worth it that's great oh maybe do it just sort of like in a pan or something easy\nOn ... on three or four hundred dollars and get around [laughter] and I gave up after a while and we found\nIs second hand you know a popcorn popper you know to thrift store it might be worth it\nI Do find now versus ten years ago my local place is like ten different kinds of beans and you can get really good teams and make or break off of the other\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Tom bio mass woods to warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated

is mostly radio I'm your host Christopher Kimball please give us a ring the number is eight five five four to six Ninety four three eighty five five four to six Ninety four three or send us an email questions and milk street radio\nDot com welcome to the street who's calling Hi this is Han Casey how can we help you today okay\nSo um you know I loved it in the kitchen love to cook my one weakness I think is with desert\nThe one problem that I have let this happen to deal with the frosting and the icing the decoration presentation all of that\nI Try a lot of recipes at home for my own crossing and I think but they never seem to work for the icing I Try that out or sugar with milk and vanilla thing it always comes out ... ... and then I tried to cream cheese one in the mix or oh so it doesn't work\nWhat happens to the cream cheese when\nIt never really become credible like I always even though I keep it room temperature I always feel like it clumps and never has a great consistency and the taste is always just not there though how can I make really good ... and I think at home\nI agree with you that the powdered sugar I ... yeah I really you can add like orange juice to understand but I I don't orange that idea they never turn out now and I don't like him a chocolate crossing always works nicely because of the chocolate cools it sets up\nI like an Italian ... er it's with spring which means you beat egg whites are and then you heat up sugar and get a sugar high sugar syrup\nLike at two thirty nine to forty the temperature doesn't actually matter that much and then you drizzle it on the egg whites as beating them and the mixer for about two or three minutes and that gets you a nice\nFluffy frosting middle hold nicely ... a day or so it's not that hard to do but you have another\nNo I was just going to say the ... which is sort of similar involved egg white friend out what just sugar water egg whites ... but the thing about the Italian so you add the sugar served the egg whites there's also the sweats where you heat up the sugar in egg whites and look at too about one sixty\nThose are a little tricky you want an easier recipe for crossing I assume\nI mean that's what I Would prefer to start that way I can kind of build at my confidence to start working with something a little bit more advanced\nI think the cream cheese frosting though that's going to give you a good texture and that's going to hold really well too\nAnd I wonder if maybe that's more technique issue with me and not maybe really knowing how to work with my mixture\nYou have a hand mixer or stand mixer\nA stand mixer\nAnd what happened you said it was just the texture with two stiffer\nIt's like the cream cheese still state kind of clunky oh\nHow long did you leave the cream cheese room temperature before you made the frosting\nMaybe an hour to an hour and a half\nThe only thing I can suggest is to take the cream cheese out kind of into pieces not what it's OK and left that's in a room temperature for an hour and a half okay I think it just feels so it sounds to me like the cream cheese would still too cold 'cause that's what would happen if it was too cold or wouldn't get smooth and it wouldn't beat up properly\nBut I always say that's your Goto frosting 'cause that's easy you know hold you know the switch them in Italian ranks don't hold the next day very well uh and they are tricky to me are tricky powdered sugar thing it's just I don't know just awful tastes pretty awful I mean with you\nStreaming support for WAMC come from birch are Center for
