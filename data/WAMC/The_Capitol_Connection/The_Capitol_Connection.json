I think the reality is it's rampant there have been fifty state officials have been forced to resign urban indicted uh since uh two thousand\nPretty much the entire leadership of the state assembly in the Senate probably want it to his actions or had been convicted in ... and reaching Europe and the guys are like that but not on the\nBasis of all the chicanery you're talking about in other words these guys Shelley silver and the skill as they were convicted for other things\nVery convicted of political corruption yes that ... taken different type of you know kick back yet you know a lot of things that we would have found a legal or outrageous prior to Watergate are now in shrine in the law\nAnd an old friend of mine are Louis used to run around and say what is a campaign contribution and he would spell out you know bribery just become a legal form a bribery and I think the controller you know needs to be mindful of that when he's at you know doing the audits why shouldn't said what is a pre approval\nOf these contractors the ass additional questions when you see the some of these make campaign contribution\nThat we're talking to mark suddenly the Green Party candidate for New York state controller okay so mark you or a guy who has always been very concerned you and your wonderful wife due to think who was a a great friend of the stations have talked a lot about the environment so what can the controller actually do to help us with the environment\nWell as I said I mean the one thing we've been pushing for as you get the state to divest from fossil fuels which we've talked about an interesting thing I recently met\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no choke ... dog harness invented to make it easier for both dogs and humans no need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand sex\nThousands of reviews at my dog Curtis dot com\nAnd the construction of the offshore wind industry I said well that's very interesting because we love to see New York state do that literally the aerial off of a Long Island in New York City is considered the Saudi Arabia of of war Sherwin ... let me get a district the\nParty or you are for the construction of these offshore\nWind mills yes very strongly in favor I'm\nActually one of our party ... met a couple of years ago with Governor Cuomo and explain to him because he was concerned at that point that wind turbines might be too close to the land and it would be scenic stuff and she said no no no we're building them now ten twelve miles out and he turned debates let's say goes who's in the room and said\nIt's a Green Party right we build a number that far out in their right you know maybe we should do more of them then they're going to be that far out\nSo you know we are trying for a hundred percent by twenty thirty based on this report Mark Jacobson did on vision clean energy but twenty thirty\nAnd in that report forty percent of the energy in the state would confirm or sure when I think ten percent from onshore wind and then about thirty seven percent from solar I Do think one of the problems we have a new state right now is almost impossible to cite utility scale renewables and I think one of the ways that\nIt's okay look on out there on fire island right place I Love and drove us\nI'm looking out into the ocean I don't see those windmills doing All right we haven't had the offshore wind fight yeah because you haven't done any we're just about ... onshore wind right okay theoretically I'm looking at in the ocean offshore I Would not see them\nCorrect okay well you might see a little blimp if you had to binoculars uh-huh but if they're you know three hundred feet high but the ... ten miles out your eyesight might be better than a mind you might catch 'em out here but but ... is going to be hardly noticeable\nI'm One of the things we have said is why not have the state you know we're a bunch of echo socialist one out of the state do public ownership of some of these are things we have fifty\nSeven fifty eight public utilities right now in your state including green island and just say to these towns and cities you\nIf you want the economic development from renewable\nEnergy we will bring it to your community you have to do is you have to cite it\nSo you decide where you want it and then invite us and we'll constructed because what happens is the developers run around and they look for the nice flat piece of land\nThat they can easily develop which is usually really good farmland and then that leads to people object to it but if this town was involved with the village and said we want to build a couple of winter vans or wind farm in town where do people want it then they can find that out locally\nFigure out what's the best place and then have somebody come in and finance\nOkay no more kindly Green Party candidate a for a controller what are your platform things is to do a state carbon tax what's that\nWell as the carbon tax you know we propose actually we have legislation I drafted three years ago it was in the number Kevin K hill has been the lead sponsor you should be chair of the assembly energy committee so uh it starts off at about I think forty dollars a time maybe thirty five dollars a ton and increase his Fifteen dollars a year\nOr the idea is that those were emitting greenhouse gases carbon emissions and to contribute to climate change should have to pay for the damage that they are causing and then the debate tends to be over ... what do you do with the revenues we rebate sixty percent of ...\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no choke ... dog harness invented to make it easier for both dogs and humans no need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand sex\nThousands of reviews at my dog Curtis dot com\nAnd renewable energy mass transit and other things that contribute to climate change surprisingly well a majority of Americans support a carbon task surprisingly a majority of Republicans in previous suppose I think is now forty nine percent among Republicans they supported if the revenue is used to pay for renewable energy\nUm they have less support if the revenue is a hundred percent rebate it does actually surprising to me that the Republican support a carbon tax if the money goes towards\nA renewable energy but the idea behind a carbon tax is that if you actually made\nThose who burned fossil fuels reflect the cost to society and the price that will make renewable energy cheaper comparatively and celebrate the transition I mean already renewable energies becoming cheaper\nThan in fossil fuels even natural gas but you know you increase that price difference to market takes over and and drives the a transition to renewable energy\nOkay no marked on me oh ... minutes left and I got a lot of questions I Want to ask you so keep him short OK okay let's talk about the N word marijuana or the legalization of marijuana in New York where do you think\nWe've I advocated for the legalization for decades or actually when I was a ... a because we're having students arrested in Syracuse N.Y Kurd has to war to decriminalize the small possession of marijuana forty years ago and yet somehow New York state particularly New York city is a marijuana arrests capital of the world\nOr I don't know how we allow the police to violate the law we passed forty years ago and we should you know tax it regulate it like we do alcohol and use the revenues and support education or you know we don't want kids using it you don't want people use when they're\nDriving or operating equipment or things that have stopped at\nA I don't know if you do stop it obviously you criminalize it when they do to that uh but I think education and you know\nI grew up with the idea that for instance that you would drink and drive it just something that always terrified me the idea but I Would get behind the car and cause an accident that would harm something just not something I'll even go close to", "show_name": "The Capitol Connection", "year":

Y. S. U. T. dot org [noise]\nIt's the capital connection Hi I'm Alan charge talk joining us this week is Larry sharp libertarian candidate for governor\nVery sharp described himself as a businessman who started a trucking business and sold a successful distribution company\nA strategic consultant for thought leaders in government finance law technology media and healthcare a teacher and guest instructor who taught English management and business at universities such as Yale Columbia and John Jay college and a native New Yorker\nMarine Corps veteran husband to Georgia and father of two daughters Barbara and Josephine welcome Larry shop\nHow're you doing I'm Glad to be here\nOkay so Larry let me ask you first of all your the libertarian candidate running for governor so I Need to know true yes I got to be in the in political science I thought of John J. to love it but I'm not exactly sure what a libertarian is so maybe you can tell\nLibertarian as someone who believes that you should be as conservative or as liberal as you want to be as long as you are not trying to force yourself on others we understand that law is a very serious thing\nThat at the end of almost every laws that guy or gal with a gun who's going to put you in a cage if you don't want to go in a cage\nThat person is going to shoot you and that means you should be using all all what it really matters things like loss of life or freedom or property or health a threat to any of those things but we shouldn't be using all off or things like I don't like what you're doing or how you're acting or things of that sort\nSo give us the example ... gives examples of that of you know forcing yourself on somebody with specific examples of what we're doing wrong in this society\nThere's so many of them may be one that affects New York state directly the way we regulate hemp and candidates\nWe should be regulating ... and the candidates like onions why if we do it like onions we will help us small farmers in this state our small farmers would love to have another cash crop to sell and to grow and to create craft grows we're not doing that we're deciding that had been cannabis as bad because you don't like people doing it\nThat is exactly the wrong reason it hurts our small farmers not just that it hurts small businesses not just that it does what they used to come back to the shake do cool things of that crap grows and and had creek hemp plastic and ... closet heavy rope not just that it hurts the average the Yorker\nWho asked chronic pain who now is getting stuck with added opioid or not even that\nAnd now they have to either a you know take some of that and they get addicted to or\nHave their family and friends go off and try to buy it and maybe go to jail why in the world but we let someone use of cannabis product and have a better life we didn't do that for those people who have chronic pain but not just that those people who are addicted there are people who are addicted to heart horrible drugs\nThat could use a cannabis product to get them off of those drugs that can be done so that's a good example that affects the Yorker's right now\nCould use a cannabis product to get them off of those drugs that can be done so that's a good example that affects New Yorkers right now\nGovernor Cuomo's for that nobody not okay go ahead\nNo Governor Cuomo is about let's make sure that we heavily regulate heavily tax medical marijuana only so that his cronies can survive and do well so big business wins and small business small farmers lose\nI said like onions with one exception obviously you to be Eighteen years old at the purchase it I Want the small farm it to be able to grow it\nI don't have to wait for years to get a license and a hope that his majesty king Andrew what happens to be nice enough to give him a license and they have to pay two hundred thousand dollars to get that license no if you want to grow grow I Want to help small but it's the small farmers not the big business\nWho the cronies you just referencing do you think I Know all of his cronies well no but give us a sort of ... ...\nEvery single person who has a bit license right now every single person who has a hemp a license to grow hemp right now every person in a kind of a school right now those histories\nWhat about the guys who were being arrested you know who have been convicted the people around him and his closest aides or you know those cronies\nOf course that's what they into all the boards at all the authorities are for ... one of the other problems which is different from what you mentioned earlier\nBut the idea of corruption there are several ways to repair and make corruption a whole lot less in the state you can't get rid of corruption nobody can but you absolutely can make it less and you absolutely kept earlier here's a when they do get rid of all these unaccountable boards authorities corporations like\nLet's see do any of those things that worries instead go to a trade school to be a trade school become a plumber a technician eight track guy mechanic whatever you want to do all good\nTwo years of that depending on what you do need a license at Eighteen or are you ready for the partnership whatever the case may be go off and do that and be happy you don't like that great go get a job\nGo work go get a job\nGo work if the work ethic burned out when your boss show up at eight you show up at eight not at nine thirty resident actually mean seven forty five get that work ethic\nI don't know how many people tell me all the time Larry I Would hire anybody with a work ethic why start a business they might say wait a minute they're sixteen are you kidding me no I'm dead serious we have a whole situation right now where if you ask twenty year olds if they feel like adults over half will tell you know\nThat's bad I Can't change parenting but I could change the environment I Want us to be making those mistakes at sixteen not twenty six now they are a lot of twenty six year olds coming back home to mom and dad they can mistakes let's make those mistakes at sixteen\nLearn lessons get better by the time what twenty six we can rock and roll the next question I get it how do you pay for their words I was ... when I got a Marine Corps I got the GI Bill GI Bill gave me the money and there's so many years to spend with the same thing with a six year old they get twenty thousand dollars\nThey can use it and we'll we'll set it off to school they want they have seven years to use twenty thousand dollars seven years when that happens here is where I promise you never want there'll be a bunch of prep schools that will pop up I guess how much their costs for two years twenty thousand dollars there'll be a bunch of a trade school for the pop up and they'll cost twenty thousand dollars how do I know that\nBecause it's guaranteed money from the government and banks love that they will give loans this will pop up this will happen everywhere Chanel what am I saying I'm saying for those tend to lead the greatest now instead of paying twenty two thousand dollars per year were paying ten thousand dollars per year we're saving twelve thousand dollars per kid but not just that\nIt's about four hundred thousand eleven twelfth graders do the math that's over four billion dollars which means we said we we make up\nThat federal funds right away still have no strings attached a lot of teachers that teach get rid of a bunch of administrators have better results for kids happier kids happier parents happier teachers\nNow on a new way way what is your question are you are there are those people who think that our educational system is still after all these years segregated a you know the black kids get less than anyone can do what do you do about that\nYeah absolutely hundred percent the first thing is if you notice my whole plan and the ... the twelfth grade\nYou can go to school you want to go to so kids will pick schools so you'll find that kids will begin to integrate naturally that will tend to happen if you can pick the school you want to go to now will that be perfect but of course not we're not going to have the fifty that's not happening\nBut we'll integrate better yes you will have better integration if the parents can pick any school the kids can pick any school and it's based upon dollars that everybody gets so you will have naturally more integration ... eleventh and twelfth grade that part is built in\nNow before this was quick yeah this is a big deal most of this goes to reward schools now because the charter schools that sort I would've changed how we actually even pay for the schools\nFirst things first right now as I said we're paying about twenty two thousand dollars per kid I'd have to pay a whole lot less I think we can go to the idea is I talked about I Would like to state ... state has to pay by a constitution\nFor grades one through twelve that's required and I get that will do that but I don't want to be paid at all by local communities I don't want\nAny school tax at the local level now that sounds crazy I Know but if you start to do that everything's comes it's ...\nBut I don't want to be paid at all by local communities I don't want any school tax at the local level now that sounds crazy I Know but if you start to do that everything's ... state the state will play pay a flat fee to all school districts a flat fee to all school districts you have X. amount of kids\nMultiply that by a number I'm not sure what that number it's exactly yet my gut tells me about Fifteen K but I'm not sure yet here's your back good luck\nNo more grant writing no more begging money from the state they're more Becky money from the federal government here is your money good luck the number of ... that you\nGot it but what if the administrators in that district or you know for one of a better word or you know jerks and decide okay this one group we when we favor one group we don't favor because on them if they rule group and you say well it's been in any way you want\nAbsolutely here's the issue the only thing that requires transparency that is my only issue you must be transparent any bad behavior whether that is racial or gender or sexual orientation or religious any of that whatever that might happen I Will shine a light on I Will that everyone know what is happening\nOkay you're young and it's not like they're not like that but what have you gotten so and it's like to your show and you know you got a group of people who get themselves elected and they want the or religious kids to be treated in different ways and didn't want to hold the same standard that's okay\nI didn't say it was okay when I literally said was any bad behavior I Will shine a light\nOkay so there is a lightning so there is like being shined on those guys I read about it all the time but it hasn't changed their bad behavior\nKnow that there isn't a shine for there's a shine a light shining or from the government from the governor that's number one and that that's the first day and they still are able to do whatever they want\nBecause the average person doesn't know the local people now but the local people aren't enough the whole state you know someone's going to shine a light on that behavior so it was going to come on TV like I Will and say look at what's happening in this community you start shining a light on that and you will see action being taken\nYeah because they want but but but Larry and they want to what they want the boats Andrew Cuomo wants to vote so you don't hear too much from Andrew Cuomo about it a lot of them and I don't care about\nThose votes yes you're correct he does that's not me I asked you have balls and ethics I care about that that's I'm not him okay I Will turn on and I'm telling you right now on radio I'm telling you I Will shine a light on all of\nThe game okay Larry we've got three minutes left I got to ask you real quickly in the real lightning round health care\nThe health care and health insurance or not the same thing this is our biggest problem we've confused them and we worry about fixing health care\nInsurance when we should be worried about fixing health care we have to fix health care first the biggest piece is transparency is making it no longer a cartel system make it no longer so hard to put people in the actual feel itself we fix health care first then we can fix health care shorts\nOK the MTA MTA's an absolute disaster the Paris summit\nSixteen billion dollars of that about six billion comes straight from New York state goes right to them because they're bad have to fix it three ways sway number one we have to start using on infrastructure raising money through that through marketing at least gotten any rights they writes the bridges and tunnels that were raised billions of dollars to help support\nThe actor empty a second you have to use it that the lines right now at night that aren't being used the rail lines in the city had freight line to use those freight lines to raise money both for marketing purposes and for bringing Frank to the city less wear and tear on the city less wearing short infrastructure more money coming in\nNext the empty as a board has to completely change because no one is accountable the boy has to go away with people and put people on who are accountable to the local people in addition\nYou have to copy all of the good ways that people are doing this and other laws\nWho are accountable to the local people in addition you have to copy all of the good ways that people are doing this and other\nLarge cities in the world those pictures like Berlin and London and copy the ideas are working because the empty chair so an efficient to fix one mile of track they are four times more expensive than other cities in this world that both have unions and have safety copy that global save money and raise money ways other than more taxes will make it more efficient\nOkay tax reform biggest thing a tax reform as getting rid of unfunded mandate unfunded mandate to the county level crushing local counties or you can talk about that if you start getting rave unfunded mandate you will find counties lot less desire to raise property taxes uh\nProperty taxes we have a problem with that you property taxes right now we're not voted on by the actual people in the town there voted on by the legislators which we then go behind closed doors and race\nPocket tax okay well I Would hold on hold on because we're running out of time to really seriously um what examples can usually have a tax reform yes I'm ... I'm Sorry\nOkay fed up would you examples can you give us unfunded mandate that you would you do with\nI Would do it but none of them I Would I Do it I Would not do away with them what I Would say is they're not required let the county's decide what they want to deal with I Would let county start their budget at zero that's what I Would do I don't have to know all these things that's the point my entire campaign is about decentralization here's what I Know from business from family from life\nIf you ask personal freedom plots accountability plus transparency you will have innovation right now are saying is it a death spiral over a hundred thousand people living every year and a rise of suicides drop all different parts of our state so that has to change which means many innovation I'm going to foster innovation that's what I'm trying to achieve\nIt's always great to have somebody who speaks a little bit of a different language than others and Larry sharp as a libertarian gubernatorial candidate against Andrew Cuomo and the millions of other people Larry we wish you well and we hope that new come back and talk to us in the future\nThank you for having ...

know the likeability of somebody a becomes an issue when in fact the competence and\nAh their capacity for doing the job probably should be the first marker of whether one support someone or not\nI Will just say that it was interesting to me that in my district or there was Seventy six registered working families party people\nAre five of whom showed up for the working families party primary [noise] so that's kind of a bitter pill a or a bitter coda to the whole nother story that they count on obviously Democrats\nOr an independence or not on their own registered voters\nJust so everybody understands this is you just mentioned that they\nNeed fifty thousand votes to stay on the ballot basically in the next time and they have to win in the gubernatorial election so certainly in democratic who qualify for the Republicans will qualify and I think would Cynthia Nixon there that would be their best bet to qualifying for those fifty thousand votes don't you\nI Believe that a democratic voters will be smart a and there are you know obviously a I'm a self interested party in this matter\nSo obviously it would be easier in my life is the she stayed on the working families party line I don't think it would affect the outcome of the old gubernatorial election uh and I think that\nThe working families party would see that a reasonable vote that would keep them in\nBusiness so to speak on the other hand you know there are people who say let's leave nothing to chance and I think they\nCould have Andrew Cuomo turnaround have the line and then they don't vote for me on the working families party line\nYou know he doesn't like the very much because he's always been an adversary using the bully\nI think he has\nAn aggressive style that um is single minded towards his whatever he sees as the uh end result\nAnd a clearly there are times when I'm that comes across as I'm tough guy and I think he likes that persona ... you know when you know these are the the muscle car guy\nAnd I have to say when there's an emergency that persona where there's a natural disaster or whatever that persona is actually a positive thing\nOr it's not necessarily as positive when there are delicate negotiations\nOkay so ... tell us a little bit about your stumping around ... the place that historically first had the boss is like ... ... from a liberal into a less liberal um person\nAnd what is the tenor of the politics of of ah Greenwich Village now\nWell let me be clear I represent the village from east to west\nSo it includes ah East Village as well as central and West Village all of which have separate identity as well as no whoa so try Becca and civic center so it's and Battery Park north I don't want to insult my uh\nConstituents in Battery Park city north um I think that\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nPeople's identities are very much tied to the twenty square blocks in which they circulate so the ... of the East Village is very different from that of the west village but I think that the politics are I'm liberal too progressive\nWe have a lot of uh old time residents longtime residents I'm One of those\nWe have a lot of new people people are attracted to the culture the creativity we have a lot of a small theater is it's you know mid town as the Broadway theater we have a lot of off Broadway and off off Broadway\nWe have a lot of small museums a cultural events\nOf those things are wide attract people there's we're losing our ... our Aaron light by having more vertical development but\nIn comparison to other parts of Manhattan we are low rise mixed use a and people like that sense of walking damned tree lined streets\nAnd seeing quirky edgy things that is being lost by over development and ... which started under Mike Bloomberg but has accelerated with the Blasio administration\n... he just said that uh moves no I used to take a\nWhen I was a young man I used to think friends girls out to um Greenwich Village to have a cup of coffee which goes than five dollars and I'm Wondering whether that whole lumber mills has gone\nIt exists in smaller pieces the East Village is still um\nAnd we have a lot of schools I mean I chair higher education and this is in many ways the epicenter of education NYU the new school Cooper Union Pace University um boroughs Manhattan community college\nOr it's not a physically large area a and yet we have these major major institutions and so we have a lot of young people who are here on a regular basis and many of whom live and want to continue to live here\nAre so that still exists or more so to the east and the west but you know escalating real estate ah prices have made it more challenging for small businesses we have a lot of empty storefronts and it's not just the rent\nIt's the way in which people shop now I'm online shopping is a challenge for small local shops they try to find a nice ... but it is hard and the escalating rents make that even more challenging\nEverywhere I was going to ask you about this you just passed over something which is one of my great teams and that's the concept of the empty store\nNow that exist on the west side of this and the religion Broadway name id is not all about price point in other words greedy landlords who want to get more and more money out of those stores and so they leave him big until they get what they want words it would you just mentioned that there are other considerations\nWell I think it's I think it's both and it's split certainly escalating rents are are a real problem and it's a problem in residential as well as commercial uh that is for certain but it's also just\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nStudent loan debt or because of escalating tuition prices and that means you know we have a consumer economy and\nWhen people don't have disposable income these kids have a mortgage on their\nEducation they're not going to be able to get a mortgage on an apartment or house so it's changing what their choices are\nAnd it's also different uh in terms of what kind of jobs people have\nUm you know half of the young people are looking for jobs in tech or an advertising that's\nFocused more on a younger demographic and as a result they don't all have to buy suits and they don't have to wear a dress up close\nAnd so the shops are and stores that are selling that department stores are struggling just as much because people aren't necessarily driven to buy the same kinds of things and it's their idea of consumerism is\nA experiences so they want to go\nOut to eat and hang with their friends but they're not going to go to the mid range or higher priced\nRestaurant or so it's ... there's a lot of disruption in the economy\nAnd I'm sure this was true and another generation ah that face the different shift and the economic interests of people but it's it's very tough and empty storefronts create a sense of depression it said it creates an unsafe streets skate\nA let alone and on appealing visually a street scape a and that uh\nHas other consequences for uh so you know it's we are in a very tough time and you know the attempt to say well let's just keep cutting\nTaxes well the result is our subway system is a is a mess\nOr the streets need re paving and there isn't the same level of

Party president welcome mug done me well thank you Alan glad to be on WAMC okay so I guess the first question which I'm going to ask do\nAnd you're not going to tell me the truth about but I'm going to ask him can you in\nProbably not this is not a race designed to well depends how you define when I Do find when as if I can convince Tom to Napoli the present state controller\nWho's twenty five points ahead in the poll or something to divest the state pension fund from fossil fuels uh I've been coordinate in that campaign for the last five years or three fifty dot org managed to get earlier this year in New York City degree to divest\nA managed to get one thousand institutions worldwide was seven point two trillion dollars to divest from fossil fuels\nBut have not been able to manage to convince time to Napoli who actually has become a national spokesperson for the fossil fuel industry or with respect to his opposition to the vestments so I thought this would be a good opportunity um but I also haven't worked for many years but who the fiscal policy Institute\nAnd with the state budget or also very concerned about some of the fiscal transparency and accountability issues\nMugged on me and that's an interesting point I've asked Tom the Napoli about this many times\nHis response has always been my job is controller is to bring the best return on our investments as I possibly can\nAnd it is not to make political statements like that but I think frankly I got to be honest with you I think you're being a little unfair to say he's a national spokesman for the fossil fuel industry well\nThey they profile them these days in their annual report as being responsible boys but I Am very concerned about the fiscal question besides I think it's morally wrong for the state to continue to invest in an industry which is ... you know contributing to the destruction of planet\nTom ... who you may remember it was the act in state controller between when she was forced to resign and eat legislature pointed to Napoli there's\nBeen quite outspoken about the need to divest wildly fossil fuels still has some value he points out for the last four or five years\nOr these fossil

it is true that I've had reservations about the gubernatorial actions of of a president governor\nIn New York actually I live in Massachusetts but of Andrew Cuomo and it seems to me he's very good and

love thousands every means at my dog current S. dot com\nBubble I'm One of the things we have said is why not have the state you know we're a bunch of echo socialists one out of the state do public ownership of some of these are things we have fifty\nSeven fifty eight public utilities right now in your state including green island and just say to these towns and cities you\nIf you want the economic development\nFrom renewable energy we will bring it to your community you have to do is you have to cite it\nSo you decide where you want it and then invite us and we'll constructed because what happens is the developers run around and they looked at the nice flat piece of land\nThat they can easily develop which is usually really good farmland and that leads to people object to it but if this town was involved with the village and said we want to build a couple of winter vans or wind farm in town where do people want it then they can fight that out locally\nFigure out what's the best place and then have somebody come in and finance\nOkay no more deadly Green Party candidate a for a controller what are your platform things is to do a state carbon tax what's that\nWell a snake carbon taxes you know we propose actually we have legislation I drafted three years ago it was in the number Kevin K hill has been the lead sponsor you should be chair of the assembly energy committee so it starts off at about I think forty dollars a time maybe thirty five dollars a ton and increase just Fifteen dollars a year\nOr the idea is that those were emitting greenhouse gases carbon emissions at a contributor to climate change\nShould have to pay for the damage that they are causing and then the debate tends to be over what do you do with the revenues we rebate sixty percent of the revenues to low and moderate income people to try to hold them harmless because energy ... tend to be regrets of the ... people and then the last forty percent\nWe or invest in renewable energy mass transit and other things that contribute to climate change surprisingly well\nA majority of Americans supported carbon cast surprisingly a majority of Republicans in previous both I think it's now forty nine percent among Republicans they supported if the revenue is used to pay for renewable energy\nUm they have less support if the revenue is a hundred percent rebate it does actually surprising to me that the Republican support a carbon tax if the money goes towards a renewable energy but the idea behind a carbon tax is that if you actually made\nWho burned fossil fuels reflect the cost to society and the price that will make renewable energy cheaper comparatively and celebrate the transition I mean already renewable energies becoming cheaper\nThan in fossil fuels even natural gas but you know increased that price difference the market takes over and and drives the a transition to renewable energy\nOkay no marked on me only seven minutes left and I got a lot of

Ruben was a senior securitization analyst in the structured finance group at Moody's Corporation welcome keys who for\nWell thank you very much it's great to hear from you why would anybody in the world give up when you're giving up in order to run\nWell look it's really important for the state we're at a point where we really have to look at sharing some of our own problems internally and you know but the fact of the matter is you're not going to get that done if you have an insider trying to cure all because what we have is corruption\nThat's being driven by career politicians and you you need someone from the outside to come in and try to clean that up\nAnd look I I Do I get really because in this life I've I've had a very very lucky lucky sequence of events happen to be in this state and I really want to give something back I I grew up in Buffalo working class on the east side of town which is not a particularly nice part of buffalo\nAnd you know my dad worked at the plant at the Chevy flat and he worked very hard we were working class just trying to get ahead as a family and\nAs a result of my parents' hard work and doing little things that like taking me to the library on weekends and during the week we had a great public library downtown I was able to get a great education and so was my brother and I was able to go to Harvard on scholarship\nAnd that I was able to go to Harvard law school and come out and become a big time lawyer in New York City and I was able to realize my dreams because of the environment I had in my parents' hard work and some hard work on my own\nBut that's changed a lot and working class people have difficulties and and reaching those same aspirations and so having had that benefit in New York state where\nYou know we had a private sector that created jobs back in the seventies and eighties and you had a public sector that was not perfect but was much more of a sudden it is today you know I see those things having disappeared and I want to try to put it back the right way and so that's why I'm running the other thing is you you also need someone\nWho you know doesn't need the job you know part of the problem is why you know people in politics who are looking at running for another office\nHas to get along with the people around them have to make compromises and that's not consistent at all what what the people need which they need someone to get to the bottom of what's going on with their money\nAnd get to the bottom of what's going on with this corruption because the cost a bit of killing off and so look you know I I'm doing it because you know I'm someone who can do it in a way that that isn't compromised by needed to get along with the politicians\nNot compromised by the need to look the other way\nOkay and teach them when they call you that I Know that I was somewhat critical of your opponent to James in this race because she was the person that Cuomo frankly wanted to when she did perhaps that's why of all the Democrats and Republicans who are running\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nWho are fourteen points up behind in the last poll is you and it's because I think people have grave doubts about having somebody who is in the chicken coop if you're following me\nYeah love go oh that's what I've been hearing all over the state you know the same story over and over we've we've done this three times right we we've had three attorney general candidates who all claim that they were going to clean up corruption and\nEach of them has failed and doing it and one of the reasons I Believe they failed and one of the reasons a lot of voters believe they've been in sales is because you keep putting in career politicians or as I said have to get along with the other people\nTo not want your government to steal from you if not Democrat or Republican to one public services to be delivered honestly and effectively and so not withstanding you know some of the other things that are potentially going on out there\nWhat we're hearing around the state is that we're going to be in a position to win because we're the only viable alternative provides what the voters shaped\nOkay so you got Michael ... than running as the Green Party candidate\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAnd so I got to ask you this and I drew apologize in advance you're going to vote for Trump in twenty dream\nYou know I don't know what I'm going to do it twenty twenty we'll see we'll see what the record looks like you know we've had this phenomena out\nAnd many many presidential terms whether it was Obama whether even was Reagan where presidents and their first term do things and they're extraordinarily unpopular times during his first tour of him and then on the voters get to look back and\nSee the full entirety of the records you know they they take a step back and and they decide what they really want to do and in many cases you know that's a reelection and educationally and it's not you know and Bush one's case it was not so I'm gonna look back just like all the other voters in America and make a decision when we see the complete record\nNow what about the current attorney general's investigation into President Trump and\nThe Trump family you continue\nSo let's let's talk about this tax thing that came out I mean I I Know this is not a very ... politician thing to do to actually answer your question directly I'm going to do it I\nJust actually came out from the New York times last week you know the magnitude of it is huge um you know it goes back a lot of years um goes bad I think they said the one that the president was three long before I was born and\nYou know I don't know what if there's anything these accused of doing that and but obviously it goes on for decades as a a massive number of dollars that are implicated by it including state tax dollars and so you know look I I don't know whether it's true or false you know the New York times did they're digging but but it obviously marriage the full investigation\nAnd I would continue to investigate that are in fact I don't know if it's started yet I I hear were rumors state tax department they may be looking at things\nBut that's something of a magnitude that yeah you have to investigate it may you know my my view of all this stuff is that\n... the office was not supposed to be partisan you're supposed to apply the law\nAnd you're supposed to apply to everyone equally and fairly and you you know that that's something that I can place to do frankly that that my opponent can't credibly say\nYou know I I really they feel we need to follow the facts whether it leads to Donald Trump or Governor Cuomo Republicans Democrats you know critics local politicians what have you\nUm that's what you have to deal with the office because we have to restore the credibility of the state government and we have to restore the credibility of this office and we you know the way you do it is you stopped running this thing as a as a partisan vendetta machine um and you run it as something that works for the people and unbiased way\nSo we would let me ask you this you are of course African American and the greater Cheever you've done credible work in your life you're going to already you've done all of these things but there are those people who would say that Donald Trump you know had given signals of racism or his constituency how would you parse that for\nA look you know my feeling is that as an African American you develop particularly if you you try to achieve success and have some some success at achieving success that you've got to develop a pretty thick skin\nAnd so you know I I'm not a person who has a hair trigger and responding to real or perceived slight because if you if you let that stuff's distract you\nYou're not going to get very far in life because there's always stuff that's going to be distractions and there's always going to be stuff that you can attribute to racism um sometimes it is racism many times it's not and so you you you've got uh\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nThe actual impact of it on you and what you're trying to accomplish versus you know than sort of the the psychological slight which made it very real but but it's not important too and in fact it's counterproductive to you're trying to get things done I mean I like I you know talked to a charge like I say to my kids look\nThere and I know a daughter was fourteen and the sun was eleven when they hear about a lot of this in the schools right about racism and identity politics and stuff I mean it's all over the schools and I said oh look you've got to focus on what you've gotta do\nTo accomplish the goals and not on what other people are thinking or saying we're doing and if someone's got some view that as counterproductive\nThat's not enough to stand on your way if you do the right things and so that's the way I've always live my life that's the way my parents told me to approach life\nAnd you know you know that's the way I look at you know a lot of the things that are that are said you know either privately or publicly that that I may or may not have an issue with I just look at you know down the road one of the things you have to do to move forward and I don't get distracted by you know a lot of the rhetoric\nAnd let's go to the environment and\nObviously than a run for attorney general of New York obviously New York like every other state in the country has to face the problems of the troubled environment where do you think\nI think we got to focus on our water at our water supply but there are there are a lot of issues that you know fly under the flag of environmental issues or air water endangered species endangered in sex you know I'm you know development issues wetlands issues a\nClimate change issues it it you know literally is almost everything on earth that falls under the rubric of the environment\nBut what I Want to prioritize as attorney general because I I I Do think it's something that's immediate and critical\nIs we've got to prioritize dealing with our water supply particularly our drinking water supply or where you have a great natural resource on the northern border the great lakes which twenty percent of the world's fresh water supply or at least that's not caught up in polar ice caps are and we have\nVery very fragile a article for is water supply downstate in Long Island and we have a history of\nBoth bad luck and and pollution and deliver it some of the accidental everywhere in between and so as attorney general one of the things I Would focus on is trying to deal with our water supply issues because obviously the the long term and short term public health damage that will be colossal\nMarijuana what do you think about that well I I think that medical marijuana has been shown at least initially to be something that's very beneficial you know under the supervision of doctors\nYou know you you've had instances where it's been a real palliative and helped to cancer patients who are undergoing incredible suffering and so I you know medical marijuana should be and should continue to be legal or in and we should\nI I think nationally naturally institutionalize that uh because that that avenue needs to be available to cancer patients and doctors ah with with tight supervision\nWhat about recreational what they're supposed to make recreational\nMarijuana I I'm not there yet because there are obviously there are a bunch of people who are pushing to try to legalize them to the extent that we're trying to deal with enforcing issues around communities of color I think we need to deal with those enforcement issues and make sure we're not ruining people's lives over low level offenses and putting them on a pastor\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nBut with the legalization of recreational marijuana there as a whole Pandora's box the problems that hasn't been discussed yet and we need to discuss those problems and deal with them before we make a decision\nOn it wouldn't matter example you're ... hold on where we we as DWI driving while you know high we don't even know how to detect it uh we have the\nLong term health care issues of marijuana used we don't really know what they are even though we have a Medicaid system that covers a huge percentage of New York's population so\nTo the extent we legalize recreational marijuana and there's a long term health impacts\nNot only is there going to be that human impact which is negative but we're also going to have to pay for that you know we also have to talk about drug testing we have a\nMultibillion dollar work than compensation issue do we want people not only driving while high but operating cranes of heavy equipment and you know drive you know potentially driving trucks\nYou know and all the workman's comp costs are going to come from that I mean one of my worries as if we legalize recreational marijuana because of our crazy litigation system in New York and the you know over zealous plaintiff lawyers were going to end up having employers feeling that they asked the mandatory drug test every part\nBecause they're not going to be able to credibly say that they didn't take steps not to have someone on the job was high at a critical moment\nAnd so when you look at all the costs you know turning back the clock\nOn you know intoxicated driving workers' compensation cost potential civil liberties infringements through\nYou know mandatory drug testing and you know the long term health care cost of doing this you know there's a lot of potential problems of legalizing marijuana that hasn't been studied and so I I'm just not there on a recreational basis\nOkay so here's my problem peaceful for now you have to promise as they come back and talk to us again I'm at a time I guess is the New York state Republican attorney general candidate ... thanks so much for joining us you are
