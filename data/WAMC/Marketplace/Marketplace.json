and give me just maybe the ... the first one of these that Sinclair did back in the day was in Baltimore and and explain how they got around the rules I suppose is is the question what can\nSo so what they did was they would acquire a competitor station uh the embassy would say well you need to divest you need to sell one of the stations in order to comply with the regulations and the laws\nBut then uh they came up with a very clever trick that the help of their lawyers and they would just simply divest the second station to a shell company run by sort of a business associates or a member of the ... family which is a family that controls Sinclair\nYou know so they would be able to say to the FCC that they sold the station but in fact the station with still not really independent and then
