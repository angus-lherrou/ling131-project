missionary parents in I don't I was always curious about this it seemed like when you have a spiritual vacuum [noise] people embrace\nHop religions that come and go do you have any ever think about that well you're in Japan\nWell I think the Japanese attitude towards religion is very different than in our country that is they're not exclusive to one religion or another they take the best of any religion and adopted as part of their life it's almost just part of the culture so\nFor example babies that are born they take them to a shrine to be dedicated and most weddings are either she do or Christian because they're attracted to the idea of a western style wedding but most funerals are Buddhist because Buddhism has to do with the afterlife\nWhereas she do has to do with sacredness and the president life ... and so they just depending on the time of year the season or the particular festival I might be Buddhist it might be she though it might be Christian\nIn your book you wrote that I was just setting up the numbers are you said eighty percent of the people identify as Shinto sixty seven percent identify as Buddhist and I thought it in her sent plus sixty seven that's more than a hundred [laughter] but it right away because people can can gather their religions I guess\nYes and so one of the difficulties I guess you'd say for missionaries such as my parents were it's very difficult to have somebody except Christianity and then exclude the other religions\nI saw it as a missionary you'd have to do the best ... nor the gods before me or or that sort of a right to ...\nAnd that would be a tough because I remember I had friends in Japan who who were kind of like sure that sounds good I'll I'll embrace that but it wasn't that the exclusion of anything else so they were ... they would pick on Christianity but but it wouldn't be\nThe only religion Ruthie what is Shinto and and I mean I'm sure that's a complicated question but I have a good sense of what is Buddhism and what is Hindu as him and what is Islam and Christianity and Judaism but ... what is that\nYes literally she told means the way of the gods it's a type of ... or the belief in the

believed by tradition that even the emperor of God has mystical origins and descended from the sun goddess who created the Japanese island\nThe emperor God do you mean the the amber who's considered a God\nUsed to be yes but not anymore right now he is a symbol of the state\nOf the people but again Japanese don't exclusively claim one religion over another so these are just stories and miss that are passed down and children just learn what you're supposed to do when you go to a scene till shrine is kind of like it\nGives your society some basic parameters some cultural ideals it's sort of like a a classroom for ethics\nYes you could say that and it's the idea of sacredness making things\nClean and purifying getting rid of evil spirits and so there are many holidays that celebrate something\nA sheep though and there's regional festivals harvest festivals or ... rice planting festival that are related to ... though so it's kind of blended into the daily life\nI was struck by a I was just confused at holiday time 'cause I was in Japan over Christmas when you're in and Christmas was like just a big party everybody was the subway was filled with people with cakes and everybody getting drunk\nAnd then on New Year's and you know like a whole time and I'll never forget stepping out my my door and and they were banging this Kong what a hundred and eight times\nOn New Year's eve

abroad Japan and routine when we're thinking about living in Japan what's the respect for women in public in the workplace and so on and and the domestic world these days are just in general\nSo I think things are changing quite a bit the marriage rate has gone down and so has the birth rate because a lot of women\nPreferred to develop their career or start their own business or go abroad to study or even go overseas to start a business so it's not quite as traditional as you might imagine and I think people do respect women and um there many opportunities\nIn terms of employment and a large company they often have two tracks that women can choose from one is to go the managerial route where you're committed to\nWorking long hours for the company going on business trips and working just like the men are expected to but the other track is for women who value their own free time and don't expect to have a life long career than there are more like secretaries or support staff\nAnd

career then there are more like secretaries or support staff\nAnd sometimes they quit when they get married there used to be pressure to quit when you get married but it's not true anymore than there isn't any changing yes\nSo the younger generation is is pretty much said we're going to demand a little more respect\nI don't know if I put it in terms of demand respect but they're going ahead and

so grateful that I got to have that experience as a kid\nOther countries have music but no other country has music quite like higher\nI agree a lot of people say it's because Irish music things to the heart I Believe it seems to something larger the spirit\nIt bullied the spirits of the Irish who have left through the centuries of no choice of their own to make a living and other countries to go fight in foreign wars\nIt also kept alive as you said in your introduction all of the her role with people and pride of place every single little ... in Ireland has a song written about it it is a way

filled with locals you get caught up in it You're welcome to be caught up in this way the music invigorated the national spirit\nAbsolutely and I think one of the reasons why is because we all know in Ireland uh singers and musicians that it's not about off it's not the culture of celebrity that sadly we're going into now it's about the song or the June\nAnd we are serving it now if it was a great

of New York at the time and he graduated from Harvard and\nWent off to New Guinea to work on a film and his father had opened the museum of primitive art as it was called then a few years earlier and Michael was a trustee and while he was in New guinea he heard about people called the as Matt who lives in the south west coast and were\nIncredible ... and he determined to go to as Matt and try to collect some as Matt art\nWhich he did he made a quick ... sort of a reconnaissance journey of a few weeks and then went back to the film and then when that was done he decided to go back\nFor a

mad it's ten thousand even today it's ten thousand square miles of road ... swamp\nIn the inner villages there are no stores no plumbing no electricity\nOr he bought a boat from a Dutch Colonial patrol officer a sort of a two dugout canoes with a little bit of a sort of Huck Finn like a cabin on top and with the Dutch miner or thirty four year old anthropologist named Renee walk thing and to local boys they just went off from village to village\nYou know and they would arrive in the village and say they're interested in stuff\nAnd people would bring it out but you have to understand in Nineteen sixty one as Matt was an incredibly remote place really western contacted just been made in the late Nineteen fifties and as Matt were uh\nUh people of great artistic passion and power but they were also a constant warfare with each other and\nWe lived in a world of the sacred reciprocal violence of which the art was all a part in a you know and and head hunting was an integral part of their culture and part of that had hunting you know was also some cannibalism and\nMichael unwittingly stepped into a very complex political world\nAnd he ended up at the wrong place at the
