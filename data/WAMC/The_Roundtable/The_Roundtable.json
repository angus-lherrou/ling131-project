crisis in this country it's just that simple\nAllen\nYou know I said look you've what levees are much more articulate Lee that hundred\nA seven forty five this morning I'm\nThe president is largely to blame for giving a what I called a green light mhm or to um to the haters entered the wrist and oil for what all for political or even academic advancement\nIt's it's um it's so depressing it's so it's done and you know we heard on the news this morning from the HDL Anti Defamation league that the um\nThe number of anti Semitic incidents has written about sixty five percent\nIt's MORNING from the age of hell Anti Defamation league that the um the number of anti Semitic incidents has risen up by sixty five percent this year and\nI've been thinking about this that Trump was elected largely by people who thought in many ways that they had been left out and that others were to blame for that\nAnd when that kind of thing happened historically it's always been the Jews who cuss right face this kind of\nTerrible terrible a reaction from the people who feel that they have been left out you know and it's not fair they're for Jews there for people in every sector society uh and and yet and yet\nI'm this guy and Libby is a very tough terms\nBut this guy will be set up all his word monster and I think that that it's appropriate in this case because of what it is getting and his defense was and he said it um well\nYou know he really wasn't a fan of mine because he said I was too close to some of the Jews give me a ... you know a\n... that is that is just beyond anything we could expect from a man sitting in a leadership position\nYou know you know and you're talking about the the number of incidents of the um the the L has has reported in and I was I was talking to a friend of mine who was in uh Los Angeles and has a young two young kids under five\nWho both go to I'm Jewish day school and ah the number of bomb threats than those that that facility that live outside of Los Angeles of receive him last year is on we've we've had them here I Know and you have a presence where you have a there is a\nWell I must have shown on Yom Kippur on the high holy days the Albany police over there right at ... at everything to\nGod Jim I'm going to check in with you too\nYeah you know it's hard to know what to say I actually heard about it after a Saturday evening because we don't listen to the news on Saturday being driven Jews and so to the stunning this of coming out of the the piece that Libya was talking about\nBut you know one of the things that resonated right away was one of his hatred of the Jews was because we were bringing in the aliens because we were supporting the immigrants are there had been many services I mean we are a community that lived through much of that and and many in our community one want to see us not\nUm close the borders we wanna we wanna make it possible for other people to come here and have the kinds of successes we did and uh it was just shocking\nAnd got up I was I spent the weekend in New York City and an immigration conference I'm about I'm\nOrganizing immigration lawyers and creating strategic alliance if we had the Albany county um geography for intend to their um the Brooklyn DA is off at other immigrant friendly law enforcement agencies that sort of collaborate around some of the work that's been done about what words [laughter]\nI I attended a racial justice seminar as part of that I'm In the first part of the conference and a woman sitting behind me and my rv Charlottesville, Virginia\nAnd she grew up there her sister Sophie Shachtman was\nInjured I'm In the\nAttack on the domestic terrorism attack in Charlottesville two years ago um and it talking with her um through the weekend and the conference lasted\nAnd it talking with her\nUm [noise] through the weekend and the conference lasted through Saturday a and making those connections between what the president said after the Charlottesville attacks and one year ago and\nIt just seems like it's been forever um and that that that that statement that he made immediately following that gave license\nTo so much hate in this country ah and yeah to to be at an immigration conference and to see that I'm highest ah ... the organization specifically targeted by this man in his postings\nI'm at a time where the president is also claiming that that that migrant caravan coming up from the south ah contains dangerous people from other countries that are coming here to hurt us when it's when we're hurting ourselves\nA it's almost too much all the pieces together and it's too much\nIt is it really it it feels to I mean after just the bombings last week\nAnd the and the um\nThe not being able to put ... we were um we were down on the air or the arrest happened after we we left the airwaves on friday so we haven't really been talked about that but [noise] you know that you see that van\nRight hand and um and it's you know it doesn't take a I\nI I did you know ... to chuckle a little bit to sadly I'm\nOn friday when the president said you know it's like finding a needle in a haystack and I thought to myself oh my God look at the van out real artist that ... you know it's like\nUm [noise] but the the the the point\nBeing that uh I I I Love Allen's um\nDescription of the green white because of her dog whistle and ... and to me it's a dog whistle it's much louder than that and I think a green light as a a good way of putting up\nBecause it's it it is and as you said at the\nCenter of the license to to um have a\nLife of a and and the the fact\nAnd and the really troubling thing and I think I'm speaking for everyone in this room but I'm not that I mean to but the really troubling thing is\nIs to see this and and to feel\nSo bereft and and so hello and then watch the president the United states go to a rally I'm a pep rally\nIs really very very disturbing and his head and when you know what he ...\nHe said I'm a you know life has to go on a what has to go on you know a morning of these wonderful people that has to go on All right but to go to one of these what we can only call green light rallies mhm that's another whole story well he has no moral compass\nWhatsoever he has no sense he has no conscience if\nThat's clear he used the word global is I think in that rally which is another code word for Jews taking over the world [noise] um I mean they are using all the old tropes regarding anti Semitism in an aunt and and Jews in America I'm not that you can possibly use and you\nKnow I ... to for anybody who doesn't think that anti Semitism isn't\nAnd well and hasn't been alive and well in this country um you're not watching because you've got I mean Adam Schiff put it so well and his er\nBeen alive and well in this country um you're not watching because you've got I mean Adam Schiff put it so well and his article in his statement but you\nKnow I was just going to but but hey you all around the world around them or or maybe ... paid for blacks have for good paper I mean it is is have for anybody\nWho's not white male and Christian or married to a white male Christian I mean I you know that's really it really is it I I kept thinking if\nYou're living all weekend long thank you know really are you are the head of of the major congregation in the capital region um and you know a head responsibility for all of those people who you know who came\nI have one small ... disagreements which is\nA and that if you said he has no moral compass\nYou see I think he does have a moral compass and I think that's what's wrong the moral compass may be corrupted but his moral compass is anything that helps me get ahead is okay and I don't care\nAnd we need to start having that conversation and the the deck of Democrats need to start calling it out more explicitly I think there was um there was a debate where where I'm Down in Florida\nAnd the the deck of Democrats need to start calling it out more explicitly I think there was um there was a debate where where I'm Down in Florida they got the gubernatorial debate where I'm Cinderella credit candidates and I'm not calling my opponent or racist I'm saying that the race is think that he's a racist\n[laughter] and that okay [laughter] I think he's one of them and that's the thing so so Donald Trump is it although he did call himself a national is right so I mean I mean it's just it's so close that that it's in ...\nWhat's happening I think we ought to go back to the\nGermany ... in the Nineteen thirties and say the following thing was there always anti Semitism who we know the answer to this one in Germany there certainly was um and so did it take a Hitler to put the face on it and\nTo give that green light I've been talking about the answer to that is yes and I think that this president is giving that green light so I think that the comparison is apt to this ... mhm\nAbsolutely absolutely [noise] and he's using the same language\nA truly would like to say it's not just the president can we please includes the entire GOP culpability for the environment of hateful rhetoric\nFrom way back when Trump selected was elected as their nominee because he was the best selling their dangerous messaging that means and the humanizes so many\nWe can at least indict them for not being brave enough to get out on the biggest platform that they have and to choose their leadership for Mitch McConnell should be saying something that is right in the absence of a of a leader in the White House [noise]\nWell you know it's a tough one it's a tough one we all have Republican friends and we all know that some of them are very very good people a and a ... and ... we have to understand what this is really all about\nTheir ... there is an economic ruling class in this country\nA these are people who who have done very very well\nAnd they want to keep what they have\nMany of them ... and all of them but many 'cause they're ... Democrats who made a lot of money too\nBut many of them have made a lot of money and this is a defensive posture we want to keep our crowded and we want to keep those other people out who want things you know for the kids or for that and for snap and and the rest of it\nSo yeah you know it is it's tough to say all Republicans are bad people 'cause I don't believe that for a second and neither does anybody else on this panel I Am sure no\nBut the letter writer was talking about the Republican leadership and I think that that is fair right I mean the ... to ... to ... point there had been opportunities that they have had [noise] um and I would argue the Democrats have had many days of this one or two yes\nBut you think about this remembers the campaign when everybody was running for president for\nThe other guys all other people I should say all called him out they called him the most despicable of the apes all accurate\nOr and are they and if they are to be condemned for anything it's for\nShutting up now right I mean after all they were right in everything that they were saying even if some of them have their own issues\nSo so that's what's particularly appalling about that Republican leadership glass\nI mean a week ago or you think of what happened during the campaign [noise]\nThen candidate Trump was basically saying that Ted Cruz's ...\nWe could go by you think of what happened during the campaign [noise]\nThen candidate Trump was basically saying that Ted Cruz's grandfather was father father of the ... was part of the Kennedy assassination\n'em and last week Cruz was on a stage with Donald Trump receiving an endorsement from I mean it's it's a bizarre thing and it says a lot about\nIt says a lot about all all of them they're not willing to stand up to him there's a number of factors one they're getting the policy is an issue if they want ... you know and that day I miss the most important deregulation of everything\nYou know getting rid of roe getting rid of marriage equality that's you know those are the things that are on on the docket but they're spineless and they don't want to be the target of\nTrump's tweets because look at what happens when you are people tried to kill you [noise]\nDays he writes a deer pedal thank you for being here today and someone who has thrown everything I have been getting Antonio de do got elected I Will\nBe devastated if he doesn't win but it's not just because of how much I like Antonio but because of hell hateful the in our accusing me the RMC see has been in reading this idea of him as someone who isn't like us\nTheir latest ad is so gross and once again John ... was not spoken against these ads I Will say so that everything we can ask a couple of times and it is\nAmazingly disgusting I I don't I don't know how um [noise]\nI I didn't think it could top the last one but uh as far as despicable illness is that a word I Will use it when they use it now ah their latest that is so gross and wants to get it on fast as I was a he has encouraged them so a given everything that is going on in this country the hatred that dog whistles\nAnd we'll just feel so wrong in the spirit dispiriting if a John faster when somebody I guess that's a microcosm for what how people feel across the country when it comes to the a ...\nDay and nails pulling seven percent and it's unclear I you know I think that seven percent would probably have gone at least four or five percent would have gone to Delgado and she's just there to pull those votes away she's not there to win\nIt's extraordinary I'm you know if you go back to our debate and it's on line and you're listening to her remarks she hates herself as a liberal yeah yeah\nAnd yet she's going to be the reason mhm if he loses that he lose a and one wonders what's going on I could only say and I said before I'll say it again I I Walk into the green room with ... everybody was preparing the only two people that were there\nWere she any she in John fat so\nUm and um and they read each other if you simply mhm I ...

this assault in Pittsburgh jumpstart the presidential campaign for Michael Bloomberg it is time for a Jewish\nPresident okay\nLynn says this murder has been spewing out his hate on social media for a long time yet the alarm bells were ignored has posed served to energize him and spurred him\nTo more and more extremes when do we learned that the right to free speech does not include a right to a platform for it this is comparable to brown shirts roaming the streets in Berlin harassing people in the street\nThen beating them up why can't we see this in the present\nYou know it's a great place to be the right wing uses freedom of speech is their excuse back on you know we were reading the\n... comment that uh that gab site that we were talking about has been shut down temporarily they claim and they say you know here we are the past year and a free speech and you're shutting us down just because of murder or you know was popularized in what he did on that site so I don't agree with them but that it really is a hard tension and uh\nYou know those of us will create the social media world understand that you have to balance this stuff but it's really hard the numbers are incredible\nYou know what we were on that right what was it five minutes to that would be a two and a half million comments made on Facebook during last five minutes and you're trying to look at the mall and see what are good or bad who judged yeah it's a real\nTough work when all the I mean it is an interesting point though I mean gathered saying that the um so the platform of the people who the app store is and the people where you can sign up for that platform have kicked them off now um and they have to find a new way to get their their message out\nAnd um and as as Jim indicated are saying you know we we stand by free speech and and we want to have a place where people can um can see what's on their mind is certainly not all of the comments on there are um inciting hate\nAnd violence um and certainly as Jim just mentioned him and Facebook and Twitter also have their great\nFear of um ... hatred that drill\nUm so I don't know it is it so that's a very delicate balance and it seems like a real um it

you know I remember reading Eduardo ... biography and you know he had such high hopes for television\nYou know and the the um so the the that tweet um before that tweet or the president said there was great anger in our country cause in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people\nThe true enemy of the people must stop the open an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony fake news most and\nIf that doesn't put ten those than anybody is buying the fear of God actually it is\nFake news most and and if that doesn't put ten ... than\nAnybody is buying the fear of God actually this is really on believable you know look let's face it not every newspaper is perfect\nOr not every media outlet is perfect\nBut what he's done here is to make sure that any criticism\nOf of of media um is met quite correctly with the kind of resolute feelings that we all have about the importance of the of the first amendment\nAnd I I don't know if you're following by thought here it's a little convoluted but I Do believe that um what he's done is to is to really endanger our American democracy the way he's doing it with the press\nWilling and people have called him ... minutes visually member suppressive called him out on this and say okay give us examples like what what has ... us reporting what is is happening and and the numbers and so what ... what have we gotten wrong [noise]\nUm and uh but it is it's also I mean the hypocrisy coming out of saying that way peace and harmony and we have to um you know ah we have to do much to put out a this this flame of anger\nAnd then I'm four hours prior to that he wrote just watch wacky Tom's Diner who I've not seen an action before\nHe ... he was interviewed by Jake Tapper he comes off as a craze in some way you want it took ... should be running out of money pretty soon as bad as their field is if he is running for president the Dems will lead them alive I mean it's just ... ... and that's our president\nAnd how can he he call mainstream media fake news and then retreat a fringe bizarre Twitter account for\nTennis as soon as a yeah that's a well put that in fact I mean he did that this morning\nAnd that is what Hitler did even though there wasn't an injured it believe me that's what he did\nWell he had ... it's all propaganda one way or the other\n[noise] All right um [laughter] you know it's enough to make me want to just stay in bed [laughter]\nYou're you're right we don't want it and we get we get a better but you're right we do watch\nIt okay um the uh the other thing um\nI Want it to a quickly get to is um I mean ultimately ... there was a article in the New York times this morning 'cause we're talking about all those new just seems like I guess a good place to\nThe end which is we have eight days I'm left and as the New York times writes with ah those days left an already device of election season the campaigns finale is unfolding in ... rounds of finger pointing that reflect the deep fault lines and dozens of competitive house races\nAnd a handful of Senate races nationwide many voters appear to set back politicians from their own parties according to interviews in polling they also often defended or blamed politicians particularly Mr Trump based on the same partisan lines\nAnd I mean obviously a lot can happen in the week we've seen numbers all over the place in just the past week so we can only assume what's going to happen in in the seven days prior to people going to the polls next Tuesday\nWhen we've had unprecedented voter registration drives you can't predict to that kind of thing and I we'd all like I think it's a blue wave well let's see what it is\nUm but it definitely gives me hope um because I I ... in the polls such and they are so close that I have to believe that the energy\nIs is heading in that in favor of justice\nI don't even want to get all that I don't even want to I don't even want to leave led by political\n... is is heading in the in the

the other fifty percent they go into from work or going to be hopefully doing some type of pro bono work throughout their career\nSo I think it's um it's about guiding the students who are trying to

veterans this week and there's a lot of uh animal rescues representing so what's exciting about it is we're sort of helping trying to help ourselves with this event and part of doing this event was\nTo bring everyone together under the same roof and sort of show the Hudson Valley\nIt's not just this one organization here having a vegan event or this one group here look how huge this world is it's the food the clothing the the ethics the social justice components the environmental issues are huge around began his I'm supporting the in his own so\nIf people can we just hope they'll kind of be blown away at how it all in ... and how people\nWho are looking to be empowered in their compassionate choices every day you and me both this is a huge way we can start deconstructing the violent infrastructure that were kind of all taking part in but we don't necessarily understand it right\nIn Joe you know if I mean we're we're going to us like we're going to have a hotter vendors of sort of one or two more of a ... ...\nRight and joke you know if I mean we are we're going to I think we're going to have a hotter vendors of a sudden we have one or two more of a ... son into\nA fourteen speakers educational speakers out to this\nAnd also food demonstrations or what have we had over twenty five hundred a\nAttendees last year and we know that we're going to exceed the number of this year but none of this happens with a disorder and [laughter] I mean she this is heavy lift\nAnd she because of her activism because of her connections in the community\nIn terms of the vendors plant based vendors Reagan voters food vendors and a small businesses that are working really really hard to try to effect change in a positive way a educators uh I mean but it starts here [noise]\nSo we'll just for the for a second Rebecca of ... the was the first event and so what have you learned since then what what do you learn when you do the first one that\n[laughter] [noise] bring the second one into welding I learn increasingly how important it is to represent a diverse amount of voices or\nThat there is no one vegan whites there are incredible people on my wall a a day well a who is coming he's the founder of black veterans in New York City which is an incredible event the highlights the contributions of people of color in the ... movement who have\nA historically not been represented by you know the media that does promote these are issues so it's it's such an honor for him to come or just to really represent we have one cooking demo being done by Alyssa Miller who is death and her\nHer ah organization has definitely vegan\nAnd so this is why I call myself an intersection Ovie again I'm not just begun because for me the key to all of us having a more compassionate world is when we find our commonality and um so I we work really hard we can all do better to try to\nGet anyone who can represent to come and I wish there were more time and more funds to bring even more education I I never get tired of learning from these different speakers shorts\nAnd all of this question to both of you but what type of education do you think is needed\n[noise] I think that for all of us coming into the world we come in with an education at different stages and awareness of each other and we're either\nAdding more layers or trying to peel them away we've all been told that someone else is other and lesser and for one person it may be the animals for someone else and maybe someone's religion or skin color but we we've made an art form out of\nHeavily for to find these battery barriers and\nFor me the the the point of a ... to start deconstructing and going why does that barrier access I mean if you\nIf you care about this person can't you care about the suffering of this animal and and also I I'm a fact based person I'm a science based person a lot of uh animal rights activists I think we're dealing with\nThe stigma of people thinking that we're just cute animal people that that this is science these these are sentient beings they feel they understand pigs have the intelligence and chickens of toddlers\nAnd yet we're subjecting them on math to these horrifying realities a billion\nColleges and chickens of toddlers and yet we're subjecting them on math to these horrifying realities of billions of animals a year and the the pockets of that for peace activists if I if I can say that\nYou know most of us would never want a job in a slaughterhouse or we would never want our daughter or son to do that all day\nEvery day it's dehumanizing it's it's impossible it's an impossible environment\nUm and yet we support these things going on but how do you think that gets on your plate someone's being doing the work somewhere and most of the time they didn't choose to do it very rare person chooses that job\nUm I think there's a reason that all the top animal agriculture uh companies the top um [noise]\nMeat companies and companies are starting to invest in plant based alternatives and began foods and I think there's two reasons for this I think one is the environment is forcing their hand and money is often the bottom line for these massive\nA company for but at the same time\nI think that a certain managerial level is aging out and younger people are coming up through these companies and going I Can't keep that going on on him to ... as people that want and there's more of an audience know we all know with current events as they are\nIt's not just a matter of showing people what's wrong like um I was listening to your earlier this morning and like a lot of animal rights activists could echo what you said that we thought getting video in front of people\nWould change back in the eighties and nineties when my friends were talking about this and we thought off we can only get this on the air you know everybody would be horrified and change and it is surreal to be in a world where facts of what we are witnessing the are being challenged you know\n... to ... I don't know if I could add anything to them but when I wasn't that comes to mind as you know when you think of ... and where to find that it was the ethical and compassionate treatment of all beings and you include the person that as a living organism\nSo um for me what we're trying to accomplish here is to inform and educate\nThrough Hudson Valley about drugs and the Institute and in a phone a compassionate way and and it's a safe space for people to call him a great food a B with community learn an experience this than in a in a fun way so\nIt's the Hudson Valley bitch fest is happening in November third and fourth in Poughkeepsie and just a real quick till about the other than your 'cause it's a\nCool thing yeah it's we love our venue that it it's called the net and gold's gym and it doesn't sound glamorous perhaps but it is this big huge\nAstro turf space the size of re food [laughter] three [laughter] soccer fields and you will be able to wander the aisles spacious and we want community to come out we know we're facing some big issues come out come together this is one other way we can empower each other for more positive things\nYou could bring your WAMC picnic Blanco\n[laughter] people doing surgery a hundred dollar dressed\nA November third am for this coming weekend and they give you can find out all about it was going on our website or you can go to each the village fest ...

G. seat which was certainly going to be controlled by a Democrat in the matter what\nAnd what's the most recent polling do we have what do you know the ... most recent polls\nAye June ... daughter

wrong lately including a copy of court cases are up there in uh in Queens in which she um in which she beat the pole by fifty percentage points can you imagine\nA you know Donald Trump was losing was behind in the polls and you know the thing that people were not going to admit that they were going to be voting for him so you know a\nTurnout is came right turn out is ... and more than ever this year and I must say there are some things I don't get for example\nDon't I don't always get the New York times so they have this article in the paper yesterday in which they say\nHispanics may not end up voting I'm In this election or because you know then there's they have conflicting thoughts about whether to turn out or not and I know I didn't I didn't I don't really believe that for the way I just don't believe that\nI think that the what would be a big disappointment is if the millennials joined I felt that if we see college age students not coming out uh uh I think that would be you know pretty disappointing\nWell it but it would be consistent yeah but we professors have always found in the past or in fact they used to be a very bad joke about the only way to get him out would be to to to light a fire cracker or you know underneath them because I'm a it is never been a case that young people get out but\nI think that's definitely changing now at least one hand on at least what I'm seeing not just on college campuses they even high school I mean we have we have a high school age students who are are counting the days until they can vote and that's a level of engagement that that we haven't seen in a very long time boy I Hope you're right\nSo the the pollsters are out in full force 'em both yesterday and today I'm Talking about the uh the house and Senate and the the the basic um [noise] the the narrative seems to be the Democrats\nCan win two hundred and twenty six seats in the house majority well Republicans will win two hundred and nine seats but they point out um they also say that Republicans were all fifty one so you can read and maintain control the Senate but they do say\nUm that Republicans that it's important to look at the margin of error which gives the Republicans are very good chance of maintaining their control of the house of the house you know [noise]\nSo um which goes back to what we all have been saying I think\nFor several weeks now the turnout is key and it is very close yeah which I think we knew from the beginning right you remember\nOne of the great moments of whoever whatever advertising genius thought this up and said I could add a V. eight because the day after this election they're going to be double lacking themselves on the side of the head in so many very close races who say I should have voted\nWell it's interesting because I think generally speaking all politics are local and elections are such\nBut uh I think the Republicans have smartly made this a year and which is not about local but it's about national I think the Democrats are making that St push too and so the idea resent about your respective candidate but who you're can't they represent at about Donald Trump so this has become a national agenda\nThat scare issue for me though is voter suppression I mean one thing you can turn out as many votes voters and you went to the polls that if they can't vote sure and if they don't they\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no ... no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com\nPredicted to possibly lose by point eight\nYeah it's not only that but they've disqualified\nWell over a hundred thousand voters and they passed themselves\nThis very interesting law and which they said if you didn't vote in the last couple of elections are we going to end the spring quote by the way has said that's okay with us\nAnd if you're going to see more of this uh if you didn't vote in an election or one or lecture to elections you can't vote anymore unless you're re register a and here's the interesting thing about that\nYou know block floating is very important in America no matter what people want to believe\n'em and one of the reasons Brock Obama won the presidency is there is dark numbers of black voters who came out and voted because he was the candidate now you get Stacey Abrams in Georgia and they know what they're doing when they say\nTo basically black voting populations or you can come out and you can vote we're going to change the rules so that only we can win look we see this in American politics all the time\nWe see it right here you're talking about the state Senate state Senate leader the Republican leader goes up to the great computer and says great computer drawing the districts where we can lose and that's not Democrats dumb democracy I mean it's crazy and and and sharing your point about what's happening in Georgia is equally disgraceful yeah\nAnd that but we have in Florida I mean I don't know if you if you're caught any of the the gubernatorial debate last night but we have\nUm a really exciting candidate and in Florida who's actually up a couple of percentage points the same same issue same rumors and then the president tweeting about voter fraud humor is a non issue it just statistically\nOr you had a he had a commission that he created and the commission had to you know well they closed up shop I don't have any hope that it might exactly even their own even his own proponents said there wasn't anything and they knew that wasn't there was a reporter of elections in office do state says that's not an issue\nNot an issue and I mean I think speaking of the Supreme Court it goes back to the to the erosion of the of the rights to voters and the voting rights act\nSo in our few moments before we go to a break when you talk about suppression of the vote you gave a Ford as an example and and before the Georgia he is now a the however many\nDays we'll do sixteen days as keeping Eighteen but I don't think that's right there so it's two weeks or his two weeks and the other day so that would be Fifteen facts right and you're right okay\nSo um but my question is do you have enough time to try to make that situation better in this voter suppression especially when it comes to er or keying into\nThat at very least informing voters of what they can do to make sure that they can do\nWell on the the thing at very least I think that's where it's at campaigns would be wise to have to invest any remaining funds that they have and if they if they aren't cashing ounce um their media buys that they should use any of those extra funds to do voter education because you're absolutely right and monitoring I mean I I started to pull monitor\n'em in several contentious races including um you know when Cory Booker first ran for mayor I was a poll monitor in the north word\nUm and and he was receiving death threats and campaign and they were busing in his his opponent Sharpe James I'm with bussing in people from Pennsylvania to intimidate voters that the polls and where his campaign ... I'm ... and so um I think the attorney general's office actually um ...\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no joke no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog harness dot com\nYou know when you have and when you have an elderly voters being brought in and and and being there they're the people who are helping them being turned away so that they don't they they can't pull that\nWe think Paul the the the lover or sell out the bubble for the candidate that they want so many issues on site I think campaigns would be wise to educate voters to get 'em campaign staff\nOn site at at the most important point places and then to staff up their lawyers I have to say you got I mean election lawyers are going to be in high demand and the next couple of weeks\nYou know it was interesting about the Florida race were the governor says we've got to find ways to allow the people in the panhandle to vote and you say to yourself well now we know he's the Republican\nAnd what does he have to um is this because he knows that you know there just isn't right or that he knows that his votes are there\nThe media has had a lot of um self reflection about that\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com\nI mean professionally despondent\nIn other words that the Republicans are going to keep it all the New York times Hispanic votes um you know all that stuff I don't believe anybody any more I think the day is going to come when we're going to have an election and people are going to decide to go out or not and I see from men this evidence of excitement or ... on on a\nFrankly both bases but particularly on the Democratic base\nI just just encourage my just go out and vote it's it it it's so frustrating that I mean I think we may see some decent numbers this year as I got maybe not historic but certainly within the last two decades a voter turnout either really what's at stake\nOf but you're right there okay\nEr and Kennedy writes to us about the trans gender discrimination with the proposed new definition of gender could a man walk into the Miss Universe dressing room just saying and claim he was born a woman does this we define stop and frisk don't the police have more important things to do from Ken\nWell this is the topic we're well we'll talk about ...\nAnd then there are none that currently go ahead and John said let's do what do you get the caravan and then we'll get to that but go ahead John says\nLatino voters I'm a fifth generation Hispanic as the above is not my real name\nAnd what your panel doesn't seem to understand is a social values tend to along with conservative one the brake tends to happen with immigration however as time goes by and we increase our numbers of generations that becomes less of an issue as many of my co workers are either not voting or like me will be voting the Republican Party line\nI Would disagree that I think most nationwide most of the social issues take on a more of a of a democratic appeal\n[noise] well I mean if your kids can't get healthcare and if they can't get fed and if you're in a particular demographic uh it ain't good\nAt our other too many Republicans who want to get rid of a a cuts in Social Security and Medicaid I think we had a Democrat you mean ... well ... ... Republicans ... across the country are not are not supporting that measure\nI think we have to be really careful about who he who we put under the label Latino or in Latin acts that that encompasses a lot of different continents actually I'm In generations of of voters and so\nWhat what may be a conservative broad way too broad I mean that the if you want to look at at Cuban mailed over the age of fifty um then you might see something different than Guatemalan you know women between the ages of twenty five and forty\nSo I it's it's really tough to to do any sort of protective analysis of of how entire swaths of of the of our population will go like that\nWill lose this letter from John who says that's not his real name and it's certainly not Hispanic name that he is I'm a ... interesting in that ... basic predictor he's using here is that um they\nWill be people who come to this country and we've seen it all denominations\nWho say pull up the gang plant I'm here pull up again click on anybody else you know\nWell that that can be an issue with waves of of immigrants in our country we've seen it before on well we'll talk about the caravan um but you know Irish that there are

defiance\nOf those governments thousands of Central American undocumented migrants most of the Caribbean and that has been heading toward the United states for more than a week resume their journey on Sunday\nIn southern Mexico the Mexican government which has been under pressure by President Trump to stop the caravan has ordered the migrants to submit to processing by the immigration authorities at a legal border crossing\nWith thousands chose instead to move on part of a group of people who have\nBeen stopped at the Mexican border this week after having traveled for several days most from their homes in Honduras most of the migrants on the move on Sunday by one local government estimates more than seven thousand people across the border illegally in recent days by swimming or wrapping across\nThe river that separates Guatemala from Mexico or Sarah you obviously um are are very in tune with this issue\nAnd I'm I'm curious as to what is happening and ultimately what\nFor a group of of say seven thousand people the goal is to walked\n\nWell I Can't speak for that seven thousand people but um it sounds like they're starting to\nUh make their demands clear I I think I read that they they took a vote there they're starting to get to self organized around what about group decision making I'm sort of what we saw in the Occupy movement and when you see a group called last like that and you can't predict the outcome\nBut you can be sure that that that the authority figures in this case many different governments in different countries are going to have to respond in one way or another that response little reflect on us\nWhile you're at it or whether it's talking about what Trump said about them\nA he said that there were many dangerous as individuals in in the group\nI don't remember the word many ... is\nIs that it could this be the can this be that unexpected October surprise you know the cost of the next week week and a half\nSeven thousand migrants are going to come near close to the U.S border at some point in time and what is this country going to do what is what is the president going to order\nA the military to do and how ugly can just turn out to be and what will Republicans who don't want to see a women and and and children each slaughtered you know what what could they be\nWell you know there's another way to look at this and that is what's the Democratic response to this in other words Trump thinks he has an issue let's keep the immigrants out or we haven't heard from trucks\nStreaming support for WAMC come from birch are Center for weight

seven five one zero to register\nResponds that we're looking to because I guarantee you there are Democrats in this country who have grazed problems with immigration\nAnd that is we should sort of super liberals or you know saying this stuff we we'd better we'd better put our thinking caps on a in terms of what of what the expectations oh we'll be uh on the part of all voters yeah\nWell it's a human rights issue of I mean we can frame it as a democratic issue but um [noise]\nAnd I'm interested to hear what you think that the Democrats issues with immigration are aside from a political conundrum which um is only that much of a conundrum because of\nThe Republican stronghold in my view on on on on a level of government quite frankly right now but\nUm if we look at it through a human rights lens\n... it doesn't have to be left or right it's it's what are we morally obligated to do not just morally obligated what're we obligated to do under the refugee convention where the conventions in place why are these people fleeing their country what are the conditions that lead them to flee to these countries and what hand and we have\nWhat handed the United states government

border or at least shared cultural heritage similarities thank you and that's from one end Joanne says immigration\nWhat needs to be understood about the immigration issues are when the average person doesn't feel secure about their own situation they're less likely to welcome competition\nThere are many aspect of this and I agree with much of what you folks are saying but knowledge and some of the problems with unlimited a migration would balance the conversation I Believe I said that earlier today by the way\nWe can and actually typically we can absorb many many many many more people because the refugee camp had been lowered to historic lows it it just looks scary because of the way that the pictures are\n... that that goes back to when Hitler was pointing at saying that\nThose people

we can't really say that's really interesting let's work on it next spring they really need it now\nAnd so we are developing a new internship I'm with the help of the more Fox here I'm ... money to

impressed us\nUm and I I I'm with their dedication their commitment and their ability to bring together what they're learning in the classroom what they're learning in the community\nAnd sharing that I'm with their peers and with their classmates um and I think it really makes an impact both in the community but also in the classroom on their their true leaders\nUnique or program as those were do

doing\nPositions that the um the area on the resume that the interviewer really focuses on is the work they're doing through the center for academic engagement and they have a lot to share because

have to mirror his style because of what you of what you're doing is telling his story so is is that a challenge to you at all of of yes we are presenting those representing his story but I also have to come close to vote look of atomic\n... well that that's a great question and um I wouldn't say it was hard but you know if you want to do something good it's always going to be a challenge writer um\nI wanted to do come up with his style you know ... you know some of my books and you you know that I I tend to change from subject matter to subject matter I wanted to do something that was\nA somewhat um distinct from his style but not jarring Lee modern jointly different something that had a a a comfortable relationship with it but not trying to\nUh imitator emulate I'm Thomas call so the distinction was very clear when I use um [noise]\nA reproduction of his work you know I have a reproduction of of a cause great paintings throughout the book that I have um a ... that I've used in inside my art work sort of um [noise]\nBut and and as you said that isn't jarring that that seems to that's actually what made me think of the question because it is it's very complimentary to what you are doing\nYeah really I I'm I'm basically a storyteller I'm just trying to tell his story is the best way I can and obviously you couldn't tell Thomas called story without seeing some of his original art [noise]\nSo um [noise] you know I wanted that sort of montage feeling at um at certain points where I live um included his work but I'm In the context of my own you know sort of\nUm highlighting his\nWhat is it like for an artist is all the story of an artist\nVery personal ... another great question are so much of it I I related to I'm I'm not an immigrant I've you know my family's been here for centuries\nBut um I Do I have to say I followed a dream to come to New York\nAnd come up the Hudson River 'em and go to Europe I Lived in Rome for a year [noise] um when I was in school and that was a great inspiration for Thomas coal his work grew enormously 'em by his tour of Europe he went to England\nOr for a couple of years and then he went down to Italy for over a year and that changed his work a lot and I give them great credit for that because\nA lot of people think of them is self taught which essentially was and he was already famous and unpopular as an

mentioned it in a ... at the start of your answer it when I asked about the uh what it's like for you as an artist to write about an artist and he said well I'm not an immigrant how much of his story comes from that immigrant experience do you think\nWill certainly in reference to ah how he was informed by a where he came from the British um industrial revolution it was highly informed by that [noise]\nUm but also they were uh he got off to a very meager starred his uh his father you know classic um cottage industry they were put out of business because of the industrial revolution they came here\nAnd tried to start over a you know doing you know painting\nA floor clause in window shades and so forth and it did not go well for them for many years he actually walked across um Pennsylvania\nTwice a in search of a you know first going out there to um join his family to help them get started but then once he got the bug to become an artist himself\nOr he walked back all the way to Philadelphia and lived virtually on bread and water so it it's sort of the classic story the starving artist which I'm I'm I'm Glad to say I've never start\n[laughter] get hungry at time close yeah certainly my college\nDays imposed college years so that part of it I I definitely uh could relate to and and and most young artist I Know I've gone through that period too so it's really a classic story what's unusual about him his that\nHe came up here he found as inspiration with the Hudson River and the Catskill Mountains brightest paintings back\nPut them in the window and oh by the great fortune um another important artist of the time a John Trumbull was walking by saw them and discovered he was he was Thomas calls discover and he was you know like an overnight success he was the toaster the New York art scene\nOf by the time he was twenty five years old\nThat did not happen to me by the way not having to you so when you look at\nThe the story and a coal story obviously it's also very much a story of this region\nAnd uh and and you have because you live here a wonderful insight into how an artist responds to where they live oh well I Hope\nSo I I feel like this as

R. G. panel\nAt WAMC dot org panel at WAMC dot O. R. G. the same rules of why as always keep your letters short and to the point and on the topic I don't include wings or because we can't collect the money they're obviously um and it just because we're all in kind of a ... mood after the fund drive\nThings are because we can click the mommy there obviously um and it just because we're all in kind of a ... mood after the fund drive\nAlthough this was always the case just don't use abbreviations inappropriate so we know actually what you're saying and if it sounds like I'm trying you I'm not I'm just I'm making sure that we uh we have a smooth transition here and also um you know keep them short end to the point and we'll be able to get to you this morning so\nUh we're getting Malcolm dance on the phone right now and he will be joining us from Los Angeles I Believe it he's on the west coast I don't know exactly what cities and but what he tells you to have to kill ya\nYeah [laughter] that's right he is a former spot after all [laughter] ah but ah what is this getting him on the phone so we'll be with him and just a second so let me take this story I Want to talk about the show the story\nAnd we're talking about that with a with a un I'm a Malcolm in just a second but Allen so let's start with this one which is the president says\nHe was talking to the Associated Press who said it's not my fault of the GOP loses the house if the GOP was the house it's their fault it ain't my fault\nYou know what Joe after a while you begin to understand how this guy works and what he's saying\nIf he thought that his people that that the Republicans could keep the house he would say to you or we're going to keep the house this is all a bunch of nonsense who would give you that positive spin on it did he\nWould be responsible for keeping it and you as you may remember Joe he was running all around the country [noise] campaigning for Republican candidates\nWell the way it's looking now is that um the analysts and you know the analysts were saying Trump would lose the last two so you don't really know but the analysts are saying that the house is gonna flip democratic [noise]\nBut I don't trust those analysts but what because I think in the end it's all it's all about who comes out to vote you know next Saturday at two o'clock I'm going to be the ... community college for Ali uh doing a an analysis of this coming election\nAnd I've been thinking about what I Want to say in what'd you don't know who's going to turn out so for example in Texas there are an awful lot of analysts who are writing off or you know whatever ... Reichs thank you [noise]\nAnd um we have to help each other out today are more mushy will you have to help me more than I have to help you out there that much right now so um so so but but what happened in\nQueens and when you see 'em you know a a a long term congressman who couldn't lose losing that just doesn't count the people who the pollsters ordinarily gets kind of cool not going to come out\nAnd not to mention um look they got it so wrong in two thousand and sixteen and then two years have things changed dramatically and in polling that that are now of course pollsters say they didn't get that wrong but it seems like\nThey didn't they did and not only that we know that we know that they got it wrong a and we know that they continue to get it wrong the one thing that counts is people getting out to vote if they don't vote they're going to get\nA terrible reaction to their own interests so\nYou know in a presidential election fifty percent vote it's terrible in a in a bi election like Xi's twenty percent off and vote but if twenty five percent or thirty percent vote\nNow we see certain indications we see the money coming from the Democrats for the first time really that I can remember the Democrats are squashing Republicans with the amount of money that is coming out but who are they coming from they're coming from small contributors now each of those small contributors goes out\nThat is coming out but who are they coming from they're coming from small contributors now each of those small contributors goes out and vote in this election um that's gonna be the wave that will be the blue way that'll happen that'll mean congressional elections\nOr in in that domain but people if they don't get out and vote\nThen not going to win\nSo the people who are contributing will vote I'm sure uh but I Hope that that's an indication that what's happening here is that people are waking up and saying you're gonna you're gonna get clobbered if you don't vote\n[noise] you know Malcolm Nance has one of our great friends and that he is are we heard a lot of love for him during the fund drive he is a former Arabic speaking naval intelligence counterterrorism and intelligence officer specializing in the middle east a combat veterans survival evasion resistance an ex scape expert\nHe has a historian and the best selling author of the brand new book the plot to destroy democracy how prudent and his spies are undermining America\nAnd dismantling the west and literally\nTwenty two minutes ago I contacted them and said can you be on the show and he is or where are you where are you where are we calling you at\n[noise] um I'm I'm In Los Angeles this I was okay to on\nA nice for what political on what is that\nYes the political scientist at Comic Con of politics and it's huge this year at the Los Angeles and\nUh all the big heavy is they're going to be out here I'm going to make fun of and culture oh great do you get to that one on one with ...\n... well in the gigantic ... you're usually about fifty heavy of their VIPs insecurity and so yeah you can just go right out of the people but uh then it will have to panels and we have discussions about things that are important for the nation\nSo one of the things is important to the nation is what's happening in the midterms Alan and I were just talking to us about this while we were getting you on the phone and that is the president told the you a the a P yesterday that it's not his fault of the Republicans lose control of the midterm this comes just days after\nHe said that uh pretend I'm On the ballot in November So what do you make of that\nWent off if he wants to turn it into a referendum about Donald Trump I I think he's only reading the tea leaves I think that's what's happening now this is why you have so much energy on the side of the left and to a certain extent what's now that people are feeling rather satisfied about the Kavanaugh\n... from ... and you're going to start seeing that energy dissipate on the right ah but you know it's always going to be about Donald Trump whether it was a you know whether it was\nA midterm election or election for dog catcher is large the\nSystem does do bows and uh for the most part I think that this mid term will be one of the most important elections in American history and simply because we're going to be deciding whether we in in a naval a Congress that has\nDecided to surrender their role as a ... of the guardians of the constitution that\nWhether we will you know validate a essentially a person who are out of John Adams called ... you know with a a dictator president ...\nBut Malcolm don't you think are always trying to say it in my posts fund drives stupor don't do think that the fact that he's going around now saying if we lose 'em don't blame me means he knows they're going to lose\n[noise] no I don't believe that at all you know and this is a guy who came against a lot of thoughts and he has this horrible ability to motivate his base through fear and this is what he's trying to say he's trying to get them to believe that you know don't\nMe lay nearly dolls and that sort of you know ... cycle\nWhat he's trying to say he's trying to get them to believe that you know don't me lame yourself and that sort of you know psychological call works for his base but he's bases median age is fifty four years old like outrage right\nA button instead of the some of the year you're still young but the younger voters who are coming out to worship little upholding that\nMoney in the usa are almost exclusively on the side of the Democratic party and the question here is not just getting Democrats out the vote who voted that\nThis election needs to turn out at the level of the presidential election and twenty sixteen and I think that energy is out there I Know in my district in New York Nineteen that energy is out there but it has to be more than just wishing it\nTo happen you have to bring yourself to the poll you have to bring a person who didn't vote for him to the polls and that's how I'm ... you effect change and that's what the Democratic system was designed for\nWell one of the interesting things you mentioned New York Nineteen there are many people who now thinking that the Republicans are doing some things that are kind of a desperate for example [noise]\n... ... so that gives us a great transition Malcolm into Saturday the Saudi situation right now you said a mouthful in terms of what we stand for is a nation what is your contemporary thinking on that\nWell you know I spent my entire career working in the middle east and I specialized working with our forces as it often times the only American\nYou know African American or could speak Arabic to them which means that they brought me in their confidence a lot and we call these these little places where they talk the watts right where they're true selves come out [noise]\nUm and Donald Trump just found him self comfortable with these people they love a guy who can be brought who can be bought paid off they love that it's ... it's an integral part of the Saudi culture there everybody knows that you got to get your ten percent\nOr they love someone who hates women or if you use women as just sex objects as much as ... as they do I mean it it's just part of the nature of men\nOutside western world just everywhere they go back fifty to a hundred years interviews Donald Trump is in credibly comfortable with those people and he also loves the money and a luxury and they gave that to him in space but does that mean that we have to compromise\nEverything that we are\nBecause Donald Trump says that we ... we should\nYou know I mean this nation that fought and struggled and built\nItself could be the moral ... floor in this world that's gone we no longer on a moral example when we go overseas and I just spent a week in London and Paris uh everybody from you know both American and and and local or saying what is that what your country you know\nAnd this isn't a joke this isn't something you can laugh that we lose the money we lose trade we lose business we lose we act\nIn the rest of the world and Donald Trump thinks that he's gaining respect because the guys who are surrounding him including the Saudis who have just murder and American resident in literally made him into ... or he thinks that that's tough\nThat's not toughness let me tell you something I've worked with the special operations forces I've been in the dirt my entire career\nOr in the intelligence community tough Mrs or people can maintain their moral values and getting the job done this guy is not that guy\nWe a have a lot of letters and we want to get to those but on this on this case of 'em and and specifically the the question that that Alan asked you are in regards to what is happening here I'm this seems to be\nThat he is warning of a rush to judgment in the disappearance of ... he is saying that a Saudi Arabia was being judged guilty until proven innocent in connection with the disappearance of the Washington Post contributor\nAnd um we meanwhile meanwhile uh\nPompeo is saying that the Saudis promise to punish wrong doors in the show ... case so given that are specifically where are we right now because it it even if\nYou ... even if you take them at their at their word and and we're waiting until they are proven guilty until proven\nEven if you take them out there at their word and and we're waiting until they are proven guilty until proven innocent um it seems as though that is a is a strange card to play\nAt this point especially when you are so reactionary just so many other people I Know this goes exactly to what you were just talking about but but how do you how do you put that into a an overall narrative\nWell let me tell you something I I worked in total or as as as a military intelligence who subcontractor\nUh thirty six years in this business and in that part of the world and I will tell you right now we know what happened we knew what happened two weeks ago and it didn't have to come from the Turks do come from the Saudis we have a lot of resources [noise]\nUh you know in the slightest were crops up we have the ability to run it doubt Donald Trump knew\nThe details of this two weeks ago he did and there's just no way that he can say that he didn't but what he does is he doesn't believe U.S intelligence and when you see something that threatens his livelihood were threatened says his friends and and and other\nYou know I'm autocrats or around the world she just ignores much in front of them and what he's doing rallies he's dancing and he's dancing around the subject that he may have an incident which could break\nUs Saudi relationships and expose Saudi Arabia for the theocratic tyranny that it is and he just does not want to confront that reality\nAnd so he's doing this whole Kavanaugh like saying that you have to be innocent until proven guilty that's not the way it works in global geopolitics and global geopolitics you have to you gather the evidence through your intelligence agencies in your allies\nAnd then those people detour to make a determination in your own government whether this incident happened and that's why we spent a hundred billion dollars a year collecting intelligence Donald Trump goes that out the window and sides with his buddies\n[noise] All right ah thirty minutes ago we finished the fund drive and here we are now and uh the roundtable panel we are going to take a break when we come back we have lots of letters Malcolm announces with us Allan shark doctors here and we welcome your letters panel at WAMC dot O.

great\nTo the round table and a and tomorrow we have a wonderful panel set up and we'll be back to normal\nOkay that's great sounds great you're OK Kathleen writes good morning Donald Love went out Malcolm his own he said something interesting about a one party system do you think that the GOP can suppress the vote to the extent that this can happen even with the demographic changes in this country [noise]\nWell I think it's quite clear that he has that they have they have suppressed all they're doing their best to do it they're doing it in every way possible or and or can they yeah they can\nAh ended his up to the other side to make sure they get their people out and get them to vote and get them to recognize what their self interest is in the game\nBut they do and what their Russian counterparts of apparently done is try to discourage people from voting and doesn't matter there all the same I think yeah there's all the same you mean the Social Security system and its existence is all the famous no Social Security system you mean to say that are not allowing kids to be able to\nHave access to the and their parents to have access to the snap system so that people can have a a decent meal or that kids going to have a decent education you mean to say that those are are not differences but that's what they're pushing\nAnd you know what to some degree they get away with it in the mid term elections you get a twenty percent turnout if you're lucky or you got fifty percent turnout in the presidential elections you get a fifty five percent turnout and the election in the elections up hanging out on the Democrats are going to win [noise]\nSo um so it's just that little extra getting the people out so what do people do besides bitch about it do they say as Malcolm just said on the air do you do cameras your own neighborhood and say okay\nYou're going to come out and if you're in the nineteenth for example that'll make all the difference in the world are you going to come out and vote this time can we find a way to get you to the polls going can we help you are registered going to get you an absentee ballot going all of those things are the things that have to be done\nBut you know what complaining is just one thing but actually doing it is huge and very good friend professor that I talk with\nAnd if this if the last election as anything he was on the phone all the time he called everybody in the United states that he knew he said\nCan we get cannot how can I help can I Do something in that district so people say well I Can't help it because you know in my district everybody's going to be blue I said well first of all that's not true in each congressional districts upstate\nThey're having substandard education that those kids should suffer because the parents didn't go out and vote I Would like the parents to go out and vote I think they should go out and vote but I don't think that kids deserve what they're getting and same thing with health care and yeah you know\n[noise] All right um well it's been quite a morning Alan so were they\nWere a ... you end of the fund drive and uh it's all over we're back to regular programming or we're

writing that story originally in and telling it in a theatrical form\nA I learned that how much that those years of growing up there are shaped me a of who I Am and what I Am and what I what I Believe in and\nUh you know I grew up with a great great parents who courage me and my father was the one who said the saddest thing in life is wasted talent\nAnd he always encourage me not to waste my life and to do something with my life and that that life is special and I mean that's pretty incredible thing from a working class guy and he wasn't a he went to school we didn't go to college or anything my mom didn't but they were just\nPeople that wanted their children because I grew up with two sisters who are very successful\nYou went to school we didn't go to college or anything my mom didn't but they were just people that wanted their children because I grew up with two sisters who were very successful but to do that you know fulfill their dreams and and what I grew up in what I learned from the wise guys is\nUh how tough life could be and not to trust anyone and always keep your college close to the vest and that sometimes you think someone is your friend but they're not uh and that when it comes to uh\nYou're talking about the flaws I was struck in and seeing the show on Broadway when they're they're just these moments where there are gaps in the audience you know there's just there's people are [noise] oh that's where this was going\nWell you always have as a writer I always try to stay ahead of the audience if the audience gets ahead of you and that's not good that's when they get bored and looking at their watch they start coughing so the main thing is uh [noise]\nYou you just want to stay ahead of the worst thing you could ever get is a polite standing ovation that's the worst thing my stand in the city of issues that Bronx still got his\nJust want to stay ahead of the worst thing you could ever get is a polite standing ovation that's the worst thing my stand in the city of issues that Bronx Tale got is when the show's over Pam they jump up that's because they can't wait to jump up you know\nA that's a standing ovation when one two people stand another person [laughter] everybody goes I gotta say that you know that's not a thing of it out that's a but officially Evan Hansen they jump up fish that yeah they jumped right up I mean that's a great play I saw that I thought it was great so\nHow does that impact this not only I mean I could ask just about any aspect of the Bronx tale story whether it's a Bronx Tale story whether it be the one man show whether it be the movie or whether it be the musical of how then as your career path change\nHow does my career path chain in the sense of what you want to do next or what or or the roles that you're all yeah or or the or the opportunities you have as a as a writer and I want to do\nMore things uh uh I like to do my own things that I write or things that I really feel passionate about I just don't want to do\nI I I've been this way for the past few years but I just do I work in movies and TV of things that I like to do you know I'm OK financially I'm doing All right um I I just want to do things I Love to do I want to write more to the more I write the more I'm happy\nTo have more personal stories using\nTo yeah oh yeah I I think the my best work hasn't come out yet I'm writing a play now for I'm a member of the actors studio that I'm really excited about it yeah yeah\nAnd the the the idea I I think\nIs is obviously in in telling that story but ultimately to find a universal story\n[noise] ... you know what you know what you do look for universal story that's that that's that's like a thing that you can't do that you can if you try to do that you'll fail and you ... you write something that you think people want to hear the best way to right it's just something from the heart and hope that other people connect with it well\nRight I I I've heard it described as you know you don't sit down and say I'm going to write something brilliant write something and then hopefully people find that sometimes\nThey see a movie people see a movie then they see another movie they say oh I'm going to write something like that I I to me that never works out you know I write\nWhat I feel you know I listen to the people I uh I listen to talk radio a lot and I I hear what the people are saying and if it if\nIt is it's nice to be on top of those things before it happens and you go wow that's a good idea that I didn't I didn't know that you know and then you just get a feeling I I have a sense of writing things that are bigger than myself that are bigger than me and\nI I don't know you know when\nIt comes to the musical when these these incredible songs and the the just the incredible the entire production now when the show closed in June now it's on the road yeah what are you oversee that you want to be a part of all\nYes uh you know I'm One of the over the years I'm not the final word of course but you know if I see something that's not right I bring it up and we talk about it\nAnd when you bring it on the road and you bring it to other places I assume I mean we were talking about it being universal but I mean this is a story and it's a Bronx Tale obviously that has a residence when I was flying on Broadway in New York City\nBut it has a residents here in Schenectady hazard it'll have a residence when it plays the Fox in Atlanta they'll have a residence wanted it plays Kansas right\nBronx Tale is one of the biggest hits\nHave a residence when it plays the Fox in Atlanta they'll have a residence wanted it plays Kansas right\nBronx Tale is one of the biggest hits nowhere Japan Japan Japan now you tell me how to have [laughter] I don't know just hand loves a Bronx the movie love a Bronx Tale loves it just\nI mean I'm telling you is the most amazing thing when I meet people from Japan see me in the street it's like I Know something it's like scary [noise]\nUh but you know it just connects everywhere and it connects all ages people bring their children twelve Thirteen Years old because they see the message that he gives don't waste your life do something with your life stay in school\nIf you have the talent use it and ... and it connects with people in their eighties and nineties who just remember the old time and it doesn't have to and it's not white it's white black\nAsian Latin everyone says oh not yet I'm I I ... I grew up like that I had a guy like sunny yeah yeah so I knew a guy you know everybody it doesn't\nMatter I don't know how I did it I don't and I'm\nBeing not for a you know not full of humility I just wrote a story from my heart and whatever I did I wrote lightning in a bottle and it connects with everyone and I'm happy I did [laughter] ...\nYou said it took you ten monster I did not process is it is it just working out at the language and the and the characters ... well\nBecause I was playing all the parts I had to work on the characters how could I have three or four people talking at once and not and you had to know who was talking and not be confused\nSo that had to be worked out and I had a rehearsal odd because I did it all at accents and mannerisms and lights and and and sound so that took a while but and\nAnd I don't want to I don't want to put words in your mouth but I'm assuming that that those characters are ultimately inside you already in the sense of your writing them yes but they're already a part of you\nAbsolutely yes or some actors work from the outside in some work from the inside out uh I have to work for the inside out you know what I find when I have that thing inside of me what I Know what I hear his voice\nAnd then I could go the other way like De Niro who are certain actors worked from the outside of Bob works from the outside in like used to say well when I get to what I Know when I find out the shoes that the character with is that um I\nKind of sense I Know who he is he works the other way I work this way [noise] you know some actors put on there is some actors like myself to take off his ... is it so there's a difference\nAnd I I Would think though in a story that's personal and a story that is about you and it was about your father and it's about your upbringing and about the people who are close around you almost have to be from the inside\nYeah yeah I don't have to be but for me it is yes I work there is a piece of there's a piece of each person I Do inside of it\nAnd I connected with it organically you know I mean I don't know I mean that's\nPart of why I Do it I Do and you know God as good as you know humbly given me that gift and I and I are say thank you and I accepted and I work on it [noise]\nFinal question you you do the one man show you did the movie musical you start in the musical now the show is out during the country as just as an audience member and you sit back in\nYou did the movie musical you start in the musical now the show was out during the country is just as an audience member and you sit back and you're watching one of these performances [noise] those are still strike you does it do you still have those moments where you're like oh well this isn't a an out of body experience to see that they're\nNot as much anymore but there are times that could be sitting there like I was a I was when I was doing the musical on stage or I was and it wasn't even a she knows [laughter] I just happened to be sitting waiting in listening to my dressing room and the scene was what Robert Blake\nOr Rob a Richard like sorry Richard Blake who plays the runs with my father and the young boy uh Frankie I forgot his last name could there is that no no the young boy oh God I Can't think of who's who's listening who's just terrific and all\nOf a sudden they were doing the scene of the working as a ... slaps them and I was back you know I was ... it was like weird and I started to tear up in my eyes\nAnd then I knew I had to go on stage and so I just let it go away but it was like really strange like while I was doing it if all these years I don't I don't know what just just happen I just go to my dad you know and I kind of weird\nAnd of course there are people in the audience were having a very similar\nYeah everyone\nEveryone at the end of this show cries I mean you can you\nThey feel they it's something they're laughing at one minute you know I always tell this thing that Alfred Hitchcock who I admired so much\nUsed to say there's only three things you could do to an audience and if you do to add three you're doing great [laughter] because as you can make them laugh you can make them cry but if you give them that's it can't do nothing else in the Bronx tale we do all three yeah we do all three\nTwo days ago we were in down in New York City we've done ten or twelve days throughout New York and Pennsylvania in Vermont and California or turning all across the country with the truth is change the truth is change the book\nIs actually the script of their performance monologue with quite a few additions because it's a bit longer than the actual bottle on but that said WWW the truth has changed tour\nDot com so it will be a film um the the I think of it as a spoken documentary where I really go into the deep in the various misinformation campaign of Cambridge Analytica Steve Bannon of many of the forces that were altering public consciousness during the twenty sixteen election and they're still doing so now\nAs well as up against the backdrop of a very violently altered climate\nSo I'm a little bit about why the idea of doing a spoken word performance was the what you wanted for this particular work\nWell it's amazing uh my last film how to like go to the world I Love all the things climate can't change which is really the third part of the gas plant trilogy gas and oil and gas and to and how to let go I went into HBO all those films run HBO\nAnd they that movie did very well lots and lots of people watched it thanks to all the people who watched it and they wanted me to do a new project and we couldn't you know\nReally come up with it and finally Sheila ... who's the guru of documentaries of all time at at HBO she's my mentor and in in many ways my tour mentor\nUm who I Love she just points across the desk and she goes you're going to take that that show that you do all over the road we're going to make it into a one man performance we're going to put that on HBO and be you know so\nI had been touring with gas gas into was how to let go with a wake a dream from Standing Rock my my my last film on a Standing Rock and doing public appearances being out on the road with Bernie Sanders\nA my history of my my my origins as a maker of work as as in the theater\nSo she she knew all this and she said she wanted me to make this one man show so we worked on it for a year or in development with workshop performances in New York and in New Orleans in San Francisco and Los Angeles and it's finally ready now we're all over the country on tour with it but it was an idea that sprung up\nFrom Sheila in Evans who is it was a genius and I had to take it on but I Love it I'm I'm having an amazing time doing it we're having incredible audience has come out for this\nYou know and the responses from people had been utterly abusive so please do come out and check it out if it's coming to your town we're going to be in Columbus we're going to be in Milwaukee Lincoln, Nebraska Boulder, Colorado Houston Brownsville, Texas Los Angeles San Luis Obispo Chico Oakland to name a few as we head out uh what was the next couple of months\nThere is a scene in the book it's called how do things change and I guess that's the question that so many people have of how do we change things now things change because people get\nIt's called how do things change and I guess that's the question that so many people have of how do we change things now\nThings change because people get personally involved that section of how things change is basically asking a question of how did the fracking movement get started\nSusan fry in guy Arkansas a thousand fracking induced earthquakes in Arkansas she was completely obsessed but her husband was thrown out of his lazy boy chair\n... during a four point seven earthquake and I imagine that when he hit the ground something changed or Amy Ellsworth in Colorado who had you know fire coming out of her ... think explosions or water was still flammable due to fracking\nShe was showering in the dark for fear that spark from her light bulb will blow over across the street in the middle of the shower and I I imagine her they're freezing not being able to sleep terrified\nSomething changed uh or carry Greenwood who died of glioblastoma brain cancer a nine out of ten if his cabs on his farm were born stillborn and I imagine a his widow walking away from his gravesite realizing\nThat she buried her own husband before she buried the calf which was evidence of the racking contamination\nAnd has something there changed you know these are the personal stories that we go into in the in the play and in the in the film in the book about individual change we change our sense of who we are is on the line\nAnd we only change that the government we only change this country when we get involved when we leave our house where we go to community meetings where we volunteer when we participate and lo and behold that is also the solution to the terrifying isolation and depression than people feel in today's political climate\nYou spend all your time staring at your phone you're in a tiny little walled garden of all your own ... you have to do is fight fire with water and water\nIs us being in a theater together water is sharing information water is life and life is about truth and we can't have a sense of what we're doing is a democratic society without a mutually acknowledged verified sensibility of how we determine and derive truth we always do that as a collective\nAnd the things that the propaganda people would have us do is to separate and divide and conquer and the push smearing misinformation on our Facebook feed on our Google searches and other IP addresses and that is what one of the things that the peas addresses but we must change and we only change as a collective\nOne of the things I found fascinating and then just your your answer is is what that group can do what is it an audience can do\nAnd and it just seems that this time that that people need that need that together as they need to come together and they need to feel as though they're not the only one feeling the way they do\nAnd I need to look we all know that I mean\nIt could be on it's like we may gas that we may gas in part to he made these films on HBO\nThat was going into forty million homes the United states why did we tour I toward five hundred cities you know across the world in the last ten years the reason why is because we need to digest information in a in a setting where we can organize you know we used to say about gas and in part to go watch it alone it's too scary you know like psycho\nUm and and the truth is information out there right now especially with the climate and especially about the ways in which our democracy as being tampered with especially with the fact that we have with author or Terry and racist climate change denying anti science Tito\nAs the president these things are extraordinarily depressing an isolating the cure for our isolation the cure for our depression how we reinstate hope how we reinstate the American dream how we reinstate our understanding of how how we can get back to a society based on truth\nAnd goodness any quality is always going to happen in rooms together that's what we're trying to provide\nHow how we can get back to a society based on truth and goodness any quality is always going to happen in rooms together that's what we're trying to provide right to whether or not it's a film screening that you hosting you bring four or five or ten or twenty people into a room we have that program to allow people to do that free of charge\nOr if it's coming to the tour and most of the tour dates are free some of them are five dollars ten dollars whatever we want people coming into that room together and we've had incredible success doing that with a thousand people\nIn Ithaca to see the show we had hundreds of people in in narrows burg\nAnd in Vermont and and uh you know in West Chester, PA all these places that we've gone because there's a movement there and that movement at the end of that show they get up and they stand on their feet and we share and scream\nAnd that is part of what it is to be healed and restored so that's why we do these tours in it you know it it it is one of the most amazing experiences that I have just being able to see that that that\nHumid phase of what's actually happening in America America is not a dark place right now America is a place that under a tyrannical rule a Donald Trump was not elected by the majority of people who was elected by the electoral college and the majority of people in America\nFeel that there needs to be places for that to be an outlet and those are political rallies or political campaigns\nAnd of course that that's the theater and that's art in that culture so I encourage people get out go out of your house\nCourse read the book get the book but more than that let's find the places where we can community come together and we're going to be tar industry for quite a while a year or two so there will be opportunities\nThe book is the truth has changed for more information about the performance with tour dates and all of the information you need you can go to the truth has changed tour dot com the

S. obese who deserved to be fired right away\nWhen you see that he's talking about a congresswoman Maxine Waters as a low intelligence individual playing I think on the stereotype\nOf blacks as having low intellect you stop and say oh my God how did we [laughter] how did things turn around so quickly means seems to me like it's this is more than Thirty years in the past this is beyond that point when I was writing eyes on the price so it's it's so discouraging\nYou actually one of the one of the comments on the book is uh from none of Brazil who says or you know we might find the moral arc of our history suddenly bending backwards but we're we're doing that right I mean we're already been\nWell in so many ways I I don't know what to say it's sort of dispiriting isn't a joke but I mean\nYou know after the Kavanaugh hearings and I think a lot of women in the country for you ... you know something's going backwards here and I think that if you ask people in the Latino community\nIn terms of the anger that's being expressed towards immigrants not only in terms of uh the president's policies towards illegal immigration but I'm Talking about his desire he's he's proposed cutting legal immigration in the country\nIn all these ways what you see as someone who seems to be oriented towards\nPushing the clock back in time or maybe this is a reminder that his campaign slogan was make America great again and it was I think reverential of a time maybe in the Nineteen fifties that he sees as ideal but I think lots of people in a more diverse America and that's where we are today\nRealize it back in the Nineteen fifties there was limited opportunity for people of color and for women and that they fear going back in time before the brown decision before the civil rights act of sixty four before Dr King before Thurgood Marshall\nBefore you had people not only Democrats like the Kennedys and President Johnson but also Republicans remember it was Eisenhower who sent a hundred and first airborne into Little Rock\nTo protect the rights of nine children are trying to attend Central High remember that it was Richard Nixon\nWho with his Philadelphia plan was the first to talk about the need for affirmative action to help lift up and bill that black middle class community\nAh so it's almost as if Trump is pushing the clock back in time rather than embracing the idea that America is a country that's been always been about moving forward and being inclusive\nSo a couple of points one thing is I mean you were talking about ... what he called her and Maxine Waters and so forth but you know and the first day I mean it did that like that\nSo a couple of points one thing is I mean you were talking about ... what he called her and Maxine Waters and so forth but you know and the first day I mean it did that like the day that he was inaugurated as president he went after John Lewis of all people are as a civil rights icon he goes after John Lewis and he\nSays the Congressman Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district which is in horrible shape rather than falsely complaining about the election results all talk no action or results\nSad that was a John Lewis and bring it up because we're talking about this idea of what then of what then was referred to as the dog whistle\nTerm I'm sick of uh [laughter] I agree dog dog whistle we'll we're well beyond dog whistle there is no the dog whistle indicates that it's something that that is being done that you can hear well we're hearing it loud and clear aren't we\nI think so and you know again the facts don't support what the president was saying even if you say oh you know Joe won ... he's just you know punching back he's a great counterparts you're John Lewis criticized him so he's going to criticize John Lewis\nBut the facts aren't right John Lewis represents a prosperous area of Atlanta which is a booming city in America so you have to stop and think what is he doing I mean the words he feels he can create his own set of facts\nIn order to demean and to diminish John Lewis is standing but again I think Joe you and your listeners know John Lewis is someone who had his head cracked open bloody\nOn the Edmund Pettus bridge again marching for equal rights in Alabama\nSo he was a civil rights leader and today as a member of Congress often referred to as a civil rights icon but the but the President Trump he doesn't have any respect or reference for this man service in fact at one point\nHe said that he didn't think Louis was a brave man it's unbelievable\nAnd and again that idea of no action I mean that that again is is just the once again going into a stereotype and and so my my uh my question to you is as as you indicated a moment ago\nOf this this idea of of bending backwards but but it it's it's also giving\nA great strength to those those feelings of racism that are were bubbling under the service\nAnd giving them some credence and allowing them to be shared more widely than they were before and I I don't know and I ask you and and I mean obviously this book is a great help but but what do we do to combat that\nWell you know you just expressed it so clearly and I must tell you a job at your sentiment is reflected in the polls where you have now more than half of Americans in fact nearly two thirds saying\nThat this president has emboldened racist and white supremacist to express their views in public\nSo they feel comfortable with him as you may know David Duke has said he's our guy and then of course after Charlottesville\nThe president was reluctant to condemn even neo Nazis people standing with tiki torches outside of synagogues threatening the Jewish people worshipping inside he was reluctant even they were fine people on both sides\nUnbelievable so what you get is a society now and this is picks up on what we were talking about a moment ago when I did eyes on the prize in the late eighties\nSo what you get is a society now and this is picks up on what we were talking about a moment ago when I did eyes on the prize in the late eighties we thought we had reached a certain point I didn't think we would ever be returning to a day when we were the neo Nazis marching in the street\nThat's unbelievable to me I didn't think we'd come to a day\nWhere David Duke and the Klan would be pointing at the president saying that's our guy\nThat's our guy it's unbelievable and of course as we were just saying go I never thought we'd come to the point where you would have the president of the United states saying about a civil rights leader hero icon like John Lewis\nHe's all talk no action how can you say that about a guy who was at the head of a march and got his head bashed in talk about action but that's Trump ...\nYou know I Know we've talked about this before in past conversations but I'll bring it up again because it it seems timely as it always is I guess um but but of course a lot of this talk is coming out of the very network that you work for\nUm a lot of the talk of of\nThe the the these voices that they're allowed to speak of course as they should be freedom of speech\nUm are on the Fox network and I I Will just ask you a of how you feel about being a part of that organization than what you feel your role is in in trying in in some way to to level that playing field\nWell I think that's exactly the way I think of it I mean you know some of the things that are fed their concern me but I must tell you I'm inside that bubble are trying to burst and trying to present a different perspective I'm On the air every day at Fox News\nAnd I got to take my hat off to them in the sense that they know the message that I deliver no one tries to limit or censor what I say and as I say I'm they're quite regularly um and to me\nThe important thing is that there are alternate voices who are contradicting some of the extreme voices that you hear on Fox\nSo I Am appreciative of the fact that I'm allowed that platform to speak to people who are drawn to those kinds of Trump Trump like messages\nI mean to me show you know the important thing is that people get out of their bubbles and hear from other Americans and understand that other people have different prospective different viewpoints and you have to say\nIf your children and the Fox you know there's different viewpoint sometimes you don't it might not like I'm a but guess what you can hear the different point of view and here it prevented by people like me\nWe we think of him as a planter and a general and surveyor and what you know what you look at here is as I said in the introduction that counting he had when it came to being in the water\nYeah you know we think of them is permanently attached to his horse mattered grew up in the tide water\nHe grew up on the rap on a river or eventually ended up on the Potomac\nLiving at Mount Vernon which by the way is named for British admiral a and he had a keen understanding he you know he had no choice but to have an understanding of the importance of water this was a time before multi lane highways before railroads [noise] the only way to transport people provisions\nOf any number was by water uh up in your region it was the Hudson River that played such an important part in the\nRevolution [noise] uh and uh in the final years of the revolution the focus shifts to the Chesapeake that inland sea and whoever has control of that is going to have the ability to win the land battles in that vicinity and so Washington\nUnderstood this and and you know I ... the the subtitle refers to the genius of George Washington and he was one of these guys he he he wasn't a brilliant in the way that Hamilton was who could command all sorts of\nA random facts and and just deliver the most eloquent synopsis possible Washington with some of the was someone who could weed out the static of life for a focus on what really mattered\nAnd followed that with an intensity that no one uh could could a rival and so when he figured out\nIt was French ... naval superiority that was going to win it he uh place dollars energies and trying to make that happen even though no one seemed to\nFrench ... naval superiority that was going to win it he a place to all his energies and trying to make that happen even though no one seemed to cooperate with a division he knew was the only one that would win the war [noise]\nOne of the things that you know you're right about him and his portrait and and I'm drumming out a little bit but but one of the things you write about is just how emotional he became we think of him just being steady as Iraq but the highs and lows that we see\nFrom him during Yorktown are are quite surprising and and they're and they're it's quite a contrast isn't it\nYeah yeah no the you know ... why should we think of Washington as the the guy on the one dollar bill you know a statue staring us from mount Olympus or you know someone who's absolutely ... but he was he\nFelt deeply or he also uh had incredible control over his motions but in the year of Yorktown he's ... by so many of frustrating and raging events that you you know he cannot help it points uh express himself there's at\nOne point when he's on the Hudson new Windsor that's where his headquarters were on the west bank of the Hudson and uh he and Alexander Hamilton his foremost aid get into a violent argument and this airway staircase leading up to his upstairs\nOffice and it reaches the point where Hamilton says you know I just cannot take it anymore and they part\nThat's the end of their relationship at least a you know in the headquarters and you know this is not the George Washington most of us realize there's times when the French it becomes clear that the French\nAre following their own agenda you know they they're not in it to help us necessarily there in it to to uh um defeat the British and and there are agendas do not always match up until Washington is driven to distraction at\nTimes he's just you know raging with anger\nAt what the French are doing and then you see him when he finally learned that my gosh the French fleet has arrived it to the Chesapeake when he learns that on September ...\nThat the French are are a general Roche um bow and his entourage are about to arrive at Chester, Pennsylvania on the Delaware and they see this this figure jump leaping about\nAh with his hat in one hand his handkerchief and the other waving them up and down and they say who the heck could that be that oh my God it's Washington Washington was just\nSo elated he just had to let it rip you know this is the washing this was what Washington was like he was an emotional are fallible man but somehow was able to keep it together through this year of job like frustrations and torment\nAnd you know I call this book or in the hurricanes I I think the hurricane is a perfect metaphor for this year this was not a linear progression to victory this was a series of random event stirred up by forces beyond anyone's control and\nAt the center in the eye of the hurricane was Washington the one person resisting all those and trickle forces trying to blow things to smithereens and due to his leadership uh we are now and independent country\nIn\nIn what you just said about our relationship with the time with friends often goes against what were we have typically\nA thought of our relationship with ramps during the revolutionary war which is that it was it was a an ideal partnership or you you write that it was really anything about that and as you just explain that were great frustrations on the on the part of a general Washington\nAnd yet and yet in the end\nGuy bouncing up and down was able to put the\nAnd Washington and yet and yet in the end that guy bouncing up and down was able to put the ego aside and put ultimately the country I had and say okay but this is what's important\nYeah and this is what distinguishes Washington as he said at one point in a letter to French admiral big Ross who led the French fleet that defeated the British the battle of\nThe Chesapeake he said greatness is recognizing that you must do not what is good for you but what is good for others you know he had that ability to look outside of his\nOwn uh impetuous character and and operate on what he also called the great scale or you know it wasn't all about him\nIt was about his country\nAnd you know he's the he's the one person who sees this vision of what a nation we could be and he conducts himself in that way and ah you know so this is a different you know this is this is a model of leadership\nThat I'm a uh is is something where he's able to subvert his own ego or in dealing\nWith an ally if he knows it's in his country's best of the ... best interests um and I think it's a model of leadership that as a as relevant today is what ever was\nWe were talking to a Nathaniel ... new book is in the hurricanes I the genius of George Washington and the victory at Yorktown\nYou spoke of this is the beginning of our conversation in regards to the water and I I'm hoping we can just go back on that in and focus on the spotlight a little bit but the\nThe impact of the water had on the revolutionary war the the rivers the seas of of how of the impact of that not only just just Washington because we talked about Washington his cutting when it came to\nHis naval abilities but but just the overall landscape of the water\nYes I mean it you know I I come from the maritime background I live on Nantucket Island thirty miles out to see 'em a and but grew up in in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania are you know which is by no means of maritime center but it's on the rivers and I grew up with a real understanding that\nThe rivers were how good were transported back then\nAnd and in during the revolution it was who controlled the rivers controlled the destiny of the war and you know the Hudson was the the important thing in the middle years of the war\nOr ... uh and and when it came to this year of Yorktown Washington realize that a naval force was not only important in winning a naval battle but it could also be important\nIn transporting his army because of the roads are at that time were terrible\nAnd transporting an army five hundred miles south in the searing\nHeat of August and September was going to be very difficult largely\nBecause his army hadn't been paid in years and they're you know insurrections had already occurred the earlier in the year and he he just feared it would all fall apart and it was frustrating to him when the French said yes we will help you buy sailing into\nThe Chesapeake but we're not going to stop in New York first and pick up your your your army and so what this was once again\nEvidence of Washington's frustrations but also his keen understanding that a navy not only is useful in fighting naval battles but\nMoving large numbers of troops the British did this all the time during the war using their stranglehold on the Atlantic seaboard to their benefit Washington\nNumbers of troops the British did this all the time during the war using their stranglehold on the Atlantic seaboard to their benefit Washington seemed to be the only one in the room when it came to the allied high command that realize\nWhat exactly the sea rivers lakes or could do for for him\nI realized I'm asking you are a huge question but uh because it's the bulk of the book but uh if you could just give us a brief description because I found this to be fast moving um\nBecause I didn't know a lot about it which is the battle of Chesapeake and ultimately how that leads to a besieged Yorktown and makes that

I think the Saudis have learned that they can do pretty much whatever they want and there won't be consequences\nI'm you know we we were talking a little bit before we went on air just about you know the Saudis have been awful actors for a long long time but just because of our suppose a geopolitical geopolitical needs in our worries about Iran or worries about oil or worries about [noise]\nUh other things we've we've kind of you know treated them could gloves what what's interesting about the Trump I mean Trump was supposed to be all about strength and all about toughness and in this case you have a foreign government murdering a\nUm American resident not an American citizen but at least an American resident who writes for the Washington Post and a response has been anything but tough you know it's just been like hey who knows I don't know [noise] can't can't rush to judgment um\nWhich in a coma captain obvious here but uh I mean the problem is of how many times is administrators shouldn't in particular this president has rush to judgment I mean it's\nIt right well with with our out with with our friends with our democratic allies we rush to judgment with our with our with other dictate with other dictators with dictators he tends not to and it's a it's a little bit of a weird but I like I said he's not the only president who's treated the Saudis with kid gloves\nSo one of the things obviously that that you know kind of following up on your comment is we've had a whole group support horrific war the Saudis are carrying out against the Yemeni population management and bombing indiscriminate bombing of hospitals have kindergartens of community centers\nI mean it is the most one of the most disturbing warrants that it's so under reported\nThe Saudis commit mass murder constantly\nOne wonders why it is that push up she got so much press well the reason is he presided in D.C\nThat is the difference because he suddenly looks like oh he's a member of our society at least he lived here he explains Saudi society to an American audience now if you think of\nThousands and thousands of yeah many being murdered on the most brutal wave or one should not even speak of public execution\nThousands and thousands of many being murdered and the most brutal way or one should not even speak of public executions in Saudi Arabia or those dungeon prison where people\nIncluding women that protested in favor of their right to drive cars have continuously disappeared and been in prison we don't know their status but dogs are unknown human beings they're massive we don't know that faces or name so that stories push up she lived among us that is\nWhen he was a journalist and you know I was gonna say I was a gentleman a journalist in and day quote unquote enemy of the people according to the students were right about that part of the story is a little bit of a strange journalists though because he he kind of play to both of these journals on one hand but at times he seemed to be a spokesperson for the society or for the government even\nAnd yet this is Alan Alan hey good morning on a and\nOne of the things that does occur to me is that you know one of the things that the sociologists have done for years very you certainly know about this as they've gone around and they found out what people think of different countries\nSo when I was in college in the Nineteen sixties the society though was hated by most Americans was the Turks go figure that out I may have been the Muslim thing it may not have been and they may have changed since that time\nBut I think your point is brilliant there and that the the Yemenis are just the invisible to most people in this country nobody knows who they are\nNot many people know how closely involved we are ... with a bombing campaign New York we refuel the jets and that didn't start on the Trump either that started under Obama I mean\nI I think sometimes we since Trump was awful and a lot of different ways we we think he's uniquely awful in every way and in this case I think I mean our our approach to Saudi Arabia is an awful for\nA very long time mhm or at least immoral for very long time absolutely I Would have to agree with you because I'm In the United states we have had a long experience with state violence or violence by the military\nCarried out against the number of countries and we have collaborated with hideous dictators across the world now we were often more quiet about it\nBut the difference now is that President Trump apparently fields um okay but the fact of just making it public knowledge that those are all allies\nYeah and it's it's curious wondering whether that's a good thing or a bad thing I mean he's making it very clear that he considers this relationship to be transactional [laughter] and I think a lot of presidents have used their relationships similarly but they just haven't been willing to say it quite so bluntly\nWell that's that's the thing that I I find interesting in normal times if if we were to back up\nFour six eight twelve fourteen years mhm um and look at this\nSituation like this we would be asking the question that I Would be asking all have you on the panel is what is the long game and the administration what are they trying to do a ... and diplomatic away what is trying to be achieved it doesn't seem like those questions are relevant and those ...\nThey're not they're not what what is at the center it's financial a financial interest investments in Saudi Arabia arms sales um all kinds of deals that Trump may have had in the past the Saudi investors are people\nThat stay at his his hotel and it's his is\nUm buildings that he owns that have purchased some that Saudi has had you know we've got bailed them out or by purchasing and ... you know one of his yacht years ago Twenty years ago when he went bankrupt and those kinds of ...\nThey bailed them out by purchasing and ... you know one of his yacht years ago Twenty years ago when he was bankrupt and those kinds of stories so we know he has had a long financial transactional relationship\nBut as we know it is here as he told us he did he told us he was very specific during the campaign he bragged about all the money that the Saudis had given him and he's just sort of the other day or one of the four thousand in something lies and said I have no I have no business relationship with them\nThat's right he he is the first foreign country he visits after he was inaugurated as president he obviously had a an interesting experience he enjoyed his experience he likes being\nRecorded in countries where they are ruthless dictators in charge of uh the environment he loves to charity he loves ... he ... you know these are the kinds of people he feels comfortable with\nNow what does it mean for the United states it means that we don't even\nReflect on human rights or specific values that we supposedly hold dear\nAs primary in our discussions and our diplomatic efforts in our economic relations\nWere we always achieving goals that we had did we always represent American ideals effectively in on the international in the international arena no of course not we fallen short many times\nUm he was immediately establishing dominance in society\nAnd he has he apparently isn't anger problems\nOr a question for you I think everybody's thinking is the guy knew that he was in real danger yes yes he did and he sent his fiance or his wife or a ... fiance a message indicated he knew right so well he ... he waited\nOutside the embassy right and he told her if I'm not back out in an hour start\nAlerting the Turkish authorities so why did he walking so one of the things that I've read about his life and I I mean obviously I don't know 'cause I never met control gene or do I know what is private life was like but when you are ostracized in from Saudi society he also what disconnected\nFrom old friends from his family his wife are separated from him\nAnd a lot of this happened for security reasons\nUm family members don't want to be executed for what he does elsewhere or how it's perceived so he was very he was feeling very lonely and isolated he was desperately trying to reestablish a family home life\nAnd he met this a Turkish woman fell in love and wanted to marry her and he couldn't do it under Islamic law unless he had specific papers from the Saudi embassy\nThe Saudis knew he had applied for those papers and they flew in the execution team interesting [noise]\nWe have some modification team yeah to go to the doctor apparently who helped or this number the\nYes you wrote and the phone so we have that on video\n[noise] yeah we have letters on those on will ah will go with ozone\nJust says good morning ... the whole issue in regards to the killing of this journalist is ridiculous nothing was done to Saudi Arabia regards to Nineteen and my ... that killed almost three thousand Americans on nine eleven and that's from Jeff in New\nYork ... who were kind of thing I mean we open our position toward Saudi Arabia has been terrible since what the late Nineteen seventies maybe early Nineteen eighties I mean this is not it may have been ... they have gotten the impression that can get away with with any than what they want to do\nYou think it was the because I think that the law is that Americans were said [noise] but yeah there were Saudi Arabians but they were bad Saudi Arabia's much like they're trying to convince the snow that these guys were accused of presidents were rogue\nAnd I think that's the underlying issue for a lot of people that pay close attention to this case\nThe question is really what's the Saudi Government behind that behind nine eleven did they have knowledge did they not did they not share information what did they know when when did that knowing what do you think um [noise]\nYou're this go you know there there are there are a lot of different um comments on that I Am\nQuite sure that there are some members among the uh inner circles who had some knowledge of what was happening and the kinds of cells that we're sending abroad so I'm\nI'm you know I mean I I don't have any clear evidence but uh I'm deeply suspecting that in the inner circle had some knowledge and I was in the process of being plant you know maybe I wasn't in the room\nThe inner circle had some knowledge and I was in the process of being plant\nNow maybe I wasn't in the room but apparently when you guys spoke about this but apparently a there was a payment that was just a major payment yes just me and I'm sure you've mentioned that um the to the United states at the very time\nThat Mike Pompeo and I know that as we have been taught when they go low you don't go lower but I always want to put an adjective Pompeo's\nName and I think it's that's the wrong thing for us to be doing\nYeah I think the payment was a hundred million dollars is how do you just paid to the United states remains at\n... goes over there mhm Mazie optics optics yeah Mexican\nBorder says Ellen ... a good morning panel or the president is threatening to close the border with Mexico if they don't stop people from Honduras dry and end of the u._s. gonna do this he says he will use the U.S military on the border I object to this strongly I think we should have open borders with the world\nWithin reason but closing a border is a shocking an alarming step\nIn my opinion I Would appreciate your thoughts on his I'll go first um and that was cause I'm reading letters not allowed to do that but my first impression has he says with the uh uh Ellen says within reason\nNow if you if you wanna stop in migration quote within reason somehow and I'm not I'm from side on this I think what's been going on is disgraceful is you've got to have some way of stopping people right\nWithin reason yeah well I mean the point is if you want to stop the flow of refugees you might want to do something else besides just closing a border because that flow and you're going to change you might want to look at the root causes of what's going on and address some of those issues to policy initiatives\nI'm not entirely sure what it was I mean this I think she's responding to a series of tweets yeah morning I'm you know those tweets can be kind of hard to figure out what exactly he's trying to say I don't really know a closed the border means I mean if you're not\nTalking about ... trade I mean some of those things would be pretty devastating to the to the limited that's how I I don't really understand and what exactly closing the border\nMe and don't you think it could be a redirect like him you know he's always sending out at these tweets when he doesn't want to talk about one subject or another um and now you know and now he's refocusing in the country on that supposedly for coming north we're right on her door us I mean if so\nIf you truly close the border and we'd be short on fruits and vegetables all winter and [laughter] and people might be a little ...

good morning welcome to the roundtable into our a paddle this morning Alan charged jackets here are very curious Kelly Avon Chris Churchill\nSo the topic that we want to talk about this what has been around for a day or two but uh since we were\nFun driving I Want to get to it today and it's still very much in the news and that is Elizabeth Warren defending her decision to release or DNA test she defended the timing her decision to release the results just ahead of the mid term elections telling the globe\nOn Tuesday that she went public as soon as possible to begin deflecting the constant taunting from the president under Senate challengers I have an election Warren said during an hour long interview with the editorial board Donald Trump goes in front of crowds multiple times a week to attack me both of my opponents have made the same attack\nI get this analysis back and I made it public\nUh and then there are critics I'm On the on the left who say okay but why are you why are you still being to his level why are you playing the games and and it's very reminiscent of\nOf the birth or a and the birth certificates I'm with President Obama and Donald Trump or does it\nDoes it really I don't know I don't I don't know that I agree with that I mean President Obama was clearly an American citizen she I mean it was false claim she is not a Native American I mean it's a it's an accurate claim\nShe might be one sixty fourth Native American according to the test or you as low as one one thousand twenty four but that does not make you\nNative American you know I I you know I understand you're no you're absolutely right my my point being though that that is you get into these you get into these wars with him right he she told her and she basically took debate ... which is what he's very successful and I mean we we saw this with Marco Rubio a mean he\nHe he gives people these nicknames and it gets under their skin and they react in ways that basically does not do them any favors you know I\nI don't know why she released the test I can understand why she took it you know to see you know what but to release it I can to act as though it it clears her of of this accusation\nShe took it you know to see you know what but to release it to act as though it it clears her of of\nThis accusation that's been around against her since I guess since her last a social six years so it's been around since she was going on I don't know\nOkay soon Scott Brown but yeah but it's been around for a long time and it just doesn't clear here at all actually adds fuel to the fire\nI I agree with you but let's assume for a second grade you got a bunch of people sitting around and her campaign staff and\nWhat are they saying okay you want to run for president we got one thing I think that he's using against us so we got to clear that up\n... alone right yeah the new guy right now a Washington\nWhere longtime Washington where the president calls a very fine man highly respected by a lot of people which I think it's pretty much what he says about everybody\nWhat I call it choose your dogs no [laughter] I Know a huge line before the noise meant is I Love the guy right\nIt's not what I call it choose your doors no [laughter] I Know a huge amount of people you know what it's meant is I Love the guy right and that would mean anything either\nHe has the best words they're just lives as often as I said okay let's go to the weather's okay but a lot okay\nYour panel how disappointed the Warren rolled out or DNA test results without any prior consultation with the Native American ruling councils that failure produced a backlash to Turner announcement of Native American ancestry into an embarrassment\nThat will probably short circuit her twenty twenty presidential run what a shame above from Albany but you know what Bob that's interesting and the New York times of course you'll read it this morning a very interesting article in which they said the

I did it myself for Thirteen Years amazing I was trying to monopolize it I didn't want anyone else to have a chance\nBut when I left a an actor named Ben Jeffrey took over the role at is still doing the role although he has as I did he has had to take off some time for injuries because it's a grueling part and I think he's also been allowed to take some time off to do other projects which they were good enough to let me do as well\nUm and another actor named Ben limits I Believe is maybe doing the road right now and they're they're all terrific\nIs it the the costume that makes a grueling\nThe ... weighs almost fifty pounds that's a lot of weight to carry around and singing and dancing run there's a lot of running there's a lot of crouching or if there's a lot of jumping yes and not only hard on the legs but\nTo manipulate the pop and you have to use your arms so I tore the labor I'm In my shoulder and I understand that\nYes and not only hard on the legs but to manipulate the pop of you have to use your arms so I tore the labor I'm In my shoulder and I understand that a ban has also injured his shoulder and his knees as I did so the ... takes a toll\nIt is it seems so that it is worth it you don't have you're not mad about it it was worth it to be to be ...\nOf course I as I say I'm I traded my cartilage for my daughter's college educated [laughter]\nI I never really expect to stay that long in the beginning of I don't think Julie ever thought it would run as long as it did and I don't think Disney expected me to stay for Thirteen Years but by the time I was pried out of that ... like a like a clam from a clam shells or I was amazed to realize how much time it passed\nIt always feels a little bit strange for for me to ask people like let's keep reflecting on your career do your own your own eulogy mutt [laughter] you're alive I'm Sorry that was more of it but um what have been some of your other favorite ... it's\nInteresting that a lot of the things that I've enjoyed the most have not been the Broadway shows that I've done um and if not necessarily been the musicals that I've done I I I'm I'm a a Juilliard kid and I trained to do classical theatre\nAnd I have to say I still have a real soft spot for plays\nParticularly Shakespeare particularly new work so some of my best experiences have been things like playing bottom in mid summer down at the Shakespeare Theatre in Washington a couple of years ago I'm sure you were marvelous thank you it was so much fun\nI also was lucky enough to do um the world premiere of a play by Sam Hunter called the whale out the Denver center in which I played Charlie a a a six hundred pound man who's eating himself to death and that was a wonderful experience [noise]\nUm I did a show that was on Broadway called is he dead directed by Michael Blake more that was the only play I've written by Mark Twain and that was a wonderful fires\n'em so yeah my best experiences have tended to be to be plays and and Shakespeare not that I don't love the musicals and my God that's been the ... the meat of my career and allowed me to raise a family\nBut I've just been very lucky of for the whole thirty forty however many years I've been chipping away at this and you've worked very hard well thank you [laughter]\nI I Do I Do pride myself on working hard I Can't control much else but I Do try and put it in the effort\nHow have audience has been reacting to head over heels audiences have been loving it they\nThey first of all enjoy the the humor and and the songs are so they're they're ... I'm the laughter and the I have to say the screaming that comes from the audience all through the show it just never stops which is great as a performer\nAnd watch almost more wonderful then that is when you go out to stage door and there are people waiting\n... I was fortunate that that the the story just went deeper and deeper much more complex and layer multi layered than I ever could have imagined when I started this study nine years ago\nRehman arsenals the author of Arthur Ashe a life\nYou are talking about there's Ninety five boxes of material in the Arthur Ashe papers at the ... Center for black culture at the New York public library and they give you a look into the entire career not just the tennis but into the civil rights activism as well\nUh they do they're pretty heavily weighted to the um the final decades of his life so there's not a great deal about his or his early life and uh but yes it's a you know he was a very public figure and uh\nHis agent Donald Dell or no it was a sort of kept tabs on him and then they were they had clipping services and he had a very wide correspondence and so you really get a sense of the the measure of the of the man of the\nThe extraordinary um diversity of his his his interests and I mean he\n... it's hard to imagine another athletes who could have done more in in forty nine years than than ash you know he he collected first additions\nAnd he was compulsive about doing the New York times crossword puzzle every day you can be sure he was the only one in\nThe in the I think in the locker room doing that [laughter] in on the other tennis store\nAnd he he just had this intellectual curiosity and you see that throughout the papers and throughout his life I I had some of his daily logbooks and I found it almost impossible to believe that he could be so many places\nIn any given week and he'd be at any given day really you know he'd be in Miami in the morning and Los Angeles in the afternoon and somehow next day he'd be a am seeing a benefit dinner in New York and he'd be doing workshops with inner city kids and\nTestifying before the United nations that just went on day one\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Tom ... what's the warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com\nBe able to say no to anyone who knew who needed his help\nA star athlete of course and as you mentioned you spend a good deal of time in this book looking at his civil rights activism why do you think that that that part of his wife that part of his um his very public life has been largely ignored\n[noise] well I'm not sure it's been ignored but it's certainly been downplayed and done not fully understood I think there are a couple of reasons one was that he he was such an independent thinker\n[noise] he didn't fit any category I he he for example he he he was not very positive about black power and yet he understood the black power advocates and was willing to uh you know give them cut them some slack so to speak but he thought they were they were you know go says centrally going in the wrong direction\nAnd yet he he he he applauded anyone who would fight for fundamental change within American society relative to race and class and gender\nBut he he never raised his voice you know we never lost his cool uh he was very deliberately avoided emotional is um [noise]\nAnd I think he's so he's he's stood out and uh you know he he didn't he didn't have a booming voice so to speak I mean he found his voice in Ninety sixty eight and turn towards activism and never never never never looked back but he did a lot of it behind the scenes\nYou know he was really a ... he was almost without ego in some respects a a he was all about the uh the ideas about the policies about kind of pragmatic change and\n[noise] I mean he was in some ways he was a radical but I sort of Martin Luther king style radical in the sense that the ... you can almost missed the radicalism until you get to see the the the enormity of the of the commitment and uh [noise] uh how the perseverance of his his work and so many in so many areas but he's often contrast it with my what Ali\nWho actually with ... became a friend of his and\nThey're still different Ali was out there\nYou know kind of over the top and and uh ash was such a paragon of civility and yet in their own way that they were both transformative figures and made tremendous contributions I think to the\nSort of the cultural side of of the the civil rights struggle the struggle for [noise] you know kind of Africa Africa will be some times called the African American freedom struggle the these days\nYou can say this about many people but one of the recurring themes of your book is that in the people that you talk to you and your interviews with people who knew the man the the fact to just knowing him they feel made them better people\nThat's right ah I Can't tell you how many people said that to me\nAnd I don't think there was any conspiracy I don't think they really got together and say they were going to tell me this but an interview after interview they said he was the finest person that they met in their lifetime that he changed them that they only wish they could have been more like him\nA there was one figure who uh send an email just a couple of weeks ago I actually I didn't interview him during the book or a Jim Jim Parker who played with him in St Louis during his senior year of high school when he left Richmond because he he couldn't play against whites there\nJim Parker said he as as a teenager he had such dignity I don't know if I've ever heard of a teenager described in those terms that someone you know sixteen Seventeen years old who had had dignity that they that their integrity what sort of locked into this strong sense of self and ah [noise] ah\nSeventeen years old who had had dignity that the that their integrity what sort of locked into this\nStrong sense of self and a a kind of a deep ... a richness of character and and and personality um and I ... I kept hearing that over and over again um sometimes through tears\nYou know they would just expressed is to me I'm a breakdown at some point in the interview and ...\nAnd apologized to me and say I just always happens to be when I think about Arthur because I miss him so much he was like no other person that I met in my lifetime\nI so I began to think that he's here with somebody really special and not just in the world of sports but one of the truly great Americans of the twentieth century\nIs that a dignified error consistent with your research and how he was brought up man and his trial\nBut I think initially it was imposed a quite a bit by his father who was a strict disciplinarian actually in the early years or if there was a bit scared of his father his mother died when he was six and so father soon large for possibilities for raising him and his younger brother Johnny\n... but then of course when he has to be had to play tennis um he had other coaches are Dr Robert Johnson and others who\n... incorporated this ah control that uh he he he couldn't afford to act out he could have a if a ball was near the line hit by his opponent he always had to call it in that he didn't want they didn't want to racial incident they didn't want him to ruin the chances for those who would\nFollow him so in some ways it was almost like a branch Rickey and as advice of Jackie Robinson and I knew forty six and two forty seven\nUh as you know when it broke the color line in major league baseball that uh he couldn't strike back a and certainly that was true of Arthur I think that was his probably that natural predilection anyway [noise] um but uh it was\nReinforced at I think again and again in his early life and he um he was quite candid about it later and some of his writings about how how much strain that put on him and\nAs he said he wanted he wished so much that he could be John McEnroe for twenty four hours at Wimbledon throwing his racket swearing up to the free he's complaining hum he knew we could never do it but the ... in some ways Mac and it was a kind of alter ego for him and that's I think why they became so close\nOr at the end of his that ten year as a captain of the David cups theme when macro was his his star but Macron was acting out and being sort of a super brat and\nActually had a difficulty in control again but he understood mcenroe is passion is just that Arthur had to keep his passion inside and I think that took its toll on him\nLet us talk about the athletic side of his life in in in general what made him so good wouldn't made him excel on the tennis court\nWell I think as a tennis player he had a he developed a powerful serves perhaps the best serve in tennis in the late sixties and early seventies um which was a strange strange because he was only six foot one a hundred and fifty five pounds and he had been a baseline or early in his life\nHe never rush than it never served in Bali never had much of a serve until he developed at in St Louis and later at UCLA\nAnd sometimes out of the lives of a bunch of good solid who kept telling them hit it harder hit it harder [noise]\nAh and ah he had a tremendous a top spin back end and and he was a very smart player although some people felt that he was he was but Collins called him a thinking man's Dennis Blair and sometimes that got in the way you know he he had he he wasn't as natural in his approach\nAnd sometimes that got in the way you know he he uh he he wasn't as natural in his approach he was he was a great risk taker er which some in some ways belied his image of being so cool and calm and the paragon of civility but he\nLoved to take risks on the court he probably would've won a number of tournaments additional tournaments if he had not been a risk taker he is always looking for the perfect back and and\nHe would sometimes sacrifice the score for just the joy of the game of hitting the the amazing drop shot or the amazing back and volley and uh and I think that made him\nThe most exciting player in tennis in his in his years he wasn't exciting and the way that mcenroe or Jimmy Connors we're in terms of their you know outsized personalities but he I mean in terms of the game it was a it was it was one of the most exciting many of those sports writers made that commentary that uh", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The

encouraging quote all sides to come together in peace and harmony\nBefore taking aim at the news media the media also has a responsibility he said to set a civil tone and stop the endless hostility and concert negative and oftentimes false attacks\nThat is where we are who would like to begin now in oh\nOkay I'm you know here's the deal this is a president\nOr who has in fact from the very beginning um said things like one leading a protest or out of the out of his meeting them pay him up I'm beat him up that's physical violence or folks and it sets a tone from the president of the United states\nLook we don't know who is done as it may be somebody who is unstable or and is just a it's just been doing it but the tone has taken me a been a set by the president of the United

that can be but I'm I'm willing to say that we don't know yet but it's a terrible thing and we have moved to a place and I hope the president accountable for it [noise]\nWell there are many things we don't know I figure it's presumed that it is a disaffected Republican who has been motivated by the\nPresident's ah overheated language what do you say disaffected meaning somebody who writes the Democrats and that seems to be a an obvious possibility of perhaps a less obvious possibility ... to foreign actor um who is trying to sow discord and have a lot of people in this country at each other's throats [noise]\nUm so but but I I'm I'm confident that I'm confident that the FBI we'll we'll get to the bottom of it uh I I think to reiterate part of what out and said I'm the president is failing miserably if he is attempting to bring this country together\nHis language is his has been has been a division from the beginning and at a time like this when there are people who are scared or with justification about what they may find in their mailboxes\nThis guy is not stepping up and he is not trying to bring the money for him to get up at the White House yesterday\nAnd make some comment about now's the time to unify\nThe country it's almost laughable because we know he's reading it off of a script\nBut in fairness we would have toward them apart if he didn't\nSay yeah well he said he has been saying but much less than he should have a clip of it but I'm Sorry and I know we have a lot of other panelists\nBut it is interesting that he gets up because we have to unify we have to obey together but let's face it it's the press that needs to their some of the responsibility here which is a theme that he has been saying for the very beginning and that is really\nSo in my in my view I I've I've come to the conclusion that uh it is entirely\nRidiculous to expect this president sound presidential he once in a while had some aid that gets salmon says you know you need to really sound a little bit differently today but really our standards have become so low um it is truly appalling where we are today\nUm I I find myself in the classroom a lot just discussing where we're at and people's fears about where\nYou know whether this country is headed with the extreme polarization and President Trump skill unfortunately is to pursue polarization and whatever language she uses for just a few sentences related to coming together and unifying as a nation\nIs just unbelievable who were not representative of anything he stands for your what are the students saying\nWell the students are saying this is really worried sometimes it's not something that we want to see in our future we want to have discussions we want to have debates we want to talk about issues and all it is it's about scare mongering and they're not embracing in the vast majority this kind of\nA level of conversation and they're often feeling left out and not listen to\nI think there's something about when you when you say the words that the president said both yesterday and ah yesterday during the day and then last night at the rally there's something about it that rings hollow when about halfway\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com no ... no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand

wide wrestling a\n... a federally federation which are office manager right you know that he everybody thinks it's all in good fun we're just at that this is real ... a lot of people could have been hurt or maintenance may yet to be hurt\nType patents people handle those type fans I mean this is\nThis is this is not fun this is\nUm is is that you know just for the sport of of uh of it and it's been very very distressing\nAnd if they go off or don't go off their inside inducing and terrorizing it's a crime I reject that kind of use of violence either emotional or physical it's unacceptable and we really need to address those kinds of\nResponses on the political level ... yeah I agree that the specially with that last point that um\nYou know whether you know where the bombs go off or whether they don't I mean the the the damage in the harm is you know the fear and you know as much as anything obviously but you know you know thankfully no one was physically hurt but I I I agree with you that the\n... the damage done by that kind of fear is is is is just as bad in some ways maybe more pervasive\nUm then maybe all more and competing um I Do think that um you know part of the problem is you know kind of the discussion you know that that we've heard here today which is you know everybody in the first sentence says yeah it's really bad and then everybody in the second sentence says\nAnd it's this guy's fault you know and I'm sure if we're on the right wing station there but he would say no it's a left wing fault 'em then I think that um I'd like to I'd like to see um yeah I agree I'd like to see the president's they stay more on message of what his original statement was whether you think it came from him or not\nUm yeah I'd like to see everybody do that and that just say you know I'd like to divorce this event\nFrom whatever the underlying issues are and it just says you know what no matter what it is you know it's unacceptable um and that period and then when you're talking points and two of us will point to him but he was on\nThe harder to do when the individuals who were targeted were the very individuals who were targeted during the rally is with the president\nI I think it's hard to do I think we've demonstrated it's hard to do the answer is yes and then I but I think it's hard to it's hard to divorce you know the emotions are from you know the passionate we feel about the issues I think that\nLook at it in in a more perfect world everybody with one voice would say\nI don't care who's doing it I don't care why they're doing it you know it's unacceptable\nIt's on ... and you know it it it it's unacceptable whether it's coming from the right or the left or foreign actor every memories with that yeah except it's distressing though how quickly people's people say that and then they move on and on top\nOf that it's a hot is the person who holds the highest office in the land if\nTrump cannot set the tone for shift and following up with action namely he had opportunities to highlight things and policies that actually um led to collaboration\nRegarding the opium a issue he had the opportunity to highlight something where people came together instead he does not pursued that so rich so rich\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com no joke no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both

obviously he's he's he's a different kind of president and obviously he's he's he's you know he says things that are abortion rude and and and on presidential\nUm but I ... for you to say that as the same thing you know we said about about the last president but I'm at you\nSo you think that this equivalency between this president and Obama yeah I think reasonable bomber who never raised his voice who never I'm never ... said to somebody we take this guy out and beat him up\nI think both of them recognized and then exploited divisions in American society\nCan you imagine the very favorable response than most in this country would provide if there was a a a gathering in the White House today and Trump walked into the East Room followed by Clinton\nSome people are better than rating of ... and others I mean but okay go ahead\nI've always thought that should actually be illegal I've always thought that if you're either going to be in office or run for office the one rule we should have is you have to write your\n... and you make a good point if you have to do it probably doesn't just be done and I I I get a great point if you have to do it for the Mars you should have to do it as president of the left side\nOf the United states does have a few duties and writing speeches takes a long\nTime now I live in the middle of your mind I don't\nKnow the response to that is and his or her most important duty is communicating with the American people there there's nothing more important in a president ... can be doing then writing the remarks that are either going to go to the American people or to Congress or to people overseas I think that's the most important and you\nCan have ideas I mean I wouldn't have had Sorenson if you wrote profiles in courage for um the JFK and he said I Can't answer that question and by saying I can answer that question he was answering the question if you think\nOf things that's more like ... ... one of the reasons for its popularity with his base is because they know their he's really talking to them and it's not candor there and if I go to yeah but I I just think that should be I think that'd be cool war\nYeah and just say one of the

on the police question I mean this country has the violence that show I'm just pointing that out and if you're African American and look from that perspective um you worry about your young people and your son's in particular so I Would say this was a major issue to be addressed and to be\nA responded to in especially when it comes to stand your ground laws\nYou know and I I agree it it's

know the question about the situation of women it's not been discussed for hundreds of years and then suddenly emerge as a I Would establish that parallel how about the fact that people that have not

point not to put words in his mouth because you know I never could do that [noise] um but but I but I think Richard's point here is that the messaging becomes very different depending on who the president of the United states if you\nAre no doubt about it but the difference between Trump and Obama among many differences is the big language that Trump uses\nThe I'll call street language that is just so on presidential I mean the ... one could argue that Obama was very provocative and a number of different ways but but Trump or rather Obama\nWas his his speeches were thoughtful sometimes Tour de but certainly articulate a I don't I don't know that you can describe those use those words to describe what Trump\nIs and you know the other point I Want to make President Obama was certainly know deep left wing ideological person because he even changed its own opinion on gay and lesbian\nRight and they were the right we probably argue with you about that but I but I don't I don't object to a president who who changes his views on line he's evolved if makes the presidential believed to be thoughtful we can't I don't think those words can be applied to Trump\nI I think it's ... I think that I agree with you that ... one of the problems I think that we all have to get an even those people like I like me who support the president is\nThat now he's not he's not presidential and and and and really any sense that that we've ever been used to I I think they show some leadership qualities that that our presidential but I agree it look\nWe've said this all the time\nIf some to me if somebody had Trump's ideas but could couched them the way Obama you know who looked and sounded and had the presence of Obama but had the kind of ideas that we can get behind that would be the perfect person that's why I watch the west wing on that point because that's the that's the president I Want\nYeah Mike says where is the Democratic or Republican leadership why is that no one's standing up loudly incorrectly blaming this president is in ... for creating this environment of eight\nThis is directly Trump's fault [noise] pardon me\nHe feeds off and said he loves distraction he loves fear\nIs quote rallies are nothing more than a breeding ground for hate\nAmericans want some one to stand up and directly asked Trump to be leader and president and that's Mike from Saratoga Springs but Mike I I have to say I saw Joe Biden attempting to do that or just yesterday the day before\nUm and doing it I thought rather effectively standing up before his own crowd and and and and listing the number of transgressions of the kind you said\nA from I'm here [noise]\nSo anyway I wanted to read but go ahead\nOf the prior readers mentioned Silvio Berlusconi and he may be\nYear so anyway I wanted to read but go ahead\nOne of the prior readers mentioned Silvio Berlusconi and he may be perhaps the best person to compare President Trump to because Silvio Berlusconi use is very similar similar populist techniques and we should also watch the presidential elections in Brazil\nIs that's particularly individual will be elected we will have a new level of horrific populism in one in the largest and most powerful economy in Latin America so this is a pattern that we ... we ...\nWe may see it in Brazil we certainly see it from President everyone in Turkey and this is just not a direction they would uh be beneficial to any democratic development rich\nIn the world know ours because uh I I I don't disagree with with with with a lot of that I you know what you know I understand what's going to get Trump's share the same hair products\nAnd apparently the same place now we have to go to I Want to be done to George ... fans as well to tell John who wrote in that I lowered my chair [laughter] uh uh we\nWe we go to Richard ... by by what seizure lowers your eye on the largest year alright where's their break we'll be back and we'll continue representatives\nSupport comes from Saratoga hospital introducing Saratoga OBGYN that Myrtle street and affiliate of Saratoga hospital formally Myrtle street obstetrics and gynecology Saratoga OBGYN daughter worked for information Fulton County tourism and the southern Adirondacks park\nForty four lakes forty four choices camping fishing hiking and more fall events throughout October calendar at forty four legs dot com Norman Rockwell's museum Stockbridge presenting the final days of keepers of the flame parish Wyatt and rock well on view through October twenty eighth an R.

I think if if if our CD was here um I I he'd probably say at least part of this is some of his geo political\nUm at some ... aside from the tower some of it is the towers and I just remember I said okay I got you you have to assume that I'd I'd a significant part of it is the increase in interest rates right which as interest rates go up people move money out of the market\nIs so you know I I you know but part of the problem you know when presidents do this when Trump does this do you live by the Dow you die by the Dow right and and I will also say you know even as a conservative and as somebody who you know who in my business we watched the market\nYou know the market in some ways I I think it's a surrogate for kind of public opinion I I I really do I I think that um it's not exact\nAnd and it's not immediate but uh it if the market stayed down for ... you know between now and the midterms I I don't know that that that would not that got hurt Trump that's got to hurt the Republicans\nYeah I'd you know whether it stays that way I\nI don't know yeah what do you think about that at the housing market is one of the major concerns obviously right I mean the numbers have gone down a little bit and that industries but equally concerned right\nAnd and again I I'm not the expert found were here I think he probably feel honor bound to say that's also part of the increase in interest rates right so it interest rates go up mortgage rates go up it it it it it's more expensive to buy a house uh and and and so yeah and then you also\nSo as interest rates go up mortgage rates go up it it it it it's more expensive to buy a house uh and and and so yeah and you've also probably say the same thing about the housing market\nAs you say about the stock market that it has been a little overheated right and and there's time for it to cool off um but yeah I think that the extent this we've learned a lot about the market is that you know one day one week doesn't determine a trend right so ...\nWell can I ask rich 'cause he's still identifies himself as a Trump supporter and the conservative and independent we well I mean I don't ever justice started out when we hear so many of the Trump supporters wanted to go with Trump because he was going to shake it up in Washington he was going to knock down all the walls\nBecause they among other things didn't like it didn't trust government\nAnd and what doesn't add up for me is how the frequency with which he lives demonstrably not just political allies but factual lives that can be easily disapproved why has that not shaken the the base who didn't want their government lying to them I mean this guy is\nSupport for streaming WAMC comes from the Davis financial group providing fee based financial planning and wealth management services to individuals families and business owners and the pioneer valley and beyond Davis financial G. R. P. dot com\nIs we actually fee of that I'll I'll speak on [laughter] you're right and I we you know that I I feel that um I I feel he is you know you say he lives all the time I feel like he is the most transparent\nI'd like I feel like I Know more about what he's thinking than I've ever known about what any president had thought I feel like I get more of his on what's the word unvarnished yes unvarnished unfiltered but there's another thing\nOh I think it's it's a good thing that I'm getting it now I might I don't agree with it all I don't I don't like it all but I I mean ... to ... to me that that that's an amazing thing I'm\nYeah what about the line who what what about lying\nI you know I Will take I I'd like to start I'm willing to start with the raw material\nAnd sift my way through it myself\nAnd determine what I think is a lie what I think is his you know pa furry ah you know what I think it's just his very elliptical way of talking which you know those of us who you know used to follow him on CNBC we're used to that I'd rather I'd I'd rather make that filtering decision myself\nThan having to go through like we were talking before you know six levels of speech writers at a teleprompter and then and then spinners after that\nYou know I mean could cause Trump is kind of an spin a ball you know I mean you know Sarah Sanders can do what she wants but I I Would so the answer is yes\nSome some of those things are are incorrect some of them may maybe outright lies I don't know I what I like is the transparency the lack of filter and the idea that I'm being given the opportunity quote make those decisions on my own\nQuote he says what he thinks but of course if you look back on the great desk but in history they said what they thought also so how does that justify bin Laden that I could\nHave ... now and I ... a lot of the a lot of them\nAs um give me some specific examples listen I'm\nWhen we talked about when we talked about health health care for a long time\nLet's fix health care let's fix health care and then all of a sudden after somebody was elected than it was ... ... let's fix health care insurance it turns from health care to health care insurance\nI Know that that was that was a that was a big change for a lot of us a and a and that was something I feel that wasn't terribly transparent or the during the campaign though that um that you know the thing about Trump is\nYou know I I Know you guys just like him and and and for a lot of good reasons but you can't say you're terribly surprised uh-huh that's right from the from the primary the general full now\nBut I mean I'm Sorry and this was more surface you question and I apologize for it but I'm just curious\nBecause I'm I'm I'm interesting when you say of of the did you see 'em on varnish but do you feel that he has a a grass and a and a full command of the of the issues that are on his plate slash the national agenda\nAll right let me give you the flip answer but there's a little bit to an end and one of the answers is\nHow much do you need okay what's your average is like oh how can you say that\nReally how these issues we kinda all know ... there's only two ways to stand on a lot of these issues right you see the big government of small government as well either more entitlements are less than ... them it does either\nIt's either we're doing the right thing in the inner cities or we're doing the wrong thing so I Do I think he has enough of a grass to deal with those issues yeah I Do also\nWhen you when you can hear the case that and it doesn't seem like Kim\nOh I see I think he does show I think I've\nTo deal with those issues you know I Do also\nWhen you're when you can hear the case that and it doesn't seem to\nOh I see I think he does Joe I think I feel I Know exactly where he stands on things\nSo it's a great does splits in history so I Want to go back to that for a moment you knew where they stood you know what they were saying juice should be killed or something and I should be happening and what wouldn't be voted out he could be voted out well that's\nWhy he's also there's lots of it a lot of things he's tried to do that he couldn't do cause according well here's here's one\nThing I wanted to say on the domestic in the domestic arena you can make the argument that you don't have to know the specificity to the extent that you know you you make the argument large small government\nThat is entirely inadequate for the international arena when you look at Yemen Saudi Arabia Brexit and so on and and that there you really know I Know the complexity of issues and he's entirely inadequate\nAnd I think his greatest triumph have been on on the foreign policy had her head and I don't mean to you I had no no he's not lying about the fact that they're that ISIS has a lot less power that it had before he's not lying to me about the fact that he's very supportive of Israel he's not wanting to me about the fact that he didn't like the Iran deal\nAnd he wanted to get out of it and he did\nHe's not lying to me about the fact that he opposes Islamic fundamentalism for whatever that means I now you may disagree can very clear\nNo he is not because he doesn't understand that Islamic fundamentalism it's sponsored by the ... hobbies in Saudi Arabia and he is Trent action oh entirely in his interactions with Saudi Arabia and we have been bombing\nIn assistance with the Saudis the many and that is where you will get a lot of the Islamic fundamentalists\nAnd he has also not understood what is happening with Iraq and Iran\nAnd the gains that Iran is currently making in Iraq so he's bungled the entire Middle East policy and he for your mostly say that it's okay to know who your enemies are based on whether they're Islamic off a certain kind or something else then you are entirely\nUnder miss understanding how foreign policy ... work plus I think\nI think anybody who who sees the situation he was given an in Syria that I think it was a bungled situation way before he got there I think anybody who sees the Iran deal which was a bungled deal well before he got there I Would say that ah that\nHe he he's been he's been dealing with the hand that he's been dealt with I think he understands enough to be able to advance our interests which I don't think had been advance I don't blame them in our interest\nIn the middle east have been advance at all I agree with you that Middle East policy in this country has been bungled for decades\nAnd in that sense I think we would agree that both um you know starting with the uh GW Bush presidencies hinge Obama into Trump it's been bungled\nBut do not misread the middle east policy is having approved at all in the middle of a shocking statement from somebody who clearly does not understand what is happening in the middle east\nI think I think that that America is a safer place than it was a ... when faced with Middle Eastern threats\nOh well I'm Glad you're believing that\nWell the underlying it to me the under ... there have been presidents with whom I disagree that maybe if you're trying to get us all 'cause you know I just want jobs I read it all up or go ahead get used to make a case on a policy issue domestically or foreign\nUm I Want to be confident that at least I'm hearing him telling me the truth about I commend done it's up to me to make a decision whether I agree with them or disagree room I don't believe a word of the man to the demands as I've said\nI'm hearing him telling me the truth about I commend then it's up to me to make a decision whether I agree with them or disagree room I don't believe a word of the man the man says I've said that on this program I think before he was elected but um so I think most out front on that but you know I I listen to him ah I don't remember what it was about the other day\nAnd it was not even a ... a major topic\nBut I remember thinking to myself I don't know that I Believe what he's saying and how can you how can the country go through wondering if the president is lying to them and you you don't think he's telling the truth on for example his position on immigration I don't know I might be a while I don't think I I don't think he's telling the truth when he says\nOther Middle Eastern terrorists in the middle of this caravan and then finally you know I don't have any proof I mean he's for days and you and Fox and friends are saying\nThey're these terrorists are from the middle east and Mexico in the middle of the Caribbean when an send me a lot of people believe it now is it true\nI perhaps but he doesn't know that\nBut I don't think that's the main thrust I write I don't think that's the main thrust of his argument I think the main thrust of his argument or something and you might call superficial but the idea that you know it starts with borders it starts with protection of the borders and and I don't I\nWould have held now does that hold me the truth on which the fact that you're making your decisions or ... or ... or accurate\nBut it does not start with borders let me point out the fact\nThat we have enormous numbers of people purchasing drugs that are coming up from Central America in addition to you know of course China attending a you know ... you know through the mail but Central American drugs\nAnd South American Central American drugs coming through Mexico in the United into the United states we have lots of customers for that\nAnd then we do Mexico the favor of returning the weapons that they that drug cartels can purchase in the country and ... and and and people bringing them back into Mexico we create a lot of violence ourselves in Mexico\nYou know some of these things I was thinking about your dad the other day I have created an ... of Pete Seeger station\nAnd they're always playing Woody Guthrie they're playing Woody Guthrie and they're playing you of course and then they're playing Dylan and feeling of course like Pete is an ally of woody but they took different past and they beat in Dillon we're not exactly the same\nNo you know Pete remained somebody who was fundamentally a public person\nHe liked people he liked being around new idea he liked going places and discovering new songs and new faces and then when it's not that way you know he's a private person he doesn't probably enjoy the publicity of being himself\nAnd I don't think Pete paid attention to his own publicity so much but he wasn't afraid to use it when it came in handy\nBut you know it's so new on top of our low and he said something and I said well you know for God's sakes you Pete Seeger and he said that's the problem is the Pete Seeger thing it's that Pete Seeger if this was\n... we all have this I mean I was writing about it yesterday when somebody gets on the stage and becomes an entertainer [noise]\nIt doesn't matter if your dog died the girl left or what the problem was\nYou got to get out there and be entertaining\nThat means that you create a stage persona that in any other endeavor would be considered a psychological disorder multiple personality or something like that you have to have to you guys at work and you're talking on the air it doesn't matter what happened at home you got to come in and do your thing\nAs an entertainer that become second nature and there are ... episodes with Pete that are always described to me and to others in the inner family up his\nWife Toshi led to put up with the stuff yeah it's the spouses who have to put up with these multiple personality people you don't know who you're talking to I mean you look at the guys playing the banjo is that the Pete I married or set the Pete that's on stage you know saving the world it becomes a problem\nYou know they consider our producer and I showed up but the thing to do an interview with a one time and it tells you turn around and said something like I'm not talking to beat right now he did a very very bad thing [laughter]\nAnd I haven't figured out what it was I didn't dare ask [laughter] you know believe it but she always talked about having a suitcase always ready by the J inspired my wife who says the same thing to ask you and she had a suitcase backed by the door just in case you know yeah that's really amazing because guys like us\nTo try and those people crazy I mean my own kids I remember you know when I first took them out on the road with me and they were very young and you know they'd be fighting backstage or you know arguing about who's crown it was something like that and they'd come out on stage and they have these ... faces and after the show\nThey'd be fighting backstage or you know arguing about who's crown it was something like that and they'd come out on stage and they have these ... faces\nAnd after the show I read um the riot act I said look I don't care what your story as backstage you want to fight and argue and jump around and do all that at some point soon as you can out there it's a different thing you gotta learn to be a performer if you're going to step out on the stage and ever since then they did it\nOkay what made me cry anytime we played it a thousand times you know Pete in golden river and you know and you're wonderful Sara Lee singing that song which is how old Fifteen Years old yeah she was fourteen worth seeing what\nA song that was and it's still one of the best things that I ever was I heard people play it and then you know I think is ... and Sara Lee was better I mean she had that quality to her that was so extraordinary\nShe is really fun and she's been you know with me on the road off and on for over Twenty years it's hard to believe that having that she started when she was fourteen and we took her to I think it was one of these big venue sort of like tangle with but it was in Virginia it was called wolf trap\nAnd we put her on the stage and said okay saying you know golden river that make people happy\nAnd she looked at me she was terrified\nBut she did it and afterwards he gave a big hug and which is ... was not his style no he was not warm that way you know but he couldn't resist and she's been doing it ever since we just did it it was part of our tour on the last tour we were on we did it for over a year and a half every night\nAnd you bring the same guys with you for years and then you try something else and then you go back to some of the same guys I say with Shenandoah night that was the original bad right\nYeah well originally when I first started out I was working with a good friend of mine John pillow who was on guitar and a guy named Bob ark and who was a brother to\nAlan Alan Arkin right and I played bass for me for years and a wonderful percussionist named Paul Modi an or Paul motion more recently and this was before folk music it wasn't identified we were playing jazz is what we were really that's what they're for days where a lot of people\nDo recognize that you were a pre Yemen and guitar and wonderful musician and people think well you know earlier we got that guitar no you should really good\nI appreciate it you know what I realized about\nI don't know five ten years ago that you have this feeling I mean I worked for over forty years climbing a hill as it were\nAnd that got to the top and I stayed there for very long time and then one day about five years ago I thought OK this ain't the top of the hill anymore I'm going down the other side\nAnd there's this sort of graceful decline that Pete expressed in his concerts he wasn't able to play like he had when he was he couldn't sing like you did when he was young but he did it anyway and it was good enough it was not only good enough it was even more inspirational\nFit was and he did this concept for us just before he died for WAMC and\nHe sang a you know I looked over Jordan and what did I see I don't think there was a dry that house rent but although I've seen so many times and you haven't lost a thing now let's spend a few minutes on this new book of yours how riches\nAre low Guthrie analysis restaurant the illustrated story what can it\nOkay back in Nineteen sixty nine the movie out this restaurant came out you know get on by Arthur Penn wonderful director who happen to live in Stockbridge yesterday and he loved the song that he heard on the record that came out in Nineteen sixty seven and he wanted to turn into a movie\nStockbridge and he loved the song that he heard on the record that came out in Nineteen sixty seven and he wanted to turn into a movie the problem was that the song I only takes twenty minutes to go and the strongest mostly true a movie takes an hour and a\nThat means somebody had to make up an hour and ten minutes [laughter]\nIn order to make the movie\nAnd that's what they did so typical on Hollywood took a bunch of characters informed them into one and the issues that I had was we were using my real name ... I was Arnold Guthrie in the film I wasn't playing a part\nAlice ... was played by Pat Quinn yes but she was using ... actual name\nAnd so people who see the movie right are assuming that what they used to eat is true because part of it was true the part that they based on the song was true and so this little book is a celebration of fifty years since the movie and it leaves out the hour in ten minutes of fiction\nAnd illustrator in black and white to tell the tale that was on the record but as it was depicted in the movie if that's not too complex\nNon room we've interviewed Arthur before he passed about this a fabulous story and it's not the only thing that's fabulous it's the fabulous our logo three there's nobody like I'm going\nTo be right here in Albany or the egg on October twenty six in the ... the state theater on October twenty seven on November sixteenth are low and Sara Lee planes into the hall in Hartford, Connecticut\nAnd back in ... on November Seventeen at the ... hey we performing arts center no matter what he says he's the best the best and let me tell you we're all in love with them in all very very grateful that you're still doing what you're doing or or you just keep\nA man [laughter]\nAre will Guthrie's speaking with WAMC is Alan ... talk you're listening to the roundtable on WAMC\nSupport comes from Woodstock guard exchange hand to blow glass and sculpture curated fine art exhibits from artist then makers throughout New York state and beyond route twenty eight west of Kingston\nFacebook or Woodstock art exchange dot com lumber yard Center for film and performing arts Catskill presenting interactive electronics artist Andrew Schneider nervous system in residence before it's opening up bam November third and fourth lumber yard dot org\nSouth ... spirit shop south that group ...

I Try I Try to bring life to what the playwright is put on the page to try to find what that playwrights intent is\nAnd what has the playwright put on the page for you and the ... what are you learning as he play this character\nOr you know something I've always known as a playwright I guess and he's done it very well characters had are conflicted characters that change their minds characters that have conflicted views things that they're sitting on the fence about or that they haven't made up their mind about or\nThat character's get new information in the course of events of the play that changes their mind about themselves and that's what's wonderful about plays in that I think what we do I say this all the time I Do believe what we do can heal this you know what I mean I Know that his therapeutic value for people who write\nYou know to to purge and and and the and I think it can have the same kind of effect if is honest if it's clear\nAnd if it's truthful which is I think true of this play it is clear it is truthfully dishonest and and I think people will recognize themselves and I think some people will get some new information and people don't change until they
