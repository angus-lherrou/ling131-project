I think that's that's the science fiction association of what\nCRISPR could allow [noise]\nWe have long lists of gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise]\nBut we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong bones or leaner muscles\nOr lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart disease\nAnd as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have a technology that could in theory\nYou allow an individual to upgrade their gee you know\nBut why would that be the ... version if it seems like that that technology is a promising like if there was a way to make a child more resilient a painter or give us a higher I kid you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere's a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent\nOf all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have essentially masks theirselves and HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nYou might assume of course they would want that but it's still\nA game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just selected traits do inherit from the parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would never have gotten from their parents\nIf it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhanced men or that disease prevention is you know many people see\nThey divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of two different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think there are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes easier five\nThat's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage and I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what you might call normal human species functioning but\nI mean I mean a part of me wonders\nShould we be giving that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of has sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up and saying that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel [laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a uh\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nHow secret as the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone\nOf course but we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years that we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individual children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think you have this very radio issue of directing future evolution\n\nYou know even saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to a point where you could use it ... embryos to install things like each of the immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher out you\nWere being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off [noise]\n[noise]

where we are this is Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind and human nature\n[noise] so what what is it that makes us who we are\nWell there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain a\nFabricated over millions of years by natural selection that equipped says with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack hair so to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just fed and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out so Steven can you can you help us with us [laughter] okay I'll do my best\n[noise] [noise] okay just to get us started human beings have debated nature versus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors\nAre either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slates\nAnd that all of a structure comes from socialization culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker unattached age back in two thousand and two in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century [noise] and then that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that\nManhattan though nature from the historian or ... you got the man has no instinct and the anthropologist asked we want to give the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non from\nHochul a scientist Stephen J go without ... why should have been such an appealing notion well there are

inequality\nAnother political fear of human nature at that time\nIf we were blank slate we can perfect mankind the angel dream of the perfect and then with the of our species through social engineering whereas if we're born with certainly interesting and perhaps some of them like damage to selfishness prejudice and violent [noise]\nFirst of all there are a number of reasons to go for the

New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time and\nI didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable with me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian that I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I'm move on and a strong funny relate of away people are able to move on\nWith me [noise] yeah because I think for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's a comfortable like we're not used to that do you think so because I mean\nDisability has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy on characters on television a disability made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing and someone with a disability\nWho's proud yeah I'm ashamed and talking about it in a way that they've never heard before but we have been mocked because like even someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever being mocked her bullet\nWe have been ... because like even someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever being mocked her bully when I became a performer

dangle a dollar bill in\nFront of me I have we have [noise] my inner river was very strong and\n[laughter]\nBy the first day of kindergarten I was walking like a champion had been punched one too many times [noise]\nSo so when you were a kid I mean first of all you describe like but up until the age of five you you weren't able to walk right I was able to walk at five I had to be able to walk in order to be mainstream did to public school\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try\nWhat did you realize that you were funny [laughter] so my dream in life was to be on General Hospital I didn't know that it was funny I went to college for drama and then I came back\nTo New York city started auditioning realize no one was hiring me and I had a conversation with an amazing acting coach and she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg\nAnd when I saw what would we go over that and thought like how she use comedy I was like wait a minute when I look at my TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard prior\nYou know Ellen Rosie O'Donnell those were the people who were not typically beautiful possibly had disability you know how different races like Margaret Cho and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an other and still get on TV\nAnd so I signed up for comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out I'm his Dara [laughter]\nYou know it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons right or their challenges their humor right in\nAnd do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or for Arabs and Muslims as well\nI've never tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own story and just by telling my own story I was controversial I was telling people things they didn't know and then started post nine eleven in New York City\nMy friend and I found that the New York are American comedy festival to counter the

humor and how it helps us deal with the chaos of life\nSo we're just hearing from comedian again for sun and she had a group of Muslim comedians traveled around the country doing what they call social justice comedy\nAnd they're trying to open up the conversation about Islamophobia which at times required a little patience\n[laughter] yeah I\nI think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes\nBut when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract more be without any I mean it's a cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is a is a joint on shared experience\nLike a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away [noise]\nSo that trip took was the other comedians they turned it into a movie\nCalled the Muslims are coming and not too long after he came out something happened back in New York a place where again usually felt welcomed and accepted\nAnd hate group spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the MTA that's the New York city subway system was yours truly offensive not to mention poorly design I mean if you're going to be negative you might as well use a better fine but\nHad a one not macho own poster campaign right that does not think about Muslim So my fellow comedians you know be doll I decided to launch the fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign\nWe raised money weren't an ca for over five months that was approved in into we're supposed to go up\nA the NCAA decided to ban the poster citing political content once\nThey got a couple of those posters here is one that Muslim Muslims [noise] let's see what they have great for a recipe\nFor us are considered political by the MTA\nOr the mention of Muslims in a positive light what's considered political but it is it it's about justice so we\nHave to change our fighting bigotry would delightful to try to the fighting bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign [noise]\nBasically what I'm saying I have a couple of dirt comedian took on a major in New York City agency and the comedians want\nAgency and the comedians want\n[noise]\nVery feeling I was like as a blonde or feel like oh let's\nMy work is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we then hate mail sometimes I get voice mail saying that if I continued telling my jokes or they'll kill me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny but\nJust changing all danger I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons [noise]\n\nShe took a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment in the film or I think you're Birmingham, Alabama and a and it will like it was pretty successful yeah so I mean you know one of our stopped with in Birmingham, Alabama where we like set up a table called made that religion\nWe're going to read a quote and you're going to tell us if it was all tests\nNew Testament or the Koran\nDoes your guest right you got whatever like ridiculous pride is like an outdated calendar salivating already and we lose our salt and pepper shakers are also like chocolate and stuff like that which totally stipulate for the girl who does not lead on her wedding night should be stoned to death of Iran\nAs a pariah it is the\nMan [noise]\nPeople guessed wrong on because they just assumed everything that was the violence um came from the Koran Mary said\nLord how can I have a son when no men has touched me\nAnd it'll be just we're trying to make the point that all of these tax have released not done them so why would we hold Islam to a temperate standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth was\nYeah yeah people were really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh\nYou know a lot of difference with three of them do you never know [noise] and credible that I mean that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states and blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that\nAmerican people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off you are a coffee and they wanna open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found than I've said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get love and return and that's what I found as a Muslim doing very publicly Muslim thing ... performing on stages throughout the country\nThat's what I found all the way I like to look at it as you\nYou get one person to laugh and a couple of people laugh and then over a lifetime you might get like a million people ... and those chuckled add up to some measure of of a popular um shift in perception\nAnd that is social change but it takes time and it takes like millions of these chuckle [noise]\nComedian again first uh she's the author of how to make white people laugh\nAnd also to talk of the nation you can find her full talk that dot com [noise]\nSure it's very painfully funny ideas about how humor can telescope with things that on their face\nAren't very funny\nOn the show today painfully funny ideas about how humor can be a couple of things that on their face\nAren't very funny as this is this is Lisa\nThis is Kevin real as the guest said the writer and they stand up comedian\nLouis Missouri [noise]\nThat makes sense but\nShe's ... she's ready though [noise]\nOf houses of it was marvelous [noise]\nSo obviously being funny is like Kevin does for a living\nBut being funny\nIs also a way he deals with like humor I think is either kind of like an invitation or\nA shield but you can use humor to keep people on the outside of your life and that's what I did as a as a young person\nWhen I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on and so my defense mechanism was humor\nBut I also think that humor can be the invitation into ideas and thoughts\nAnd stories that might otherwise be too uncomfortable on heavy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative within them for Kevin humor was a way to deal with his depression\nBut at least in the beginning it was more of a shield than an invitation\nWhen I was Thirteen Years old my best friend at the time and in Jordan McGregor passed away in a car accident and\nIt was an experience that really radically changed my life and when he died it just ripped everything out of me and felt like I was shattered and just a million different pieces I mean it's like kind of grief that\nTo this day I kind of really struggled to put accurate words and language around it because it was just so overwhelming but that was my first experience with this really

before the break we were hearing from architect the ... party in Michigan says designed could be part of the solution but it's largely depends on how we use technology\n[noise] technology was a big part of the problem and the twentieth century ... when we invented the automobile what happened\nIs the world's all bent towards the invention and we recreated our landscape around in the twenty first century [noise] technology can be part of the solution is it bends\nTo the needs of the world and so what do I mean by that take the tournaments vehicle I don't think the economists vehicle is exciting because it's a driverless car\nI think what's exciting about the economists vehicle is the promise that we have these small urban vehicles that could safely comb angle with pedestrians and bicycle\nThat would enable us to design to main street the gang streets without curves maybe streets like the wouldn't walkways on fire island [noise]\nOr maybe we could design streets with the cobblestone of the twenty first century something that captures kinetic energy melts snow helps you with your fitness when you walk\nOr remember those big ladder fire trucks what if we can replace them and all the asphalt that comes with them\nWith drones and robots that to the rescue people from burning buildings and if you think that's outlandish you'd be amazed to know how much of that technology is already being used today in rescue activity\nBut now it like you to really imagine with me [noise]\nImagine if we can design the hover craft wheelchair [noise]\nWrite an invention that would not only allow equal access [noise]\nWhat would enable us to build\nThe Italian hill town of the twenty first century [noise]\nI think you'd be amazed to know that it's just a few of these

like with the help of technology or or whatever I mean there will still be\nSome level of inhumanity in them right in the right not is it possible to have no social scored at all\nKnow part of why I gave the talk I gave a tad was being cognizant of the fact that there are a lot of technology in the room a technologist can be wonderful people but they can also\nStreaming support for WAMC comes

invent stuff\nThat helps us bill more humane cities right firefighting drones and the and the you know different kind of a wheelchair and so forth so we can look at all those codes and standards that we have to build with\nAnd change them so we can maybe have a kind of back to the future moment and think about what was great about cities before the twentieth century they could maybe inhabit our cities and the twenty first and twenty second century because technology is allowed us to change those standards [noise] um\nBut that's not the goal the goal is the standards of changing so we can design this infrastructure so we create some more social friction cities\nAt their best our engines social friction so if you look at the Arab Spring\nAnd you saw what was happening interior square we saw what it was happening in Tunisia it's because cities tend to be the platform\nFor social change in nation and social friction requires a kind of lay in my book I call it an infrastructure of

people on the street you start having conversations you'll do deep dives in your community and you you start becoming keenly aware that as much as you think you understand you just have\nWalked a mile no shoes during Richard's time as mayor Albuquerque saw spike in its homeless population and lots more people panhandling and the streets and so it Richard Want it to come up with a more humane approach for how to deal with it\nSo I saw a gentleman on July fifteenth twenty Fifteen I Believe was the day I was on my way back to city hall from lunch meeting and he was holding a sign that said he wants a job\nAnd listen I'm a student and I'm not a genius but I went back to my staff and I said listen I saw gentleman holding a sign that said he wants a job why don't we do something different why don't we make government less complicated rather than more complicated why don't we take this man at his word\nAnd I grew up in ... in Nebraska around a rural environment I knew there was dignity and work I saw people putting my grandparents and my parents work hard and there's just something about having a reason to get up in the morning and accomplish something that's been engrained in me since I was a child\nAnd so we just wanted to take that and present an opportunity\nTo worry about what happened in my city when we decided to think differently about panhandling and lift people up to the dignity of work\nThere's more from Richard bury on the stage\nWe call if there's a better way because\nI Believe there's a better way to get the money than panhandling on the corner I Believe there is a better\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nDollars out the car window\nWe know there's dignity and work we also know that people are much more likely to invest in themselves if they believe that there are community is willing to invest in them first\nAnd because we're all wired to be kind and compassionate it always feels good to have a couple of dollars to someone that is neat\nBut if you talk to panhandlers many of them will tell you that your few dollars don't necessarily go towards feeding the body that go towards feeding addiction\nIs the Albuquerque the beautiful place or a mile high Sandia Mountains on the east the Rio Grande runs through the center of our city but there's always something to do always read the whole litter the pickup\nSo if you're going to have an initiative like this in your city have to ask us all to questions first one is is there anything left to do in your city\nThen if the answer is no would you please give me your mayors phone number because I Need some advice\nBut the second question you have to ask is this are you are solutions to panhandling working if you're taking a punitive approach I'm going to suggest there solutions aren't working and I know you're not getting to the root of the problem in your city so if you have something to\nDo you need people that need something to do the good news is is not that complicated [noise]\nSilk so would you do we took an old van from our

these at my dog hunt S. dot com\nAnd it is [laughter] that says food writer Mark Bittman truth in advertising and marketing describing how over the past fifty years corn and soy and wheat have become staples of the western diet\nOne thing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell and easy to process\nAnd the government through direct and indirect subsidies encouraged the growth of what we now call mama cropping which means really really big field to hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time\nPlanted in one crop an endless rows that are all cultivated an harvested mechanically um but if you look in the late Nineteen thoroughly twenty century of it what was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest or second biggest producer of tomatoes that was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown in our you know it was just in Iowa and again you can't believe that drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now do you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nSo we got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many Sawyer corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the troops there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups\nBecause all of them can be bought and any store not that they were any good but they were there most bombs cook like mine a piece of royal made a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or\nThe stupidest food ever minute rice\nFor dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either\nSome of us reading on good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma if not actually killed\nBy the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat\nAnd spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually\nMade this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were surfing at home\nAt the same time masses if women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden so now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave nights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself nights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way me junk food cheese the very stuff that will kill you\n... and ... like what you're saying earlier a lot of it\nStraightening support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no joke no poll Doug harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog hunt S. dot com\nThink about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want a mango you're going to be able to get a mango if you want it to NATO you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word or I'm and I'm Talking about more root vegetables in winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you eat everything but you you were a guy that a lot of people look to and say okay well you you've written all these books you or a food to eat like I think of my statement and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat\nWell I Do think you know I did this book called the ... going before six or a few years ago and um basically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinner time and then do whatever\nBut I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know of the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because that are broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can as you can eat\nThat's it yeah\nWithin those rules do eat what you like to eat and you're going to have a good diet\n[noise]\nOverconsumption of animals and of course junk food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now there is no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that class and I want to make this clear it's not the ingredients and plants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the carrots\nThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming of this point you eat more class you eat less other stuff you live longer not bad\nBut back to animals on junk food we don't need either of them for health votes have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demand were not foreign craving whoppers or Skittles\nWe have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone that's the hard part but by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy the simple formula eat food eat real food\nWe can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals were reduced not only calories for our carbon footprint we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so\nYou [noise]\nWriter Mark Bittman you can see his entire talk at ... dot com um well I Know you have to leave marks thank you thank you for doing

pastas gonna kill ya\n\nOkay so am I saying that like forty percent of stuff in grocery stores isn't real food but but if you had to estimate what what percentage of the stuff in grocery stores has added sugar\nI don't have to estimate Seventy four percent whacked Seventy four percent of all of the food in the store\nHas been spiked with added sugar in some fashion [noise] is it [noise] hidden

doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal and one of those situations [noise]\n\nWhat exactly defines a perfect meal\nI'm especially a different for each and every one of us I mean it can be able to make very very simple it can be a fishing trips by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere\nThese almost taking people's minds as as best meals but ... would I guess has to be there is um [noise] the mood you're in on the people you're with so because of social aspects of dining\nUh I Know one of the perfect meal when the fighting with up hot in the say\nPart of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seem to stick with doesn't resonate in then you can never quite capture when you get back home is as your moods you pretty relaxed your holiday less stressed Tripoli with your family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it something sort of truly memorable\nYou think about like um how many times have you met her friend is just come back from a holiday and they say oh you've got to try this amazing red wine that I Try and reach and then you try it and you are sort of thinking\nThat phenomenon has a name that we've all learned versions which I'm from the province all rose a paradox so used to describe a northern Europeans um but to kill the guy for that so holidays to the Mediterranean\nOr missing some well or on the side of the sea suffering that arose they wind blew looking into that love his eyes [noise]\n... you can hear the sounds of the sea smells the Soviets all laugh and not pay slightly basket while you've ever had\nSo great that you want to buy a boat or a case and bring it back to share with your friends and choke could taste you have in that you bring it back\nAnd then you're disappointed and your friends are like this is really cheap\nBirthday yeah as you say well how is it something about when the buttons were in the Arab play with a cold and I you know sport the wind things not about a tool and we never eat or drink no we're always somewhere in a certain environments in certain states would\nMind on all mental state and the environment both together that kind of impacts what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy its missile in a way to\nMiss attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation\nAnd put some of that pleasure into what we think about the food\n[noise] in fact just Charles these ideas about how we experience food have actually convinced some chefs to try out certain methods of flavor enhancement and these are methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients\nIn a good mood food tastes good if you're in a bad mood I never tastes good is this illusion about flavor we think we're tasting the wind the glass but I'll break has taught me everything else the thousands of single the smell of assaulting the at the wall of the song box all of that is play against their beer and\nOn

wow so it's like from from a neurological perspective do we fully understand what happening like why that's the case [noise]\nUh no so we didn't know that it does happen but it is the case\nIt's all of a classic example of just how important the environment is what we taste I work with a young chef which is if you have here in London and he's been I'm sending our question as several weeks have to be living his restaurant\nI'd say what'd you remember yeah he said well ... flavor was a soup and people are convinced they can remember in ... when you check was actually on the menu that kind of constructing something they remember the experience but I felt about it and the brain kind of fills in the rest of the details of what they think they thought they reaching\nOur most chefs that you talked to are they on board with with your ideas do they think yeah it is it is about the experiences right or they or did they say that this is totally absurd all about the food and the taste the food\nUh of course there are still some chefs who say no no it is just what I was taught in color and re school days justice all sing the preparation\nBut nothing else but he says their case so I'm In a restaurant um do you serve the food we near plastic cutlery nah that's a silver and what does your restaurant exactly oh it's in the country manor house looking at that nature\nSo the the saying all these things on the one hand but clearly you can never sort of ... who just by itself it's always on something in a certain environment\nAnd those kind of contextual factors are always that it cannot
