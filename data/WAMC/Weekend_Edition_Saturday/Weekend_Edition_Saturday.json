interested in whether football players took her new you're not during the plane or the anthem\nWell at first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at we're sowing discord this\nIssue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive\nAs it gets but it's not just people that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain\nWhat did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency well\nWhat we found was these tweets head be gone all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the

calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that break down wonder how that influenced the conversation\n... short if it wasn't director of the TV and a certain result just to to stir things up apparently yeah\nAnd the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraud contentious issue\nAnd also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they showed some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to try to attract the debate\nI gather a lot of these accounts have been closed right\nYeah so the accounts from this study have been closed but you know what we see with these it sometimes seems to be a game whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up\nAnd one of the interesting notes that the closing professors had was that these are closed but they're monitoring new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations and they're continuing to weigh in on controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charge moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue

by in the world series\nJoining us now to talk about some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael friends who teaches political science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political ad these days that's not negative it might just watching the wrong spaces\n[laughter] well it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast dads which pit\nThe policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those together you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition yeah\nUh have you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found that the percentage of ads on TV that are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous midtown\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no choke ... dog harness invented to make it easier for both dogs and humans no need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nThousands of reviews at my dog Curtis dot com\nNegativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ads on line\n[noise] yes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tend to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content online\nThere's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter so just the season on through [laughter]\nUh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as a centrally being connected to terrorist organizations\nAnd that kind of explicit attack\nIs not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people and in question should be raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric in public discourse these days do you draw any link between the tone shipped by some of these ads and fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nWell yeah this is a tough one to decipher because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is at an all time high\nPolitical advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say that it's a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television have to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes and so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle but you are also speaking to a middle the set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic in those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael friends are voting college who is co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure and weekend edition Sunday Lulu looks at our political rhetoric and language may affect us and how we speak to each other you can listen to that story tomorrow

Mueller was the star uh he threw seven innings he was given the ball and asked to basically save\nThe Dodgers season because if the Dodgers had gone down three oh no team it's ever come back in the

we're waiting for the Senate to vote but Brett Kavanaugh looks to be headed to the U.S Supreme Court\nJudging from official announcements and from a procedural vote yesterday Senate Republicans have

generations could\nOh yes we assume the current lineup of five justices who were appointed by three Republican presidents do named Bush and now to by Donald Trump will be around for some time\nAnd this will be the first time that the court has five members were alumni of the federalist society who it's been which has been a growing force on the court for years and a swelling presence on the federal bench at a lower level and with the Trump Administration and White House counsel Don McGahn or they have truly come into their own\n... what do we need to know about the federalist society especially as they are going to be um more prominent than ever and us life\nOr the group got started at a couple of law schools in the early Nineteen eighties it was a pushback by students and Google's legal scholars\nAre people who are convinced that the court had become too liberal to inclined to read the constitution to accommodate the outlook and philosophy of a few justices with big

basis for those decisions was in the constitution or whether it was being supplied by somebody's interpretation of the constitution and let's underscore there's nothing remotely secretive about this

we welcome and she joined just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian blushing forward now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] um what was that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes\nDon't think so I think well I mean yes and now right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nOr perhaps not as often as we'd like um I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with as it doesn't look to possible that they should confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote\nYou know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the sins of the investigation do its job [noise] I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal and people say it wasn't a I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true and they had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative by not providing she had basically two pieces of crowds I wasn't aware of that because she was in well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she had told and sort of two thousand Seventeen to those and they tend to should\nPeople they're basically issues of cooperation were her therapists notes which would seem to say look she talked about this all they're not we have another name and two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took but she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee\n'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear but the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her you know and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen foot\n... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's ... Christian bushy Ford a sincere\nA book that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support right a judge\nNo the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time it is an inherently difficult crime because you know ... some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated\nTo consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated altered have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible um and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in this neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks it's not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\n[noise] um but also you know as Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved from people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth\nUm it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it it's way worse than what ...\nMaking the cardinals thanks so much thank you [noise] ...

don't think that's a news though I think the nuts and bolts that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump\nUsed a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent\nTo protect the family's vast wealth for about a billion dollars or so in in wealth\nTo keep it in the family to keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump tasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid\nInheritance and gift taxes or in other words the Trump probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred and instead they they paid around fifty million or so\n... when when Donald Trump has said over the years I've built with I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people and uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that\nThe times really flashed that out with a lot of new numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really laid pretty bare and that story so that's another\nImportant theme of the story which is the president is set on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] is there anything that you that you can recognize and that may be people going over the

received by new colleagues well I think they'll\nAll suck it up hill suck it up they'll suck it up\nAnd they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do what the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan we're prince and on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial being neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment than we left that\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term sometimes it can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether the employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex covers gay and lesbian employees\nJust as Kevin out of places Justice Anthony Kennedy who had been the court swing vote when Kennedy announced his retirement June you called at the end of the world as we know it uh so what does the court's new world look like I'm closely\nContested cases you will see a court that is more conservative than we've seen in this country probably four Seventy years or so\nAnd that has consequences way beyond abortion and gay rights

is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning highly though [noise]\nAh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims\nWell let me know that eleven people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told none of them were children um and also that six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as the day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals and memorial services I Will be hearing more about those in the days to come as well\nYeah this alleged shooter has been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime well\nIt is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue or the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media\nAnd he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened well authorities\nSay the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was a as a religious service was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\n[noise] put this into context for us so there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern\nRight I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog hardest dot com or no choked no poll dog hornets invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans no

conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all\nThis mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America\nAt a rate unprecedented in decades\nYeah and we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this ... and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning right um\nI went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the at the edge of the synagogue up to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun laying flowers memorials I'm just at the edge of the there's sort of a shrub a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner\nAnd and it's just you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and uh people are\nGrappling as they as they do and and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were vigil last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding yeah but I think mentioned\nThere will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a that's of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opens its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like that happen so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and and so that's just one small thing the community is doing to try to help families a Jewish and otherwise ah throughout this community in Pittsburgh a pope with what's happened here\nThe tragedy that happened again and again around the country um has happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it\nYeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n\n\nYeah incredibly moving and somber\nUm what has been the response from elected officials so far\nIt depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accepted violence as a normal part of American Life\nUm something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a remarking that\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog hardest dot com no choke no poll dog ... invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans no need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nThousands of reviews at my dog Curtis dot com\nThat I'm the president also suggested that perhaps bringing back the death penalty would help the tour such attacks\nWorth noting that the death penalty is still on the books and in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a a couple of decades since it was carried out I'm at the same time you know there are several other states where there have been mass shootings in recent years think of Texas that actively carry out that's at sentences but nonetheless the president is calling for that to be more of the conversation\nAnd obviously President Trump has a personal relationship with the Jewish faith or his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime\nRight and and he you know he and the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a ... and said that this is he said essentially that this was a you know sick thing to do [noise] um so he's he's certainly called it out I'm\nA ... of course the you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that\nWhen you walk around Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it or what are they saying about um why this might have happened [noise] well I think\nIt needs situation than it and I I've not been on the ground here in Pittsburgh too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now I'm three this is my third in just the past year or so\nUm people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there is is there the search for why after the the Las Vegas shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motor for crimes that they can prosecute and investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce that\nThere is also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community\nAnd in this case there are as we said indications that suggest that um the shooter had anti Semitic an anti immigrant uh motives\nThat tells us something about why this might have happened again that's still under investigation but um it is being investigated as a as a hate crime and that may be something we know more about a as a press conference get started pretty soon here in Pittsburgh\nWe are waiting I'm we're watching screens here waiting for a authorities in Pittsburgh to to address the public address the media um and there are a lot of questions about about why this happens and also we'd like to know more about about the victims soon\nAnd we're going to bring in ... or Mara Liasson now to talk about a little bit more about the political landscape around this of course we are coming up to the terms um and a lot of people are looking at this and feeling very on edge wondering if this is really um you know connected to the elections Mara a good morning It's MORNING\nAnd ah they're they're doing a fantastic job ah with that I Can't say enough for the interagency

we've been having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity politics\nAnd when we talk about identity politics wheat and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by Nicole Anna Jones she covers rates for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voter or the teen of voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters but when we talk about white voters we rarely mention their race at all unless it's a story about race\nWe talk about them in terms of their varied interests and their very identities so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class voters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals are we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color are somehow the only ones who engaged in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so I have to eat it frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban ...\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog hornets dot com and no choke no pull dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans no need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nThousands of reviews at my dog harness dot com\nAnd not be but we're also decide accurately reporting the story Democrats don't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people [noise]\nWell I I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this leading up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because\nBy ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue or that issue and in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack\nAnd so by and instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why but our invoking it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this also I think speaks to\nThe very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you were a person of color we had legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago\nBut white voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows\nWhen we were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously the most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also the sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair\nAnd to me new Paul it's modern learning spaces like the new

trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow should the U.S response to let let me Ventura possibility cancelled that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a right for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council secondly to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to\nSuspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a better sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end\nThe indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have\nIf we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid an foreign society's\nWell yes the export of democracy to foreign countries to\nA point of a value and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept the Saudi explanation of how a journalist is killed and in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president of the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests\nAnd we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in in the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work together to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments of that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can\nFind ways to put pressure on the Saudis that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we've seen for ... weeks is unacceptable uber gold or thank you thank you\nSo during for profit isn't new you probably remember hatred mercenaries

with her toddler son Aden who was grunting from his perch on her back\nThat photo showed a good day for money but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old and ... the high school party\nA drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son metal and Lynch and Mir died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her\nSister Kato Neal wrote that obituary and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Burlington thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me first we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be an actress and starring Broadway musicals and she really had\nThe voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew in lived and then there was that a Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but\nWe had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did she tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no joke no poll Doug ... invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two

hope we were always full of hope for Maddie this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nDrove more than one program are gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of this in Europe which were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so

wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry out for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronouncing there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications to help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people in that part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that not even one phase of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about Matty with her son in her ... in a backpack on\nMatty didn't resemble that photo when she was in the throes of her use and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\n[noise] understand there's going to be a service for ... there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWell through song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a a video of Matty singing a Bonnie rate songs he's just sitting at the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no

seated with executives from a number of us arms makers who are selling those weapons to Saudi Arabia the president has made it clear this journalist was not a U.S citizen and that this is not the president's focus right now what is focused\nBut president made that clear this week by spelling out is gender like a shopping list he said this election this fall is about Kavanaugh's a caravan law
