I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing him back to our program when I heard about the massacre at the Senate\n... welcome back to a fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program when I heard about the massacre at the center God I thought about your book\n... black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father Don black is still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front he did not pull a trigger the synagogue and I'm trying to blame him for that but do you find Don black story relevant to the views that were expressed\nBy the shooter Robert Ballard\nI think you can draw a straight line from dawn views and ... work in this movement to the views expressed by the shooter am not straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooters body yet attached to a fourteen eighty eight am to white nationalist slogans fourteen refers to a fourteen word\nSort of statement of purpose that is central to what storm front does about securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children or you know in and saying things like I'm here because of a white genocide and I can't stand by and watch my people get\nGet murdered and as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language and the motivation that exist on storm front and that's the way that they speak about this a quote unquote race war that they believe is underway\nYeah the um ... Ballard had had said that um he believed the Jews were committing genocide against his people and genocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believe the Jews are committing genocide\nSort of radical idea of free speech above all else I'm so somebody like Alex Jones that conspiracy theorists who does not have a platform on Twitter and because Twitter doesn't doesn't allow for it uh he's he's one of the most popular people on gab Richard Spencer the white nationalist spends a lot of time there and\nThere is a very high representation of white nationalist racist ideas on gab you know and I think the danger of a place like gab um and also the danger of of other social media network is that\nIt allows for people who already have some of these ideas to sort of cultivate their own reality and\nThat was when he went on gab he saw the message is only the people that he followed which is essentially one long news feed of confirmation bias and\nThat those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and so then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and watch my people get slaughtered and that's because that's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\nTo have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting at synagogue\nI'm In ... is the site that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founders son\nSo so what are you reading on June front now\nThere are some really vile I'm sort of celebration of what happens ah there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero and racial or a A R A N and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm front um\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storm front over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that\nWell this probably isn't quite the way to go about it that he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself\nBut our our global with and that Jews who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect but every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so have you spoken with either done or guarantee black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um you know and and I think that he's\nHeartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels in small ways culpable and he wanders and you know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism\nPlays into you know incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating the phrase white genocide and to to popular I think that in the movement said to then have somebody go into a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio um for years and you're young wife is a I think it's it's haunting\nYou liked ... the author of the book rising Adam he treated about Jared black swimmer white nationalist whose father does\nIt's haunting you light sass lowest the author of the book rising out of hatred about Derek Black a former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white

is fresh air the social media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nGoing to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Derrick black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we mounting those views when he was twenty two\nHe helped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nBarracks father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm front\nDerek Black as the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli sass low who we heard from earlier in the show I interview with black also included ... the first question was addressed to Derrick black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning like people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to like it's not that we are better than but we're all better off being separated by by race\nIs like my dad popular everywhere in white nationalism in so that was his thing\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was for it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he found that storm front and called it a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that was\nNot about superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it that it's it's totally irrational I how exactly do you think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nFor a second I've always wanted to know\nThe early people who rebranded white supremacy to white nationalism whether they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable or whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationally\nThey really did believe they were not\nDoing bad things to other people that the uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and maybe unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better\nUm the the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not and gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and had made it much more difficult to speak about race when their job was just uh\nCountry and that that was not and gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race in their job was just to give people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confidante way\nInception was everybody is basically all white people are basically race if they're just afraid to express it let's give them a language in a safe space\nSo that they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insults were they ... a clinical word [noise] um\nRatio is racial out all over the years if you look at the language in terms of how\nMany people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively\nPursuing in and cause of separating or\nYou know races into into different homeland Sam\nWhite supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is so if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguish the movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures\nAre based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think it's still effective and useful for us as we talk about it\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick lack a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who has since renounced those views and Washington Post reporter Eliza ... who wrote a book about black called rising out of hatred we'll hear more after a break and Terry Gross innocence fresh air

would lead to white genocide that white people like these other guys coming and they're going to kill all of us that's really violent language it's not about you committing violence but it's about all the other people who aren't white committing violence committing murder committing genocide\nAgainst due so it's still the language and finds you just changed to the actors are\nAnd who the victims and ... and in the end of this was a long process but um immigration was just going to out number white people in all their countries and that that was a threat to all the normal why people who are listening to the radio show or posting in the comments section and that quite unlike\nWhat they were being told they were the aggressor that they were the people were making society worse\nIn back to being attacked ... it's not like all the immigrants are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know when the quote unquote pure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm Talking point about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme let it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kittens in the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against that every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire ideology and point to the ideology is built on a fallacy an and for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on what you mean you want to separate people have different races into different places like ... percent ...

that\nThere was a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public\nEr and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to are we going to do this or that and one of those with how are we going to define who is white because only a white person can be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to say the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white in and were something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to ... who is white\nWas that you had a generally be considered visually white by most people in America\nAnd you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to

so after you kind of out of yourself and after having befriended people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were very upset when they found that he really are um you had Jewish friends who reached out to you\nEven had a girlfriend who ... who didn't initially no was Jewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends said to you\nThat made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nBut I think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew about dinners took the strategy that I think it was very very smart of\n... are not talking to me about it ah I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up well every this other thing that we were possibly interested and did\nA and I think the Matthew said that the reason for that or was that\nIt would have been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about something anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or talk about his life and this is very human\nAnd he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd that effective I actually actually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know Jewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that the Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermined the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups that are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all of white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where either this is this is crazy when you to stop attacking Jewish people back off\nIn addition to being the story of decks transformation I mean I I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on this campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYou know profound change and they did that in a lot of different ways I mean there was a civil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of cast Derek out and made it clear to him\nHow how awful and how he'd for and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who ah who won one is trust built in a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like point by point went through and and\nAh and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited Derek over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build a relationship hoping that\nJust by spending more and more time with them he would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes to the people and to the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in of itself can be transformative\nAnd I think it's important to note\nTypes to the people and to the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in of itself can be transformative\nAnd I think it's important to note that that did not happen quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the beliefs of this ideology and the things that Derrick had set Matthew in ... in between these dinners\nWhich sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site and they would see the horrible things that you said about Jews and and ... yeah\nUh Jews warm their way into control over our society Jews Moscow all Jews Moscow and you're in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid and beliefs Jews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe\nThe Jews have propagated a scheme of

bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of the of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross that comedy just as men can and it really wasn't the point of it oh okay and none of\nNone of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak did into the film\nKind of late into the process and I think at first everyone Brits old data and thought we don't want to do this

play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like you have to look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movies saying like\nOh my God just look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the fact that like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and\nAnd how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that because the second half of my question [laughter] what's going to be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do grows out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality of by doing

stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um [noise]\nIt when you went into a regular comedy club or something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nHe's the one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go club to a club like are you actually the same guy [laughter] and it was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like your job off [laughter]\nAnd you're just like what like what does that ever worked for you has any woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my chop off [laughter] like it just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly each other now not just

this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane [noise]\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they've stopped talking what was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to Hitler God\nI don't think it was my favorite I think the more work the more I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who\nWho is in crazy about this guy has to take your shirt off and like and I would do vote for him and talk about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels bad like to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what first of all there's no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAt the actors if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like tapping as Washington Times oh my God so I\nThere's the light oh ... ever present or not to ever not be heated\nLight that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the white men I would've flashes climbs up yes and when that light flashes is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics and ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a oh my God it's a really big deal yeah\nAnd the ... other people's time you're stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they are going to get less but the first time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch might surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booth\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal um applause from the manager kind of ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great [laughter] so I kept talking and the light kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I\nI got off to finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes [noise]\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no joke no poll dog harness invented to make

you're one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act and material\nThat means something to you that you care about and

and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed\nYou know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read were kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant\nI was like I don't know how to play pleasant like what it who who cares there's nothing to think your teeth into it's like the perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I was just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't want to play it also thought all the people I Love and like are\nFilled with quirks and eccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even just like people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is\nAnd so often I I've I felt that everything I read for female character was really blend in and often a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like Carl\n[laughter] Sam feel I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and say the guy's name I'm like why doesn't she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why she\nAlways a bummer I just I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to play this 'cause I don't know why she's doing it\n[noise] I'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement\nWhich you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors\nTheir careers or at least temporarily ended because they were

meaningful\nFor you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more empowered in Hollywood now [noise] every little\nIn ... I Will take every centimeter forward it will take I think the more we talk about it and the fact that it is becoming less acceptable you know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be dismissed you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like me you know boys they're happy to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think it's so important for me to its its branching out to everyone and it's all women that need help that need money for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and\nI think the more we we linked up and in ... strength and numbers it can't be for the worse\nWhen Melissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on her show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you and your new role in Kenya\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no joke no poll Doug harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Albany", "day": "22", "locations": [["Manchester", 53.45, -2.23333], ["Vermont", 44.00034, -72.74983], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Philadelphia", 39.95233, -75.16379], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Afghanistan", 33.0, 66.0], ["Kandahar", 31.61332, 65.71013], ["Afghanistan", 33.0, 66.0], ["Kabul", 34.52813, 69.17233], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["the kingdom of Saudi Arabia", 33.3046, 50.91843], ["Saudi Arabia", 25.0, 45.0], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Livingston", -17.84194, 25.85425], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Literary", 18.39467, -67.11324], ["Iraq", 33.0, 44.0], ["Vermont", 44.00034, -72.74983], ["Oregon", 44.00013, -120.50139], ["Hollywood", 26.0112, -80.14949], ["Kenya", 1.0, 38.0]], "not_found": ["Netflix"], "ep_coords": ["Albany, NY", 42.65258, -73.75623], "in_country": ["Vermont", "Albany", "Albany", "Albany", "Philadelphia", "Washington", "U.S", "U.S", "Washington", "Washington", "New York", "Washington", "Albany", "Vermont", "Oregon", "Hollywood"], "out_country": ["Manchester", "Mexico", "Afghanistan", "Kandahar", "Afghanistan", "Kabul", "the kingdom of Saudi Arabia", "Saudi Arabia", "Livingston", "Israel", "Israel", "Israel", "Israel", "Israel", "Literary", "Iraq", "Kenya"], "in_state": ["Albany", "Albany", "Albany", "New York", "Albany"], "out_state": ["Manchester", "Vermont", "Philadelphia", "Washington", "U.S", "U.S", "Mexico", "Afghanistan", "Kandahar", "Afghanistan", "Kabul", "Washington", "Washington", "the kingdom of Saudi Arabia", "Saudi Arabia", "Washington", "Livingston", "Israel", "Israel", "Israel", "Israel", "Israel", "Literary", "Iraq", "Vermont", "Oregon", "Hollywood", "Kenya"]}, {"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WAMC", "content": "This is Northeast Public radio WAMC F.

Blacksburg who is also the show runner seasons five is now a net flicks Comedy Central is now showing the first season\nThe Syrian satirized in Hollywood and deals with issues like success and failure ego power addiction relationships and sexism\nSeason five is set in the era of the me too movement\nBow jak horsemen takes advantage of the kind of characters that you can pull off in an animated series it's a world that is a mix of people and talking animals with human characteristics bow jak is a horse who became famous as the star of the nineties sitcom horsing around\nBut when season one of bull jak horsemen begins bow jak is washed up his celebrity has faded and he spends a lot of time drinking feeling sorry for himself and watching old reruns of his sitcom horsing around admiring how great he was on the show back then\nLet's start with a clip from the very first episode of Bo jak horsemen when Bo jak as a guest on the Charlie Rose show [noise]\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Tom ... what's the warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com\nJob which young bachelor horses forced to reevaluate its priorities we agreed to raise three human children was initially dismissed by critics is wrong and sacrifice and not good\nBut the family comedy struggle corporate America went on the air for nine seasons star of horses around ... is our guest ... ...\nIt is good to be here Charlie\n[laughter] ... Blacksburg welcoming the fresh air time changes how we see things doesn't it [laughter]\nYou slit later when he did that Charlie Rose opening you probably had no idea that he would be excused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to a lot of his job [laughter]\nSo let's just start with the surprise of that for you did you think of that opening at the headline the women step forward\nIt really dates the show doesn't it have Charlie Rose be the the voice of sober reason that you know look at bow jak who is such a mess and all of the Rio and unprofessional and Charlie Rose or played in in this clip by patent Oswald is are are straight person in the scene\nAnd uh yeah when the allegations against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nIt is a very silly cartoon universe but it can also I think maybe because of that go to some very sincere dark a melancholy and even tragic places and that may be in a live action show some of the story beats would feel modeling or soccer in or you know a misery corny\nBut because it's animated and it's like a horse and its brightened colorful it just takes on a different feel and you can kind of sneak attack in the sadness and some funds surprising ways\nI liked it sneak attack into sadness and said in some fun ways [laughter] everyone was like that's the kind of sadness I like the fun of her [laughter] and and jackets\nAnd such despair afterwards and feels responsible he's driving any closes his eyes and nearly drives off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the wheel\nWell let's say it's a lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt at the plausible deniability like he's not actively killing himself but he's\nAllowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a port and but maybe minor distinction to us that he is so despondent despairing that he was willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself\nOne of the episodes that you have in the currency then didn't five which you wrote it I'm an unusual episode because it's one lung monologue bow jacks mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dimension and low tech does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her so he's at a podium at a Mike her coffins at the side\nAnd he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in his family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was mean to his mother and they were both mean to bow jak [noise]\nI I Want to play a brief part of his eulogy and this is well or not as low jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called horses around seriously though hold your applause\nWill held it was written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named Sarah limb\nAnd it was about these orphans in early on the network has no maybe don't mention they're orphans so much because audiences tend to fight orphans sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they could imagine their parents to be anything they wanted something to long for\nAny way we did this one season finale where Olivia's birth mother comes to town and she was a junkie but she's got her so cleaned up and she was being Olivia's life again it of course she's like a perfect grownup version of Libya and they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted anyway the horse to water be careful\nLobes of the way of letting you do but Olivia\nJust thinks the horses jealous when the mom says she's moved to California Olivia decides to go with her\nAnd the network really juiced because ... ...\nOf course is jealous when the mom says she's moved to California Olivia decides to go with her\nAnd the network really juiced the cliffhanger is Olivia gone for good\nReporters because it's a TV show should not gone for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and had to go back to rehab facility had hits like all the way home getting rides from Mr T. alpha ... stop of course that's what happened because what are you going to do just not have a ... on the show\nYou shouldn't have happy endings sitcoms not really because if everyone's happy the show would be over and above all else the show\nHas to keep going there's always more show and you can call horsing around dumb or bad or unrealistic but there is nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more show\nI guess until there is\nAn assay saying until there isn't he's looking at his mother's coughing you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broken your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that I'm so he he really had a bad relationship with her and when you said early in that clip\nThat um he ended our our fans because they could imagine their parents anyway they wanted to [noise] um what made you think about that\nWell you know I I I think a big part of this episode at a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ... and his relationship with his parents is about\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but it's gone now and will never hurt you again and\nEven in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself and I'm really interested in that idea and that that question of\nYou know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think what's really interesting for me is the tension between that and to easy forgiveness of public figures right and and I want to believe\nOn a personal level level that nobody is era deem Abul or so far gone that they can't find a way to be better and be forgiven\nAnd how does that track with me where I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've hurts so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption\nAnd I don't know how I reconcile those two ideas and and that tension for me\nHas been at least are really interesting to explore over the course of this last season but also the show in general\nSo in this era of the me too movement which sounds so many men have so much to apologize for [laughter]\nI'm One of the funny things that you've come up with for the series or you you and the writers is do we forgive you award you created a whole awards ceremony for people who need to apologize for saying would you describe the ... the lead for\nSure but we forgive you awards as presented on the show are awards that celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a we forgive you award from\nI think for time forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd it one of the sad to slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about how sad it is that our industry is so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men\nUh last summer we were talking about how sad it is that our industry is so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men who do awful things\nAnd they're able to kind of likes linked back into the limelight and we wanted to satirized at and then over the course of the last year it started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry\nAnd then just in the last month or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe more forgiving\nI don't know maybe this is sadly irrelevant a new um so I feel like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture news when in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening for\nYears and years what makes you think that people are being forgiving again well\nUh it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers\nAnd I I don't know if we have we forgotten his anti Semitic remarks is homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her\nIs use of of racial slurs in mystified me in this era that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable\nThat it still feels like we are not you know we see carry a stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation are there are reports that Garrison Keillor and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks I think that there is\nWork that those men can be doing to better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know we think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I find it tremendously upsetting\nAnd I guess since ... Blacksburg the creator and show runner of the Netflix animated series bull jak horsemen after a break he'll tell us why he had second thoughts about some of the jokes from season one\nAnd Marine Corps again will review a new collection of Eleanor Roosevelt advice columns and Terry Gross and fresh air [noise]\nThen you've our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Amazon Prime video with the Romanoff and new series from the creator of Mad Men starring John flattery Amanda piece all riser and Catherine hung a new episode every Friday on prime video [noise]\nAnd from Rhodes Scholar and not for profit offering learning adventures for adults and natural settings across the country learn more at our oh eighty scholar dot org slash retreats\n\n... would\n[noise] support for NPR comes from the station and from Sierra Nevada Brewing Company family owned operated and argued over since Nineteen eighty proud supporter of independence solved whether that's on mine over the air or in a bottle port Sierra Nevada dot com [noise]\nAnd from home advisor matching homeowners with home improvement professionals for variety of home projects from minor repairs to major remodeled homeowners can read reviews of local pros\nAnd book appointments online at home adviser dot com\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is Rafi out by Blacksburg and he's the executive producer creator and show runner\nOf the Netflix animated comedy tragedies here he's a bow jak horsemen which is now being shown on\nReruns on Comedy Central so watching that series especially like after the eulogy episode I would've thought that you were a bitter mental at a very troubled childhood\nReading about you a little bit my impression is that was not so your parents were involved with a Jewish culture your mother rented Jewish bookstore your father help Russian Jewish immigrants in the U. S. um tell us about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of a kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nSo my mother owned a a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob\nAnd it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto and the surrounding area and so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books\nAnd and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish state school um you know I\nAnd and and leaf through the books and and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish state school um you know I even after a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt\nA extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never once felt like a minority in the community that I was in\nUm she would always bring home stuff from the store often it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of men that were shipped 'em and we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah that's as happy Halloween because it's missing an and have the the misfit toys and\nUm it it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life\nUm and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWith the disconnect me between being told about anti Sam ... senators and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated times now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew\nAnd you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes um\nAnd it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country\nAnd they're they have a lot of power and there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage um and that's been very scary to me um but also scary\nHow little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening\nUm especially big some for someone who\nYou know as a Jew you hear the story of a Holocaust over and over and over growing up and the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing\nRight there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who are shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them in cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd you know if actually one of the Jews control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kinda feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nThey said it because it's the ... and like I think yeah and I and I would\nSay a couple of years it'll be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around then\nSo it was it difficult for you to concentrate long enough to to read books\nYes or sometimes you know I I could always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there was something that really interested in me I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in it\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave and you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took her pride or a pleasure in it or you know\nYou have and you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time\nThat I took a pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience and I love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't\nNobody was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize it inappropriate\nYou know like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants inappropriate inappropriate and and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy you're pushing the boundaries I did it because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified\nThat oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect to this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take\n'em you know or just a shouting out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's a ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I I have I Want to say the thing so I'm going to say it\nAnd I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference I mean you know the problem with ADHD and other a mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not\nOh you have this thing therefore you're this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this precisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have\nYou know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps and what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat what is TV like a safe space for you or you can like\nYourself on TV and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of what you were consuming than the actual world and the reason why I ask that\nIs that like that so many pop culture references and they'll jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them\nUm that made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nYeah well TV made sense to me and you know there is a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely\nWas a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate\nIf I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this scene that I was living in feel like the scenes that I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful is being a writer and having an outlet and now if I Am in a situation I think of the funny thing\nI can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto that don't have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think it was a funny situation you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or if someone came in here and did this\nI can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment I'll I'll get paid for by ...\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of Berkshire health systems providing orthopedic services in the Berkshires including ... robotic surgery sports medicine and anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero zero\nSeries now that Comedy Central there's rain yet starting with season one um what's that like for you because you\nIn retrospect like some of the jokes in season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter]\nCable\nYeah you know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks ha and making the right time for Comedy Central and you know we're obviously want them to keep their", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Albany", "day": "17", "locations": [["Middletown", 39.51506, -84.39828], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Philadelphia", 39.95233, -75.16379], ["Hollywood", 26.0112, -80.14949], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["Panama City", 8.9936, -79.51973], ["Kurt", 33.68106, 65.91136], ["Turkey", 39.0, 35.0], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["us", 45.99696, -118.49854], ["Brussels", 50.85045, 4.34878], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Saudi Arabia", 25.0, 45.0], ["US", 45.99696, -118.49854], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["China", 35.0, 105.0], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["China", 35.0, 105.0], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Beijing", 39.9075, 116.39723], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Brussels", 50.85045, 4.34878], ["Brussels", 50.85045, 4.34878], ["Brussels", 50.85045, 4.34878], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Hollywood", 26.0112, -80.14949], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Libya", 28.0, 17.0], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["the U.

successful presidential campaign were based on his image as a brilliant dealmaker and self made billionaire\nBut recent New York times reporting reveals a different narrative it's based on a trove of more than a hundred thousand pages of documents including confidential tax returns and financial records given to the times by a secret source\nThe documents reveal that by age three Trump was earning two hundred thousand dollars a year as measured in today's dollars from his father Fred Trump's real estate empire\nFred Trump made Donald Trump a millionaire by the time Donald was eight over the years Donald received today's equivalent of four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's business as\nMuch of his money was transferred from father to son with the help of schemes designed to avoid paying taxes some of which according to my guess or outright fraud\nDoes and crab and David Barstow or two of the reporters at the New York times who wrote a long investigative article about

a guy who had built and sold his first home before he reach the age of twenty by the time he was in his mid thirties he was building hundreds of\nHomes a year and by the time he was in his mid forties she was really one of the biggest developers actually in the country and what he specialized in\nWas building middle class housing um his homes which he built in his apartment buildings which he built

what's been written about before and we were all kind of accumulated into this um sort of settlement of 'em in this case it kind of mythology of a man who has at least in his\nTelling of his story the famous line of he's always said is that you started with a million dollar loan from his father\nHad to pay back with interest and then he parlay the million dollar loan into a ... billion dollar empire that remained for the most part the dominant narrative that she sold certainly you know to make himself a celebrity to gain a power and ultimately it's what he campaigned on very avoid\nTo win win the presidency and so this story really dissect about narrative think\nMore than anything else offers\nReaders now based on the actual facts um and based on actual documents an entirely new financial narrative the forty for president\nWell let me reintroduce you here if you're just joining us my guess which Suzanne ... and David ... of the New York times who wrote or a remarkable investigative\nPiece on a President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans you got from his father the tax evasion schemes the family had and that was published a couple of weeks ago you

of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how as a self\nMade millionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred tromp Donald's father funnel to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about\nI'm Fred Trump made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that he got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlay that antennas into his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws\nAh we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans not one million I'm In today's dollars quits two hundred and forty million dollars in loans um which is on top of that\nIn um in today's dollars of quakes two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct wealth that we saw\nTransferred to Don and what we what we also saw about ... what is important also is that in many cases um these were loans that were never repaid him and he would take out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to that and he's barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to to Fred Trump to get more money and we saw especially that the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream it went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then being off to the races [noise]\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nYeah he used the money for\nMany of his adventures he how Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support his ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars um in debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars\nUm he was in debt to his father was going to his father these very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and end up in debt in a lot of instances instead of making a fortune ...\nIt also see that when he fell and then when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety net was there to catch them\nThere's one spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is a time\nAnd the you know the background of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of his company has their either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casino that they're facing a debt payment\nAnd Fred Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing a bad it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money history and a half million dollars worth of it was not a chat room and a half million dollars worth of casino chips\nAnd at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father is well it's actually a new well and this call to sell to the wheel it's taken to Fred Trump's house in December Nineteen Ninety\nAnd Fred Trump immediately sees this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire into potentially put at risk\nAnd Fred Trump immediately says no he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that

Frank ... own at the time of his death out they're awesome clued all the buildings that had been transferred from ... to the children\nThey included both of the buildings that had been transferred down the ones that he owned it was it was pretty much as ... empire\nAnd it sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer name or be shown in the price tag was just over seven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learn through the ... the documents that we went through that dot sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars then what the banks would value at out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that dot empire was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much laugh\nSo it wasn't like the deal of the century that down Donald Trump may it definitely wasn't so if the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with it so it's true that the IRS actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact they are as ours did push back some and especially on the lower valuations they've placed on buildings and made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning from ... million more bucks on that return\nBut the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got an agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a recession and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy family as you are the most expensive legal and accounting helping who engage\nIn these very sophisticated maneuvers to\nAvoid or the taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an odd or they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just under state tax returns\n[noise] I'm just saying I'm going to ask you to choose either the art of the deal the art or the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us all it actually going on in ...\nGet to choose either the art of the deal the art or the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us all it actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nOn public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David or other come back [laughter] go for it [noise] [noise]\nOh well so he publishes the art of the American Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of a sort of you know pulling himself up I'm Out of the mock of his casino collapse\nAnd through shows grit and determination and why are we negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a ... a few weeks of the publication of this book so happens to coincide with the time when you're actually took possession\nOf one quarter of his father's real estate empire through one of these very elaborate tax schemes that we describe in the store it so at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map\nIt actually cause it's perfectly when the moment when he was just taken possession of twenty five percent of this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately uh the uh The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice in the song money money money money\nThat happened in two thousand and four I'm right as the sale had gone through the the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Fred Trump and yet when you watch not opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that fried shrimp belt and paid for\n[noise] I'm Wondering how you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making abilities\nAnd so many people still believe the math and Donald Trump is still putting forward in that\nIt's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked\nAnd I think that we've ... I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think the the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents up I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's absolutely true and the documents are there and and a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for this just sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three report is working on this story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access into law\nOften everybody except that the three reporters working on this story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access to were locked up in this room [noise] um ... who cleaned it who is allowed\nTo go [laughter] we uh we did not have a cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come into one day with a with a little vacuum and and [noise] [laughter] [laughter] but we uh yeah it was uh just\nThe three of us for a year um with ah yeah that's a pretty messy [laughter] for ...\nAnd a little claustrophobic here I'd imagine [laughter] and other people know why you were locked up in the room [noise] um if people", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Albany", "day": "18", "locations": [["Manchester", 53.45, -2.23333], ["Vermont", 44.00034, -72.74983], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Middletown", 39.51506, -84.39828], ["Plattsburgh", 44.69949, -73.45291], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Philadelphia", 39.95233, -75.16379], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Vegas", 36.17497, -115.13722], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Montana", 47.00025, -109.75102], ["Saudi Arabia", 25.0, 45.0], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Kandahar Province", 31.61332, 65.71013], ["Afghanistan", 33.0, 66.0], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Saudi Arabia", 25.0, 45.0], ["China", 35.0, 105.0], ["Louisiana", 30.12595, -92.00939], ["New York New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["New York's New York", 40.77205, -73.93014], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Albany New York New York", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Atlantic City", 39.36415, -74.42306], ["Atlantic City", 39.36415, -74.42306], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Stockbridge", 33.54428, -84.23381], ["Massachusetts", 42.36565, -71.10832], ["Northampton", 40.62593, -75.37046], ["US", 45.99696, -118.49854], ["New York New York New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Manhattan", 40.78343, -73.96625], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597]], "not_found": ["Nineteen Ninety"], "ep_coords": ["Albany, NY", 42.65258, -73.75623], "in_country": ["Vermont", "Albany", "Middletown", "Plattsburgh", "Albany", "Philadelphia", "New York", "Vegas", "Washington", "Montana", "the United states", "Florida", "U.S", "Louisiana", "New York New York", "New York's New York", "Albany", "Albany New York New York", "Atlantic City", "Atlantic City", "New York", "Stockbridge", "Massachusetts", "Northampton", "US", "New York New York New York", "Manhattan", "America", "New York"], "out_country": ["Manchester", "Saudi Arabia", "Kandahar Province", "Afghanistan", "Saudi Arabia", "China"], "in_state": ["Albany", "Plattsburgh", "Albany", "New York", "New York New York", "New York's New York", "Albany", "Albany New York New York", "New York", "New York New York New York", "Manhattan", "New York"], "out_state": ["Manchester", "Vermont", "Middletown", "Philadelphia", "Vegas", "Washington", "Montana", "Saudi Arabia", "the United states", "Kandahar Province", "Afghanistan", "Florida", "U.S", "Saudi Arabia", "China", "Louisiana", "Atlantic City", "Atlantic City", "Stockbridge", "Massachusetts", "Northampton", "US", "America"]}, {"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WAMC", "content": "Offering accommodations including shuttle parking and breakfast\nI HG jak for bookings and from federal Asset Management the investment advisor to fans buttons with offices in ... scale and Albany offerings included mutual funds IRA rollovers and small business retirement plans more asset dot com [noise]\n\nThis is Northeast Public radio WAMC F.

dollars a year\nRight and what does money go\nThe money largely goes to be adults who run the games very little of it goes to the players or the players get the value of their scholarships so if you look at a program like Louisville which is program that I focused on\nThey generate about forty five million dollars a year in revenue they give out Thirteen scholarships that adds up to about four hundred thousand dollars a year the rest of it gets spread out to the coach who makes eight million dollars a year just the assistant coaches to make as much as a half million dollars a year\nAnd a thousand or more players a couple of hundred\nCollege coaches and they're playing in gyms all over Los Vegas some of them are staying on the strip and they're being scout it not only by coaches not

their hooks into kids and get their hooks into families\nAnd get into their inner circles and then to see what's in it for me can I deal this kid to a particular college can I associate him with a

did it just bring them to me there are things I don't want to know these\nAssistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep their hard to get back in the business if you lose the job the temptation to cheat is extreme\nBut you have these kids that are kind of showing their stuff in this amateur basketball kind of network and the street runners sort of pre agents that build relationships and hope to steer them to universities assistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government has charged in this case we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities there is another really creepy part of the story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges\nBut then in some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players who are already in college to a certain financial advisor at the St runner has a relationship with what's going on there\nWell that's exactly right and I and I think that's the most insidious part of this\nSo in the federal government's case there have been several assistant coaches charged with taking bribes from these runners or go betweens\nOn the grass roots circuit and the attempt of the bribe is to say okay you already have this player he's headed to the pros send them to me I Want to

three percent of that salary that adds up to a lot if you have five or ten of those players that adds up to a whole lot if you're quote managing the money of one of these players\nI don't know what that might add up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting what a money manager might make there's a lot you do you're dealing in tens of millions of dollars if I were a future NBA player or I were the family of a future NBA player\nI don't think that I Would necessarily send my kid to somebody who specializes in managing the money of sports stars\nBut there is an ecosystem of people

year a federal grand jury charged ten men in the case and the first three to be tried convicted yesterday Pitino was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal\nWhen these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news were people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on\nThey absolutely were not shocked\nWhat the FBI did was put names and faces to what\nMany people had assumed or knew was going on but there was an element of shock\nAnd what that was was that the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing parents and coaches and players into interrogation rooms as opposed to the NC double a if you're in college basketball\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double a it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be visited by the FBI and maybe looking at present time that was a shock ...\nAnd has it had a major effect on college basketball program some in Louisville certainly was turned upside down they lost their coach what about others\n\nI think overall it has not yet had a big impact on college basketball\nYou know I mentioned that they do well in a fantasy land and part of that just involves putting your head in the sand so the one of the most prominent coaches in college basketball\nThe legendary Mike ... coach K of Duke was quoted as saying this is a blip this is nothing you know this trial is nothing um it's a small sliver of what really goes on well nobody believes that but\nThe fact that coach case that it gives you an indication of the sort of institutional reaction to to what has gone on and\nA determination to sort of try to get past this without really changing anything\nYou know you're right that the question in the criminal case is whether this conduct violated federal criminal statutes but what what's really at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of the whole structure of college\nSports explain

football some of them are just moving through not necessarily getting a degree\nComing out with some injuries and yet the NC double a persists in the myth of the student athlete when everyone knows that if anything it's the athletes student you know the the athlete is what you're there for\nA while to come back to one thing you said earlier um you said a lot of people knew that that shady things were going on and that there was a risk of running afoul of and see a regulations it as a whole new game if you have the FBI asking questions do you think that'll make a difference in the future\nI Do think it will make some difference but I think that difference will be just in the way that people conduct possibly criminal activity\nI think people will be more careful you're already heard these people you know on the recordings that the FBI took them you know talking about you know we have to do this and some underhanded ways we have to get it out of certain accounts so they knew they were engaged in criminal activity I think there'll be or possibly criminal activity\nI think they'll become more careful sunny the ... the former Nike\nExecutive the godfather of the grass roots circuit he told me these people forgot where the boundaries where you know they got too greedy he also saddened by the way you never do this kind of stuff on the telephone so there's an element of all of this that makes\nThis look like just common criminal activity it makes the three shoe companies seem like crime families on the on the basketball circuit so to the extent that all of this is true and I think it is whether it's criminal we don't know\nIt will continue to go on because there's too much incentive for it to go on I certainly think with the FBI on the case people would become much more careful\nAnd just so we covered this I mean ... you said that in some respects shooting apparel companies look pretty bad in this what do they say about their role in in college recruitment in these
