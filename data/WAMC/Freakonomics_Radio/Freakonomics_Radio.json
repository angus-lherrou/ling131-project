and I hit her as hard as I can and she actually fell down I have an eight year old son is no way I'd let them play talking for\nMaybe you are an obsessive sports fan war they'd be more casual fan and you follow just a couple of sports teams or maybe pay no attention to sports and you only see it when the Olympics are on somebody else's TV whichever the case when you do see those athletes\nIt's easy to think of them as existing solely in that context\nAs a full grown adult wearing a uniform performing under extraordinary pressure focused on highly specialized task has zero to do with daily life for at least your daily life but is that who those people really are and how they get so good at this thing they do\nWhen you see them on TV all you're seeing the outcome but what were the input

equation\nToday on freakonomics radio the third installment in the series we're calling the hidden side of sports in the first episode we looked at how sports have always mirrored society from our historical penchant for war and colonizing Jew or more recent obsession with pushing the limits of human achievement\nIn episode two we looked at the economics of a single NFL franchise San Francisco forty niners and how they have a gun to recover from a debilitating\nLosing streak I mean when you lose a game a lot of noise happens when you lose to a ton happens usually three like Armageddon I'm trying not\nIn today's episode becoming an athlete's\nTime to step back and try to understand how these people rose to such heightened scientific is the process how predictable will look at the number of factors including of course raw talent my parents are both super suddenly athletes will look at will determination\nI did a bunch of push ups and sit ups that night until I was I'm throwing up\nAnd the mental aspect of this most\nPhysical pursuit well I think the mind is is as big of a separate or um for professional athletes as any physical tools will hear stories of opportunities gained\nAnd lost in Nineteen eighty one it was Eighteen forty seven percent black African American players in the major leagues as of two thousand Eighteen seven point eight percent and we'll hear one story it's almost too good to be true\nThey said hey you are blowing up on Twitter you're going to vote for him you know your everywhere and you just have no idea\n[noise]\n\nGuess freakonomics radio show that explores the inside of everything [noise] here's your house even down there\nWhen you see an elite performer in any field sports store music or surgery whatever it's natural to ask yourself the question how would they get so that how much of that ability where they born\nHow much is attributable to hard work can practice this is a debate been going on probably forever nature versus nurture raw talent versus what's called deliberate practice\nWe've had that debate on this program most recently in episode called how to become a great at just about anything\nToo often this debate ends up obscuring what strikes me as a pretty obvious fact come great at anything\nNeed both talent in lots of each but even that fact seems pretty narrow don't you think because athletic success like any success\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu tore a\nLot of input from a lot of variables imagine you've got to athletes with identical talent levels in identical training methods\nYou really want to make a big bet that their athletic careers also ended up identical as much as we might want to turn the pursuit of success in to science into a recipe real life is more nuanced than that also interesting [noise] so I mean [noise]\nJay Z\nSold drugs grew up in a Marcy projects to a single mother\nThat's Dominique Fox worth who played six seasons in the NFL\nNow he is I multiply multimillionaire married to beyond say the most amazing talent we have today so why don't we set it up so that all young men\nMust sell drugs when barricades and um and have only their mother and grow up in a Marcy projects in Brooklyn New York like I I mean he had a great\nTalent and to be honest like there's probably a a great deal of luck like he happened to not be there when one of his friends got arrested and his friend in snitch on them like that is like a lot of luck\nAnd that to me see and I think the same thing is true for me like I didn't go through the course of my life and look at all the things that happened that were just happenstance that led me to these positions and I'm not going to say that it's a model that should be\nThat should be followed understand that there are occasional outliers but trying to build around that seems\nCrazy so okay we're not going to arrive at some perfect model for turning an ordinary person into a world class athlete but we'll do our best to describe some of the inputs that seemed to be strong contributors let's\nStart with physical ability it may not surprised to learn that a lot of elite athletes exhibited pretty high baseline level of talent from an early age ... to share a for instance a three time major league baseball all star\nYes you know ... and most kids grow up being you know if you're an elite athlete you're going to be the best get on your team\nPlayed every sport as a kid was baseball your best sport in the ... always while yes ah and I actually enjoy playing basketball more uh I play backyard football I played soccer tennis and uh but I I was always good at baseball so I knew baseball was going to be um you know a sport for my future\nAthletic talent is considered one of the more heritable traits passed from parent to child\nIn super freakonomics one of the books I wrote with the economist Steve limit we performed a rough calculations showing that if a major league baseball player has a son that boy is about eight hundred times more likely than a random boy also make the majors\nSo it may not surprise you that a lot of the athletes we've been interviewing for the series came from athletic families here's Kerry Welsh Jennings who's won three Olympic gold medals and beach volleyball\nOh man well my ... my life has literally then family and sports like from day one I think from birth and my parents are both super sadly athletes they both come from very athletic family\nMy parents are both athletic\nAnd that's the alpine skier McHale is shift friend who was one two and then put gold medals\nMom is ... extremely athletic and even now she's had knee surgery than hands surgeries and neck surgery and everything but she's still such an incredible athlete well I mean my dad kind of did\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nHe was a hockey player he wrestled he did BMX he a race ... I mean everything\nOnly by age twenty two did they start playing fewer sports in spending more time and structured soccer than athlete to put into the lower levels so this sort of less structured development [noise]\nAnd turns out to be completely characteristic of athletes go on to become like [noise]\nOkay but\nWhat if you are a young athlete or the parents have one\nIn your ultimate goal isn't to become an elite professional athletes but rather to get into an elite universities like one of the top ten schools in the country [noise]\nYou know I've actually been thinking about that exact problem that's ... my freakonomics friend and coauthor he's an economist at the University of Chicago\nMy calculation about point four percent of kids so about one\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAnd so it's a it's a hard hard goal to do it\nAnd I can't say I've thought about the University of things you you could do but I thought about sports and uh and I stumbled on to something that was pretty surprising to me so the answer I think is you want your kid to be a fence or\nThe guy that you might say that sounds crazy like this college fencing even exist and\nAnd the answer is there turned out to be exactly forty six schools that have fencing but the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked schools in the country nine of those ten\nHave a fencing team the only exception be my own university University of Chicago\nIn each fencing team has quite a few slots to fill this three different blades ... soil and there's male female fancy and given that relatively few kids in the U.S are serious you Spencers\nSo it's something like six or seven percent of the kids who ever tried to be sensors end up being college fences about saying they get scholarships but that they're likely to be admitted to college based on their fencing\nHow much does limit thing fencing increases your chances from that point four percent baseline\nSo fencing seems to raise that number holding everything else costs than something like Fifteen fold we shouldn't say here that college admissions being what they are\nFencing doesn't necessarily increase your chances all that much your grades would soon to be very very good to get into those top schools that said as an admission sweetener\nHow does ... think fencing compares to other sports\nMy God if you want to go to an Ivy League school\nForget about soccer and basketball and football there's something like three hundred thousand kids playing high school soccer and presumably any of those kids would love to be caught soccer players\nBut that the chance of having soccer be your vehicle to get to college as opposed to fencing turns out to be about Seventy five or eighty times harder so how many of your kids have you turned to defense or is it\nExactly one and uh so far so good uh I I couldn't really turned him into a fence or uh he he strangely enough gravitated towards fencing when he was about nine years old and he fences that are really good club in Chicago\nAnd I don't know his grades aren't that good so he knows and I know as everyone else knows if he's going to go to an Ivy League school it's going to be because of fencing [noise]\nComing up on freakonomics radio the story of an athlete who did go to an Ivy League school but then it was time to go pro that apparently counted against him if he had played at Kentucky or do you\nView would have been a time to address\nThe problem was he played at Harvard we'll be right back\n\nFreakonomics radio is supported by target

Chinese born and raised Chinese\nUm when he was three years old he was taken away from his family and raised to be an Olympic gymnast\nAnd he kind of had this crazy career that I Would say almost traumatized him he he lost his childhood he'll kinda lost his family and so when he was Twenty one years old he actually left to China\nCame to the United states open to a gym in West Des Moines Iowa of all places and had this dream this American Dream to raise an Olympian are lumpy ends that were also children and how to balance in life and were\nYou know fun loving and had a true childhood Johnson had started her training at different gym and I loved it it was awesome but child my coach that took me to you on backs opened up a gym about five minutes from my parents' house\nAnd my parents ended up switching the they had to save gas money and I was really really last fall under his his guidance and his coaching I mean I I was a very very fortunate child's within the gymnastics community to have\nVery loving very very protective people around me and he I mean\nGiven today's society I can thankfully and\nSay that he he kept me safe and I am forever grateful for that\n\nSean Johnson's good luck created good opportunities which she worked hard to parlay into\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nDon't get the right opportunities whether if you're bad luck bore through something much more concrete like lack of money what were the past decade the youth sports economy has doubled more than Fifteen billion dollars a year and a lot of youth sports involves some sort of pay to play model\nPay to play is something that just it just scares me because it's become so much of a business of itself and less about\nTrue true true development\nThat's Brandon McCarthy he's been a pitcher in major league baseball for Thirteen ...\nIt's a tournament in California this week and the next week and you go to Nevada and after that it's Texas and I don't understand how two working parents could never afford to put their kids through that and then take the time to travel with them\n... you know the theme of economics the last like ten or Fifteen Years has been income inequality and connected to that the rich getting richer it sounds like what you're saying with youth sports is that's being near ... all the way down the line yes\nI Would think so I mean there's two players on your team and one player I'm at the age Thirteen level can make all the tournaments in the summer and one can only make to the tournaments well how much playing time as the player who whose family can't afford for him to go all those trips and then the coach doesn't favor him and play them\nI think this that trickle down effect from there there's less access to the top coaching lessons equipment you name it over time it's starting to pirates off out as some income inequality just creates better baseball players and worst baseball players\nOr in one or the instance a huge drop in baseball players in Nineteen eighty one there was Eighteen point seven percent black African American players in the major leagues as of two thousand Eighteen seven point eight percent so the question is why the decline\nAnd I remember my family kind of being like what the hell [laughter] why you know why are you suddenly neglecting us so much and ah [noise]\nI I didn't really have a good answer for them at the time I just thought this is something that I Want to do and I want to be really good at good at it while I Do it and so I Need to you know make these sacrifices now so I can have a good performance later\nIn high school at you know by the time I was a sophomore and I knew I had a chance I started preparing the former baseball all star mark to share\nMy didn't go to my high school a homecoming for three straight years because I was playing for baseball you know I didn't I didn't do a lot of stuff in the summertime like Seventy games every summer my friends are going to concerts my friends or you know having a good time at the beach and all these kinds of things\nSo [noise] um for me I sacrifice from the time I was I don't know uh\nProbably in high school is when I started to uh forego other opportunities\nThat again is Dominic Fox worth who over did his push ups and sit ups at age eight in order to make the NFL\nAnd then in college I wanted to be a ... computer science major at um University of Maryland and my academic advisor was like Mm though that that core slows going to make it very difficult for you to make it to our practices\nTheir labs and blah blah blah blah so I was like not not going to do\nThat so instead you did with an American studies at American studies when journalism ... which just shows how easy would I Do is that you could do it and another major while\nPlaying football [laughter] no I um I enjoy those and it was it was good but it wasn't what I wanted to do and in the summers when when people were getting internships or whatever I was working out and getting ready for football and I\nSay I want to say once I got to the league then I got drafted in I was in the third round so that's it's money it's good money but it's not life changing money doesn't make up for all the things that you are given up through the course of your life\n[noise] you shouldn't feel too sorry for Fox or he played long enough to enter free agency his final NFL contract paid him about twenty seven million dollars but now out of football for a few years he's still feeling the after effects\nOf his single minded\nSo like my my whole life since I was a kid I had a very clear goal and I work towards that goal and I made lots of decisions that would give me close to that goal but give me further away from other important and interesting things including friends including family and\nAnd then I Will say art I'm done playing so I Will be in the state of transition\nHis transition included getting an MBA from Harvard and working at the NBA players union he's now doing some writing and sports casting I mean I think\nIt's a feeling of loneliness honestly which and it's not like a three kids and my wife and I'm not like alone obviously and I love them and I have fun with them and but\nThroughout my life I have been\nAlmost myopic Lee focused on a goal which being focused on that goal I gave me purpose and\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency

I never drank in my life I never smoke we like I\nWas single focus on doing everything every decision I made with like All right I'm going to get closer to go and I I ... the people who are close with in high school like those are my friends any more people I was close with in college like not really my friends anymore and then at thirty five I'm In DC where my wife has\nA bunch of family and friends friends that she's been close with since they were in the second grade and like and I my\nI don't really have that and like I was making these choices\nAh which I thought were choices to get

and mark to share a and Lauren Murphy bought about the athletes who make the sacrifices but don't make the big time\nJust look at the numbers there are only about Seventeen hundred players in the NFL major league baseball you're if you were the nine hundred the NBA just about five hundred in baseball roughly Ninety percent of the players drafted by major league clubs don't ever make it to the majors\nOne of those Ninety percent was just an Humphries\nYou get a phone call says how does it feel to be the next member of the Houston Astros and you just get you get except the dream come through so I ended up signing\nHe started playing minor league baseball at Eighteen which meant skipping college although he did start taking some courses later on\nIn two thousand nine he retired at age twenty seven without ever making the majors he enrolled at Columbia University and took a sociology class with a professor named Sudhir Venkatesh\nSo I was sitting there in his classroom I started thinking about all the issues are that I'd seen an independent baseball and affiliated baseball\nGuys living check to check struggling with Louis go back to school family life issues at home and I thought if I could use some of the things that we were learning in class talked to some of these guys and find out whether the stories and and things that I was seeing and hearing was reflected in the numbers\nWe followed a sample of the draft class of two thousand and one and so that's the but you know it's ten years\nAnd that is Sudhir Venkatesh\nAnd so we thought that would help us understand what happens to these folks I think one of the most curious things that we find is how much ten years matter so if you take two people who grow up in the same circumstances let's say one played baseball in one day and\nThe person who plays baseball is making about forty percent less on average ten years after they enter the game then the person who decides not to play baseball and who just wanted a regular career\nAll right so what kind of background is typical for these players you're tracking the average player\nProbably looks like an upper middle class kid who comes out of college or comes out of high school\nUm and when you follow in upper middle class kid for about seven to ten years they're probably going to make higher than the median average income they're probably going to live in a neighborhood that's relatively safe they're going to have a career now when you take the counterpart among the pool that was drafted that median kid\nThat kid looks like he's making about twenty to twenty four thousand dollars a year\nWhich is not a lot of money um he's working probably five to seven months playing baseball and then struggling to find part time work in the off season might be coaching might be doing some training might be working on a construction site might be working in fast food\nWhen you're twenty five playing an independent ball making less than two thousand dollars a month\nLiving off your parents because you can't financially sustain yourself like that\nAt some point you have to say look I got with no degree I had less than an associate's degree at that point so at some point you tell yourself I Can't do this to myself I Can't do that to my parents and I can't continue when I Know there's ... untapped potential to do other things [laughter]", "year":

[noise]\nWhen you see an elite performer in any field of sports or music or surgery whatever it's natural to ask yourself the question how they get it how much of that ability where they born\nHow much is attributable to hard work can practice this is a debate been going on probably forever nature versus nurture raw talent versus what's called deliberate practice\nWe've had that debate on this program most recently in episode called how to become a great at just about anything too often this debate ends up obscuring what strikes me as a pretty obvious things come great at anything\nYou need both talent in ... lots of each but even that fact seems pretty narrow don't you think because\nAthletic success like any success and leave money failure it's what you might call multi factorial a lot of input from a lot of variables imagine you've got to athletes with identical talent levels in identical training methods\nYou really want to make a big bet that their athletic careers also end up identical as much as we might want to turn the pursuit of success in to science into a recipe real life is more new ones and then also for interesting so I mean [noise]\nJay Z\nSold drugs grew up in a Marcy projects to a single mother that's Dominique Fox worth who played six seasons in the NFL now he is I multiply multimillionaire\nMarried to beyond say the most amazing talent we have today\nSo why don't we set it up so that all young men\nMust sell drugs when barricades and um and have only their mother and grow up in a Marcy projects in Brooklyn New York I mean\nHe had a great talent and to be honest like there's probably a a great deal of luck like\nHe happened to not be there when one of his friends got arrested and his friend in Smith on them like that is\nLike a lot of luck that to me and I think the same thing is true for me like I didn't go through the course of my life and look at all the things that happen that were just happenstance that led me to be physicians and I'm not going to say that it's a model that should be\nThere should be followed understand that there are occasional outliers but trying to build around that seems crazy\nSo okay we're not going to arrive at some perfect model for turning an ordinary person into a world class athlete but\nWe'll do our best to describe some of the inputs that seemed to be strong contributors let's start with physical ability it may not surprise you to learn that a lot of elite athletes exhibited a pretty high baseline level of talent from an early age ... to share a for instance three time major league baseball star\nYes you're at and most kids grow up being you know if you're an elite athletes are going to be the best kid on your\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family

pretty high baseline level of talent from an early age ... to share a for instance a three time major league baseball star\nYes you are and most kids grow up being you know if you're an elite athletes are going to be the best kid on your team\nYou I've played every sport as a kid was baseball your best sport in the ... always ... uh and I actually enjoy playing basketball more ah I played backyard football I played soccer tennis and uh but I I was always good at baseball so I knew baseball was going to be um you know a sport for my future\nAthletic talent is considered one of the more heritable traits passed from parent to child in super freakonomics one of the books I wrote with the economist ... we performed a rough calculations showing that if a major league baseball player has a son\nThat boy is about eight hundred times more likely than a random boy also make the majors\nSo it may not surprise you that a lot of the athletes we've been interviewing for the series came from athletic families here's Kerry Welsh Jennings who's won three Olympic gold medals in ...\nOh man well my ... my life has literally been family and sports like from day one I think from birth and my parents are both super than the athletes they both come from very athletic family\nUm published a study where they attract the development of soccer players in Germany that's David obscene and he's talking about the two thousand fourteen World Cup and found that the athletes who went on to the national team which by the way one that World Cup\nUm had played more different sports when they were younger spent more time in self structured or unstructured soccer play when they were younger but not more time in deliberately structured soccer training\nOnly by age twenty two did they start playing fewer sports in spending more time and structured soccer than athletes who plateaued a lower level so this sort of less structured development [noise]\n[noise] and turns out to be completely characteristic of athletes go on to become [noise] okay but\nWhat if you are a young athlete or the parents of one\nAnd your ultimate goal isn't to become an elite professional athletes but rather to get into an elite universities like one of the top ten schools in the country [noise]\nYou know I've actually been thinking about that exact problem that's ... my freakonomics friend and co author he's an economist at the University of Chicago but\nCalculation about point four percent of kids so about one in two hundred and fifty kids will make it to one of those top ten schools so it's a it's a hard hard goal to do it\nAnd I can't say I thought about the University of things you you could do but I thought about sports and uh and I stumbled on something that was pretty surprising to me so the answer I think\nIs you want your kid to be a fence or\nCase though you might say that's a crazy like this college fencing even exist and and the answer is there turned out to be exactly forty six schools that offensive but the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked ...\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nIs you want your kid to be a fence or\n... you might say that sounds crazy like this college fencing even exist and\nAnd the answer is there turned out to be exactly forty six schools that have fencing but the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked schools in the country nine of those ten\nHave fencing thing the only exception being my own university University of Chicago\nIn each fencing team has quite a few slots to fill\nThere's three different blade says eBay there's Sabre list foil and there's male female fancy\nAnd given that relatively few kids in the U.S are serious you Spencers\nSo it's something like six or seven percent of the kids who ever tried to be sensors end up being college fence is not about saying they get scholarships but that they're likely to be admitted to college based on their fencing\nHow much does limit think fencing increases your chances from that point four percent baseline\nSo fencing seems to raise that number holding everything else cuts and something like Fifteen\nFold we should say here that college admissions being what they are fencing doesn't necessarily increase your chances all that much your grades would soon to be very very good to get into those top schools that said as an admissions sweetener how does ... think fencing compares to other sports\nMy God if you want to go to an Ivy League school\nForget about soccer and basketball and football there's something like three hundred thousand kids playing high school soccer and presumably any of those kids would love to be caught soccer players\nBut the the chance of having soccer be your vehicle to get to college as opposed to fencing turns out to be about Seventy five or eighty times harder so how many of your kids have you turned into sensors limit\nExactly one and us so far so good uh I I couldn't say I really turned him into a fence or uh he he strangely enough gravitated towards fencing when he was about nine years old and he fences at a really good club in Chicago\nAnd I don't know is grades aren't that good so she knows that I Know everybody else knows if he's going to go to an Ivy League school it's going to because of fencing [noise]\nComing up on freakonomics radio story of an athlete who did go to an Ivy League school but then when it's time to go pro that apparently counted against him if he had played at

was incredibly lucky to end up with my coaches so how'd that happen it was kind of this freak occurrence my coach was Chinese born and raised Chinese\nUm when he was three years old and he was taken away from his family and raised to be an Olympic gymnast\nAnd he kind of had this crazy career that I Would say almost traumatized him he he lost his childhood he'll kind of lost his family and so when he was Twenty one years old he actually left to China came to the United states\nOpen to a gym in West Des Moines Iowa of all places and had this dream this American Dream to raise an Olympian or Olympians that were also children and how to balance in life and were\nYou know fun loving and had a true childhood Johnson who started her training at different gym and I loved it it was awesome but chow my coach that took me the ... opened up a gym about five minutes from my parents' house\nAnd my parents ended up switching me because it saved gas money and I was really really blessed to fall

can thankfully in\nMay that he he can't maintain and I and forever grateful for that\nOh\nShawn Johnson and good luck created good opportunities which she worked hard to parlay into an Olympic gold medal but what about the young athletes who don't get the right opportunity is whether if you're bad luck\nWar through something much more concrete like lack of money what were the past decade the youth sports economy has doubled more than Fifteen billion dollars a year and a lot of youth sports involves some sort of pay to play model\nPay to play is something that just it just scares me because it's become so much of a business of itself and less about\nTrue true true development\nThat's Brandon McCarthy he's been a pitcher in major league baseball for Thirteen seasons\nIt's a tournament in California this week of the next week and you go to Nevada and after that it's Texas and I don't understand how two working parents could ever afford to put their kids through that and then take the time to travel with them\nYou you know the theme of economics the last like ten or Fifteen Years has been income inequality and connected to that the rich getting richer it sounds like what you're saying with youth sports is that's being near that all the way down the line yes\nI Would think so I mean there's two players on their team and one player I'm at the age Thirteen level can make all the tournaments in the summer and one can only make to the tournaments well how much playing time as the player who whose family can't afford for him to go all those trips and then the coach doesn't favor em and play um\nLauren Murphy is a professional mixed martial arts fighter in the ... weight division of USC\nThey have to work out all the time they need to rest a lot of us work so they're just not a lot of time in the day and a lot of times the first thing that kind of get taken off the plate is time with family\nAnd so I remember missing a couple of Thanksgiving dinners um you know not being able to drive out to my sister's house for Christmas and I remember my family kind of being like what the hell [laughter] why you know why are you suddenly neglecting us so much and ah [noise]\nI I didn't really have a good answer for them at the time I just thought this is something that I Want to do and I want to be really good at good at it while I Do it and so I Need to you know make these sacrifices now so I can have a good performance later\nThe high school at you know by the time I was a sophomore and I knew I had a chance I started preparing the former baseball all star mark to share a\nWhy didn't go to my high school a homecoming for three straight years because I was playing for baseball you know I didn't I didn't do a lot of stuff in the summertime like Seventy games every summer my friends are going to concerts my friends or you know having a good time at the beach and and all these kinds of things\nSo [noise] um for me I sacrifice from the time I was I don't know uh\nProbably in high school is when I started to uh forego\nOther opportunities that again is Dominic Fox worth who over did his push ups and sit ups at age eight in order to make the

and getting ready for football and I\nSell it to say once I got to the league and I got drafted in I was in the third round so that's it's money it's good money but it's not life changing money doesn't make up for all the things that you give it up through the course of your life\n[noise] you shouldn't feel too sorry for Fox or he played long enough to enter free agency his final NFL contract paid him about twenty seven million dollars but now out of football for a few years\nHe's still feeling the after effects\nOf his single minded and\nSo like my my whole life since I was a kid at a very clear goal and I work towards that goal and I made lots of decisions that would give me close to that goal but give me further away from other important and\nInteresting things including friends including family and and then I was like All right I'm done playing so I Will be in the state of transition\nHis transition included getting an MBA from Harvard and working at the NBA players union he's now doing some writing and sports casting I mean I think\nIt's that feeling of loneliness honestly which and it's not like I have three kids and my wife and I'm not like a loan obviously and I love them and I have fun with them and but throughout my life I have been\nAlmost myopic Lee focused on a goal which being focused on that goal I gave me purpose and\nI'm sure I'm going to

Eighteen which meant skipping college although he did start taking some courses later on\nIn two thousand nine he retired at age twenty seven without ever making the majors he enrolled at Columbia University and took a sociology class with a professor named Sudhir Venkatesh\nSo I was sitting there and it's classroom I started thinking about all the issues are that I've seen an independent baseball and affiliated baseball\nGuys living check to check struggling with Louis go back to school family life issues at home and I thought if I could use some of the things that we were learning in class talked to some of these guys and find out whether the stories and and things that I was seeing and hearing was reflected in the numbers\nWe followed a sample of the draft class of two thousand and one and so that's the but you know it's ten years and that is Sudhir Venkatesh and so we thought that would help us understand what happens to these folks\nI think one of the most curious things that we find is how much ten years matter so if you take two people who grow up in the same circumstances let's say one played baseball in one didn't\nThe person who plays baseball is making about forty percent less on average ten years after they enter the game and the person who decides not to play baseball and who just wanted a regular career\nAll right so what kind of background is typical

accident that it's taken by the United states has repercussions are\nEverywhere are across the world so anything that the U.S does will have a global systemic effect so of course a lot of my time uh has to do with that but what is important also you have to realize that President Trump didn't just happen\nYou know he didn't just you know fall from the skies in an ambient that was a a knock ripe and then found a direction that didn't that that was not there he is the result of a very real\nA situation in American society and in the American economy and the if you don't understand the forces

welcome in other areas of the world but not every single forced\nThe WTO as opposed to tariffs generally and most economists agree that tariffs are a really distorted way to do trade\nBut it strikes me that there are a lot of instances where tariffs exists under a different name one of the U.S is the biggest complaints is that China for instance doesn't honor intellectual property that\nRather than being bought or license the properties copied so that would essentially be a tariff on the imported version and their their governments subsidize their airline industries or their agricultural industries are oil and gas and sugar [noise]\nDo you the WTO have any ability\nTo direct totally request or command that these are terrorists not by name but in essence be eliminated\nAbsolutely happens all the time industries like protection they want to be supported by the government is they want to get help and they are now seen this um a prize in what we call behind the border protection\nA and that happens in the form of a technical barriers it happens in the form of or insufficient enforcement of certain rules like you mentioned intellectual property and that's much more difficult to assess because terrorists you can measure\nThe Arabs you include on your spreadsheet and you'll prepare for it to pay that additional cost a behind the border measure you don't know when they come you know what form they would take so it's it's stuff we have a communities are hearing the W. job will discuss exactly that\nDo you have any sense if you had to estimate the size of those ... what they would be compared to the official tariff rates\nAnd not really a also because some of those are perfectly legal you would see some countries are a put it in place technical barriers or

this very traditional very a historic attention\nToday we are seeing a transformation of the economic structure of the global economy Web producing things differently we're producing things fester we don't require 'em as much human input as we did before and this is increasing\nNow clearly even for a government sent for politicians it is easier to blame you know the foreign for these problems which are happening inside their own economies it's easier to blame the the imports are for the loss of jobs when they arm or they have a role of course but the minor\nIn this structural change and I think if we don't realize that if we don't try to find a solution for this will be hurting much more than the help it\nOkay so you've just described I Would argue beautifully in succinctly a big problem that of course a lot of economists and some others have described but you're right that's not the political rhetoric\nSo it's easy to think of what the wrong medicine how involved is the WTO in trying to discover and administer the right medicine\nI think that number two is already at least trying to help governments and public opinion to understand uh the situation and reached the right

[noise] [noise]\nThis is freakonomics radio with your host Stephen ...\nSo I wouldn't say that my pop economics was through Marxism but it was through reading some very inspirational economists which one was definitely Carl Marx\nMary on among the Cato\nI'm a professor and the economics of innovation on public value at University College London\nYou also advised as far as I can tell a number of governments in governmental institutions\nShorts I'm currently on the council of economic advisors for the first minister Scotland and also the special adviser for ... their research commissioner in the European Union and I used to be on the advisory board offered Jeremy I'm ...\nAnd I resigned because of breakfast\nIt's sheer special advisor to the secretary general of the CDs that right yeah so the\nOnly city is currently rethinking its economic narrative and so they have a group that's literally called called that the new economic narrative and I'm One of the people on that\nGotcha and also

forget that futile ism was five hundred years of inertia one of the defining features of capitalism is a fact the way the innovation has really broken down all sorts of laws that it's constantly changing how industries operate how production distribution and consumption work and marks really talks about that\nBut it's quite curious that one of the you know most of them at the critics of capitalism actually described it and the most dynamic kind of always and knocked what got me interested in economics of technological\nChange but it's not just technological change interests much cut

out to be the most expensive one that\nGot anyone who read that article to call me a\nSoviet ... social [laughter] right\nSo to someone who says you know free markets are almost always good and governments are almost always bad to someone who says that you say what\nThe first is what do you mean by the free market and it's curious if you read Adam Smith a you know a one of the first economists back in the late Seventeen hundreds he actually meant by the word free market not\nFree from the state but free from rent seeking free from those activities that extract value so when I say to those who say that you know we need less state\nI'm uh in order to be more innovative more dynamic might say well let's look at one of the most innovative parts of the U.S economy which is Silicon Valley did that come from the free market or from an active a visible hands or the state\nMy point is actually the state to listen to the ball and almost everything in Silicon valley not to exclude the role of the private sector of course we all know the very important ah companies in that area but\nThe role that public after it's played was really across the whole innovation\nChain so you're talking about agencies like dark but NASA and the national institutes of health and so on yes\nExactly I'm Talking about both agencies that do basic research like the national Science Foundation\nBut also a agencies more downstream doing applied research like a dark chocolate sister organization in more recent times called ARPA e the national institutes of health which continued to spend more than thirty billion dollars a year and the most radical\nUncertain high risk a research\nSome evidence of the government funding that much ... is talking about DARPA or the defense advanced research

starting in Nineteen Seventy eight invested more than a hundred and thirty million dollars studying the extraction techniques that have come to be known as fracking\nAnd the national institutes of health has helped fund the vast majority of all new drugs approved\nBy the FDA [noise]\nThese public institutions have absolutely co created value is quite extraordinary that we've become very used to these kind of much more passive words to describe the state you start having to change the copy Larry\nUh that one uses so instead of saying the public sector deem risks the private sector is actually about sharing risks instead of talking about just facilitating and enabling business it's really about taking on the lead investor role as an investor first resort\nOne of the central arguments you make is that government institutions and closet government institutions are involved in the investment are involved in the risk and yet you argue barely share in return how big of a problem is that\nSo it's a huge problem and it comes back how we talk about things I often remind people um you know Plato [laughter] a sad story teller ruled the world\nSo these stories that we tell about who create value has in fact created the stories that are that justify the extraction of of value so let me give you an example which I think brings home\nThe U.S government after the crisis decided to have a proper fiscal stimulus program of close to eight hundred billion dollars\nAnd part of that agenda was really also to direct that fiscal stimulus towards the green economy so you might remember that Obama financed some companies like a cylinder through the U.S department of energy through a guaranteed loans that was for about five hundred million and that company went bust\nOr new questions about a cornerstone of stimulus won five hundred and thirty five million dollar loan to a company called cylinder makes solar energy panels what is the taxpayers have to be the one footing the bill to try to shift a shift on power or solar power works\nPeople said my God the government would a basket case group of\nThey don't know what they're doing they shouldn't be picking winners they should just really do this kind of facilitating rolls of you know construct some roads education infrastructure and then get out of the way on which first of all completely misses the point that actually the U.S government in terms of energy has been the lead finance or\nOf areas like solar and wind alongside other governments but also nuclear fracking itself came out of a U.S government financing early on\nBut more concretely at the same time that it with financing cylinder and also financed Tesla for a very similar amount of money so the tests last car got a four hundred and sixty five million

thinking about running for mayor but he joined our board gave some money\nMichael Bloomberg wasn't seriously thinking about running for mayor much less being there\nWhich as you may know also

sidewalk labs whose mission is\nOur mission is really to use technology to redefine urban life and the twenty first century and we want to do it by literally building or a city or a district of a city and we have chosen Toronto to do that\nOkay let's back up to before the un doctor off was the new one [noise]\nSo you were for many years obsessed with the idea of bringing the Olympics the summer Olympics to New York city and you ... first in obscurity for a while spending a lot of your own money\nA recruiting a lot of people to your cause you you got some leverage over time you got in the Bloomberg administration you were first reluctant to take that job because he thought it would curtail your limping activity but Mike Bloomberg persuade you that it actually would give you leverage\nOr you've got delayed you wanted to be two thousand they had got pushed to two thousand twelve Olympics\nUm you pursue do you pursue you pursued you traveled the world did everything you could\nFinally you were a New York was voted the U.S a city in the bed\nAnd then um ultimately lost out in the in the Iowa seeing the international Olympic Committee vote\nSounds pretty nutty doesn't it\nYou know I don't mean to be dismissive of the Olympics themselves but was the Olympic bid on some level\nKind of a a stalking horse to rebuild New York city whether the Olympics came here or not and is it possible that New York perhaps benefited more from the bid for the Olympics and all the infrastructure and related benefits that have produced then they would have benefited from actually hosting it\n[noise] I wouldn't describe it as a stalking horse I Would just say that that was always part of a strategy that it was sort of the off ramp from the strategy that\nYou know the Olympics could be the catalyst to getting things done that people have been talking about for generations but never were able to muster the political will or financial resources to actually do and you could look at successful examples in the past\nAs to how they use the deadlines of the bidding for the Olympics were more likely hosting the Olympics\nCreated sort of an imperative in a city so Tokyo in Nineteen sixty four built the subway system around it\nYou know Barcelona in Nineteen Ninety two did an amazing job of recovering from being a stepchild of dread under Franco for decades and revitalizing the city\nYou're leaving out the the counter examples like Athens but I mean it's not quite the science of what kind of region will benefit from\nIt all depends on the planning and it depends on the economic resources and other things but I convinced myself\nThat we're in New York was in its development cycle having that kind of catalyst could be a really important thing and we use the deadline of the Olympic decision to get massive reads owning guns\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and

started his New York city life as just another banker who then got obsessed with bringing the Olympics to New York then joined the Bloomberg administration help New York recover from the nine eleven attack\nWho then paired the recovery effort with the Olympic dream to dramatically reshaped the New York that exists today one of his projects at the moment is a new cultural center on the west side of Manhattan called the shed of which Dr off is chairman of president [noise]\nShed I'm just curious about the the wide and that's why did New York city need another arts complex you I understand are not exactly a a performing arts fiend at least\nYeah well the origin of it actually dates back to when we re planned the west side of Manhattan which we did and in two separate parts one part of it was in West Chelsea in the core of it was to save the high line\nThe second part was to a bill what's called Hudson Yards which is this area on the far west side of Manhattan and uh we decided that the intersection of the high line in Hudson Yards\nWe wanted to have a cultural institution we set to standards for what it should be unlike anything else in New York which is hard 'cause there's twelve hundred cultural institutions in New York\nAnd secondly that it should play a role in keeping New York on the leading edge culturally in the world\nAnd so we eventually had an insight about the role of technology and the role that it's playing and reshaping the cultural ecosystem that led us to conclude that what New York needed was a completely different kind of institution one that would be the most flexible but pro grammatically a and physically\nRight so this is a building that kind of can be recon figure like a transformer or something else\nThat's exactly right it's like a transformer it's really remarkable the building literally moves a and it will open up a in March twenty ninth is what we're targeting two thousand Nineteen and it may be one of the largest cultural start ups of all time\nAnd the c._e._o. of telling him to Alex boots or ran for many years in Manchester international festival which again is unusual in that it takes place or took place at least all over the city not in set theaters\nFrom what I can gather the sheds seems to be a sort of um you know professionalized gorilla operation in a way right it's got a lot of the experimental is some of the experimental arts movement with kind of the the juice and leverage of a big city like New York\nA great way of saying you know another way of expressing as cultural festival every day because there's multiple spaces that can be recon figured\nThat can accommodate virtually any cultural discipline I mean look at our basic view whether it's with respect to culture or whether it's with respect to city building is\nNobody smart enough to predict the future so you cannot plan\nTo the detail or even sort of the gross level what's going to happen in the future instead what you can do is create the infrastructure that might be physical it might be digital might be some ground rules et cetera that enable people to project their own ideas and\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAnd to change I think that is a very different notion of the cultural institution as well as city building\nI find it and I mean zero disrespect by this but I find it interesting that of all the things that attracts people to New York city these days outsiders visitors the high line is among the most popular it was proposed to be turned into this you know public parking strolling area and\nYou are not a big supporter of it not that you are so hard against it\nBut it's just a striking reminder illustration I guess to me that\nYou and your folks around you who were obviously doing the central infrastructure planning you couldn't have possibly predicted that something like that and his humble as the high line for God's sake and it's an abandoned freight line would turn into this thing that has so much appeal and I'm just curious what kind of lesson that taught you\nWhen I came into city hall um the high line was really one court decision away from being torn down and the Giuliani administration which it proceeded us was really intent\nOn ripping it down because the landowners who owned land under the high line really were really pressuring the Giuliani administration to get rid of it\nAnd you know there were some of us in the administration and immediately saw what the two young guys who would basically kept it alive saw which is that this could be a beautiful park and a manatee\nI Will confess I didn't see that right away um but the key point is is that you know you seize opportunities as you see them and as they evolve and if you're flexible enough to do that then ultimately you can create something that might be amazing\nI mean the the paradox and that is flexibility is not a hallmark of government is it\nWell it generally is not because government is really hard um and just getting anything done and often takes extraordinary effort\nA but it should be a on some level a hallmark of government at the same time you have to have a sense for what you want to do and so you have to\nCombine sort of this openness with a determination to get things done or else nothing ever happens you know one of the principles that we always operated with is that what we're competitive entity in New York and whether we were competing with\nLondon or Los Angeles or Jersey City to be honest you know we can't make policy that puts us at a competitive disadvantage\nLet me ask you about that competition between whether it's far away cities are are near a city you and the Bloomberg administration made it a point to change policy and stop throwing a lot of money at firms are institutions that threatened to leave the using that kind of standard financial incentive\nBut I'm curious what effect that zero sum competition has on each area because\nYou know in some dimensions I'd imagine the competition is healthy right on the other hand firms and institutions can end do game the system and basically skim a bunch of taxpayer money for their own purposes so what's the best way to balance that and still incentivize firms and institutions to be where they can do the most good\nOur view was that financial incentives or to work companies or more importantly keep them was almost always a fool\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nJust on its back you know we're facing enormous budget deficits so the easy temptation would have been to bribe companies to stay or bribe companies to come uh we met with CEOs of companies all over the country and all over the world in addition to in New York we analyze their cost structures\nIn great detail\nAnd eventually what we concluded was companies are going to do what's in their economic interest over the long run and that providing these sorts of incentives was like giving a crack\nBut the crack was ultimately going to affect the dealer more than the user\nAnd so it just didn't make a lot of sense and so we just stopped\nInstead the way we'd compete was based on our natural strengths which we thought we could enhance and our number one natural strength was that New York um had been a haven for people from all over the world you know it's sort of this optimistic sense that produces incredible energy\nI'm that attracted companies to New York and we ought to build off of that most places have some sort of competitive advantage but they got to be honest about what it was and so that for us was really what the strategy became [noise]\nYeah you got to be true to yourself um that's one of the things that I consistently preached to leaders in cities around the country and around the world\nYou know cities are like people um or maybe like companies they have personalities they have strengths and

sure in some ways we benefit from the novelty act of being three brotherly writers but then we all of course want to be known for her own accomplishments right but uh you know\nOur parents didn't do anything they didn't force us to play violin or four hours a day and or or sit down and study the great chess master as we watched a lot of heat man an Addams family reruns on television when we were growing up\nBut what are the things that they did was they gave us a credit card which they said we weren't allowed to stand essentially on anything except in the event of an incredible emergency and there was one exception to this which is that they said that we could basically spend the credit card that will at the book shop\nAnd so they basically guided us to one thing\nYour first job in

never really turning a profit and so as\nWe entered the Internet age that became a more and more difficult thing to continue to do and so we ended up shifting from one ownership group to the next and I got so exhausted trying to find an owner and kind of sick of that I ended up\nResigning his editor but then a couple of years after I resigned the magazine got bought by a guy called Chris Hughes who'd been Mark Zuckerberg's roommate\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\n... and to me it just seems like almost too good to be true or that you had this guy who understood social media who had incredible number of resources and seemed devoted to this little magazine that I was also devoted to and so I came back\nAnd I edited the magazine and Christian I Try to remake it\nAnd the relationship and the beginning seemed like it was unbelievably good\nYeah we became really good friends and it was exhilarating we felt like we were trying to save something that was imperiled in the world and then maybe we can help provide some sort of dignified solution to the rest of journalism which was grappling with a lot of the same issues that we were grappling with\nBut there was a moment when things just took this turn which was that Chris\nDecided that he'd always talked about wanting to make a profit with the New Republic and he suddenly decided that he didn't want to lose at least not lose a whole lot of money with it and so we had to turn around our financial position incredibly quickly and so\nHe insisted that we start chasing cliques in two thousand Thirteen the shore is way to get clicks was supposed to clip from last night's Daily Show with John Stewart and you slap a headline on it and you may be right back a couple of sentences about it and everybody would click on it\nAnd you got caught up in at least monitoring the numbers right\nYes I did um look data is crack cocaine and then if you're the guy who had a hard time getting a date in high school to suddenly find yourself producing things that are extremely popular\nYou become obsessed with replicating that popularity in ... in some ways everybody in the magazine wanted to be successful on Facebook we wanted to master social media and this new environment but we didn't want that new environment to dictate how we did our jobs\nAll right so we should say that you ended up getting will you ended up quitting as you were about to be fired from the New Republic\n[laughter] yeah so um you know I I took the brave decision to resign when I learned that there was some guy who already had my job and was offering other people jobs at the New Republic\nIt's funny you're describing what was happening to you at the New Republic but it sounds as though you're also perhaps describing\nYour view of what happened at places like Google and Facebook over time where you may begin with a certain set of motivations but as those motivations lead you to this overwhelming commercial success you're so seduced by the magnitude of that success that you can't help but want to
