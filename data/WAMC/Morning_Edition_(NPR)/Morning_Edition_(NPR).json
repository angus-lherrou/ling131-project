Winston was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to have answers but then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred

doesn't add up ... says the customary charged for this test is thirty five dollars that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nOr just do the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patients being left with to pay out of pocket so the math still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she did that down to Fifteen hundred ... put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw him on a grand embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases and that grand piano\nWinston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'd be worth it for a lobby the fitting five star hotel maybe not\nOr that reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive to Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for a partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby a buck forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise and you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place\nTo live well no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think well the allergy test\nOh how could expense who could it be a thousand bucks but here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert in the ...\nStreaming

compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think well the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain\nTo say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per

yesterday after the retired army captain failed to victory in yesterday's runoff election who will take office on the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy\nAnd let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and\nThey ... for the restoration of national pride I think that it helps explain why both not defeated the workers' party candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively\nI should say the most amount of himself insist the survival dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted\nAnd afterwards he read out part of the constitution to reporters\nAbout the need for the future presidents who respects to judge had to remind him and and people that people really do about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which this is a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's essentially issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes oh they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent and on corrupt\nFor example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not at home and\nHe's really on that's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe that I think he really but\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said does he have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready\nPeople hit David are sick of robberies and the sky high ... yet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is a sprawling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... power a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are especially the poor people than minority\nOkay so both

story\nEver since hurricane Michael hit the Florida Panhandle survivors have been trying to get in touch with their families for some it's been a real struggle cell phone signals went down after the storm hit last Wednesday and stayed down from many customers\nHorizon in particular had lingering outages Florida State official called the company out for lagging behind competitors after days of complaints new numbers on Wednesday showed just over half the cell towers near Panama City Florida we're functioning\nThere's no doubt run a more positive track\nMatthew Berry is chief of staff at the Federal Communications commission the agency criticized the slow pace of progress earlier this week\nBut we need to keep the attention on this problem and keep the pressure on because there's still a ways to go when we can't have any backsliding in the next few days\nRestoring cell service is always a problem after a big storm the absence of a signal means people outside the storm's path or left worrying about loved ones they can't reach well residents have trouble contacting local authorities and their insurance companies\nThe FCC says it usually takes a few days to approach full coverage after Hurricane Sandy it took about a week after Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico it took six months an extreme situation\nThe problem with hurricane Michael is that several days after the storm the FCC was noticing only marginal progress in the most devastated areas\nWe don't disagree that this is an unacceptable situation\nKrista born is rising market president for wireless in the south she says for rising slow recovery from this storm was uncharacteristic and unprecedented horizon biggest problem is not cell towers but the fiber optic cables that run to those towers\nThe storm passed just happened to go right in\nA critical area where the fiber was late and it's just an incredible amount of ...\nAnd it's not just damage from the initial storm as clean up is under wave rising as having

United states it hurts the Saudi Arabia\nI'm frankly at this point more than that hurts the United states because we have found ways to become less dependent on Saudi oil than we were in the past\nUm and and I would also argue that we need to look at the broader scope of the trend line of arms sales to Saudi Arabia um we're selling Saudi Arabia um it's a much more arms today than we were ten years ago or ... and so what I'm suggesting is that we just returned to a level of\nArms sales to military relationship that looks much more like it did\nA a decade ago um there has been a big increase\nThe

single one at the time it was seen as a gaffe many Democrats were trying to distance themselves from Obama approval rating at the time within the low forties Trump's approval is in a similar spot now again Abramowitz\nYou're probably going to combat through at risk of losing their seats were probably rather localized election traumatic more about local issues about things they've done for their

S. much of the country's retirement plans\nAre invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy at say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is editor weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\n[noise] well what's interesting here Noel is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that\nThe u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nStarted doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like this the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these terrorists that President Trump has imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a kind of I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chain to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U.S China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost\nNPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks up ...\nTo a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change Silicon Valley\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no ... no ...

comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting end to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNow the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy\nBecause he's a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of silicon valley's big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it's just there's a quick and easy solution that things that fix climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute\nBecause it before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things\nAnd these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nBecause as watching could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees the company's planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mocking a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially Ken kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place that solutions that are actually more important to
