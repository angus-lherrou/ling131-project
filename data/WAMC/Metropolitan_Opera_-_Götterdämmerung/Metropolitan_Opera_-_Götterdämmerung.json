representatives\nThat we have NPR's Dominican to narrow Tim Mak an Danielle Kurtzleben in the studio everybody hey so let's start with the fact that historically and given some of the big picture trends Democrats really do have to wind up their backs let's walk through why exactly that is\nWhen president during their first midterms they lose a heck of a lot of seats on average is just as a matter of and we've heard President Trump actually posit publicly why that is\nNot a good job wise [noise]\nIn some of it has to do with frankly with the fact that people got their guy over the line they got their president and then they sort of a back off and the willingness perhaps the content that settles in and the people who are most motivated or the people who are most upset with the policies of the new president is putting in place\nFun facts on that so Gallup crunched the numbers a little bit earlier this year and they found that when the president's approval rating going into the midterms is below fifty percent and Trump's according to our latest poll is thirty nine percent\nThe president's party averages a loss of thirty seven seats in the house which by the way Democrats need fewer than that in order to take the house so when the president has approval of over fifty percent his party tend to lose only fourteen ... still a lot but not nearly as huge\nAnd Johnny A voter suppression or who can and can't vote has become a huge issue in this race especially as early voting has begun why is that\nKevin Abrams has sparred over voting for years and it's getting more and more attention as the election comes closer more specifically one issue that drawing a lot of controversy is these voter registration applications that have been held up because the information on them doesn't exactly match other government databases\nAnd the registrations that have been held up in that list there's a disproportionate number of people of color\nAnd this has drawn a federal lawsuit a camp says it's all blown out of proportion that it's just a move to excite the Democratic base and he actually points the finger at Stacey Abrams end of the group that she founded called the New Georgia project which has done a lot of voter registration he says that her group is responsible for these messed up applications\nThere are on the list definitely some fakes or some errors like people named Jesus Christ that live on ... street as complex to point out\nBut the issue has really persisted for a long time it continued to be a source of debate in the race\nLet's talk about the issues for a little bit what are the voters that you're talking to focusing on\nHealth care and education are really big in the race and and jobs although Georgia's economy has been doing pretty well and the current Republican governor Nathan Deal is pretty ...\nKaren education are really big in the race and and jobs although Georgia's economy has been doing pretty well and the current Republican governor Nathan Deal is pretty popular\nRace has been an issue in this race or maybe not\nTotally at the forefront but very close ah there was a report pretty recently that looked back in the archives and found that Abrams participated in a a flag burning of the Georgia flag back in the nineties that at the time that the Georgia fly had the Confederate flag on it as well\nTwenty six years ago as a college freshman I along with many other Georgians including the governor of Georgia were deeply disturbed by the racial ... that was embedded in the state flag without Confederate symbol\nAnd eventually that Confederate symbol was removed and she pointed out that the governor at the time was actually pushing for the Confederate symbols to be removed as well\nThe ... this is one of the top tier national races this year a lot of people paying attention to it a lot of a likely democratic candidate for president two years have made a point of going to Georgia to campaign for Stacey Abrams what is it about this governor's race that's getting so much attention given all the other races going on all across the country\nWell Georgia is one of the state that has been traditionally Republican but there have been sign that it could be moving away from that certainly the demographics suggest that it could be a more of a center right state\nJohnny you've been covering this race since the beginning less than two weeks left what are you thinking about are looking for the final days of this race\nMy big question right now is how well is Abrams reaching and communicating to voters who may not be as engaged and don't usually vote in these midterm elections\nAbrams has gotten a lot of attention in the national media the fact that she would be the first African American female governor is a big deal but ... has done a really good job of labeling her in a simple way that she just too extreme for George eight\nStates have room to be spending tax rating liberal she kind of extreme [noise] even campaign\nIt's clear and concise people can understand what he's getting out there Abrams I'm not sure has done the same with camp and so my big question is you know Abrams talks a lot about her policy proposal she's very smart\nBut how well does that reach people in Georgia and maybe a more rural parts of the state that don't have access to as much education or resources are they going to be motivated in the same way that maybe they were for President Obama back in two thousand eight\nAnd people compare this election to like the Obama wave that that ah Abrams needs to inspire voters and the same way that Obama did in two thousand ... Obama did not win Georgia in two thousand and he lost by about two hundred thousand votes so that's a huge hill that Abrams hello to climb if she's going to win this race\nOr we will have answers to all those questions in less than two weeks That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro as well as Johnny Kauffman of W.

weekend through the mid term elections to guide you through everything you need to know what the elections disclose people are focusing\nOn the whole to try to get a sense of what might happen on election day just about a week from ... showing Gillum was one point lead well within the margin of error real clear politics however has\nIt at a dead heat and the president's poll numbers are going out running neck and neck is this the race to watch on election night the new NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll confirms enthusiasm is high for both Republicans and Democrats and if you weren't sure already confirmed this\nThis election is all about president Donald Trump\nAnd you know I like to look at it falls only when we're winning I don't like them otherwise\nJoining me now to talk through this with NPR's Dominican to narrow and Danielle Kurtzleben either hey All right\nSo about a month ago we had to pull out and it got a lot of national attention because it showed a lot of good news for Republicans this new polls this time around looks like Democrats are going to be happier people reading it\nWell it looks like essentially that the Kevin confirmation fight and all that it did to fire up Republican has kind of faded to be perfectly honest or it looks like we've returned to the fundamentals and that's something I've been hearing from Republicans quite a bit when you look at the landscape for the house races for example\nThe vast majority of those races are being run in places that Republicans hold seats and that has not changed\nLet's get to the pool and the numbers a Dominican what are the biggest takeaways for you looking at this point\nThe big thing is that President Trump is seen as the biggest factor in people's vote and really the numbers are kind of remarkable even when you put them in historical context two thirds of people say that Trump is either a major or minor factor in deciding their vote in less than two weeks on November ...\nCompare that to twenty fourteen when Republicans took back the Senate\nJust forty seven percent of Americans said that Iraq Obama was a factor in their vote\nAs a twenty point jump that's a big deal and more people this time around and say that they're motivated to go vote for a Democrat because of their impressions of President Trump than in twenty fourteen when people said that their impressions of President Obama made them want to go vote for\nA Republican so I mean President Trump is campaigning saying of voters if I'm On the ballot you know this is about me get trying to get his supporters to the polls but this result shows that this is a negative\nIt depends on who you're talking to you though right I mean people in either party Democrats and Republicans once again already in their corner Trump may be affecting their vote off and he is\nAnd you know for Democrats makes them less likely to vote for Republican more likely to vote for a Democrat for Republicans vice versa interestingly in this poll the independence or where you see the interesting gender gap\nMore likely to vote for a Democrat for Republicans vice versa interestingly in this poll the independence or where you see the interesting gender gaps on this for example when you ask independent voters\nHow important is Trump to your vote you have fifty percent of independent women saying he is very important compared to twenty eight percent of independent men that's a bigger divide then you see among Republicans or Democrats likewise when they say okay so how's Trump going to affect your vote\nFifty percent of independent women say more likely to make the vote for Democrats thirty three percent of independent men say that\nSo when we talk about gender divide and this is important that here\nYes women are a driving factor we do have the potential to hear across the board for there to be a bigger gender gap in this year's midterm are as big of a gender gap as we've seen in a very long time but that said it's not just about gender it's also about party democratic ... democratic win and I'll like this like Trump and are going to vote Democrat\nYeah I mean when Daniel talks that independence they really are an important factor here and that's because President Trump has really done very little to reach beyond the base with a lot of what he's talked about and the gamble here among Republicans in a lot of Republicans I talked to was they said look independents young voters Latino\nA new data from the Centers for Disease Control show the numbers are not\nThousands of reviews at my dog Curtis dot com\nAnd that's at least one hopeful story this week we're talking about how this was the the rare period where where both parties are on the same page but that doesn't mean there hasn't been any criticism right that's right and there was a lot of disagreement in the process of putting this together people saying look what we need here as a tobacco up and take a much more holistic approach to the entire question but just\nDitching together all these different programs are kind of pastiche of good intentions are that's ultimately not going to be good enough and that that may well be true some people say there needs to be a great deal more money\nPut into all of these programs that it's really just a drop in the bucket against the size of the problem as we've seen but here again the consensus in the end was let's pass what we can let's put as many dollars in as we can\nIf we can only agree on that stitched together patchwork programs let's at least do that that is NPR's Ron

each week we focus on one issue on voters' minds health insurance reform becomes law racism\n[noise] health care for my first day I'm going to ask God to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare [noise]\nWith the Democrat has to be Affordable Care act Republicans found one of their best talking points they used it again and again we're going to unify because we all every Republican ran on repealing\nAnd replacing it we're going to keep our promises that goal\nThey used it again and again we're going to unify because we all every Republican ran on repealing and replacing and we're going to keep our promises\nThat does seem within reach when Republicans gained control of the White House in addition to the house and Senate but\nThe Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act how fast harsher a tale of Obamacare failed by a single vote early today\nAfter seven years of promises to repeal and replace Obamacare it came down to just one vote the final vote forty nine to fifty one\nNow is the Democrats who feel like health care is an advantage for them Democrats have talked about health care all election and the polls indicate that voters want to hear about it\nThat has Republicans on defense and we're going to talk about all of this with NPR's Scott Horsley Danielle Kurtzleben guys hey Hi so let's take a few minutes here to talk about health care because all year we've been talking about how Democrats the healthcare as their best\nIssue with voters which is so striking because from twenty ten on after Obamacare passed Democrats were really on defence when it came to health care and they lost a lot of seats because of it so let's start with this how are people feeling about the state of health care right now\nI Would say concerned fair minimum but if you're a Democrat you're much more worry I mean one thing we do know I can tell you from being on the trail and from polling data is that\nBoth Republicans and Democrats are worried about the healthcare system worried about access worried about costs but Democrats are much more worried and this is reflected in what voters tell you and it's reflected in ads Democrats have just been running more health care ad throughout the entire midterm cycle then Republicans have\nDetermined to fight for affordable accessible health care and not take it away\nLike three hundred thousand North Dakota and he has a preexisting condition that used to mean no health insurance now the retina match with Morsi's losses to take away health here from people with preexisting conditions\nAnd what Democrats are targeting is the assault that Republicans have waged a over the last two years on the Affordable CARE Act Republicans of course campaign saying they wanted to repeal and replace the Affordable CARE Act they weren't able to do that thanks to John McCain's thumbs down in the Senate\nBut the Trump Administration has been steadily wiggling away at the Affordable CARE Act for the last going on two years\nAnd it's worth pausing for a moment and walking through all the different ways the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have had tried to undermine the Affordable CARE Act or have tried to replace the Affordable CARE Act because a lot of the ad\nComes down to you voted to do this and Republicans are responding no I didn't so let's start with action taken by the Trump Administration\nGot what are some of the biggest things that President Trump has done on his own to affect the Affordable CARE Act\nThey have offered up a variety of alternative insurance plans mostly sort of skimpy your plans that would be cheaper and might appeal to younger healthier people a book could also have the effect of raising prices for older sicker people\nThey have done away with the marketing budget to try to encourage enrollment in the Affordable care act's a healthcare marketplace is\nThey have ended subsidies for insurance companies which has had the effect of driving up premiums on the a C a marketplaces and then Congress as part of their tax overhaul did away with the tax penalty for people who don't have insurance so all this sort of\nBeen an attack on the a C a insurance marketplace which despite all that has proven to be pretty resilient a sign up so stay pretty level since before the Trump Administration came in\nAnd the most recent census data says we still have a about Ninety One percent of the American public covered by health insurance\nDanielle of course most of twenty Seventeen was folks\nYou still have a about Ninety One percent of the American public covered by health insurance\nDanielle of course most of twenty Seventeen was focused on Republican attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare they ultimately failed but what should we know about what was in those bills how the house bill that passed and how the Senate build it didn't pass because of John McCain would have changed Obamacare\nOne of the biggest things that's most salient in this election cycle is what that built the bills would have done to pre existing conditions this is what Democrats are attacking Republicans on and so many of these ads saying that\nRepresentative so and so voted for the Obamacare repeal and replace bill that bill would have done away with your protection for pre existing conditions and Scott Republicans running for reelection are defending themselves from these attacks\nIn an interesting way basically saying how dare you insinuate I don't care about people with preexisting conditions\nThat's right but it's interesting that Republicans are on the defensive here this is really the mirror image of what we've seen in the past few election cycles when Republicans were on the attack going after the Affordable CARE Act\nPromising to repeal Obamacare and Democrats were largely staying quiet they knew that the Ford will crack wasn't terribly popular at that point\nNow we have voters saying well they might not love Obamacare writ large they do like various provisions of it and you've got Democrats running about half their ads defending those provisions moving the GOP on the defensive\nWhen you look at television ads when you compare pro Democrat to pro Republican that were put out this year how democratic ad yes like Scott said more than half of them have been about health care this is according to the Wesleyan Media project which tracks these things here to tell them building Democrats field is here that's compared to\nFrom twenty ten twenty twelve twenty fourteen twenty sixteen in those years roughly seven to ten percent of democratic ads are about healthcare Democrats did not want to touch healthcare during that time now this year they are all about it\nAt the same time we have a group of Republican attorneys general who have gone to court in Texas to try to strike down the Affordable CARE Act\nTwo of those state attorneys general happened to be running for Senate one in Missouri and one in West Virginia Josh Hawley the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri has been running ads saying oh I definitely would protect\nPeople with preexisting medical conditions even though he's gone to court to unwind exactly that protection in the Affordable CARE Act\nEarlier this year we learned our oldest has a rare chronic disease preexisting conditions we know what that's like ... I support forcing insurance companies to cover all pre existing conditions\nSupport comes from the New York state health department reminding overseas travelers they're a measles outbreaks in many parts of the world including Europe\nVaccines that should be updated before traveling health dot and why that G.

have hurt other colleagues from NPR on the road this week like them we spent the week traveling and talking with people about the mid term elections ... ten days away now visiting pivotal states and counties\nWe decided to come here because Pennsylvania the Keystone State went for President Trump and two thousand sixteen breaking a winning streak for Democrats that stretch back to Nineteen eighty eight\nAnd Pennsylvania was supposed to be part of that and blue wall from Pennsylvania to Michigan to its content that Democrats thought what secure the White House for them and all of the states went for Trump on election night\nNow though Democrats are banking on a comeback here in Pennsylvania in their quest to retake the house\nSo we've been talking with candidates business owners students working folk people we found because they are really into politics and people who are really not\nAnd we've been asking all of them what to and they're on what's on their minds this election year had help us understand what we've been hearing we asked WHYY Dave Davies to join us he's covered politics in this region for more than Thirty years and he's with us now and thank you so much for hosting us and\nThanks to all the people who offered a pumpkin bread and cookie insider which we were not expecting so thank you for that is great to have you all so nationally they've Democrats need to take back twenty four seats to win the house and now let's say they could pick up a quarter of those seats give or take in Pennsylvania and a lot of that has to do\nWith a new congressional map here in the state can you just tell us how that came about and what that has meant to this election\nYeah this is a seismic shift in the politics of estate mean for the last six years Pennsylvania's have had congressional maps\nThat were pretty bizarrely shape and generally acknowledged to be a gerrymandered if even favor Republicans we have eight hundred thousand more registered Democrats than Republicans in Pennsylvania Democrats have only one five of Eighteen seats\nThis will challenge last year and a lawsuit that was aimed not in federal court where some of these gerrymandering suits have stalled but at state court\nAnd in Pennsylvania the state's Supreme Court five of them elected Democrats not only ruled the map and unconstitutional gerrymandered and ordered new districts but said it had to happen immediately for this election and it created some confusion and controversy but it really opened up opportunities for Democrats\nAre they're big themes playing out in congressional races across the state and I asked because we've been watching the ads all week and I get the sense that both major parties are trying to push specific theme in these racist or do you see that\nSure sure I mean for the Democrats they're telling people that Republicans are tools of corporations and and the wealthy who will strip away protections for people with preexisting medical conditions are up the Democrats or Republicans are casting the Democrats as friends of Nancy Pelosi they can't say that name off\nWho will spending recklessly raise your taxes and a lot of it is you know she'll just character assassination if you have ever missed the tax bill if you have done or said anything controversial it will be exaggerated an amplified on television and hopes to to undermine you\nWell one of the races that we've been focusing on this week is the first district in Pennsylvania it has attracted an enormous amount of national attention it's drawn huge amounts of money it's been one of the most expensive campaign in the country and a lot of that has to do with the fact that it's one of the twenty three districts that went for Hillary Clinton it two thousand sixteen but\nWas also carried by a Republican congressman in this case Brian Fitzpatrick he's being challenged by a millionaire philanthropists name Scott Wallace who's never run for office before and he poured millions of dollars of his own money into his campaign and I asked him why\nBecause it's an extraordinary are not just the policies that are being\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my

never encountered at a time like this and I just couldn't sit on the sidelines anymore\nWhen do you think the campaign here hinges upon it you know I was watching a lot of the ads last night and\nAll very negative [laughter] what do you think is the ledge fan of it here the on a specific level the big issues here our health care and clean air and clean water we have local issues with water pollution from a military base and air pollution but the overarching issue that\nTies all of us together as money in politics\nMy opponent has taken a million dollars in corporate tax money I refuse to take a dime he's got seven and a half million dollars in superPAC contributions a huge amount of corporate money in this\nAnd I think people are fed up with that because that's what is blocking the people's business from getting done and you think people are noticing that when I explain this is why you're not getting\nClean air and clean water when you want reform of Wall Street predatory lending when you want gun control the amount of money that\nFlows in from the big corporate special interests stops every single thing that the people want you know frankly the situation with money in politics is outrageous\nThe amount of money it takes to run in the district like this in a suburban district ... expensive media market like Philadelphia is ridiculous nobody can raise Fifteen million dollars without going to the corporations and begging them and of course their money comes with expectations comes with strings attached\nAnd so that's how the candidate votes\nSo yes I Am blessed to be able to do some self funding here I don't know how anybody could unless they take corporate money so we have to fix that system you know the largest voting bloc in America that understand this problem is the people who don't vote at all\nThey are not crazy when they think that their vote their voices going to be drowned out by the voice of the big special interests how big a factor as President Trump in\nYour campaign it is huge I mean I don't bring him up when I go door to door but people blurt out that they want change they cannot stand the tone coming from Washington even Republicans not that they want to throw him overboard but they just hate the tone\nSo he's not on the ballot but is he on the ballot in a way I mean do you see your campaign in a way or this election as in a in part a referendum\nOn Donald Trump it is becoming and largely through his own urging\nHe goes around the country singer vote for blank vote for me he is saying this is essentially a presidential election and of course interest is much higher on the president's election and the reality is this is the first chance to voters in this district in everywhere in the country have to express their feelings about what they're seeing\nAnd the last thing I think anybody wants to see is Trump doing a victory lap around the rose garden on November seventh\nSo let me see babies let me

more hello Brian ...\nFirst of all what can you tell us about the gunman at this point [noise]\nUh well we don't know a whole lot about 'em at this point he's been identified a as Robert Bowers of Pittsburgh resident or in terms of how this investigation is going to look the special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Pittsburgh a man by the name of Bob Jones laid out a bit of that today or here's what he had to say about how this was going to move forward\nAnd over the next several days and weeks we look at everything in the suspect's life is home his vehicle to social media and his movements over the last several days\nAre Jones says officers recovered an assault rifle and three hand guns at the scene a when a agents are going to search is home they say that they'll take precautions that case there might be any sort of explosive devices there\nHe says the FBI does not believe at this point or the suspect had any accomplices or he was not known to law enforcement for today says uh and he also says that the suspects full mode of at this point is unknown but then of course is something that the FBI is going to work\nNot known to law enforcement for today's says uh and he also says that the suspects full motive at this point is unknown but then of course is something that the FBI is going to work to find out\nWhat the president has called it's an anti Semitic act and authorities say that they are looking at it as a hate crime investigation what does that mean and what does that tell us\nWell first off yes attorney general Jeff Sessions has said in a statement that the Justice Department will file a hate crime a hate crimes and other criminal charges in this case he says that there's no place for hatred and violence on the base of basis of religion\nOr the U.S attorney for the western district to Pennsylvania Scott Brady he says that prosecutors could file those charges as early as this evening but we're gonna have to wait and see what all those sort of charges are going to entail\nThey could just tell us a bit more about what hate crime charges would mean\nRight and in some cases a federal hate crime charges would bring a stiffer sentence or to take into account that particular nature of of the crime in a case like this a a former federal prosecutor tells me that it likely wouldn't change that much\nBecause this sort of crime with eleven people killed or that the sentence is likely to be significant anyways but federal hate crimes could bring into play a possibly the death penalty Pennsylvania does have a state death penalty although it hasn't been used and in quite some time", "show_name": "Metropolitan Opera - G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung", "year": "2018", "city": "Albany", "day": "27", "locations": [["Albany New

color or need your help we will never backed down by and if we buy\nEvery week we focus on one race in the country that speaks to a larger theme playing out in races all across the country and this week we're looking at the Florida Senate rent ... with us as well as the ... and diminished go walk us through\nWhat race we're talking about so we're looking at the Florida Senate race here where Democrat Bill Nelson who's a three term democratic senator and former representative he's been there a long time and he's trying to hang onto his seat he's running against Rick Scott who's term limited as governor and served two terms in Florida\n... what have you been seeing in terms of both poles and and what you saw reporting there this week\nIs it really is really tight I think it's largely because of the opponent that Bill Nelson the singing and Rick Scott\nAnd I had multiple Democrats tell me\nYou know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this is the guy is running a masterful campaign huh in terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman can yes wise I actually had met her before during the twenty sixteen campaign she adamantly doesn't like Trump\nHe told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor\nBut you know she she sort of has had this little bit of an evolution on Rick Scott here's what she told me about him initially\nLet me be very honest with you at risk up in the beginning the his governor for re electing\nSo she did not like him she says that she just didn't think that he was necessarily going to be good for the state based and everything that she had heard she refers to herself as a Democrat but she's had to change in major part she says\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu actually\nLet me the many honest with you at risk up in the beginning the his governor for electing\nSo she did not like him she says that she just didn't think that he was necessarily going to be good for the state based and everything that you've heard she refers to herself as a Democrat but she's at a change of heart in major part she says because she's Puerto Rican and she's seen how many times he has gone down to visit Puerto Rico after the hurricane ...\nHe's showing me he's working from ... to his show me what he'd do\nAn awesome it can you step back and remind us how critical the Puerto Rican vote is in Florida\nYeah it's still an active it's will tell me there are over a million Puerto Rican voters in Florida now and the population has really grown and in part it's actually grown wild bill Nelson has been a member of Congress and to some folks within the Democratic party who have been a little bit critical of bill Nelson's visibility within the community\nHave said hey look maybe he doesn't fully understand the magnitude\nOf this community power within the electorate\nYou know when you talk about the Puerto Rican community Rick Scott\nYou know she broke very quickly a right away with President Trump after Hurricane Maria and after President Trump said that the numbers that came out about how many people died in Puerto Rico we're wrong and he said that he stood with the people of Puerto Rico and like you noted has been there a number of times\nSo this was a close race Nelson and Scott held their first head to head debate this week ... you were there what did you see\nYeah and and the debate as you point out was being hosted by the local tell them when does dish and it was broadcast in Spanish which you know to what we've been seeing sort of speaks to the significance of the Latino electorate there there were a couple of major issues that came up health care came up time and time again and we've seen this you know in in states across the country\nBill Nelson really hit Rick Scott specifically on the fact that while being governor he did not expand Medicaid and that that has actually affected a number of Floridians the other issue that came up a lot was immigration and Bill Nelson basically accuses Rick Scott as being the hardliners on immigration\nYou know on the other side Rick Scott is saying that the bill nothing really just wants to have open borders\n... one of the big themes of of race or the week is that these races aren't happening in a vacuum the similar trends but similar voters throughout the country that's really the case here in Florida as well because this is not the only statewide race and and we've seen that that other races are having an impact on the center it absolutely\nIn fact I had one Republican operative tell me that one of the big reasons why you're seeing Nelson suddenly very narrowly lead in the polls or he's lead in last for ... for example very very narrowly in within the margin of error but that's a shift\nThe reason for that they said of the energy in the governor's race being on the side of Democrat Andrew Gillum he said that if this is an election about energy that's where the energy is and it was killing at the top of the ticket they said that's something that could carry Nelson over the finish line\nOr an incentive to Florida I think we can be pretty confident that are probably stay a narrow race between now and election day this is one of the most fifty fifty a fifty fifty states across the country or the medical mountain are Oh thanks so much You're welcome an alcoholic thank you

politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow it feels like every week there's always one major story that dominates the news so each week we take a few minutes to talk about some of the stories you might've missed in to do that we always have Ron Elving Iran to be with you got some of the things we're going to talk about what\nIs in big deals and other weeks but this week just no room for anything but Brett Kavanaugh\nSo let's start with this in the middle of all of this partisanship and toxicity in the capital\nThey actually got a lot done that's right the Congress passed an authorization bill for the Federal Aviation administration for the first time since twenty twelve he's got a lot of money in it to run that agency and all of its functions\nBut we'll concerned consumers most is the focus on passenger complaints for example cramped seats the width of the seats and the leg room\nFAA now has authority to set a minimum coverage is giving a bigger seats in Congress has not yet given you a bigger seat neither has the FAA but they now have the authority and the direction the policy direction from Congress\nTo do that also uh to ban cell phone talking in flight on all flights you might have thought it was but there are some airlines that allow it and ditto for the cigarettes you might not have thought they were allowed but they haven't been covered previously in terms of the ban on smoking All right and another big thing that happened\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nNow have the authority and the direction the policy direction from Congress do do that also to ban cell phone talking in flight on all flights you might have thought it was but there are some airlines that allow it and ditto for the cigarettes you might not have thought they were allowed but they hadn't been covered previously in terms of the ban on smoking\nAll right and another big thing that happened this week one one of the topics that have just dominated the Congress has bipartisan concern about the opioid epidemic in how to deal with it that that got done to this week\nPerhaps the main thrust of the bill Scott as a renewed effort to stop the shipping of synthetic opioids things like ... there were twenty thousand deaths from a ... a related overdoses\nI just a couple of years ago and to prevent the introduction offend no would really be a big big difference so the post office has new authority the government's going to really make this a priority they're also going to lengthen the support period for Medicaid patients eligible for treatment\nAnd they'll broaden eligibility for all substance abuse for those treatment programs\nAnd also there's going to be more money and more emphasis on research to find a non addictive painkiller\nOkay shifting gears this week the state department announced a new policy starting this month diplomats who wants to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married\nThat's right they'll have to be legally married to qualify for that second base so that's a change in policy that had been in place since two thousand nine because you see the same sex marriage is legal in less than ten percent of the countries that send them passengers and diplomats to the United nations so\nThose people the people who work for the United nations are going to account for roughly half the couples that the state department estimates will be affected\nSo the state department says this is about treating everybody the same if you're a heterosexual couple right now you can't get a visa for the second person without being married so this is intended to level the playing field of course the differences you can get a heterosexual marriage and just about any country in the world\nBut and fewer than ... percent of the United nations countries is that\nPossible so is there a plan for for people who live in a country without same sex marriage or can you just not bring your partner they're going to be exemptions for certain kinds of diplomatic personnel but that would not appear to apply to most of the United nations personnel so that's where it's really going to be felt\nAround That's NPR's Ron Elving catching us up on some of the news we missed this week as

was there that happened in our lives I miss it I didn't appreciate what a good thing it was when we had it\nI don't know about you but me I spent a full week obsessively reading about judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss it and I know this is just daily life and are totally divide the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years where\nRed America and blue America look at the exact same event and come to radically different conclusions\nAnd to me this one field the worst I think because he originally hearing itself with Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh testimony was just so wow like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so\nEmotionally wrong that even watching it was emotional it was upsetting [noise]\nAnd then since that hearing we've had this week of waiting for the FBI report which held us all for a week in that same state patch patient in disbelief\nRepublican disbelief or the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans [noise]\nBut even in moments like this one\nThere are people who haven't picked aside\nAn incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide I mean I had to cast a vote in the United States Senate\nAnd it does not seem fun for them\nToday and I shall we have somebody in that situation in our\nFirst act Arizona Senator Jeff flake

people having to make these huge decisions\nThey are not comfortable with hall [noise] that'd be the easy Chicago it's this American Life America stay with us [laughter]\n[noise] one\nTo Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drama on Capitol Hill this last week turned on the TV and you'd see a tortured face\nHe dragged his decisions down to the wire over and over he was undecided than seem like a no on Kevin up there was a yes that was let's wait a week is Jeff Flake who made the Senate wait for new FBI investigation then he was a yes again\nA British as though he chases spent a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode you did recording him for months that he tried to pass some kind of Taco Bell and she was with him in the days before and after the Kavanaugh hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how he made his choices there's always the first thing I Want to talk about the uh\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nBecause two women accosted him on an elevator\nNear to tell you that's not a true story it's not what changed his mind [noise]\nI Would there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at flake peering out from the elevator\nHe just stood me up for an interview just leaks fees can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune\nIn this case though I think he was miserable he just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters around the corner to get the elevator to get to the boat\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flick and declared that he would be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination was confronted by a mob of screening protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake crumbled\n... was one of the two women and that confrontation that her play good morning good morning when the elevator dorm close to with Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n[noise]\nEr ... and Maria Gallagher and the other one that the elevator the always hedge how influential they were the lots of others don't

[noise] lots of people loved his version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of these last two weeks has been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to see\nHere so I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff weeks to mind is not true\nFirst of all I saw him she had no when asked about it by other reporters\nInto the women and maybe this morning that they have any sort of your mind\nAlso we talked about it wasn't but I Do think there was a\nIt was a thing it's not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect him like that\nI've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers in for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them they're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories and sexual assault it's everywhere\nJust the day before ... and I got in an elevator on the other side of the building he's in the middle of the story about Lindsey Graham women jumped on the elevator with us they were being a hero to shirts and I believe women T shirt they were filming hand and calling out you believe women Senator Flake easily\nSupport what do you believe me when when you think you can replace what do you have to say something you can say that went in

to the doctor for it and judge Kavanaugh I'm not sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a day like this undecided both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not\nThe one time he spoke in the hearing he sounded just does ensure as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nIs not a good process but it's all we've got and I would just urge my colleagues to recognize that we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent\nAnd India and there's likely to be as much doubt a certainty going out of this room today\nAnd go and just have a little humility on that front section\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nThe night after the Ford Kavanaugh testimony Thursday night fleet stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assaults you talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said he found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night\nHe found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't it's off putting to him as they thought it might be in staff said they'd never seen him like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything\nA in a decision on a boat\nThat's been is just\nA debates staff discussions late last night too and\nIt was that oh it was pretty raw you know [noise]\nAnd next morning of course we finally released to the statement he's going to vote yes on the judge\nAfter seven days of being treated

reached Chris Coons that afternoon\n... you know look Jeff and I both went to the same place and read the same report 'em and you know I appreciate his friendship [noise] we are we are viewing this through a different lens a Jeff as a conservative senator has always wanted a conservative on the Supreme Court I Am not and I don't know\nWho started the FBI report was a disgrace basically didn't follow up on any leads he said we're not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI I'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as flake voted friday he fled the capital I talked to him in the car [noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am a presumption of innocence he told me over and over\nHe was satisfied with the FBI before do you feel better now you're kind of back among your people you had kind of a week with the ... you know

folks um is that fair\nIt is a totally fair assessment it's but this is a moment when this kind of story ought to be hurting when we need to think about it and that was the name Horton cog in this White House for nearly two years\nHe reportedly restrain President Trump a number of times when he was on the verge of a fire in various people including the attorney general Jeff Sessions and Robert Mueller the special counsel investigating Russian interference from the twenty sixteen election\nThat's a report that it's hard to confirm but this is clear McGahn orchestrated the selection process that led to two new Supreme Court justices that's Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and scores of other new federal judges at the trial court and appeals court levels all over the country\nAnd a lot of conservatives consider that to be President Trump's highest accomplishment\nIt take you back to one thing you just mentioned earlier and name there Robert Mueller um McGahn sat down with the Mueller team as part of their investigation isn't that right\nYes indeed he did and that was apparently condoned within the White House as part of a strategy to cooperate and wrap up the Mueller investigation or in a year if at all possible\nUh it's been reported that McGahn met with members of Mueller's team several times for a total of thirty hours now does that mean he's been defending trumped nonstop campaign all that time as a good loyal soldier and a veteran of twenty sixteen Trump campaign\nOr does it mean something else and we should mention here that are Emmett flood he has been\nHandling much of the solar met her and is reportedly taking a somewhat more confrontational approach to that as opposed to that cooperative arrangement that they were trying to pursue a year ago\nI Do want to ask you though about the job itself did Don McGahn represent the White House the the institution of the presidency what did he represent Donald Trump the man the president himself\nTradition says the White House counsel represents the White House the institution the presidency but\nIf he is not the president's personal attorney where does the person of the president stop in the office of the presidency begins\nAnd maybe that ambiguity which has really been with us for a very long time they created this office way back in the Nineteen forties maybe that ambiguity ... speaks the larger ambivalence that we've always felt about this grand office of the presidency of the United states\nVersus it's human inhabitants are we loyal to the institution and the tradition of the office or to the humans who have held the office where it is one in the other begin drawing that lunch never been easy but it's never been more important\nAlright well thank you so much that is NPR's Ron Elving

H. Y. Y.\nJoe thanks for joining us great to be here and we'll start with you can you just lay of the land start with the basic the who is running\nWell the Republican incumbent in this race is Tom MacArthur some might remember him because of this contentious town hall in May of last year where his constituents really grilled him about his authoring a key amendment to the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare\nAnd won support from House Republicans of course it didn't become law and we'll talk a little bit more about that\nHe's running against Andy Kim he had a string of national security roles in the Obama administration including serving as an Iraq expert at the state department and the Iraq director of national security council\nAnd Joe you been there on the ground in the district so touch with a little bit about what it's like\nWell both of the candidates have been really busy campaigning all across the district which is quite large we've also seen a lot of political star power in this district so\nMacArthur had a fundraiser with vice president Pence and former vice president Joe Biden has been stumping with Andy Kim\nThere's also been a lot of money flowing into the district Andy Kim took into point three million from donors in his bid to unseat MacArthur which is one million more than MacArthur has but because there is a wealthy former insurance executive so he can dump some of his own money into the race\nThat it took a little bit more detail about who lives in his district I mean it's a pretty wide geographic district right when you look at it on the map it kind of goes from the western to the eastern edge of New Jersey\nRight there really is a yin and yang to this district so it starts in the suburbs of Philadelphia kind of wealthier more democratic suburbs and then it stretches all the way to the Jersey shore and the Atlantic ocean which gets more Republican there are a lot of vets and seniors who live out\nThat way so it's a swing district it went for Obama twice and then it switched and voted for Trump in twenty sixteen\nTo the Republican and the rates MacArthur had a fairly easy time getting elected the past couple of times but it looks like the race is much much tighter than that I mean given equal talked with a little bit about why Democrats see this as a potentially vulnerable seats\nBut when you tell MacArthur you know really go all in on that repeal effort and this amendment that he put forward in a contentious town hall that went viral that suddenly gave Democrats an opening to be able to think okay let's put someone in place here who could have a chance and in a wave year this is the kind of see that\nGoes in general is that what you're hearing a lot undergrad from voters is about healthcare\nA lot of voters are talking about health care especially Democrats who are getting kind of jazz up behind Kim who's been attacked\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no joke no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog harness dot com\nJersey third congressional district is it's kind of playing out in a really intense way in part because MacArthur authored this amendment to the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act that really would have changed the current healthcare structure Joe can you walk us through what this MacArthur amendment was\nSure so it would have allowed states some flexibility MacArthur says in in in how it uh interpreted the law would have allowed states to opt out of parts of the law\nAnd Kim and Democrats have hit MacArthur because they said that it would allow insurance to stop covering people with preexisting conditions MacArthur disagrees where it actually falls is that insurers would have to cover people with preexisting conditions but they wouldn't necessarily have to cover treatment for those preexisting conditions\nYou know stepping back and looking at what's happening across the country healthcare has amazingly become the top issue that Democrats are running on across the country was a huge flip from twenty ten when Republicans were really using healthcare against Democrats Democrats this time around are using it\nIn their favor as the Affordable CARE Act has grown more popular in fact half of all ads in September that were run we're about health care and most of those were pro eight CIA and in New Jersey it's even more acute two thirds of all the ads that have been run in the month of September were\nHealthcare related that is really phenomenal and you're seeing Republicans all over the country now to talk about their support for maintaining preexisting conditions\nOr a line that we might not have heard say four years ago it's amazing to see Republicans on their back foot on the issue that got them in the house and the first place that

month\nTurkish investigators said he was killed inside the consulate and that his body was mutilated the new Saudi version of events that the journalists were killed after a fight broke out between him and unnamed people inside the consulate NPR's Peter Kenyon has more from Istanbul\nThe Saturday acknowledgement ... died inside the consulate did little to satisfy critics who say the kingdom is still trying to deflect blame away from crown prince Mohammed bin Salman they note that the Saudis took more than two weeks to confirm what Turkish investigators have been saying all along and didn't allow authorities to search diplomatic buildings pretend days\nOfficials have also said the theory that a brawl broke out doesn't fit with the evidence that the Saudi forensics expert was sent to Istanbul the same day 'cause showed you arrived at the consulate\nThere are also demanding that the Saudis produce the body President Trump said he found that Saturday account of what happened credible he also said the fight and accidental death is just a theory that's being thrown out and he doesn't want to use arms sales to the Saudis as retribution\nFor a hundred and fifty million

behave during a police traffic stop but first we want to tell you about another police encounter earlier this month that ended in tragedy\nOn October third according to the San Mateo county sheriff's office today to uh Kobe was observed walking in and out of traffic on a busy street in ... California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy\nAnd then he was taser several times Mr Kobe later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Coby it's Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story\nAnd she's with us now from London Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss\nThank you so much for having me now I I have to ask do you think that race with a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds on it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think that it has been shown that police officers\nAre able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered 'em who went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to arrest him without harming him um it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests for black men in particular versus arrest for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he had been described at six foot three and three hundred pounds of sort of those those are factual detail though aren't they I mean if you were to someone you wouldn't you described those things you\nMight not have ... do you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as deeply as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\nIt's been reported but your brother struggled with some mental health issues with that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that his mental health issues or a factor in that says well\nAbsolutely and I think here you see the impact of intersection holiday so he is at the intersection of being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think the ... and I think I Know statistics show and kind of between police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person has a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who clearly no mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who's just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public

Mateo county a sheriff's deputy she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us and our sympathies to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nAs we said earlier police conduct towards civilians particularly when someone dies had become a flashpoint in American Life that's happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she mistook it for her home and of course amplifying that is that the officer is white and a deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post there had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone at Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just gone into effect requiring that high school students in a state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nMe you know I don't like\nWhy are you

how did you come up with this idea frankly\nWe're having over epicenters of African Americans and Latinos that ended up in volatile confrontations with law enforcement or traffic stops and I guess for

about it in order to at least to fire the\nRight traditions citizens and police officers ship which last year is that people are picking the legislation just focus on citizens were gotcha doesn't just sort of video\nIs really a campus a stage for additional course content for both the citizen and also pollution police academies\nWhat will be expected of the police officers at the academy\nWhat we've done is to find the objectives of a what we want police officers to get while they're in the academy and the fact that the length of course is a minimum of two hours the video it was just a part of it's sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw at least the video aimed at the students to fix to appear to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose of the video is as a

the conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees that's produced to Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project\nAnd that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions we're talking about the Heritage Foundation a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group\nTargeting recent law school graduate who had secured clerk ships for federal judges\nIn exchange for participation and the all expense paid program these clerks were to keep the training secrets and sign something of a loyalty oath\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now I don't think so much for joining us from going to be here so what what's stated purpose of this program how was it advertised\nTo the program was a

may be nothing wrong with a seminar they may even be nothing wrong with it all expenses paid seminar\nBut there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learned secrets probably even from the judges that they were going to serve\nAnd something deeply problematic about having to make a promise that whatever they learn will be used for an open to quote now from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd dig into that like the the ethical concern here is what do you take it to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts kind of indoctrination a law clerk is a an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties ought to run to the judicial system into their judges", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Metropolitan Opera - G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung", "city": "Albany", "day": "20", "locations":

she's also the director of the advance certificate program and trauma and disaster mental health but at the school\nShe says the first responders in school Harry county many of whom are volunteers may not be ready to handle the trauma of the accident as opposed to perhaps in the state police and responders or larger urban areas who brings drama and multiple fatalities more often\nThis is definitely a population that I Would be concerned about and hope for getting the support that they need um you know people\nBecome volunteer firefighters or antifa because they think they can handle it because they have a high tolerance because they are strong and resilient but certainly anyone can reach a breaking point and I'm sure what they encountered\nAt the scene would be a breaking point for just about anyone um and there's also often with this population is often kind of an added level of\nGuilt because you know they're there to save people in when they're unable to do that even if that clearly would have been impossible that often kind of factors in as well um [noise]\nSo I think one of the real strengths much like military populations is there's often are all kinds of bonds among these groups um so they can rely on each other for support\nAnd it does sound like they're getting ... briefings and other kinds of a more professional support I think first of all the fact that their distress is being acknowledged that's a real step forward and the past they would have been expected to kind of\nYou know suck it up as part of the job so you know I think that's a positive thing that we are recognizing the traumatic impact on his populations\nAnd getting them help for it um and I think often that the you know kind of they've been through this incident together and they're often the best people to help each other recover but getting some professional mental health support and and stress coping and traumatic coping is definitely important as well\nThere was a vigil in the city of Amsterdam the other night there wasn't vigilant screw Erie County closer to the actual accident how do these vigils helping the healing process\nI think these events are so important and in a way it's especially important not for the people who were directly impacted but for those of us who maybe were part of the community or you know I think everyone when an event like this occurs we can find\nSome way of identifying with the people impacted we are the same age we know people the same age we have kids the same age we've gone on similar outings\nI'm ... and it's just important that we recognize that and you know when people have that kind of distress\nThey want they want to do something with it they want to come together as a community um so I think it's really an egg in a positive thing that these events are being held they give people a place to come together to something to do with those emotions um of course you know attending a vigil doesn't\nTake away the distress and it shouldn't but I think it's important that as human beings we mourn for people we don't even know just as we\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkeley Center for weight loss surgery with a focus

people a place to come together to something to do with those emotions um of course you know attending a vigil doesn't\nTake away the distress and it shouldn't but I think it's important that as human beings we mourn for people we don't even know just as we'd want strangers to mourn if the last ... hours and so these community gatherings are kind of a great way of kind of coming together and and showing that support even if we don't know the people directly impacted\nAs the investigation continues it's becoming more clear that this was something that probably could have been avoided man has been charged criminally negligent homicide there's a lot of indications weapons vehicles should not have been on the road that leads to anger in what happens with that anger to those infected\nAbsolutely that would involve anger I mean this event was so clearly preventable um I think you know there is something of a mild bright side and the fact that even though the driver was killed in the event as well and so it will never really know you know what\nHis responsibility was but the fact that the company operator has been arranged now and hopefully it's going to face punishment I think that may provide some comfort for some of the family members you know when something is human caused whether that's an intentional act of violence like a terrorist attack or shooting or in this case something more related to negligence\nJust want someone to blame and they want someone to punish and I think that's completely understandable um and often it's frustrating for them because\nEspecially in cases where say the perpetrator has died in the accident or the or the events and they can't get that kind of justice at least in the criminal system that we use this kind of unsatisfied need for people that's often very hard for them to overcome um [noise] I\nThink also we often see in these kinds of events than there are changes in policies and safety procedures and that can provide some comfort as well but of course none of those ... mile silver linings take away just awful distress of knowing this really shouldn't have happened and didn't need to happen\nThere's a word that's been used quite often in the past hundred Twenty years after an event like mad as closure can close your really ever be accomplished\nThank you very much for asking about closure um no I absolutely do not believe enclosure you know there's this expectation that people will go through the five stages of grief and then they'll achieve closure and the loss won't hurt any longer that\nIs just not the reality it's not the reality for more typical deaths due to you know illness in old age it is certainly not the reality for something this tragic and traumatic\nI'm a you know people certainly can go on with their lives\nThey can rebuild their lives but I often use the analogy of when you love someone when you're attached to someone\nIt's almost like you're two trees whose roots become intertwined with each other and when one of those trees dies it kind of leaves this gap the other cheek and go on living but it's never the same it's never you know you're never hold the way that you were before which is what closure implies\nSo I think people want to be looking for ways to\nMourn the losses and acknowledge the losses and thin rebuild their lives and that's incredibly complicated especially when you have these cases where there are multiple losses like this um there is another concept that I\nDo think is much more valid enclosure which is the idea of

these cases where there are multiple losses like this um [noise] there's another concept that I\nDo think is much more valid enclosure which is the idea of bereavement overload\nWhich is basically the concept of you know we're we're we're pretty good at dealing with individual losses as human beings because we have to be we don't have any other choice in life but when you have multiple losses like this um it just can be too much for someone to deal with it once and especially think about the fact that\nIn many of these cases for these families and these friends\nThe people that they would have turned to end coping with a single one of these deaths are not available because they've also died in the same event so not only are they dealing with multiple losses at once but they're doing that without the normal support system that they would turn to under more typical circumstances\nDr Carla from human is an associate professor in the psychology department at the state University of New

elections breaking down the major theme for seeing that\nI Need you to your friends your family your neighbors your\nWorkers and you did vote for Republicans\nThere are less than four weeks until election day and polls show voter enthusiasm is hot but of history as a guide most Americans won't vote in the mid term [noise] even when they're eligible one of the reasons why I haven't but it is because I feel that I'm always busy\nBeing away from home but also connected to the political system I don't believe that it actually affect us\nToday we're going to look at who isn't voting why they are and what would happen if they did to talk about all of this I'm joined by NPR's to medical mountain RO and off Mulholland hey guys hey there hey it is likely a lot of people but it is very likely a majority well not right\nAnd that's the whole thing is between presidential elections in mid term elections you have about a thirty percent drop off\nA between those two elections and that's why you hear the parties talking so much about kind of base politics things that really rough up their bases because they need to get the most activist people out to the polls because this whole other group of folks just don't go out to vote\nBut I'll smoke why aren't they voting\nThe it's complicated right like some of it is because they're apathetic they're too busy they don't feel like their vote matters if you like the system is rigged I mean I could go on and on it's like there's so many reasons but those are kind of some of the big ones I mean a big part of it also is\nThere are some people who actually are just obstructed from voting like they want to vote but they have registration problems or their name is kicked off the voting rolls\nBut I Would say for a lot of people it does come down to both a combination of\nNot feeling like their vote matters but also not really\nCaring too much about the fact that they feel like they have the power to change anything\nEvery mid term we see the same pattern emerge and also I'm Wondering are I think we have a pretty good sense of who these people are wonder if you can lay it out for\nThe audience to share sure I mean so the one big group I feel like we constantly hear pundit talking about our our young people and um you know this has sort of historically been a problem it's even an issue when you look at presidential election years and I spent some time in a congressional district a right around the Las Vegas strip\nAnd why it went there in particular was it had one of the worst estimated voter turnout rate for young people in the entire country and twenty fourteen and there's an Eighteen to twenty five to twenty nine year old is how they oh wow\nThat's not even that young and there was a young guy I met his name is ... he is attending a local community college there in Las Vegas\nAnd and you know he basically was very confused with the system he initially didn't know if you needed to register every year he thinks he registered but overall he just seemed confused with how you vote\nI've never voted before morals from what all I Know about voting as you show up to the whole place and you hope I don't know what I Need to bring on an even know what happens during the\nSpring yourself some states bring ID yes I mean there there is the argument that you know some of this you can figure out now increasingly

increasingly through like Google but I Do think to him like he wasn't the only person who expressed this confusion with how you vote\nWhich I think it's interesting like people don't know if they're registered they don't know if they should register and maybe to us political junkies is is\nSort of things that we assume people knew but I was really amazed by the amount of people who just did not seem to have that kind of like literacy\nEighteen to twenty nine year olds are the lowest age group for voter participation every year consistently like these voters keep getting older and they wind up voting later on but as young voters Eighteen to twenty nine they have the lowest participation rate\nAnd they have among the deepest drop off between presidential elections and mid term elections in twenty twelve for example about one in five voters were Eighteen to twenty nine year old Nineteen percent\nAre having to do with various kinds of pollution\nAnd this particular week of the weakening of regulation had to do with just spending the scientific advisory board\nFor particulate pollution now that's the kind of air pollution that doesn't come in a gas form it's made up of tiny solid particles that can get into your lungs and this follows on the heels of other UPA proposals up weaker regulations on radiation exposure and mercury emissions and\nOur last month or so we were talking about the administration rolling back restrictions on methane emissions\nFrom oil and gas drilling and transport so when the president talks about all the regulations that he has rolled back some of those regulations have to do with the environment\nRight the last story involves health insurance plans and a vote in the Senate\nWe had to close Senate both in fact as close as the Senate can be in a division between the two parties it was a fifty fifty ... not perfectly but almost perfectly along party lines this week\nAll the way back into Obamacare they created these little short term plans they don't cover a lot but they're real cheap you could have this for three months as a kind of\nAbsolute minimum stopgap before you got more permanent arrangement other Trump Administration like those plans because they're cheap and uh so they said why just three months or let's let him go for a year and the Senate had a chance to roll back that change and that opportunity failed this week when the Senate tied fifty fifty so the regulations remain in place\nRon tell us about the potential downsides to these plans\nThese plants don't have to comply with all the usual rules under the Affordable CARE Act so insurers don't necessarily have to cover all those basic things that people think that Obama Care guarantees they will get perhaps including maternity care perhaps including emergency care perhaps including an ambulance that takes you to the hospital after a car accident\nAnd of course at the bottom line they also divert dollars and patients from a larger insurance pool that makes Obama Care work so in that way it's one more way that the White House has managed to undermine log they could review\nThat is NPR's Ron Elving each week he catches up on one of the

you give us a quick recap of what was in this big tax bill\nYeah the big top line thing for the people will remember the most is that Republicans cut the top corporate tax rate from thirty five percent or Twenty one percent they also made things a little bit simpler for individuals they made the standard deduction almost double\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic

nine six six zero zero\nTop line things that I think people will remember the most is that Republicans cut the top corporate tax rate from thirty five percent a Twenty one percent they\nAlso made things a little bit simpler for individual they made the standard deduction almost double they cut rates for most people who pay taxes and they doubled the child tax credit\nBut they also lowered the cap on the mortgage interest deduction is that thing that people use after they you know buy a house and they are paying interest on the mortgage payments they can deduct that well they were Republicans decided to cap that to help kind of keep the overall cost of this bill in check\nThey put a cap on the state and local tax deduction which is um when you live in a state that has a particularly high a state tax and you could write some of that off\nThat it also limited now those things are primarily benefits that go to people who itemize their deductions on their tax forms so it the impact really was spread on evenly across people with different income brackets\nScott this has been a lot of the land for almost a year at this point do we have any sense of the economic impact\nI hate to say it but it's really still too soon to tell but we do have kind of competing stories we have seen fairly robust economic growth a second quarter growth was over four percent we're in the ballpark a three and a half to four percent for the third quarter when that number comes out later this month\nThose are pretty healthy growth numbers private economist and the CDO forecasters they think this is a short lived sugar high that people are are getting more money in their paychecks spending it and that's all going to wear off pretty quickly\nScott I'm going to stop you right there you said CBS show that is the congressional budget office that's the independent agency that I'm sort of calculate the economic effect of congressional\nYeah they're the nonpartisan official scorekeeper for all ... all the bills that go through Congress to deal with taxes and budget\nMore optimistic forecasters notably at the White House think no this is a lasting change that companies are going to take their tax savings put that into new plants new equipment\nNew machinery that's gonna make workers more productive and that we're going to see sustained higher growth for years and years to come and it's really just too soon to know which of those competing narratives is the right one so basically\nWe're going to go into the mid term elections where people are going to vote not really knowing the answer\nWhat we do know however is that government revenues have taken a hit from these tax cuts and as a result the federal deficit has ballooned\nThis is not at a hot matter of of conversation on the campaign trail as far as I can tell\nNo the deficit has has certainly receded from the public consciousness you might remember back in the\nEarly days the recession it was kind of high on the public agenda that Republicans in particular were complaining about trillion dollar deficits we're marching in that direction again the desks it's expected to be up around a trillion dollars in the current fiscal year but you certainly don't hear Republicans talking a lot about this and you don't hear a lot of Democrats talking about either\nWhen you do hear Democrats talking about it they seem to be setting it up as a binary thing you know Republicans\nWanted to cut taxes for the wealthy while also doing away with government benefits that people want to you until it's not usually message from Democrats as as just the tax cut is bad but the tax cut his dad which means the government can't spend money on programs that are popular\nYeah I guess the challenge for the Democrats is they have to be careful in how they criticized\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of Berkshire health systems provide an orthopedic

Democrats as as just the tax cut is bad but the tax cut his dad which means the government can't spend money on programs that are popular\nYeah I guess the challenge for the Democrats is they have to be careful in how they criticize a tax cut lest they be accused of wanting to re people's taxes which they often are is this the the great thing that Republicans thought they were going to be able to campaign on or not\nWell Republicans have really backed also campaigning on it and that's in part because you know the polls have been bad for the tax bill for months and months and the polling average that they use of aren't real clear politics shows than thirty nine percent of people approve of this and forty two point five percent disapproved\nAnd you know the tax credit had kind of a a momentary high water mark back early in the year when there were a lot of stories in the newspaper and on TV about companies that were paying one time bonuses to their workers are and and for a

handguns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into the building and a week and a half before school started\nAfter a bunch of training they're running their first drill in the school building with a gun fresh out of the boxes\n[noise]\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around the district of rural Ohio that let us record on the condition that we not see their name on the air\nThe day people on this team only to teachers all do it for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodian the three administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team pollock watched them doing this week or so I'm explaining how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations of at the school\nI saw the run a bunch of drills\nAnd then all of them the goal was to run to the air safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter as as soon as possible and they time each drill okay we're going to pay for this is one of one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks\nThat fire during these drills [noise] so the first little glitch\nThey came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into the safe you have to put your finger on the sensor is like a fingerprint\nAnd a little tricky\n\n[noise]\nThere's a share of that meeting he's playing the shit [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John is the principal for grade six to twelve\nHe's running from his office starts by the cafeteria [noise] he's got a gun is ramp bullet proof that he's

the doors\n[noise]\nThey said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to\nThem I I talked to John the principal about that yeah I'm for a long time he agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he says he's not a gun guy didn't grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have it some police force so if a shooter got in the building they could be waiting a long time for help\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right thing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you worry you're worried because you realize that you're on your own and and\nSo I wanted to learn [noise]\nSo I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle it down\nAnd which is different you know the first time you shoot a gun that's pretty scary it was scary to me\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd went exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target tells close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision this is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close do you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot that target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss\nBecause if I miss [noise]\nThere's a possibility somebody else getting her [noise]\nAnd I can't let that happen\nI Can't let it be me who hurts\nUs doing it in my school\nOf course he might have to shoot one of his ... and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise]\nI I wouldn't have believed\nBut these\nThings don't stop happening\nThey just continue to happen\nAnd\nThey shouldn't do just continue to happen\nDid an effort that we have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare\nFor like the staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shootings it'll to pass it would just be the future knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nLike one of our Saturday we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put in measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly can\nAnd it's still not enough to we have people who have invented something that

school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation just came after a total overhauled schools emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nI don't think they could have been more prepared than work day and I mean they knew what to do we knew what to do\nEven still even with that and we still had\nHas if you have people that are going to return to their family\nDid the training they received save lives that day were didn't it such an open question one of our producers Robin semi and went to ... to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane mornings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher in that new clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive\nOnce she and the other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills the whole school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the cage and go through all the emergency procedures this is what we do for ...\nEvery ... every day says what occurred black it this is what we do for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do it with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids knew the procedure that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they knew so if they were asked to non silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nAfter those two boys tour around the corner yelling at the shooter at the shooter actually did for another second and our doorway still confused then she went to her left all the way down the hall to set of open doors the face of freshmen building\nI see like hundreds of kids running out of the freshman building looking terrified you know when you see terrify kids running like that and it's\nThey they're not there there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not what the drill was\nShe knew it was real [noise] [noise]\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running to stop\nShe tried to back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group that smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building oh man I Would yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the town how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total body is in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in\nYes it was [laughter] yes it was laughing there were terrified people reading and I just I could not in all conscious as leave\nThem leave and be like that I\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you

or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been greeted by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet\nAnd I didn't hear from her for a while in our one by\nWe heard noises in the hallway um we got really quiet um has it has a flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on and when I heard the door open and put it sounded like it was open with the key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody not the comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is a please send you went in here\nAnd then there was like kind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time I set it on like afterward I should do am I supposed to open the door they didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started you know giving us
