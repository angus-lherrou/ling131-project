murdering and torturing political opponents during his Seventeen year rule\nThey argue that under international law European countries could try that general serious crimes conducted elsewhere at large for the British public opinion supported the idea\nBut says Patrick what's in the general himself now under house arrest in what was remained unfazed by the crisis unfolding around him\nThe first time I mention was in this house on the one with the state\nAnd that was a peculiar thing because he was sitting at this lunch table and we had the English special rounds police are controlling

that Pena shake could be extradited serious crimes allegedly committed often Nineteen eighty eight when Britain had ratified the un convention on torture it was a momentous decision\nOverturning the international tradition immunity for former heads of state but Patrick had already begun pushing a different idea an exception on the grounds of Pinochet's ill health\nHe was a frail man question about it he was quite large and have to be moved around with care I think what the media did was they took the impression that he was in some of because of the fact that we moved around in a

isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple it's just that somebody know something that somebody else doesn't know\nAnd the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation\nOthers didn't the fact is that the people who want to believe that markets were perfect close

called ritual does though who\nIs white parents age but identified them indeed became an activist on behalf of the black community and lived a life as a black woman though when she was challenged about this because people realized eventually that she had two white parents if it came out of a fascinating and difficult debate about who is to say\nWhat being black is and she said look I've never identified as white I feel myself to be black so therefore to that extent I'm black\nWell I think she's a very good case to think about because\nYou ask what's the relationship between self ... and and and others I think you have to think of these things as a matter of a negotiation you count simply declare the meaning of the euro and rice all on the air and races a special category you need to

created a movement to allow them\nTo be what they want to be an artist and they've opted to change the system I have I'm happy to respond affirmatively to that request and change the system I don't think it has any harm to me to buy masculinity to adapt system in that way and even if they did a little bit of how do I am asking then the I'd be happy because it's obviously very important to

of that is is the the moments when identity is leads to to hostility and hatred and division that's the thing the ones that can fall\nFor that I think some things can be said a but these are the things that are known to social psychologist one is so close yourself off people who live with people of diverse identity tend to be less bigoted than people who does so don't allow yourself to be

of the Irish border and the coverage breakfast status of northern\nIreland are obstacles that cannot be overcome\nI'm disappointed maybe I'm not surprised but I'm not without hope so just let me take this week because everyone quite anxious about what didn't happen at the weekend um well what\nIs happening is that took the continuing so there's no sense that there's a breakdown but there's an impasse and it's not surprising that the issue of northern artist and the island of Ireland is the issue is that the withdrawal agreement if you like it still has to be completed on because remember it isn't just the easy you or\nMe as an Irish semi pie or the our government insisting that the United kingdom the bushes prime minister\nLast December signed up to\nAn opposite of commitment that

example but I'm going to propose changes\nI guess what you won't agree with all of them but you take someone bought that have not happened\nIn these negotiations what is happening and that does the travelling part that I Hope we can get over is that the u._k. side on diet their right to do they have said well\nWe don't like to withdraw we went to northern we're proposing that in the future

expertise with batteries but we're also very focused on hybrid electric solutions where you've got an on board generator and the reason for that is really to allow our customers who are the aircraft manufacturers\nTo not have to design for the batteries of now but rather designed for the batteries that we may have ten or Twenty years from now\nAnd then use the hybrid system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be and what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely and reliably right now or as soon as possible and then upgrade the batteries as soon as the battery technology is there\nDescribe who is in this game\nIt's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies and you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in about voting that can absolutely you're thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angles to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where\nYou'll the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft\nSome of the start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they developed the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you can fly across New York\nOr London or Paris if you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus that's in Europe\nYou worry of maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board there is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now what I expect to see is you're going to see the\nHighlighted versions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric power train like the ones that vertigo is developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery technology has come

clearly before is this is an impact structure that's buried it happened about three hundred and sixty million years ago when sharks were roaming the seas and plants just started to colonize lamp\nAnd so during that time this large event occurred it would have generated towering tsunamis and other catastrophes but over time it got buried and when we want to study it today we need other means to
