radio I'm David Box on the on this edition of a our futures David standard\nNative American Holocaust\nThe bug barracks ... of the onslaught I'm indigenous people by euro American settlers can scarcely be believed\nHistorian David standard says the indigenous peoples of north and South America had undergone the worst human Holocaust world had ever witnessed\nRoaring across two continents nonstop for for centuries and consuming the lives of countless tens of millions of people\nThe Native American Holocaust isn't historical fact I'm quoting standard now but the records that it caused remains vividly evident among many of its survivor descendants today from the desert southwest of Arizona\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAmerican indian community has barely survive mired\nIn poverty and despair that has little equal except in some so called desperately impoverished third world countries unquote\nYet to add insult to injury Columbus Day is still a federal holiday but in defiance many cities have changed their name to indigenous people's day\nTo talk about the Native American Holocaust is David standard\nAnd award winning historian he taught at the University of Hawaii he's the author of many books including the puritan way of death before the horror and American Holocaust the conquest of the new world\nThis never before broadcast classic from the A R archive was recorded at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee in two thousand and eight\nAnd now David Steiner\nHolocaust is a very old were\nDating back to at least the thirteenth century and originally meaning a sacrifice consumed by fire or a burnt offering\nLeader around the fifteenth century it began taking on a more general and secular meaning specifically a great slaughter for sacrifice\nThose in the early sixteenth century the famous Spanish prior told them it tell us costs us use the word Holocaust to describe the Spaniards ongoing destruction of a men's numbers of native people in the Caribbean and Latin America\nHolocaust also was used on various occasions from the sixteenth through the Eighteen centuries in reference to the massacres of Irish civilians by English soldiers and columnists\nAnd among other instances in the late Nineteen century the word Holocaust appeared in the New York times headline above a story describing the slaughter\nMore than five thousand Armenians in eastern turkey part of an ongoing mass killing campaign they're\nHolocaust again appeared repeatedly during World War two as historian Peter Norfolk has observed in reference and I'm quoting over to the totality of destruction wrought by the axis not to the special faith of the Jews\nIn fact another points out only in the Nineteen sixties in the aftermath of the trial in Israel of the Nazi criminals out of like when the English language publications began referring to the Holocaust loosely translated reference to the Hebrew word Shaw like most people\nI commonly refer and speaking and writing to the Holocaust with exclusive reference to the slaughter of six million Jews and the Nazis massive extermination campaign\nBut I don't believe it makes sense to expect the word Holocaust suddenly to disappear from the English language following World War two except with reference to the Nazi Judeo side\nBut at the same logic we should be prohibited from using the word calamity except with reference to the Armenian Genocide where the nineteenth century Irish famine\nEach of which killed at least a million people any feature which has been designated in capital letters and in quotes the great calamity by their victims\nThe same logic would suggest that we strike the word devouring from everyday speech since that as the English translation of crime is to capitalize rama word for the genocide purpose\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nUsing a particular word to memorialize they're suffering of course about\nIt just doesn't make sense to banish or word from everyday usage because one group or another has adopted in reference to their victimization\nAnd no doubt that's why my use of the word Holocaust not the Holocaust and referring to the destruction of indigenous peoples in the Americas actually with very little remarked upon much more controversial was my use of another word\nThat word was genocide\nOne of the reasons that became controversial is that by employing it I was joining an ongoing debate about the uniqueness of the Holocaust\nNot talk about that debate the unique has to be shortly but first it's important to have some sense of why many people who knew nothing about that debate we're still instantly resistant to my use of the word the word genocide\nAmerican Holocaust was published on Columbus Day Nineteen Ninety two\nEarlier that same year Oxford University press also published a book by the prominent literary scholar and cultural critic James Tompkins than of Duke University\nHer book was titled west of everything with the west referring to the American west\nIt was a sweeping in a wide ranging book that included discussions of women in the west white women at least popular western fiction buffalo bill and much else even had a separate chapter on horses another separate chapter\nOn cattle only one thing was missing Indians the native people of the west how could that happen pumpkins address the question in her practice\nI forgot what you wrote us what she said I forgot although to be fair she did express regret for forgetting as she put it and I'm quoting here\nThe Indians had been decimated by disease removal\nAnd conquest and now I had ignored them so she wrote I cried and then she returned to putting the final touches on her manuscript\nBut don't recount the story to be critical of Jane Tompkins but rather to suggest that her self confessed memory loss was representative and in some ways perhaps symbolic of the attitudes of most Americans and understandably so that's\nThat prize was land and the Americans wanted it therefore the Indians annihilation the president concluded it was both I'm quoting him again beneficial and inevitable\nToday in the post Holocaust era such racist and genocidal boastful is usually is frowned upon at least in polite company in its place especially on the international stage is the silence of denial\nThe silence of Belgium is an example hold on to an acclaimed museum of African history and culture museum that until very recently made no mention anywhere of the horrors of the Congo where more than eight million Africans perished under the bloodthirsty colonial rule of Belgians king Leopold\nOr the denial of turkey over complicity in the Armenian Genocide or Japan over culpability for the so called rate of ... king and on and on and on\nThere are various reasons and rationalizations behind such efforts to ignore or deny the existence of genocides or to systematically minimize their magnet to national pride and its flipside potential national shame is one reason of course\nBut one nations genocidal denial frequently is eight and a vetted by a chorus of support from others political allies around the world\nIs one reason turkey has been able to remain so adamant in its official denial of the Armenian Genocide is support for this denial by the governments of the United states and Israel both of them fearful of damaging bilateral trade and diplomatic relationships with turkey\nIn the opposite spirit of denial\nThat is the spirit of never forget\nThere was a wall in the United states Holocaust Memorial Museum inscribed with a warning something that'll Hitler reportedly said one day in Nineteen thirty nine on the eve of the Nazi invasion of Poland it's a famous phrase who after all speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians\nMore ... than on this day I Believe nearly Seventy years later is another question\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nFive could have imagined that the United states and Israel of all countries would help to perpetuate that convenient forgetful this about the annihilation of the Armenians and with it Hitler's murderous cynicism on into the twenty first century\nIndeed it was only a half dozen years ago that the current president of Israel Shimon Peres declare the Armenian Genocide Armenian Genocide to be historically meaningless\nThis prompted a particular the anger reply from within Israel by\nA man named Israel Charney the executive director of the Institute on the Holocaust and genocide in Jerusalem\nIlliterates parents Charney wrote the Paris Ed Koch gone beyond a moral boundaries that no juice should ever allowed himself to trust is adding that specific remarks on the Armenian Genocide being meaningless were comparable to denials of the Holocaust\nThe sort of statement is not unusual for Israel Charney for many years he has ferociously fought back against the evil of Holocaust denial\nOn at the same time resisting efforts to set the Holocaust apart as in his words and I'm quoting him the ultimate of event against which all other tragedies of genocide a genocidal mass death or to be tested and invariably found wanting\nFor me he writes the passion to exclude this or that mass killing from the University of genocide as well as the intense competition to establish the exclusive superiority or unique form of any one genocide\nEnds up creating a fetish just the atmosphere in which the masses of bodies that are not to be qualified for the definition of genocide or dumped into a conceptual black hole where they are forgotten unquote\nWhich finally brings me back to the genocidal destruction of north and south America's native people\nAnd the strong resistance by some commentators to my use of the word genocide and describing the destruction\nCommentators like recently convicted felon Senator Ted Stevens who threatened to use his considerable power to cut off funding of the Smithsonian Institution if you use the word genocide as a plan to do in a documentary film on the destruction of the Americas native people\nCommentators in short who would prefer that those millions of bodies remain buried and forgotten in Chinese conceptual black hole\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the story of what happened to the indigenous peoples of the Americas during the course of four long centuries from Columbus is first landing at Hispaniola in fourteen Ninety two to the massacre at wounded knee in December of Eighteen Ninety\nOr over the course of five centuries if we bring accounts forward to the U.S supported genocide and Guatemala during the Nineteen eighties and beyond I must confess that it is impossible for me here tonight to describes specific events in any detail\nThat's what I did over the course of several hundred pages and American Holocaust and even then I barely scratched the surface of what in North America Alone began with a deliberate calculated extermination of the Indians or Virginia in the seventeenth century\nWhat yell genocide scholar been turning recently described as a genocide on the court the Geneva and model so total was the destruction\nLet me just say for the moment however the claim of euro American genocide is one of the primary agents wrist\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nWas hardly original with me\nIn fact the first person to make that case was the very man who coined the word genocide and who relentlessly and heroically press the United nations to declare it an international crime a law professor polish Jew who would last forty nine members of his family in the Holocaust roughly ...\nIt's commonly thought that in his efforts to name and defined genocide as a crime Lincoln was supposed to focus exclusively on an ongoing extermination of Jews in Nazi Germany and this is incorrect\nRecent research in the Lincoln archives at New York's American Jewish Historical Society the New York public library and the ... center of the American Jewish archives in Cincinnati\nHas revealed the existence of detailed manuscript ratings from the Nineteen forties and which Lincoln obviously preparing at least one book on John genocide probably more\nLess numerous folders filed under what he regarded as a variety of genocidal events in history including the titles are his quote Spanish treatment of South American Indians North American Indians colon extermination\nHistory of genocide projected book on North American Indian research and much more\nIn the Nineteen forty eight report to a foundation that we're supporting his work Lincoln listed what he called ten specific genocide cases says phrase he used a which was compiling information and I called to be made available to the United nations drafting committee on genocide\nOne of those ten cases is labeled the Indians in Latin America another is the Indians in North America\nAnd then finally in the Nineteen fifties Lincoln's archives reveal still more folders bulging with information on these subjects including the draft of a one hundred page essay on genocide against Indians one that includes sections on their incarceration in what he calls concentration camps\nHe was of course referring to reservations\nBy the late Nineteen fifties Lincoln had almost completed a massive book on genocide world history\nThe entire third section of which was to be given over to genocides and colonial settings with separate chapter titles listed on genocide against the American Indians Latin America\nGenocide against the as tax the Yucatan genocide against the Incas and then on to European genocide against the natives of New Zealand Australia south West Africa and more\nBut in Nineteen fifty nine Lincoln died of a heart attack in a hotel room in New York City he was not yet sixty years old the book was unfinished\nBut even if it had been completed it probably never would have been published because by then a new orthodoxy was beginning to take hold in the United states and elsewhere when that view the Holocaust as a singular unique genocidal event in world history\nTo some proponents of this idea of the Holocaust was not on the preeminent genocide it\nWas the only genocide whereas Lincoln apparently felt that acknowledging the suffering of others had no bearing on the recognition of one's own painful experience\nSome among this new generation regarded the Holocaust as moral capital to cite one representative writer moral capital that risk being plundered by others who sought acknowledgement of their own horrific experiences\nAnd this emerging climate of opinion authors who chose to order even mildly critical comments about aspects of the new orthodoxy including ... just\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's

their points of view\nAnd it's not just the poverty racism as an agent unto itself is a killer\nRecent research initiated by a group of physicians in Chicago is showing the college educated middle class black women give birth to premature and dangerous the underweight babies and almost three times the rate of comparably educated and situated white women in America\nI should note that preterm birth not only is a leading cause of death in infants but those who survive face the high probability of lifetimes damaged by learning disabilities hypertension diabetes and coronary artery disease\nSo this research since this research controls for differences in education and income all the indicators point to extreme stress as the primary cause of this health crisis\nStreaming support

society of course what I'm Talking about here regarding African Americans is the pathological residue of centuries of slavery Jim Crow and ongoing institutional racial discrimination today\nThe same imposed pathologies orange seriously at work and many American indian communities and the damage being done just heartbreaking loss while as essential that we as a nation face up to the genocidal realities of our past that's only the beginning\nThe simmering bigotry maligned neglect of the president continued to kill those people among those whose ancestors first settled this land thousands and thousands of years ago\nIts way past time for the nation as a whole but for all of us to begin repairing the terrible damage it's like\n[noise]\nSo you said at one point that the American Holocaust is as an event in the past that the wreckage from it as something that we're still dealing with today and it's annoying if maybe I can\nI'm like put you on that 'cause I'm Wondering if maybe if it's the case that it actually in something that's ... I'm In the sense that not you know we don't see government for his going out and flattering in a physical sense on indigenous communities but in a way we've seen\nColonialism work so well that now they're definitely they're forced to find out and doing it actually made it to their communities are very very good at kind of exterminating sell 'em\nSit down in terms of North American reserved communities that have the highest rates of violent and died out all of them got dependency I'm incredibly low literacy rate and also kind of just they widespread ability of like mainstream political ... to make all of those things and there's a whole lot that they don't come up\nUm that we don't actually talk about them so that we can talk\nRace and racism without actually talking about indigenous people at all and so I'm Wondering if maybe he'd be willing to say that it's still going on or if there's a particular reason why you okay and you know\nI Would take issue just one thing that you said and it may have just been a a term that you you would not maybe perhaps wanted to use or maybe you do you suggested that somehow or other the system has become so efficient but I think\nThat's not your word or phrase but that the people were doing it to themselves are destroying themselves and to me\nThe ... very close to blaming the victims of and ultimately they're not doing it to themselves even those who are committing suicide I think are not doing it to themselves again that's a fine point I think but in saying that what I'm really saying is that I agree with you\nOn that yes this has become a kind of machine that goes of itself in the same way that we can have deeply racist society without any overt\nEvidence of hate speech um and and racial hatred apparent\nThe surface of the society because we've created institutions that the ... or institutionally racist and simply take care of business on their own without without all the rhetoric that was associated with racism in the past so I agree with that\nI guess the the distinction that I Would make 'em because I did conclude American\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nJust to um the killing in Latin America in the Nineteen horrible horrible genocidal killing Latin American the Nineteen eighties\nComes back to the question of the word genocide\nHistorians over the many years of trying to figure some historians just a made up definitions of genocide and the reason they made up Jeff Sessions is because the genocide convention the United nations was cobbled together by a group of nations\nTo somehow make sense of ... to to institutionalize a law that would say this is that we cannot have this anymore this is illegal and nations must act against it so in order to do that they had to define it\nThe problem is who is sitting around defining this\nPeople who represent countries that in the past and at that time were committing genocide\nAnd then it was like having the thieves sit around the table right riding the law\nSo for example a Lincoln had always had in his definition of genocide whole groups of of political um people who would who were being exterminated because of their politics the Soviet Union had would have nothing to do with that\nBecause they had how many people in the gulag at the moment that they're sitting down reading this this this genocide convention they simply could not have that as a result technically\nThe genocide in Cambodia was not genocide\nAnd there are very very few genocide scholars who will say that it was genocide but most of the genocide scholars in the world today would say if it was horrible but the victims were political victims and\nThat's why it's not a genocide same thing with the killing of Indians and part of why\nThe the killers weren't able to extricate themselves by saying yes we kill all of those people almost exterminate an entire people\nBut it wasn't because of the fact that they were Indians which would have made them a protected group but because their political activities were such that we they deserved being exterminated and therefore yes maybe that was not very humanitarian and maybe it was a crime against humanity and so forth but it's not genocide\nAnyway that's one of the reasons why historians have tried many historians and sociologist right above genocide have tried to create their own definitions of genocide the problem with that is\nYour definition includes this group my definition includes that group\nSuch as um taking children as the United nations convention those taking children away from families and putting them among others as that's happened in Australia most famously a and so on and others don't so therefore then you've lost everything\nSo I think that really what we need to do and I hate that I don't like this because I think the genocide convention as real problems\nIs that would just simply have to hold to the un genocide convention it's the only one the only thing that the definition that exists that most people bought into\nI guess what I'm saying to come back to your point which I think is a very good one is that I think we should stay within the un definition and fight about issues within that\nAnd in that case then we have to accept the word intent however we define it as part of the justification for our use of the term genocide\nThe effects are like I think that um\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany met that will open the mastery family children's emergency Center for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot E. D. U.\nI think that the intent to exterminate has being replaced in a really large way by the intense assimilate which I Am not sure is all that\nLike if you look at the residential school policy uncanny and so I Know there was a folder full of system in Canada a lot better but you look at the end of the residential school policy I'm not sure that you can pull apart the intent to exterminate with the intent to assimilate and that kind of example so\nYeah and actually ... case can be made that the genocide convention does cover them and uh uh uh people have written about the into the end again in Australia particularly well\nAs somebody who is Native American\nA church in the school basically my family all ran off during the removal\nAnd hit out I've lived on three different reservations and\nMy kids are all members of federally recognized tribe [noise] when you're looking at genocide as as a native person there was the physical genocide [noise]\nThere is the fact of genocide I grew up right here in Nashville and I grew up around mainstream society being a person from a completely separate culture and having to deal with why can't you just be an American\nWhy are you still speaking that language\nAnd the school still do this [noise] my kids have had to fight these very same fights in school that I had to fight that my mother had to fight and so forth and so on where\nYou get one little chapter of maybe four pages and a few paragraphs and it's so gentle it's useless", "show_name": "Alternative Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Albany", "day": "09", "locations": [["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Utica", 5.16977, -74.50134], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Milan", 45.46427, 9.18951], ["Arizona", 34.5003, -111.50098], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Nashville Tennessee", 36.16589, -86.78444], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["turkey", 39.0, 35.0], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Belgium", 50.75, 4.5], ["Congo", -1.0, 15.5], ["turkey", 39.0, 35.0], ["Japan", 35.68536, 139.75309], ["turkey", 39.0, 35.0], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["turkey", 39.0, 35.0], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Poland", 52.0, 20.0], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Jerusalem", 31.78199, 35.21961], ["Paris", 48.85341, 2.3488], ["Columbus", 39.96118, -82.99879], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Guatemala", 15.5, -90.25], ["Virginia", 38.34982, -81.63262], ["Geneva", 46.20222, 6.14569], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Germany", 51.5, 10.5], ["New York's New York", 40.77205, -73.93014], ["Cincinnati", 39.12711, -84.51439], ["Yucatan", 20.75, -88.83333], ["Incas", -19.71667, -66.53333], ["New Zealand Australia", -25.0, 135.0], ["West Africa", 9.56, 44.065], ["New York City", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Chicago", 41.85003, -87.65005], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["the Soviet Union", 38.90344, -77.03942], ["Cambodia", 13.0, 105.0], ["Australia", -25.0, 135.0], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Canada", 60.10867, -113.64258], ["Australia", -25.0, 135.0], ["Nashville", 36.16589, -86.78444]], "not_found": ["Kingston W.

themselves and were flocking into this attack meals or to look for work\nWhere they were literally worked to death that is the introduction of capitalism that the introduction of what we call the colonial food regime\n[noise] now this was a great concern\nTo great thinkers at the time and I'll just mention two or something to do with co ops in John Stuart mill who is a very important reformer and who believed in a co-op cooperative victim um as a way of helping people to respond\nTo what capitalism was doing to their society\nUm and of course Robert on a who was a utopian thinker also very much in favor of co ops end of a a planned communities um but\nAnd he was also trying to uh not just sort of reform\nThe ... the capitalist system that was being imposed on Western Europe at the time particularly British Isles but he wanted something different he really wanted something radical he wanted to pull out of the capitalist system\nAny also want to co opt to help do this so we begin to see that cooperatives or tools and different responses to capitalism\nVery few people today actually know what John Stuart mill or rubber own said we don't really studied much\nOwing and crew or the philosophers and and the sort of the wealthy people who were pushing back against capitalism at the time [noise]\nBelong to a very elite level of society and they sort of launched these ideas in what we call the public sphere were there was all this debate in the coffee houses in London about oh dear oh dear what shall we do about capitalism after all\nBut in fact there was another public sphere where people were discussing what the hell to do about capitalism how the hell to stay alive working Eighteen hours a day and not getting enough and literally thing were to death\nBoth the diesel and the fertilizers said you know this is not good for business and their names were forward and Rockefeller\nSo foreign Rockefeller decided\nLet's expand our market so they decided to sell these inputs to the rest of the world the problem was the rest of the world already had food already had working systems food systems and didn't need that stuff so they had to destroy those food systems in order to save them\nAnd of course the discourse we're going to save the world from hunger by increasing productivity so they send out all of these inputs and tractors and fertilizers and sees and I'm into the third world\nBut the third world doesn't have any money how's it going by all these things so banks from the United states loon private banks loan money to the third world to be able to buy all these inputs and they do\nAnd governments are forced to push peasants off land and so basically the industrial revolution is played out again\nIn the third world your tremendous um disruption of peasants societies and they flock to the urban centers looking for work and you get what Mike Davis cause a planet of slums\nWell did you shoot everybody starts over producing not only were producing all this food and the third world we're producing it here too and the bottom drops out of the market and then no one can pay back their loans role in this country in the seventies we lost half of our farmers they went bankrupt the farm crisis\nIn the third world we get the third world debt crisis and so the world bank steps in and the international Monetary Fund steps and says\nYou know you got to keep up your payments\nIn the United states you could just you know repossessed the farm but you can't exactly repossessed Mexico\nSo the world bank steps in and says you got to keep up your payments [noise] um well known you the money to keep up your payments this is public money this is our money by the way the world bank is a public institution that's our money so public money\nStraightening

dismantle although if you're a grain reserves\nAnd um started growing things more coffee and flowers these things were to get your dollars\nSo you can pay back the banks is this called Neal liberalism you have to privatize all of your state services privatize all of your state run industries put them up on the market will come down will buy them thank you very much\nSo what's happening to us today in the United states happened first\nAnd the third world the privatization of Arctic of education already happened the third world privatization upcoming privatization of the post office already happened for a\nThird world I'm so privatization is basically this new wave of capitalism I'm which we now call Neal liberalism\nAnd a complete deregulation from Minneapolis environmental deregulation um labor deregulation trade your regulation that's with the world Trade Organization it's about we have this this rush of free trade ... the free trade mania\nWorld Trade organization and the free trade agreements of the north American free trade alliance and Central American free trade\nAgreements and you get tremendous over production the north they dumping in this in the south or putting farmers out of business within a year the signing of NAFTA over a million Mexican farmers went bankrupt and why do you think we\nSo many immigrants here today it's because these arrangements these agreements\nThese capitalistic remains destroy their livelihoods that's why you hear you look at who's\nWho's in the back of the house or the fancy restaurants former farmers whose cutting the lawns those farmers who is doing all the farm work all the stupid labor those were farmers so when farmers in this country say oh geez who's going to you know all the farmers are disappearing\nNo there's no no one wants to farm anymore and they're surrounded by foreigners just happened to be brown so what a cough doing well in the postwar period cops kind of you know languished\nBut then they begin to get what I learned was another um second when called the second wave of cause and you get these co ops by fairly privileged people who decide to reject this corporate food regime\nThey want to live differently they want healthy food they want food which is recognizable and they organized and they push back\nAll of these instances of people pushing back is with carpal on your call the counter movement\nThe counter movement is a social movement of people who do not accept what capitalism is doing to them and they push back out of necessity out of belief for out of survival ...\nAnyway we get the second wave and I'd like to think that the second wave was really part of the beginning of what we today we call the food movement mhm\nStraightening support for WAMC comes from my dog harness

thousands of reviews at my dog hunt S. dot com\nIs comes out of the desires of of Asian Americans it would have very different position and the food system\nBut who find different ways of ensuring their own food security out of necessity\nAnd so today we have a really a thriving food movement we talk about all the time Michael Pollan Alice Waters always people talk about the food movement\nRaj Patel ... pay me um and I think we have to sort of cop to the fact that\nThe food and one of the reasons the food movement here not just because we're rejecting\nA processed food which we should it's pretty bad for us as everybody knows where we're also trying to deal with the contradiction that the richest country in the world produces more food than any other country except maybe China\nI'm\nIn this country when people one of the seven people are going hungry we don't call it hunger recalled food insecurity and there's a special\nWay of measuring it might not [noise] um if you call it hunger you won't go to us the grounds and I'm sure you have to call it fruit and security\n\nBut one in seven people in this country so that tells you right away that hunger is not the result of scarcity\nWhy are people going hungry and the richest country in the world with more food than anybody else because they can't afford it and so hungry maps very closely with poverty\nHunger also maps very closely in this country with rich so the highest levels of food insecurity\nIn this country are among people of color we have a racialized food system and this is one reason we have a strong food justice movement to deal precisely with this kind of inequity\nNow it turns out that the figure I just gave you one in seven hungry people in the United states reflects perfectly how many hungry people that are in the world about one in seven people\nAre going hungry in the world in fact depending how you measure it it might be much greater\nBut by the standard um a means of measurements from the uh United Nations\nOr one in seven people are going hungry now you're a lot about from Bill Gates and others that we have to go to Africa and we have to say Africa from Hungary we need to take the new green revolution to Africa and Africa Africa Africa where are you guys are interested in Africa\nAll of a sudden oh well African never got a chance to for the green revolution it's not true actually agreement wishing failed in Africa but in fact that if you really want to end hunger\nThat's not where most of the hungry people are most of the hungry people are in Asia\nAnd Pacific why aren't we talking about that because they already had a green revolution and Asia and Pacific that's why so they bring revolution isn't just about expensive inputs\nFertilizers and hybrid seeds and pesticides on the green revolution is about exchanging one food system for another exchanging peasant food systems for capitalist systems and so logically and historically as it always has it displaces end this\nStraightening support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no ... no poll dog hornets invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... sent two

thing one is\nWe know some things about capitalism people have been studying it for several hundred years and one of the things capitalism always does it gets that goes through a period of liberalization and then a period of reform liberalization\nThey take the gloves off the market's market gets to do whatever it wants new more rules think of the roaring twenties\nThinking today Neal liberalization and this other states society but it concentrates a lotta money in a few hands but then people can't take it anymore encounter movements rise up and they push back and they demand reform\nOr they demand revolution which is even scarier\nStraightening support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com I Know choke no poll dog hornets in that did to make walks easier for both

counter movements why didn't we get reforms that last market crash they've all the money to to the banks bailed out the banks what about the people because the counter movement was not strong enough\nSo what does it have you done brothers and sisters take a look at things we've got about two million farmers we have more people in jail and then we have on the land we have\nLess than a million agricultural workers forty six thousand people working in processing plants but three million working in retail grocery sector you put all these together that's a fifth of our national workforce\nNow that's interesting from an organizers point of view from disrupt his point of view from a reformist point of view from a revolutionary point of view twelve percent you can check things which represent ... percent is\nAll the globe the in 'em all the corporate food regime controls\nGlobally they controlled ... percent of the food and with that they control the world's root systems\n\nNow co ops don't control much of the food in this country I Know\nAnd farmers are two weeks to demand anything but people who work in retail grocery that's the biggest employer in this country Walmart because some part in this country\nWhat if we were to converge in all of our diversity how powerful might we do and I'll end by saying that the counter movement as far as we're concerned is the food movement it has the progressive\nWing and it has a very radical wing and the corporate food regime has two wings when you're a liberal and one reformist\nAnd it's a counter movement expects to introduce any reforms much less transformative reforms it'll have to converge the progressive than the radicals are gonna have to converge\nThink about the different types of co ops that I described they're all represented here but which ones should come together my position\nIs it the progress is in the radicals need to come together because if the reformist in the progressive to come together than the Contra moving to split down its back and it becomes a week thing and it will never be able to introduce changes\nThe reformist ones bringing Senate changed the two week why because the neo liberal or hedge demonic this is the age of neo liberalism what's keeping us from coming together I Would say there are some historical obstacles we need to deal with\nOne would be sexism and there would be racism and another would be clashes and\nWe have to deal with these things brothers and sisters we have to take them head on we have\nTo be fearless we have to call it out I have to call out my privilege is a white male and I have to allow people to call it up right here right now everywhere we've got to dismantle patriarch\nStraightening support for WAMC comes

curious you said there are three million grocery workers you know uh this this statistic of service and restaurant workers that we could add in there as part of the food\nOh yes I Do but I Can't remember [laughter]\nYes and there are some excellent organizations like the restaurant opportunities center that organize restaurant workers\nUm by the by restaurant workers have some of the highest levels of food insecurity in the nation and the highest of within that sector or in the fancy restaurants\nI have a question of all the inconsistency that me and my friends discuss brought many systems but the people in this room all respect from saying about this one so we have an eleven thousand members that are small cooperative upstate New York\nIt occurs to me that those eleven thousand members although they raised their hand to say they want to be part of this shift in food systems\nTherefore one case their retirement plans their stocks and their bank investments are at the same time more than likely supporting the structures that you discuss\nRight we realize is in our school board work in my community that the people were coming to us demanding security in the front of school buildings\nHad not checked her all the ... to see whether or not they were supporting Remington\nRight so how do we begin to expand this conversation so we stop eating the tale of our own snake\nWell thank you that's not a simple question is is [noise] I think I I really do believe that that reflects of action\nNeeds to take place within the public sphere is which we consciously created I think that we need a radical public spheres I Need we need public sphere is deeply rooted in community um and these issues have to be put on the table and you know people are going to get defensive\nUm but we can't not address those inconsistencies a and I think that the only [noise] there's no easy way but I think that as we understand the structures which has driven is to this dead end\nAnd to the contradictions in our society into the violence that we experience in our society as we understand the structures behind that and call them out I think it deep personalize things enough so then we can begin to address the very personal issues as well\nAnd I think that you know there's a lot of trauma trauma um built into all of this\nWe can't just address it intellectually you can't just addressed that organization like every one of us has to do some work whether it's about internalized oppression or whether it's about the guilt of privilege\nWe can't get anywhere if we're if we have these anchors on us which means we do have to do the internal work the good news is you don't\nStraightening support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com I Know choke no poll dog hornets in that did to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog hunt S. dot com\nAnd constant constant work on genocide there are excellent forums and workshops and um for dealing with\nRacism and how to dismantle racism\nFrom both sides of the oppressor envy oppressed and the same is true for a sexism and patriarchy so I think that to the extent that we can begin to bring these into our practice or social practice whether that's cooperatives or whether it's research like I Do\nThere's no guarantees on this you know we don't know what's going to happen we don't know if we can avoid planetary collapse civilization will collapse the planet will go on we won't we don't know\nBut what if we didn't even try what else are you going to do it's time to change everything were you busy\nSounds intimidating but what else I've been doing this stuff for a long time and very much for a position of privilege to meant trend tremendous mobility got educator I never thought I Would I mean I grew up as a farm worker but I'm the only one in my family\nBecause of
