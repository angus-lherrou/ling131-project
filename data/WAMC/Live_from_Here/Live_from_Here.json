constant gray missed allowing for just occasional peaks of the colorful leaves\nThe forecasts was calling for the first snow fall of the year but for the good people of buffalo that's not even cause to wear a long sleeve shirt\nWhen you live in Buffalo complaining about the weather is complaining about life itself\nI was picked up at the airport by a woman named Charlie she's been driving for twenty two years in their cabinets filled with stuffed animals they line the dashboard hung from the rear view mirror and the monkey was attached to the steering wheel\nThese are my co pilot she said some people have Jesus I have these guys\nShe goes by Charlie because her father was hoping she'd be a boy I really think the name made me a bit of a tomboy when I was younger they don't say tomboy anymore now everybody is filled with gender fluids\nI guess that was ahead of my time but anyway I'm all girl now and everyone still calls me Charlie\nAfter growing up in Buffalo she went to college down in Arizona because they wanted to go to the hottest place I could find but it turns out I'm not built for the desert seems more like a place for lizards\nPeople who stay there too long start to look like us funds that was left out in the sun\nShe came home after school and it's been in Buffalo ever since we have a lot of moisture here and I love it I'm like a plant water me and I grow when

what looked like one of the older bars in the city covered in lights and years of science coasters stuck to the walls to kind of place where it's always midnight the kind of place that so tired that even the ceiling seems to be hunched over at the end of the bar\nThe bartender was a big bear of a man named Chris he had a giant beard and big pause and then grab while he worked he says he's been in this bar for Thirty years and then he's been there so long he doesn't even smell they're famous buffalo wings any more\nPeople come in all the time and they say they smelled them all the way down the street but I don't smell as saying who knows maybe it's to me they smell\n\nEagerly place my order there's something great about eating food that makes a city famous\nIn addition to whatever natural elements are involved in the water the air the ingredients there's also a pride and love and it's corny as it might sound the love the people add makes all the difference\nHave you ever been away from

isn't even a little funny it might be a different story if it was the Likud he splits\nAmong the trophies was the fate of newspaper article featuring a high school football team there was a picture of Chris he was the captain in the last year they won the state championship\nThis was a different life it's all just a memory now he said just like this will be one day have you ever started to tear up about a bartenders glory years only to realize it was just your eyes watering from a plate of piping hot buffalo wings\nI have and boy were they hot my lips were on fire tears were rolling down my
