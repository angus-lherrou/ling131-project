W. dot com has more information\nApple CEO Tim Cook threw down about privacy in the tech industry or what he called the data industrial complex he called for the United states to adopt a comprehensive digital privacy regulations\nApple has stress privacy is a selling point over the past couple of years but this was a big broadside at a couple of the other biggest tech firms in the world namely Facebook and Google\nAnd it's worth noting that it's easy for Apple to privacy when the option it's offering is it closed ecosystem where the company controls every aspect of the technology\nLet's dig into this and quality assurance the friday segment where we take a deeper look at a big tech story Tony Robbins attacked policy reporter at the Washington Post he covered cooks remarks I think\nTim Cook is pretty frustrated with Silicon Valley he's certainly not the only one these days\nFor the company though I was able to do this because its business model is so much different than a company like Facebook and Google\nThose two companies rely on collecting data about you and turning that data into insights that can then be sold to advertisers that's how they monetize things with apple it's different we're talking about the sale of iPhones and iPads and knocked the pros so I you know Apple CEO Tim Cook has a bit more of a runway to talk about these things and his peers\nWhat did you think about these comments afterward by Facebook's former chief security officer Alex Day most he said Tim Cook is being a little hypocritical because the company accommodates Chinese censorship and essentially saying you know nobody's clean when they're making billions of dollars off of selling technology\nDads and even beyond what Alice famous was pointing out in his tweets from Denver when you're on your iPhone when you're using the search feature you're using Google Search there there's always been an arrangement between\nApple and Google with respect to search for some of the things that can cook is lamenting when he talks about privacy or things that in some ways the iPhone enabled by merging you towards using Google Search in some settings but I think that it speaks to the bigger issue here which is that for many of these companies they're troubles with governments are very complex and they're pretty wide ranging\nShould any tech company be framing the conversation right now especially a conversation about regulation on privacy\nWhether they should or they shouldn't be framing it they certainly are and that's because these companies don't want to be regulated in a way that affects their ability to collect information and monetize it and many of them are really worried in particular because of what happened in Europe and in California over the better part of the past few years\nYou're put in place very very tough restrictions on how companies can collect can use information and then California wedding had ended its own version of that sort of the GDP are as we call it for the United states these companies don't want to\nBut how companies can collect can use information and then California wedding head and get its own version of that sort of the GDP are as we call it\nFor the United states these companies don't want to have to follow multiple sets of rules and different parts of the country so that's why you're seeing them talk so much about regulation because it's in their interest to set the rules to have a voice in the conversation so to speak so that they aren't burdened by a regulation put forward\nBy government that is Tony rom tech

what we're looking for is just some bare minimum of safety training some safety attracts you to see that someone actually has a confident and safe driver before they're allowed to pick up members of

has come you know thinking way to get people to love the flyers um they're against it in in Philadelphia in tough stance I Do not like you know the furry creatures however\nWell the document comes from first they have listening sessions around the world and they asked bishop to pull their um used community there was a survey for Catholics teenagers sixteen and twenty nine\nTo fill out there and

to\nChurch who may have left and better realized they um\nExperiences and and the questions that young people are asking about their church today is there anything bind doing about the document well look at the official church teaching 'em but it it it depends really I think on the local bishops 'em and communities to implement them\nNow you you you mentioned you know being outside and of course you're protests have taken outside of the Vatican and the Senate what kind of reaction did you get there\nThere are just ten percent of the participants are women within the Senate ... show on the day that the Senate began we had a witness outside the Senate gates and to call for women to vote within within the Senate hall basically ... called the bishops out by name and say we see what you're doing a near closing the door and making decisions without\nUs so we were able to peacefully protest outside the Senate hall I'm also praying of for twenty five minutes ago before the Roman police came and I'm\nAsked us to stop basically I was held for simply by my arm and everyone was forced show identification ...\nWhat about the reaction from the crowds were there any ... or any reaction from ... ... or ... people observing up notably to\nProfit from Ireland came and greeted us and and to our materials the fact that women cannot vote in a meeting in two thousand Eighteen it's it's pretty absurd to most people so we got a lot of support from people walking by\nNow Pope Francis has promised to put more women and leadership roles and after five years there are only six women in you know what can be defined as leadership roles at the Vatican what more would you like from him\nWell there are things that he could do immediately and he could appoint women took the position of leadership I'm across the Vatican today that positions that don't require\nWell there are things that he could get a need at the end he could appoint went into positions of leadership I'm across the Vatican today that conditions that don't require ordination and\nNow there's been a lot of criticism of Pope Francis about how slow he has been to understand the sex abuse issue within the Catholic Church and how he said the right things but has has has been very slow to act\nI'm there hasn't been as much public criticism towards him about women do you think he gets the issue of of why women should be included in in the Catholic Church and given leadership positions\nMany of us are calling for all any and are not satisfied by the slow progress at his papacy to bring women into you know substantial leadership position\nMhm but do you think you get the you\nKnow I I really hope that he is able to meet with men who I call to be praised as a pastor I Know that he would respond to them with a a generous heart and they hope that he has a man of conversion\nYeah no I understand that that's what you hope I guess what I'm trying to ask you is do you think that Pope Francis is a Catholic leader who can grasp uh why it's necessary in two thousand and Eighteen to fully include women um\nI guess I'll have to see so far he hasn't made any moves to include women in substantial voting to shed or made tremendous steps towards women in the position so I mean five years in a lot of us are are you know\nTired of waiting and but I I I Do think that it ... it takes time for change to happen

meter a fan barb barely sitting above the ocean surface\nAnd before the hurricane rolled over at what did the island looked like then [noise]\nPretty standard how\nSmall Sandy Island a represents the northwestern one island was about eleven actors in two meters above sea level covered with a bit of vegetation but basically teeming with wildlife thousands of birds hundreds of green sea turtles that used it for nesting and I'm a couple of dozen endangerment feels that would use it for pumping habitat\nDid people live there are written ... unit at any point\nNo so the northwestern right onto the is a national monument or large national park um and so the only people that would ever be up there where researchers and we usually had people that would be up there between out of the month of April in August\nNow it's part of Hawaii a French ... shows were there any other island affected by the ... hurricane earlier this month\nYeah so French radio shows itself has has about seven islets of a very ... they're\nSome of the estimates that we've heard as the storm surge was probably about five meters all of the island or maybe two to three meters high so obviously every island was over washed it's just east was sitting at the probably the most exposed part of that to the show and and suffered the brunt of the damage\nNow as someone who had done research on this island what were your concerns when you learn that that had been wiped off the map\n[noise] it just a really really like many of these islets a a really really important habitat for a lot of animals um\nLearn that hadn't been wiped off the map\n[noise] it just a really really like many of these islets a a really\nReally important habitat for a lot of animals in the middle of the ocean so for green sea turtles they're threatened Ninety six percent of the population breeds that French for ... years old this island with fifty percent of that nesting habitat so it's it's a pretty significant loss for turtles\nAnd for among feels it's about thirty percent of their population\nUm pups there at French racial so the first question for us as did we lose animals and we don't think we did because it was so late in the season so they probably weather the storm it's next year when they come back to ... poor to nest um you know how are they going to respond to that loss of habitat and are they going to move to another

the data is all that personal\nMost of them felt that their genetic data while it was personal\nAt the same time it didn't reveal who they really were versus\nOne the other things in my study I looked at was search queries so when people type a search term into Google for example\nDid they consider that more personal than their genetic data in some cases they did because it really revealed something more about what made them tick what they were concerned about what they thought about what they cared about where's your genetic data doesn't tell you anything about that but then\nYou get to you know the news the twenty three news partnering with a pharmaceutical company to develop drugs based on the DNA data that they got from twenty three me do you think that changes the calculation for people\nI think it can because one of the things I discovered is that while people were motivated by the idea that there are data could be doing good that often wasn't very critical people hadn't

prominent publication particularly in print in this country and so\nIt's not a decision you made lightly you know I I I'm not an incredibly wealthy person so that the uh the loss of a paycheck is going to be felt but I I mean ultimately I didn't think that I was really making any sort of difference in the area that is the most important to me and if and if that was the case then what was the point standing on\nThe road to in this article when I brought to the newsroom did not matter\nYeah that was the feeling that I had and then I think other journalists of color have that you know we have these experiences and these insights that we've been to the table but we don't feel you know seen or or hurt or or or understood perhaps and that can be a real struggle\nAnd I'm Glad I mean this is something you you walk now do your job because it just burned you so much that this was the case and so we have what have you heard what are you hearing some other journalists of color about your experience the globe\nYeah so I published a piece on Monday I've heard from dozens of journalists of color at a vast majority of whom work in this country and they shared the same experiences of not feeling as though they're represented and not feeling as though their voices are valued and and you know some people have left\nJobs over it some people have taken on different roles just so they don't have to write and so you know what I've heard is that the struggle is is a lot more widespread for journalists of color then people might might recognize\nEvoked as a journalist who ten years and you write in the speech that you say there are solutions that are pretty obvious what are they\nYeah I mean I think sometimes there's a tendency to talk about this issue as though I'm well how are we going to fix it up very complicated but actually I think it's actually very simple I mean you you know you hire more people of color\nYou hear their voices and and and trust them and empower them to to report on what they see as important and you know you elevate them to positions of power prominent so there are\nPeople of color higher up in the chain who can champion those stories and I had to help with their framing and I just think that the solutions are are fairly obvious\nThat what do you think's last with your departure I mean at some level you thinking well maybe I should stay and fight the good fight and that did you leave then you know you'd just once you have people of color in unions and\nYeah I mean I think that's sort of part of the struggle if you leave you can feel like you're letting other people of color down and that's one less\nIn your newsroom yeah I mean I think\nThat sort of part of the struggle\nYou leave you could feel like you're letting other people of color down and that's one less forced to fight for you know the issues that you've you as as important but I think for me ultimately I felt I was a really providing that much help anyway and that my

their way over to North America yet but I'm delighted to to bring them here and they they really are sort of an answer to a question I think a lot of print readers have in terms of\nThe portability that were used to in our lifestyle but with the luxury of print that so many of our readers we know prefer\nJust to I Know it's hard to do because you do you see them you can't have that kind of oh my gosh yeah of course yeah as as best you can you describe what one looks like four hour radio listeners\nThere there are several things that make them really special in terms of construction so they're really not just teeny tiny books shrunken down a they're a horizontal format which you can tell when you're looking at it and so they're very genuinely easy to hold in one hand and flip the patches\nThe fine is not a traditionally so inspiring it as a hinged fine see can truly flipped the top open and hold it more or less flat\nFee you have the horizontal aspect\nPlus the sort of top to bottom horizontal reading of the flats finding the hinge and this ingenious flee special nailed paper that's just paper thin but has almost no show through and super sturdy\nThis ingenious flee special ... paper that's just paper thin but has almost no show through and super sturdy\nUnder that when it's closed it's about the size of a smartphone\nYeah it was almost it is almost the exact same size as my smartphone so in in the case of some phones smaller in fact a little tiny bit sicker but easy to slip into it back pocket or even a front pocket\nSo it really is a pocket book I was wondering why they call them pocketbooks I never had a positive yes and the text isn't too small\nThe text is not small at all it's not shrunken down really so when we went into it we broke down the text I worked with my art director here I'm\nAt a certain and we read ... pages of paying attention to lie in town and spacing and the best fonts you could really read it so we worked really hard to be able to have a comfortable reading experience that's the same as almost any print books in the trade\nBut now that the paper is different because in order to have as many pages as you would for a book you need to use a different type of stationary we would describe that for us\nIt is very similar to and in fact is um it is like Bible paper\nUm the publisher the printer that we work with and the Netherlands is historically by trade a Bible publisher and this is an innovation they came up with many years ago um so it does have that same than paper but they get it\nFrom this one single meal and Finland so I Believe where it is reinforced so it really doesn't or if it's quite sturdy\nUm we had a a laundering\nOf one of them in my household my son left one in a pocket which most folks would not survive and yet came out a little soggy on the other side but the paper was completely intact\nSo they can put up with a lot so they'd been you've tested they have been used tested they have made it through an adolescent boys laundry\nAnd which is a good thing because you're the first of these books are going to be for young adult readers is that right\nYup we're launching what John ... with fourth has back lists titles and he is you know his historical young adult author though his readership is very broad and crosses a lot of demographics and one thing we know about young readers and which is across the whole spectrum of people who read our titles is they really love print books\nWe know that they are looking for print titles that are not migrating to eat\nAs some adults have so we know it's something they're looking for\nWhat we know that people would turn to the readers because it had that Compaq major and that was easy to just carry uses light\nAnd it sort of the gas an ice giants like Neptune and Jupiter and we think some of those maybe many of those are one or planets ocean planets ... completely covered by an ocean\nAnd we find many of those in a habitable zone also wants to specially interesting about that is if it's a habitable zone covered with water water will evaporate\nAnd out build an atmosphere water vapor as a common molecules that are around our solar system in the galaxy or nitrogen and C. O. two [noise] so you can imagine this plan is having a nitrogen CEO to water vapor atmosphere\nBut that's just what we need for life that's what the earth was like for billions of years before the bacteria made enough oxygen for animals like us to live\nAnd what are they found them to do is your imagination pigs in what are the possibilities those Hollis planet that could be life as we know it could be people that could be animals who could be things I guess\nThat's all sorts of possibilities\nAnd the other hand you know you look at this positive thing and you think well this is what could happen but we're always making assumptions and I always I'm afraid of assumptions if you assume\nThat whenever a plant and us in the habitable zone as small as got water life starts then there should be life throughout our galaxy but then we would have a problem with the Fermi paradox right cause for him he said well there's no life all through the galaxy why hasn't contacted us this letter there's\nThere's two aspects here one there's so many planets habitable zone\nThat might have a life\nAnd yet we have heard from none of them so it's a big puzzle that we've uncovered as well\nAnd we tried to contact them I don't think we've done that [laughter]\nWell maybe that's the problem is that is right that might be a problem can you just take us back to the day this launch march of two thousand nine what was that like to do that bond to what was it like to be there\nWas absolutely marvelous taxis\nBack to the day this launch march of two thousand and I what was that like to do that launched what was it like to be there\nWas absolutely marvelous to actually see this big rocket and see the you know our space telescope on top of that\nThat was marvelous and I had an opportunity I was told you could be in the control room bill and say your name over a fire or you could spend your time with your family watching a launch well\nAway from the launch I'd spent so much time away from my family building that mission I said no control room would be a wonderful experience but I Would rather be with my family and so my family and I\nAnd some of our colleagues for the measure were sitting there watching this magnificent missile was plume of fire ... going to try it was absolutely marvelous I used to talk about how wonderful that was at night was the most exciting night at my life\nMy wife said no it was the second most exciting your life\nThere for the most exotic ... was ...

know people know credit you with having done that you hadn't been so resistant wouldn't be there\nYes we ... we proposed five different times you know only the fifth proposal was accepted it takes a tremendous amount of work\nAnd I'm from a lot of people to put together a spacecraft proposal Carl Sagan was one of our members our team members I don't know if you remember Carl Sagan of course and every time we would fail I Would ask all the team members do you want to try again\nAnd I had a letter from Carl Sagan yes yes I Want to try again I think it's a great mission and\nI'll be feeling better so a few months later yeah diapers letter on my wall\nSo the Kepler telescope is now retired and I understand there now says project called Tess he's launched this is the satellite is going to be watching those dies\nIt's actually on orbit it's actually sending data back down but they've already found several planets and the nice thing about tennis Kepler was a discovery class mission it was a probe into the galaxy\nOur plan is common or rare earth common or rare just give us those numbers so we can build new missions\nWhich is what kept her did now test comes along and says let's look at the whole sky and find the closest planet to start the plants around the closest stars and so we can examine them\nWith a James Webb telescope and we can examine them with ground based telescopes the new big telescopes coming online and find out more about these individual planets so that's the next step in our exploration of our galaxy\n... appreciate speaking with you thank

others corals are the ones that aren't strong and can't adapt to these conditions that we stressed upon them aren't going to survive\nWell and if we do nothing that's exactly what the outcome will be and I think that that fits with a pulling back from the context about what\nWe've observed and we continue to observe the death of call leaks in Nineteen Ninety eight to the El Nino we lucked Eighteen
