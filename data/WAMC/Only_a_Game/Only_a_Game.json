thank you and buy one of my very favorite investigative journalist you do not want her on your trail the terrific Jessica Luther Hi Jessica high you are up first this week Jessica what do we need to know\nYeah so Christie honor and all do the soccer superstar from Portugal who played for event isn't Italy is the third highest paid athlete in the world and possibly the most famous he has now also under investigation by the Las Vegas police department in regard to a two thousand nine reported sexual assault\nA woman by the name of Catherine me or guys come forward in a long piece in the German magazine Der Spiegel she waited until now because back in two thousand ten and all those settled with her out of court impaired three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars but the stipulation that she never talk about the report it assault again\nBut she has a new lawyer who is trying to avoid that settlement on multiple legal grounds there the police investigation because she found a police report ended a rape kit back in two thousand nine the day after she said he raped her\nEarn although has denied these allegations but and they're reporting Spiegel says there was an internal document between her and all of his lawyers and which are NATO and met she said no\nThere may not be a bigger ... on the planet the all seeing is getting any traction\nWell I think that it should be getting some traction but given that the week that we've had and also not just the week but the year you're looking at Ohio State and Jessica of course the work you've done and Baylor and Kevin army and you wonder how you're going to keep your enthusiasm level high to we used to be paid closer attention\nI'm going to try to be optimistic and say that this was going to get the sort of traction that it needs and it's going to it and that people are gonna pay attention to it I Wish I were more optimistic than I Am totally what do you think\nWould if we don't have the optimism mostly because uh

league baseball after his domestic violence situation is this needle moving at all in your opinion\nYeah I mean it's moving it's a you know I always described us as like\nA giant cruise ship with a teeny tiny writer and turning this at all it's very difficult but you know for someone like me who studies college football and sexual violence in particular it wasn't much but urban Meyer he got a little bit of punishment but it it's going to take a long time and a lot of work to get the kind of change that we're hoping for\nTyler Europe so in the last few weeks one of the major dissenters in this athletic moment of protests outside of Colin Kaepernick his former teammate era greed was originally signed by the Carolina Panthers read isn't all pro level almost all world level safety at this point and was one of the main people who kneeled next to Colin Kaepernick back in August twenty sixteen\nAfter Jerry Richardson's reign of mythology and also sexism and also racism and also everything bad in the world that could be around one owner him leaving the Panthers last shares opened up a new leadership where owner David temper\nHas said that he sides of the protests that being said it doesn't feel as if the Panthers have done anything monumental by hiring at the center are hiring a protester who was ousted from the league has a collusion case with the NFL\nThey've done nothing but hire the right person for the job but at the same time it almost feels as if protesters during the cap on the air are finding their way back into the league for you guys think\nYeah I think that number one do you get a medal for doing the right thing to you is that what we do here just to get my question for you on this I'm thinking is this cynicism\nIn met you finally got a player that you needed when you're the Panthers or is it the fact that now that you hire Eric read that collusion lawsuit that he's got currently against the NFL now goes away\n... does it get a question I mean it doesn't matter that they hired him because he's a good football player [noise] I'm\nGoing back to the discussion we just had and Tyler brought that up um if we want to talk about the impact on me to on sports the fact that Richardson stopped there is because of Sports Illustrated reporting about his massage and racism that's right that's tied into me to write so we can see a direct impact here\nAnd it's hard you don't want to give them cookies for doing the thing that they should do [laughter] I don't know it's so complicated I'm really happy that read it back\nI think we can mix a piece of actually being happy that somebody who deserves the job got one\nAnd also having skepticism that it took this long for it to happen to the entire NFC alpha needed so they never happened in the first place why why are we waiting until October for this exactly agree with not on a preseason roster every was on the training camp roster it took ... mental fall and the gridiron for ... to even get proposed that he should have a job\nOr the general manager Marty hardly ... strictly a football decision and that's when they start to feel duplicitous like we need to actually speak about it\nYeah and he's not being silent I Would want to point out that that has presser which was raped by the way the yeah I mean his unpacking of us history and oppression in this country should be used in classrooms and he's being very clear in his messaging as he has always been\nA Eric and I talked about this at linked to during the twenty Seventeen season all year with the forty niners last year and I remember saying to him listen you can't beat the flag so you're going to have to go head first on shaping us\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nOr you and you're going to lose or what he did to me was fantastic\nI Am going to finish things off with football as well and people hate it when I say it but sports are filtered through the following one's white owners white coaches white season ticket buyers white media and black players\nThrough the lens players perform a service for the owners and the entertainment ... they have no other rights or concerns they're paid a ton and they're expected to be grateful\nBut it'll Thomas the safety for the Seattle Seahawks he held out earlier this season for a better contract and everyone knows the dangers of football the injury risk the short window of opportunity and the fans called him selfish\nAnd he came back and what happened he broke his leg and well being cut it off the field he flipped the middle finger to his sideline and some fans burned his Jersey my reaction wasn't to burnish Jersey it was to buy one Jessica\nWho got your Jersey money though [laughter] friends\nThere some way to support and also to make sure that the right people are being hurt by this\nYeah I think that's a great point and it made me think a lot about ah this story with JR Smith they came up recently in the NBA and he put a tattoo on his leg and then all the question about covering it up and and sort of this discussion of who owns a company that in quotes like who owns\nThe ... and what did they owe us Jessica sometimes but yeah refer to them as owners [laughter] right yeah he was talking about them is owners the language of sports is very specific right\nI think the anger that comes with hearing some some of these decisions of the fact that we don't really understand the metrics of how capitalism can work right [laughter] you belong to the people who pay your paycheck and that's wrong at the basis of it right\nSo the NBA says they are with actually we do on your skin and he has one of two choices he said the fact that we know you don't I Want a brand do my leg\nOr he says the money is more important to my kids what she did say I'm just going to keep pushing and so I think it's powerful that people like all Thomas and GR Smith are standing up to these corporations that are telling them they're not worth that much when the reality is if there's a lady on bill on the field as we've seen with the state was often\nOften doesn't do the team is bad losses recruit people get fired in that just because you wouldn't pay somebody their worst\nMy guess for this week's

leave the athletic and by north ... at the Boston Globe welcome back to you both like severe thank you Karen [noise]\nSo I don't normally follow the latest research out of the Aspen Institute but this week our friend Patrick ... treated out an interesting report and they study the dangers and benefits of high school sports and no surprise football was ranked at the very worst for causing injuries\nBut it was also ranked number two for what they called psycho social benefits\nAnd football would have been ranked number one for psycho social benefits if not for the fact that football players are also more likely to engage in risky behaviors like\nExcessive drinking but that to me seems like a a self selecting kind of thing like kids who are going to be attracted to risky behaviors are also going to be attracted to risky sport of football\nSo this really sums up to me the issue that we've been grappling with for about the past decade which is is there a way to make football less dangerous without turning off the kids that need it the most and those are the kids who are attracted to the dangers of football and I'm all questions and answers and nor a what do you think\nSo first of all my perspective on football is that kids don't need to play it in high school high school football scares me ... just because all the research shows that when your brain is younger thoughts when it's the most vulnerable and the thing that I thought looking at the study was just that\nThe psycho social benefit seemed more related to playing a team sport mhm than playing football specifically so even as a football writer I looked at it and thought well yeah that's great but don't you think it's maybe just being outside and being on a team and making friends\nWell I I don't know if I have an issue at high school football as much as I Do like pop Warner like yeah like really little kids\nBut I think that you know at a high school level you know that's kind of like those awkward years where you're trying to find yourself the teams are usually pretty big and so you're a part of a really large community and you have the whole town behind you you know I Know from my years from cover in high school football I Know just what that sport can do to just\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com a no joke no poll Doug harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs

sure you're really by yourself 'cause there's no one there to cheer you even when you cross the finish line I Know that for run across the country [laughter] but football I can totally understand why it's viewed positively by the participants that doesn't make it any less dangerous\nYeah I mean we were you brought up youth football and certainly the solution there has been ... in jest that kids under fourteen ... plays flag football and sad that they don't really need to\nTell 'em in there with that yeah and I'm totally ... and yeah yeah yeah and\nYou know Tom rainy and demanding none of them play tackle football until they they were a little bit older\nBut what was interesting to me in this study because I I have thought hey what if we just need high school football flag football like would would that would that community still show up would you still get those hundred kids who are all working towards the same thing\nAnd this study really made me question my own sort of point of view on that because then I Wonder these kids who are looking for a risky behavior [laughter]\nI'm not sure they're going to find it in flag football so it's a problem there's definitely more work to do\nMichael a basketball we need some basketball help with that [laughter]\nWe have our latest effort to fix an issue for college basketball at all boys the obvious solution paid\nLeave that the G League is a now offer an alternative to the in sees one and done rule by providing the ultimate incentive to have a leap prospect from high school Eighteen years old ... before the draft to come and play for a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars a year\nYou choose a lot of money especially when you consider that this is more than the Mac salary for WNBA player and that's another topic that we can discuss later but the best part about the select contracts with the league is going to offer is that the players are able to sell their likeness everybody signed with an agent\nBut there is a risk to this one being you're playing in the ... so you're playing with grown men so you may not be able to establish yourself or separate yourself\nFrom your perspective as you say in college when you're playing against guys are on age also the G League does not provide the platform that a billion dollar industry like the NCAA will while I applaud the Julie for trying to provide an alternative I think that the NCAA\nCould actually benefit their athletes and especially the elite basketball players but just allowing them to have the ability of the hiring agent to sell their likeness and assign shoot is I think that could resolve the issue of paying the players I just wonder can the NCAA ever just step up and just solve its own problem\nWell so I Would say that no I have absolutely no confidence in the end of all ages\nSort of one day waking up in deciding like oh we're going to do the right thing cool facts\nProbably the best possible outcome from is right or at least as I see it would be\nThat the threat of\nElite high school players going to the G League instead of being one and done would be enough to push the NC double A. to reform they're not going to do it on their own because they just feel like it [laughter] uh I mean I think the only way it works and this seems like a an uphill battle is is\nThe alternative is a good enough one I can actually be a source of real pressure on the inside of light which would be the first time that there's an alternative that's been able to\nIf guys are actually getting drafted out of the G lead into the top\nStreaming support

developments one by one starting with the arrest on Wednesday at Steve Penny the organization's former president did you ever think you'd see something like this well\nFirst of all unfortunately it's becoming all too common that we start the segment we both argument using true and for all the wrong reasons\nThis guy's on blue since the penny guy he took it on the lam this guy rant on sports organization right on the lam and they have to track them down any gallons burger and that that bringing back ... taxes\nA grand jury in Texas has indicted penny for allegedly destroying or hiding documents relating to Dr Larry Nassar who has been sentenced to more than a hundred years in prison for sexually abusing athletes and I really really want to see what's in those missing document do you\nAs does everyone else including I suspect someone Nassar's victims I think one way or another either a disguise trial er into discovery the eight zillion lawsuits that are going to be filed against you say ... we're going to see what's in the documents and it's not going to be great\n[noise] so let's talk about Mary Bono she was an which I never thought I Would do it again [laughter]\nRight right well she was announced last friday as USA Gymnastics a new interim president by Tuesday she had resigned there were two major issues first that\nDoes the fact that means bono worked for a law firm that also represented Larry Nassar disqualify her from running USA Gymnastics yes next question All right and that question [laughter] the second issue to me as a bit more complicated\nIn September a month before she got the job Mary Bono treated an image and in it she was using a marker to blackout swoosh on her Gulf shoes\nAnd as anti Colin Kaepernick tweets go this one was pretty tame\nI might disagree with her point of view but I respect her right to express it\nYeah well first of all I missed the memo in which Mary Bono somehow became qualified to run usa your true backing them all she managed to alienate both Nike and Simone Biles\nWhen you've alienated the primary corporate sugar daddy and the face of your sport if really time to go and it's pretty convincing evidence that\nYou shouldn't have been there in the first place\nI mean what the USA Gymnastics do at this point at all bring anybody back\nThe Olympics will bring people back you will see what will probably be a Nike fueled run up\nTo the next Olympics where whoever represents the United states and God Knows Simone Biles is going to be one of them are going to be the redemption team they're going to be the ones who bring honesty and non criminal behavior back to women's gymnastics and it will sell because the Olympics will help itself\n[noise] Charlie you and I have been saying for a while that the best thing that the NFL could do regarding players who choose to Neal is absolutely nothing and they seem to have listened to us are you surprised\nNo because we're smart Karen and more people should listen to it [laughter] no I mean the basic problem the NFL had with the whole anthrax thing was they got three or four owners who were off the reservation on Jerry Jones\nBombing narrow down in Houston a church singing and kill and those guys are print pretty much marginalize if they didn't depart the league entirely white churches and was cooler heads prevail\nOr they realized that probably forty percent of their fans are at the beer stand during the anthem anyway and the ones that you know are offended by this\nStreaming support for WAMC comes

enough ice hockey players to field one team they had never played a game against an opponent so why has this team made international news\nFirst of all I Want Jersey Jersey I so bad [laughter] apparently Sidney Crosby and Nathan McKinnon help these guys come to Toronto to play against the team of firefighters and then Crosby imaging and played for the gang [laughter]\n... which is the last story on our on our segment every week is usually a funny one which is in a funny one this is an author and McKinney even have you got you can't really put out which is pretty good considering most of them did skate before last year\nThere's a video because of course it's sponsored by a coffee company and my favorite but it's one of the Kenyan players reaches out and like pot Sidney Crosby on the face and said is it really you know [laughter]\nI've always been you can still hockey anywhere if you give it a chance you could sell hockey in Kenya I Hope the lions practice very hard and are in the

Would super invested in in the LDS as I think a lot of people were because you know Yankees Red Sox first time meeting in the postseason since two thousand and four when I was also really invested but what was interesting to me about the series is that I went into it assuming that every fan would be judged for the rivalry and\nYet when I went to send way and Yankee Stadium also I found that fans weren't as dedicated to hating the other team as I expected them to be\nDo you think that part of the issue I mean besides the fact that the dragon was slain mouser for but also the red Sox and the Yankees these current teams are kind of a likeable didn't have enough jerks the red thought out and yeah you need more jerk for that rivalry to be really a food\nNo change in that exactly what people said at Fenway they were like we don't have the same characters you know there's there's not a lot and not to like\nAbout a lot more for\nGoing in a locker room and I get yelled at by Yankees PR

Sixers centered July al indeed had signed a five year deal with Under Armour it'll making the highest compensated player at his position and he told ESPN quote\nThere is a stereotype about big men that we can't sell shoes is that because she's look really weird and aside Seventeen\nYes I mean speaking as someone who bought\nAt a charity auction an autograph Shaquille O'Neal show out on which I Believe we're using as a car for [laughter] the problem with what they looked fine on the big men right but when you put them on a shelf\nThey look like art auction [laughter] but if anybody can do it it's Joelle envied who has charisma beyond belief um so I mean he's going to make a lot of money at this and he says he's not really a center anyway he thinks of itself a guard I mean you might as well think of his own as a Martian for all I'm concerned but you know this is the way the world is\nYeah I mean he said I'm not really a big man and of course he's certainly big he's seven feet tall but he thinks he can do at all which I guess means he can shoot the coaching staff of the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers to just add a stroke [laughter]\nThe college basketball corruption trial has been underway for a while now Charlie but the big allegations are starting to drop anything here that shocked shocked you yes\nWhat shocked me all along which is the FBI spending my money to become the enforcement arm or the NC double a\nThere is nothing you can do there isn't a bribe big enough to make me care about this bribery trial it's re criminalizing an underground economy the whole thing is

the real victim here the prosecutor say the victim is the university's fans might say at us but the New York times suggests that it's Bryan tags Boeing whose father agreed to take money from Adidas and as a result tags is now playing in Australia and\nWell there's nothing wrong with playing in Australia certainly has a really nice place but it's also not national television\nYou know I think Brian balloons going to be fine I think he's going to do was apprenticeship in Australia and come back and get drafted pretty high\nBut again the fact remains is the whole notion that somehow the universities have been victimized by these guys taking money from shoe company guys as though the university's haven't been accepting that as business as usual for Thirty years is one of the ways they've turned the bribery laws in this thing into a pretzel\nCharlie last week on the show we learned that the woman who is accusing event it's darker the honor and all the freight had compelling evidence in the form of a legal document in which we're now although admitted to non consensual sex\nNow we're in all the lawyer is saying that document was acquired in the computer hacking altered so now what\nWell this is one of the eight thousand reasons why I didn't go to law school I think certainly burden of proof is on ... on his lawyers to prove that thing was hacked that sounds like a very expeditious discovery all of a sudden\nOtherwise let's let this thing get litigated but I don't envy the judge it All right because it's clearly a lot of money on the side of Mr and all those who is capable of buying a lot of forensics\nYou've written a lot and your other jobs about the nature of truth and how hard it is you know you're out what is true and when people start calling into question legal documents\nI really get confused about what can we ... well I mean you know given the nature of how much we rely on computers these days there's always going to be somebody who knows more about it than you do so I mean it's a lot of institutions have been undermined or quote unquote disrupted which is apparently the term of art for it I mean I guess you just have to trust your instinct and understand that the legal process will grind on\nEuropean soccer has long had a problem with racist fans and Chelsea has decided that just fanning offenders from the stadium isn't changing things\nInstead they're going to give offenders the opportunity to quote spend some time with our diversity officers understanding what you did wrong and this time isn't going to be spent in a classroom\nRight oh they're going to take them to Auschwitz which I Will guarantee you most of these people will not connect with the black people their insulting it's a good idea\nYou know maybe they should all get on an airplane and go to the new anti lynching memorial down in Alabama that Brian Stevenson is plays put up I like inventive thinking on this sort of thing going on a road trip and go see what the end result of what you're doing it\nAnd finally Charlie I'm just going to let you explain what wouldn't stereotypes about the guy wearing number Thirteen when Hawaii Wyoming last Saturday Night\nHe wasn't [laughter]\nOrder but it'd be Wyoming by the way in his game Seventeen to Thirteen but they're starting quarterback Colin McDonald he had some sort of injury that they did not want to
