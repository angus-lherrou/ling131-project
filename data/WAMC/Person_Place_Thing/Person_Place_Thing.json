youth\nDoes your ... to the mall yes as I grew up it became more and more so\nI remember when there was a there was an outdoor mall and then there was the Livingston Mall which I think was built when I was about twelve and it quickly became a kind of destination um ... odd for a man he's a young people in and\nAnd of course very quickly certain malls I became a hatch just distinguish themselves to create certain different kinds of status this was a cheat mall this was a posh mall\nAnd then more even the word mall has to be changed so that and I think here in Manhattan they they created the shops at Columbus Circle because we're more with so degraded wealth\nBut I always thought if I wanted to live in Atlanta I've moved to Atlanta on you know\nBut that was but that's part of the ... but but but that's what the Manhattan has been a very suburban ice in so many ways\nAnd in in in justice we influence of it's such an impact in the city on the suburbs they have\nA a great impact the

forth I can say that it's it's just that there's less there was at least when I was growing up there was less going on um but that's for someone like myself culturally it it it was as some people might have described it as a wasteland and yet I'm a ... if\nYou were a consumed with a a sports in athletics there was a lot to do and that is that it wasn't all to find of course simply by the dream of shopping um uh uh it's just there wasn't much other than sports that that was going on\nAnd a cultural culturally and so uh one of the default um solutions was ah you go to the mall and if not to shop at least you have to imagine that you were actually doing something\nTo imagine you are doing\nDoing something meaningful when in fact you argue on something meaningful and that you are consuming even just the images the advertising and on the whiff of of ah ah the desire ability of all these things that perhaps you could buy are and how they might in fact change were alive\nBut you came to

in shopping if they're it's kind of ... there can even be an art to shopping the way in which you the ... the way in which you observe the way things are sold in the way you are able to\nAh see how that is ... how that reflects upon the world in which you live\nUm it's not all about a quiz Egyptian it said it it I mean that's the aim obviously for the the corporations but\nBut as a shopper there are different ways I think there is such a thing as as an arts in a creative way let's say of shopping\nUm uh it it just says a there is a creative way to all sorts of endeavors\nI'm a people often say that oh if you are an artist or a writer you must be so imaginative so creative but really there are many artists or many writers who are not terribly creative or imaginative\nAnd yet there are
