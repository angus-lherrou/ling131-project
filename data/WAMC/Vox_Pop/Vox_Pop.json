lander the New York state\nHistorian and I'm Don Wildman a New Yorker and explore of all things history\nThe basis of this podcast is the New York state museum and the state's capital of Albany established an Eighteen thirty six it is the country's oldest and largest state museum within its walls there are roughly one million cultural objects and more than sixteen million scientific specimens\nAll which helped told a remarkable story of New York and its citizens\nI Believe that not only are they understood relations not only drawn to the worm and\nI sometimes wonder whether people of the world and we have our own hungry and all of our own we align why do we aren't hungry on world\nAs Alfred e Smith the forty second governor of New York said the Empire State has a special place and it can be argued its history is essential when telling the story of the United states of America [noise] we\nThe Empire State has a special place and it can be argued its history is essential when telling the story of the United states of America we hope to make that case through this podcast a New York minute in history and by my side on this journey answer my questions and yours like is the historian for the entire state of New York\nSo Devon what is it about New York and New Yorkers that makes what happened within these fifty four thousand five hundred and fifty five square miles so unique\nWell Don to answer that I Would paraphrase Columbia University's eminent historian kind of Jackson and safe but it happened in New York\nFrom the era quite confederacy through European contact from the Dutch Ford orange through New York's explosion of immigration and diversity New York's history touches on all the major themes of America's history\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nI'm this episode of a New York committed in history will explore the empire states most ambitious engineering feat the Erie Canal\nTransformed upstate New York like I'm pressing time and distance providing the fuel for an explosion of population commerce communication and social change\nBut before this artificial river would slow it was simply an idea touted and anonymous essays written by Jesse Holly in the early Eighteen hundreds as the flower merchant spent months and debtors\nPrison the writings of the so called Hercules grab the attention of a New York politician named dewitt Clinton\nThe idea of the canal spanning the state from Albany to buffalo what would become known it's Clinton's ditch is the most notable impact and his two stints at New York's governor\nBut setting its future success and enormous impact aside why was New York chosen as a place to build what was it the time the nation's largest public works project\nTo answer that let's turn to my colleague at the New York state museum predator he's a senior historian and curator who has been focusing on the Erie Canal for the past four years for a major exhibits celebrating the bicentennial of the canals construction\nSo New York with the logical place for a canal to reach the great lakes was the only state that has a connection to the Atlantic ocean and the great lakes and it's the only complete pass through the mountain chains that get you through to the other side of the Appalachian mountain chain\nThe promise of economic expansion for New York and the people who are already doing business in the region where other contributing factors to determining the waterways location\nThe mohawk valley was fairly settled by the time construction began on the Erie Canal a farming communities and farmers who were able to make use of the river um for trade\nAnd further west not only do you have Native Americans but you have\nPockets of settlements of euro Americans Hugo was was quite a large place already and Kennedy ... buffalo\nI'm and other pockets Geneva had a small settlements not cities per se but there were there were certainly people out euro Americans out in western New York\nAnd um the challenge for them was was trade so you a lot of the farmers certainly in between the the bigger places had um substance farming\nAs opposed to cash crop just growing what they needed um neighbors were were very far apart and those who did try and trade ah found it easier\nWhat they needed um neighbors were were very far apart and those who did try and trade\nAh found it easier and and more economical to trade south through the ... river valley a down to Baltimore in Philly or north to uh Canada through the great lakes\nUm and this was a big factor in the ultimate decision to build the Erie Canal because as I mentioned it was cheaper to trade with everyone but New York city in Albany\nAnd geo political actions involving are young nation also solidified the need for a major trade routes from the eastern seaboard to what was then considered America's west\n[noise] the war of Eighteen twelve was actually a big factor in\nChoosing the root of the canal because the boar front in the early stages of of the war of Eighteen twelve between [noise] the British Canadians and Americans [noise] was on a western frontier of New York state and it was actually\nMore expensive to ship the cannon to buffalo from Albany that was to manufacture that can [noise]\nAnd\nSo transportation to our borders for national defense was lacking and it was extremely hard to for the generals to conduct of war the other factor is as I mentioned earlier it was easier\nFor western New Yorkers to trade with Canada and cheaper and after the war of Eighteen twelve Americans didn't really want to give their business to Canada and we wanted to promote trade from within\nAnd that helped establish that the canal should actually go to Lake Erie and not Lake Ontario ah Lake Ontario would have been shorter\nA it was already an established trade route and it it would have been easier but that factor where that we want to get straight to American territories in American states helped solidify the route to Lake Erie\nBut with such a huge undertaking there had been some debate or hang up not much gets passed in the state or nation without at least some contention\nVery true let's deal with the federal side of that\nCoin first they're actually um we're a couple of efforts in the federal Congress to have\nSurplus funds set aside for internal improvements which would be roads and canals it passed through the Congress only to be vetoed\nBy Jefferson and then Madison are claiming constitutional grounds although New Yorkers would tell you at the time that it was because uh the presidents did not want\nA New York to get an advantage over Virginia\nAnd really they're figuring out big government versus little government what were the roles of the federal government not everyone agreed that the federal government should be building roads\nOr or canals um or or the state governments for that matter so for New York to take this bold step in and say yes we want to\nBuild this canal we're going to raise the funds to do it\nUm they were making a statement that this was was possible under our\nForm of government and when it comes to New York state politics and ways of life upstate and the big apple tend to defer that was true then as it is today so part of the political\nChallenge to making the canal happened was that the more populous areas the Hudson River valley south or New York city in Long Island they were worried that they were going to get taxed to pay for this canal and did not have the trust of the politicians\nLong Island they were worried that they were going to get taxed to pay for this canal\nAnd did not have the trust of the politicians that that wouldn't be the case early on but they're also concerned about especially the the Hudson River valley farmers are concerned about the increase in competition from agricultural products coming from western New York\nLetters of a woman living in upstate New York who was writing to her relatives in Scotland and she was talking about how she was eating ... fresh seafood and she said something along the lines of we're two hundred miles from the sea but distance you know is reduced to nothing here she she made it clear that this this possibility to get sort of the comforts of home\nReally made it much more palatable to move out to the west\nWith the ability to travel and move goods uninterrupted day and night the canal short in time and distance\nThose factors were key to business and profit and wants to waterway was open it provided opportunities for various entrepreneur\nAs bread order up the New York state museum describes New York state was predominantly agricultural based\nAnd when the canal opened and you see a large numbers of immigrants going to Ohio and Michigan\nWhen the canal opened and you see a large numbers of immigrants going\nTo Ohio and Michigan and shortly within a few years their products are coming back\nAnd the grains were cheaper there were often better than what we could do in New York and so agriculturally speaking you've got a transition farmers can no longer compete\nWith the grains coming in it wasn't cost effective\nSo you start to see a transition to um produce apples and dairy products cheese milk\nWhere if you're closer to a city you know you need to provide milk to the city you need to provide she's so New York farmers turned a dairy in and produce as an answer to this\nCompetition or the other thing that happens is you get a large number of industrial centers or or industries that grow because of the canal all of a sudden you can get\nLarge amounts of clay from New Jersey to Syracuse searches has salt all of a sudden you can have stone where and it's easy to ship and you can you can manufacture almost whatever you want it used to be you had to be next to the source only but now you can get things iron ore out of the other on decks\nShipping down to um the capital district where they have large amounts of molding sand so then you have a large foundry industry and the capital district stoves and all sorts of of casting products plows\nAnd the other thing with the transition of agriculture is not to say they weren't growing grains\nBut it wasn't as cost effective to try and compete so you get a different level of it\nBut they also turn to each other in forming a cultural societies their cultural ... society of New York state um and it turned to the science of of of agriculture and\nSo they're trying to figure out ways what's the best kind of plow what's the best kind of fertilizer and this all adds to the industry possibilities along the canal court or and New York state in\nGeneral but with the economic progress came what some consider to be a variety of social ills and dishonest ways of life as Carol sheriff explains\nTo one thing that you would notice that people would write to state officials about the canal they might talk about um how they were very glad to have a law near their farm because that made it possible for them to set up a can outside business which they could where they could serve a vote man and passengers coming through\nBut at the same time they didn't like the fact that workers were congregating there because for many of these middle class religiously oriented people the workers who were coming seem very rough and lose life than she is and they thought that this was a bad influence\nFor their children so they wanted to have the benefits of progress but they didn't want to have what they saw as being a a moral cost of it and I think we see that\nWith the Internet as well that people worry about 'em you know what their children are going to have access to on the Internet\nI think their economic parallels as well people at the time the fact that you're doing business along the canal people you don't know in the previous world you would have had lots of personal interactions with people you were in business with that now you might never meet those people and they would talk about scams that people would [noise]\nYou know they would sell their flower but they were throwing rocks at the bottom of the barrel and so that it would seem to be like they were selling more more flour but they they couldn't really trace these people because that because of the sort of in personality that came along with with the count\nAs jak Kelly describes the promise of independence and the chance to strike it rich on the canal appealed to the younger generation\nThey came along with with a cow\nThat Jack Kennedy describes the promise of independence and the chance to strike it rich and the canal appealed to the younger generations\nLooking backwards we're a little bit deceived by because we have this image of the some men with ... ... ... ... and the ... coats and\nOh that was great great great grandpa back an old man but in fact as you mentioned the people that went out along there right now is not it was not an old man's a racket out there that was it was mostly young people are looking for opportunity looking for something new\nLife was pretty rugged that was the frontier that was the wild west in those days\nSo it attracted young people for example Rochester New York which was on the canal and really it was the first boom town I grew up along the canal they invented the term boom town\nTo apply to Rochester when it was booming three quarters of the people that live there were under thirty so it was really a youth movement or some people compared to the Nineteen sixties America's youth culture is very prominent\nAnd um I think just like young people in any age they were more open to change more open to spirituality they were they were searching as young people were in the sixties searching for something new something exciting something that was emotionally gripping\nThe canals merging of the young population new communities a rapidly changing way of life and the faster method of communication was fertile ground for reform movements highlighted the second great awakening\nTheory can we think of it is a great work in progress and it was but there were a lot of\n... to that progress and people were concerned about that they want to have the benefits of progress but they didn't want to have the cost of it and so I think they often turn to um you know to movements that allow them to improve society to perfect themselves in a religious sense to perfect others or bring perfect ability\nTo others and then I think just the canals opening up of\nNot just the commercial highway is that but also in a way for ideas to move there were many reformers he traveled you through the area they were tracks religious newspapers people who travel along the canal boats stopping at different towns to to try to to bring their ideas there\nAnd I think you know in a very little literal sense and allow for the movement of ideas\nAnd uh there was a great a movement back to religion I think partly because the constitution had not only guaranteed the freedom to exercise religion but it had ban the establishment of religion\nAnd the ... and those days not taken taxpayer money and paying the clergy and supporting the church in every town\nSo once that idea of an established church government authorized and sponsored church was gone there was a suddenly a big market for relations like anybody could start a religion all you had to do is attract enough followers\nThey would contribute to you and you you have your religion and going towards it opened up um opportunities for both very sincere people and people that were a little bit more marginal on the\nMargins of Charlotte and has them to start their own religions and to appeal to the\nMasses of people and see if they could get followers and\nA lot of people did it and particularly along the Erie Canal where people were moving into the frontier of moving away from the established traditions of New England and ah we're more open to the to these new ideas\nOne of the best known preachers at the time\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Tom ... what's the warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com\nThis church and studied to become a license minister and the Presbyterian Church\nWhen the Erie Canal opens in Eighteen twenty five he travels along it holding revival is rallies that drew thousands\nMany of these communities in the western end of the canal and that's really where there was kind of hot bed and spiritual and send them perform mindedness and what was called the burned over district famously name by Charles Fannie and he talked about how there have been so many fires in the evangelical revival isn't that the area was burned over\n... often preach themselves into exhaustion spreading his message in raising his public profile many saw the preachers teachings as a means to salvation and morality\nLeaders in the boom town of Rochester witness to drinking and other believed social wrongs invited Finney to reignite religious fervor in the city\nWhen there was this upsurge in some new religion going on\nFinney was sort of the middleman between the really wild frontier versions of Christianity\nAnd the various stayed and and traditional puritan Calvinist New England version\nHe had the ability to excite a lot of emotion to give a bit of an impression of heaven hell and Bible stories and so forth with this preaching and became you know developed techniques of a restrained emotion I Would put it that way\nThat was carried on by evangelists and revival is all the way down to Billy Graham\nSending would go on to promote the abolition of slavery and equal education rights for women and African Americans\nWhile Finney was a trained preacher one of the periods most striking religious movements came from a far more unlikely source\nAs a conspiracy theory and it was cited by Richard ... is a historian ... later on he cited this as an example of what he called the paranoid style\nOf American history that the people had had jumped onto this conspiracy theory and it was somewhat like in his time was the McCarthy Era of hysteria finding communist around every corner\nSo um it was a remarkably long lived phenomenon in the sense that fifty some years later they put up a monument in Batavia which is we're Morgan had lived a huge pillar and statue of Morgan as murder to free speech\nFor trying to write this book and then being probably killed for doing so\nThe Morgan highlights how the spread of information change because of the canal\nBoth through its influence and its intention\nAmerica had always had a pretty high level of literacy\nBut uh if you go back to the time of the revolutionary war it was just paper was expensive of printing books was expensive and they were sort of the the um circulated mainly among people that were wealthy\nBy Eighteen twenties and thirties the price of newspapers in books and so forth had dropped considerably\nSo um they became a vehicle for information or we think today of ah the various newspapers or Web sites or whatever whatever you're considering that are politically biased\nNewspapers in those days and through much of American history newspapers were very biased and there was a man in Rochester named furlough weed\nAnd he was a a newspaper publisher and also a political operator he was sort of a um the Karl Rove of his day and\nHe latched onto the antenna sonic movement and changed the name of his paper to the ... or whatever it was and became a whole hearted proponent of anti Semitism\nAnd helped with the clerk formation of the political party and so forth there were dozens of anti ... newspapers in different towns around first in western New York and an farther afield\nSo there was um information available and ... and moved quickly or because of the canal they were able to get word from New York to buffalo in a matter of days instead of months so that would have been just a little bit earlier\nTalk about new ideas\nSupport for streaming WAMC comes from the Davis financial group providing the base financial planning and wealth management services to individuals families and business owners and the pioneer valley and beyond Davis financial G. R. P. dot com\nAs we dug into the impact of the Erie Canal the parallels between the worldwide Web and the waterway continue to avail themselves so\nWe've spoken to a number of historians who obviously you've told us about what happened in the past I think it's time to look into the present and dig further into those parallels [noise]\n[noise] I'm ... I'm the director of the Institute for data exploration and applications at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute\n[noise]\nNow before professor handler makes the connection between the Internet and the Erie Canal let me just interject with is interesting though RPI intro in New York just north of Albany is described as the oldest technological University in the English speaking world\nNow remember there were no civil engineering schools in America when they started building the Erie Canal well the school and the banks of the Hudson started producing the country's first civil engineering degrees and Eighteen thirty five coincidence I think now\nSo what happened in both cases you had some visionaries who looked ahead and said we need to be able to go somewhere we can go now and we need to get there fast\nAnd then what happened is as that infrastructure started coming in case of the canal when it was starting to get finished when people were starting to really start to move the first boats on it\nPeople realize they can do a lot more than was originally and vision so I think the early days of the Web was going to be something that was actually even e commerce was being debated were we going to be able to buy things on it hard to believe [noise]\nNowadays but it was really seen as just a way to make people across the world able to talk together faster\nLike the Erie Canal the Internet and the world Wide Web created opportunities few imagined when they were being built\nSo you know there's an old saying in science that anytime you can make something ten times faster you can change it drastically\nI think the surprise in the Web was just how much it could be used for\nDifferent things both positive and negative so you know now most of the money on the Web is being made by advertising actually in the early days it was pornography but meanwhile is creating the business that eventually became Amazon than thanks so it was used for many many different things in what\nOriginally the assumption was that was going to be sort of like television very few people most people would just sit and watch stuff and then very quickly it became clear that it was it was really exactly about ease of\nUse of doing stuff I could buy something faster I could look at more things I could go check out things and then as it became social networks and picture sharing and messaging it it's just all about faster communication how soon can I get something to someone\nIn a way that I used to not be able to and like the second great awakening social media has created and or fueled movements that likely never would have happened if not for their rapid distribution via the Internet you know becoming famous for being famous almost in in a way that I'm told the the canal did\nAnd some of the really interesting things we see on the Web what we also often referred to as a viral video or viral means something for ... for no one's quite sure why are doing well in the early days those red containment\nBut then they started becoming more meaningful when and whole movements grow around that look at um [noise] you know sort of it was first used to watch for getting people out them into physical sciences but then you have things like black lives matter and things that we're just the social media impact\nYou know sort of it was first used a lot for getting people out and into physical space but then you have things like black lives matter and things that we're just the social media impact of being able to see things\nThat had been going on for a long time and now suddenly not only could you see one but you can see lots of them from any place that I have a feeling you had that same kind of\nFunneling effect now suddenly coming through the canal on either end was a lot of information from a lot of different places that the other side\nAnd that that bringing it together really is something new and on the Web of course that's around the whole world\nBut it can be in your neighborhood lot of discussion nowadays requires things like fake news and stuff like that and again once you got that communication then people can start putting up their messages which may not be the same as your messages religions can spread in ways they\nCouldn't before a small group of people who might have lived in different towns along the canal can suddenly now be in touch with each other and form a group\nOr a ... and we see that kind of thing on the Web is this group formation this ability of\nThings that that you know those are the bad part with him in some ways and some what we're trying to explore how to change is you know people can communicate about anything including things you don't like and you know people can get move a in those days physically here now more [noise]\nA character assassination reputation and all those things really changed very rapidly because of the fast [noise]\nSophie\nCovered how the Erie Canal reshaped upstate New York and the country but what happened to the canal itself I mean people in goods don't travel by barge any more\nTo turn back to the historians first up is Brad under the New York state museum so as soon as the canal open completely from Albany to buffalo there were already calls for hey let's make it bigger\nIt was an immediate success they can now assume choked with boats boats long lines at locks\nAnd so as the revenues were coming in they said okay we we can invest in making a larger in Eighteen thirty six they started the first in March of the canal so you've got the original which people refer to as Clinton stitch\nAnd then the enlarged canal starts in Eighteen thirty six in the large sections as they went I was not completed and or declared complete until Eighteen sixty two due to political and financial wranglings if you will\nReally second half of the nineteenth century railroad is becoming very strong\nVery strong opponent to the canal and they started to control prices that they bought up warehouses along the canal system especially in Buffalo New York city and they made it difficult to ship I can now these are the robber barons of the railroad um however\nThe one thing that saved the canal or one of the things to save the canals that\nPeople saw the canal as a check\nOn the monopoly that the railroad was gaining so the railroad had the advantage of lower prices during the boating season to match the canal and inject them up in the winter time to make their different sort of make money in Eighteen Ninety eight a governor",

I think it's more like the paper and have all athletes have sauce to go\nWhere you are right on hand yes um\nYou know they say oh get out get ... you know an F freshener I don't want to hanging air freshener I Want my God it's\nNot like nothing had always said yeah um if it it has an eleven and a silver forester\n... by any chance notice this past summer since it was so hot and humid right at when you're in your air conditioner that you're floors got wet in the car\nAnd help and I've had my hands down there I've played ... paper towel stepped on it to see if there's any moisture and now it's ... it's leather seats I've had my nose I think my DNA as an every inch of that\nCar that coming from\nI thought maybe the you know let them get Callie inside of the car by the um a dashboard was disintegrating yeah that it doesn't seem to be coming from that because all that heat we've had a hot summer\nWell so here's what I see a lot um\nAnd there was a caller earlier today that had a road that have gotten in his a heater\nYes I listened about that lower motor\nIt would be nice to have somebody look at your cabin air filter\nWhere the air goes in and see if debris has gotten past it and it's down in your heater air conditioner housing which could be causing some um some type of uh mulder mildew or\nOr just decay of of something that got in there\nOr the other thing that we see a lot happening is the ... a drain for the air conditioner which carries the water out of the card drips it out on the ground in the summer\nUh-huh plugs and then the water backs up in your air conditioner housing in that water a starts to a developed some bacteria and smells and okay so two things um make sure that a sea drain is clear how to shop ...\nYes have him go in with a a mirror flashlight were that cabin filter a sea of road and is there any rodent activity or debris\nUm and if you find that that's the case get it as clean as possible and they do make some disinfect things sprays that go in there\nAnd if you find that that's the case get it as clean as possible and they do make some disinfect things sprays that go in there\nBut they sometimes have a pretty strong odor so if you're if you're a sensitive to odors you want to be careful what goes in there that can be a big problem we see that a lot I Know exactly what you're going through\nOh okay I'm hit everybody says oh you're not going to die from it you know could there at the bacteria those I mean could that be bad for your lungs\nI haven't heard that it causes any health issues in cars like it like you can have in a house where the where the ... like mad in the walls because there's so much air going through that heating system I don't think that's an issue in OK\nOkay the only thing I haven't done that I've been meaning to do is take it to a car wash to have the under carriage wash ... think that what hell\nNo I don't think the smells coming through the floor from the outside but what I Would recommend is after you confirmed that the housing is good and all the drains ... where\nAre you could go to a detail shop where they will steam those carpets you know those the floor it's in your car yeah where they are very hot a distance affecting a cleaning solution\nThat's that's what I Would do at the end right okay\nWe'll have that very good and I don't know if anybody's check those things you know I'm ... I Know that when they uh cabin felt it was changed that's from the inside not from the outside right\nWell but that's filtering outside here so they're like\n... so they should have been looking then on the ... I've lifted up the Hudson can't see anything\nOn it from that ... inside and maybe take out the blower motor\nAlready knows he thinks a lot for the call smells like cooking pasta that's a new one Russ not a bad smell really is it or would be worse right in fact I've smells a lot worse inside of cars let me tell you it let's go to Roberta in Rotterdam Roberta\nHow oh sure\nI have two thousand six chain till I oughta category which I Love like or one and I got it in that\nAnd maybe this time go for a ride with your boyfriend writing in the back of the car just to to home in on the weird that sound is coming from\nI've gone to protest drives in the trunks of cars or you have not yes me in the trunk of my one of my guys driving the car or sometimes the owner of the car to tell where sound is coming from and that's what I gotta do you've got to\nDo no wait a minute we do not get it the trunk of a vehicle\nThat we're not saying that legal department when I got back back there would not recommend that we recommend\nThat well you can fold the seat down and you know I Need you need to get somebody's ears in various locations because sounds in cars can can transfer ... where you think they're coming from some times the ABA sorry but my ...

V. yeah and what it does is it okay it doesn't shift through gear speeds like you're accustomed to okay step on the gas the engine rubs up feeling low lurch and it goes the engine slows down and you're going through increasing gears\nWhere us a constant a variable transmission is seamless it the power comes on and it just glides up in a glide down\nUm industry has used or CDs and snowmobiles and some four wheelers use them they have a belt that drives them so there's no gears shifting anymore okay um so\nTo answer the question about the modes a sport mode keeps the engine revved higher as its up shifting through the rangers so you have more power available or feels like you're celebrating greater which you are\nAnd when you put it in ... in winter it actually does the opposite of sport it loads the engine down makes it shift up faster it robs power from the engine so is to prevent wheel spin and slippery condition okay and the last\nPart of the lock mode yeah lock mode is your ... is yours yours is an outlandish\nSo it's all wheel drive correct yeah the the lock is to uh join your front and rear a dry chefs for optimum traction in bad weather okay so that's a window slippery whether mode now what about the service\nAbsolutely critical so it needs to happen when they say it does\n[noise] uh there's more things in there that are rubbing against each other a so fluid maintenance is very important on a a a variable transmission and the fluid is very expensive um\n... Nissan ... is I think it's a close to thirty dollars huh war okay and so you're meant to be horribly closed is a lot of that expense is the special fluid\nSo do the service when they say absolutely All right norm thanks a lot for the call our number\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Tom ... what's the warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com or been western mass Rob Iran\nGentlemen thank you I have a two thousand six not sob nine seven acts the four point to\nWrite recently recently a dashboard light all the gas or light started linking\nRadio going in and out fraud and chewing dealer people actually still service solve out here to enjoy dealer told me I had a module that cost five hundred dollars et cetera plus labor nine hundred dollars total to replace it\nYup had\nA a disgruntled former Chevy mechanic told me to check the ground the wire does that sound reasonable to you well I haven't done that yet\nThere isn't really just one ground wire but yes ground circuits are extremely critical on any component and the lower the voltage some more sensitive it can be to that\nSo we always there were always testing powers and grounds to any module just to be sure it's not that simple\nBut that instrument cluster and that's what they're talking about replacing correct\nOr not the extra cost her it was actually at the bill attract module\nOh what so I thought it was your uh what warning lights were going what what was going crazy on it\nEvery dashboard light was going in and out and I believe that's why the Chevy mechanic thought it might be a short verses Knoxville module going back okay\nBut it's but it's just it's a stability track problem is what has been traced to correct yes so that's the bill attract module ah can be trouble\nAnd\nEarlier versions of that vehicle cars that vehicle is basically a a Chevy Trailblazer yes um had a lot of trouble with the modules getting wet in the location of was on the right I'm a pillar down lower\nA water would seep through the windshield or the body um where the bodies were seemed together and get the ...

it fees and that grass is dead it's not coming back\nYou have to read it which you could do now where you could do in the spring and or if you treat it with one of these new window physically in his grass as I said no it's been around for years there's some grasses that are resistant to the church going\nAnd they don't eat it so you'd want to get something that has insect resistant grass it but

just literally plant those sim you're going to use 'em or somewhere else in the spring so you just want to kind of hold them through the winter so the easiest way to do that leave him in the containers big holes just as deep as a top of the container and a plan on pot and all I Would leave 'em up maybe an inch or so it's just that you can get a hold of the container for\nThe summer that going to be able to plant them that's the problem you can't have them in no and they were\nOkay so then you've got to you've got to mulch them in um they can't come into your home they they won't they won't make it through the winter actually they need to go to sleep and stay sleeping they need to be outdoors um so you do need to get most up to the top of those containers otherwise the winter winds will end up probably\nI Would I Would be inclined not to lay them down and most of the whole thing because you know I Would read a wire but for an animal to get in either of us ... yeah yeah\nSo so you know in the um in our our business we might have some plants left over at the end of the year and a though we have some um different storage mechanisms just pushing all those parts together we have five or six or ten boss making a little box\nIf you have a a house or a garage that has the north side has no sun whatsoever you could make that little grouping on that side that believe it or not that the the most protected side for the winter and then when it gets cold\nThanksgiving or thereabouts as um everyone's been saying just push some ... around the pots and then you should be pretty well see that\nYou could also bring them into an owner heated structure her garage or a bar and I've done that many times and and just get them out of the wind and the weather and that'll be enough so that might be sending on\nWhat plans it is and how bad the winner gets right um and everything around those roots though are going to help it just a lot easier yeah what about watering even water and then now and be done with it yeah there we go to if there was a when you're really dry out you know I don't imagine you and and I would say neither one of your own wedding them\n\n\n\nWhat

good point and and especially with a raise but it's going to be even more of a factor because the ph is going to be even easier to adjust you don't have the buffer and capacities up the soil and I'm

Paris in two thousand Fifteen are not enough to keep global warming from rising more than two point seven degrees Fahrenheit above pre industrial temperatures\nSo most most of the extra energy that our planet receives from global warming actually is stored in the ocean most of it is not even used to warm up our planet directly it gets stored in the ocean and then over time it's it's get released\nAnd that happens every few years but what triggered the event\nThat I mean you're then you're okay now it gets a little more complex\nAll right well we'll take a break here in a moment for you have twenty seconds and then I think we wanted to follow up\nOkay so El Nino events basically what they are at the ocean and the atmosphere they talk to each other they interact with one another and they do this on different time scales and that leads to the ocean basically being quiet for a while taking up all the energy and then at some point the ocean is it's enough I got to release all is

a cost on carbon\nIs needed to help us move more quickly you know if if your if your goal is to move quickly you've got to put a price on the things that you want to discourage so um how do you do it\nAre the best way that I have heard her I've looked at a lot of different systems is one put out by a citizens climate lobby and uh also of a few other groups where you would put a fee on the

address how climate changes impacting on threatening agriculture\n\nIs a good question it depends a little bit to where you are and what part of the world the biggest threat for agriculture is not here in the north east um the largest changes are the biggest threats they expect to see in tropical of agents that are already very hot today\nA that's a number of um crops that have upper limits on that hates tolerance that will not produce so not grow when it gets too hot read this one such example\nSo they think the biggest problem for food production a global scale will be in and tropical countries but there's certainly a suspect in the U.S we see this today already a during periods of extreme drought for example\nSo increase drought an increased he puts a lot of stress on many crops including soybeans and corn et cetera\nAll right this one is from David and a few rights given the deadline of approximately twelve years originally announced where humans to change their behaviors\nThat adversely affect the climate of planet earth what are the most practical things than average citizen should do in light of this warning and should not voting for political leaders who will take appropriate measures be at the top of the list and that drum David\n[noise] [noise] yeah I think are looking at a political leaders and getting them to put climate change and actions uh uh to to address it on the top of their list is very important and voting is the way to get their attention\nAll right this one is the last female will do and then we'll get back to the phones a lot of

sites coming from\nUm above sort of the greenhouse gases we ... we can measure the energy that goes into the planet system and we can measure the energy that's going out and it's an imbalance and it's caused by greenhouse gases\nNo I think Samuels question was could be earthquakes because ... the increase of feet on the surface of the earth\nNo earthquakes are costs by plate tectonics place that um

and hitting Sheila um but you're saying that the money does flow back to the household say you have income constrain senior it's for home the kid in class or a big issue and you have a lower income families and\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nNegative how are you going to how do you how do you persuade them that actually they were they come out ahead of the game paying higher prices how how does that work economically\nOkay um that's a good question and and it's one that has to be taken very seriously as you design a system\nFirst of all ah I've seen a number of studies that indicate that lower income people actually come out ahead\nThe greatest energy use as a by the higher income uh segments of the of the population not the lower income segments I'm the U.S treasury a Internal Revenue service tax or analysis unit put out a very nice paper\nIn January of ... of twenty Seventeen it's working paper one one five\nAnd it has a ... a ... analyzed what happens to a different groups in the population if you refund or what you collect\nAnd the bottom or Seventy sixty to Seventy percent of income earners do better\nNet net on their uh after tax income with with that kind of a system now implementing it may you still have to have some special safeguards for a at risk parts portions of the population or so but\nThe basic idea of getting it on the back to everybody so that they can decide what's best for them or seems to work thank you\nThanks and we appreciate the call our number is eight hundred three for eight to five five one Lou al ... and with the U.S we are here to answer your questions and let's now go to Steven in Berlin Steven\nUm another up soon is that you sequester carbon for example like ... which is another of each company where they take the carbon right at that a site\nWhere um they extract oils from the north to see the reason they're doing that is because nobody has a carbon tax and it's actually cheaper for them to sequester the carbon injected underground again so there's an incentive there\nAnother way but that's really something that we have not developed to a point where it could be deployed is to try to actually um sequester carbon right out of the air so basically install big shelters where you feel to the air\nAnd um you at ... the carbon with some rescued you and you again come precedent injected on the ground the problem right now is that for all of these um programs and it's very very expensive for not at the point where we can really use that to college in a large scale\nYou may recall that for Twenty years ago ten Fifteen Years ago uh the coal industry was talking about clean coal mhm this is what they were talking about it never happened it's too expensive\nOr that doesn't mean that we shouldn't be a doing research on trying to a sequester carbon or possibly a trap carbon dioxide that's already in the atmosphere but it's expensive and it's going to take a massive\nEffort to based on just what I Know of as un report anything we do is going to

I'm not as familiar with this but this sounds like there might be an issue with somebody paying their mortgage or making payments on the on the reverse mortgage\nI've actually researched into this and what happens is on when the value was established\nFor the reverse mortgage say they value the house at a hundred thousand and it's been five years and now they've already been able to cash out that hundred thousand and they're continuing to cash out on it where they stopped cashing out on it now the has technically its upside down\nThat so they owe more on the house and the house has actually valued and they may not be able to pay that back this is why I had had taken it over\nSo you need to figure out who who to call you need to speak to hide in to see what red tape you have to get through to get to the right people and whatever the difference as you might be able to buy out the house for whatever owed\nUs off with aps a lawyer would be the best option at this point\nProbably yes yes I mean you could try calling an eight hundred number see how far you get with them it really depends on how deep into the paperwork and into Hyde it's it's already been in and what needs to

Lewis of Alexander Monticello here to answer your real estate questions we go to sue north ...\nHi I'm I was calling about my house I had planned on putting it on the market um this fall but there was more work than I anticipated so it's not quite ready yet\nAnd it's probably going to be in a two hundred thousand range I'm just wondering um you know what you say as as a local market and maybe the spring\nUm is there any advantage to try to rush through and and get this on the market say within the next month or wait till the spring\nWe've talked about this the seasonal ah aspect to this whole thing and I think there are differing opinions who wants to go first\nAll right let me go first so yes there is obviously that's being marketed when everybody gets their homes and the market\nOn the lake the big thing that I discuss with my sellers and my clients that may want away is when we enter the market we have a lot more competition so we are no longer leading the market we may be following the market and doing what everybody else is doing\nA if you could I Would probably way to the holidays on just because it does slow down and if you need some time you know choose that time to get everything done\nJanuary February the winter market not a lot of ... out there you are the seller can lead the market and price it maybe a little bit higher\nBecause there isn't going to be a lot of um you know it's a virus looking and you might be able to get a little bit more for your home at that point so don't went to market scare you I think it's a great time to get the house and the markets that it's a new year people are excited\nHopefully the interest rates don't go up anymore and you should be and I go to\nThe showers you concur yeah I mean I so I I think uh a couple of things to watch um interest rates are rising a little bit ah and if interest rates continue to rise that could that could eat into the buyers purchasing power\nUm so I pay attention to interest rates the other thing is two years ago in December we had a really busy December that was right after the presidential election um for some reason there was a lot of pent up demand I think we're buyers were holding back and interestingly enough between\nYou know like November seventh and January first it got really really busy um so I don't know with all the attention on this election if there will be a similar burst of buyer demand\nOn but one tip I could give you is right now when when you get the sunny day maybe tomorrow it looks like it's going to be a sunny day I Would take some outdoor photos of the yard front of the house to the back of the house so if you do decide to list alternately in January at least you have some photos where the grass hiring\nSo you don't really thank you so you don't really want to take pictures with the smell piled up to the window\nYou can't if you have to but it's always nice to show the green grass right\nVery interesting so that's a psychological ... you've proven that this this psychology works over an hour we\nWill certainly pictures matter in terms of selling the house yeah I think\nIt works in reverse as well as you know you see all this thing in the summertime that has now I'm at a no good [laughter]\nAnd it gets even worse if you have a pool right if you're trying to sell a house with a pool um it's a deal to sell it when it's Ninety degrees in\nJuly when you're like oh and I'm trying to show how old the covers very Troy says no I'm not not not as he learned fair enough or let's go to Robert in Greenfield Robert ...\nAh yes I was just wondering um\nNo I'm not not not as eating right fair enough uh let's go to Robert and Greenfield Robert Iran\nUh yes I was just wondering um my partner and I we decided he'd like his ashes spread around property but recently decided that perhaps\nYou should just be buried on the property or without you know and how to wondering how that might affect the value of the property five acre lot you know and there's no restrictions in the local governments\nWho that's I've never told jumping I Would never ever have any there you know I I\nI think there's two things to consider here the value of the property in the wishes of your partner and what's more important um ... maybe that's that's the way to look\nAt it I don't think that would be anything that needs to be that's close to you\nWhat was the only ones who are now yes yes but the ashes\nAre no go ahead we originally wanted ashes but then I'm asked to cremation has a huge a carbon footprint so we thought perhaps just bearing um body on the property in a in a green way\nYeah that that that may be a full disclosure something that you may have to disclose when you sell the property and it clearly you know potentially I'm a little bit of a concern on the buyer and that's a new one but it is it really is a new and I I mean I've had pets buried in the backyard that a little\nBit overwhelming I found a um\nI guess it would depend on that city town and county rules in rags on maybe check into that first talked to some local realtor to see what they say and again I I Do agree with Alex Gino respect your partner's wishes and you know ... on on the value and so I\nThink I couldn't be more helpful thanks a lot you know a good guess in the old days was fairly common can be normal to him to do to\nThat we had to pay a lot of money that was found on the inspection of house certainly not that that were open it's actually and I didn't know there was any course of course actually take take Libya that\nWell I mean a couple of thoughts in just reiterating with what I said to the other caller New York is a buyer beware stage so um you know if the sellers provided a property condition disclosure statement\nI don't think they did\nOkay um so you know I'm not a you know if if they didn't provide a property condition disclosure statement I'm I'm not sure there is any recourse I'm\nA you know the other the other complication you're going to have is one proving that the defect existed\nAt the time you purchase dead and then even if you did that um if the person is has a short sale or it sounds like they weren't able to to make their mortgage payments had to get out of their house you know how to how even if you had a viable legal Kate how would you actually get money from the seller uh sounds like they may not be financially capable 'em\nLoose in the short sales in the house is not being told by the bank but still by the owner\n... the owner is selling the property but he he or she is doing it with the cooperation of the bank because the bank is going to take a haircut on their mortgage um but what I Would say is just maybe checking with your attorney and see if they have any uh potential ideas but it sounds like this one might be really difficult\nOr Lisa thank you for the call and sorry we don't have better news for you have to take a quick break eight hundred three for eight to five

phones for the final moments on the program several moments ago if you want to call by the way are you going for three or four to five by one number this were given from mark\nA when buying a car even a person with bad credit or no credit confined several winters were willing to work with them why does this happened in the housing market especially with supplied being what it is where can a person with bad credit or no credit find a good lender by the way are you know if you're buying a two hundred thousand dollar Mazda rotter you'd maybe don't want to get that\nRight correct I think it really depends on why that credit is not good I'm with the bankruptcy with their unpaid ... is there too much debt to income\nUm there are some lenders that will work with you with a lower credit score however feel under five hundred it's it's going to be pretty much impossible to get into a home and the reason they do that it's because\nWhen you die and your credit to debt ratio is that low you probably cannot afford a mortgage payment\nThey don't want to put you on a home where you're going to default on a mortgage and not and be house apart and put you in that position so much much stricter in the housing market going back ten years ago at the subprime with a big indication of what happens\nI'll just add that if you're looking to repair your credit I think the Affordable housing partnership which is a non for profit offers those services or they might even be free so that might be something you want to look into\nAll right Michael thank you for that email is go back to the phones of eight hundred three or four eight to five five one I'm Teresa Teresa in Albany is uh [noise]\nI [noise] All right\nWe had um purchased a house in April and we did have a property disclosure and sellers disclosed that they had had a bad back on septic tank that had been repaired\nAnd ... that the ... that changed them onto your prior to ask perched in the house and the day we moved into septic system backed up in the basement\nAnd we've been battling with septic system problems since that we had to replace the pipe that went from house to the bank um it was crushed we've had to replace the type that ... that was crushed and broken in several places um what kind of records do we have ... or\nSo again the standard is you have to be able to prove that the seller had actual knowledge of the effect\nI'm so and so it it you know one scenario is right they they were aware that there was a baffle 'cause that's what they saw and that's what they're stopped the company told them but they were on aware of the other issues um and that would probably be their defense but ... you would in order to to have a claim against them you'd have to prove that they had actual knowledge of those other issues\nUm you know maybe talking to their their septic company who services septic tank and ask them where they ever called to do any other repairs or did they ever get any estimate to do any of that work and decide not to pursue it\nUm you know but it's again it's a very steep hill to climb 'cause you have to prove that the seller had actual knowledge um and so I'll just also say that you probably would want to check in with your attorney is well does that answer\nStreaming support for WAMC come from birch are Center for weight loss surgery with a focus on life
