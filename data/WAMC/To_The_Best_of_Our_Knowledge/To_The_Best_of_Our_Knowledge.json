before\nAnd as I tried to point out in the book had affect many many years after because one for is the gun it just does not have limits in time as the war waged in Latin America shows it doesn't have limits in space\nWell I guess that's my final question is what is the legacy of the war in Latin America\nWell we'll never know how the government's which were turning pro democratic\nTowards the end of the war as many of them not all of them remember they had pretty much entered the war is dictatorships but\nThe war especially the victory of the allies and the Roosevelt four freedoms gave space to democratic forces in many of these countries a free press a labor students\nHour by that I mean the United states a counter espionage presence was run by J Edgar Hoover a very very famous anti communist\nAnd there was a tendency to be suspicious of these democratic movements and to support the more conservative right wing groups and of course\nThe United states was able to be president where before your was more the place that Latin countries looked to for culture and education then models they looked more to the United states after the war so\nYou know Bob we'll never know what the

assessing the impact of individual dams on individual systems\nEven though the Andean Amazon is only a small portion of the entire Amazon basin it really is important to the whole system\nThe majority of the sediments in the nutrients and much of the water that feeds the lately and Amazon comes from the Andes\nSeveral thousand species of fish also live in the base and many of which migrate from the land to the Andes for spying\nWe hope that by showing regional trends and showing that widespread river alteration is happening our research will encourage more coordinated development highlighting the importance of keeping some rivers free flowing in the Amazon\nWe have a big opportunity to preserve Amazon reverse which should be the focus of new initiatives for environmental conservation

volunteering with improve mood leading some to recommend volunteering to older adults who might be otherwise isolated\nBut the research has a few problems it's hard to determine whether the ... comes from the pro social aspect of volunteering from helping others or from the social contact these activities typically provide\nSecondly we don't know whether people who are generally happier tend to volunteer whether volunteering contributes to being happier the research has shown correlation not causation\nThird we are taught to size that volunteering help some people but not others based on individual characteristics in our study we split older adults into three groups one group imagine the pro social activity one group I imagine they surely social activity and the control group imagine a neutral activity\nWe found that only those who scored high on social responsibility a measure of how much they valued responsibility towards others experience more positive aspect and the pro social condition compared to the social or neutral conditions\nIn fact those who scored lower an altruistic orientation and measure of how connected you feel towards others reported greater negative emotion

social behavior is connected to your value system and personality if you don't value helping others or feel particularly connected to them volunteering is not going to make you happier\nAnd it may

last three or four decades have not changed dramatically the coverage of those incidents and the reports have\nAnd universities are are working or order are scrambling to address what is now perceived as a crisis so what happened in the sense of hope that becoming more glaring as far as the the understanding that this was going on\nWell up a couple of things happened which is I mentioned that the Obama administration's letter from two thousand eleven it was two thousand eleven it was called a dear colleague letter and it was about\nTitle nine and how that all night had to do with sexual assault and harassment and schools how to deal with it and so that letter ... university on notice and of course one of the things that happened was suddenly the threat of university losing federal

done to freeze and she's talking with the best of our knowledge is Joe Donahue about her new book consent on campus a manifesto while talking about sexual assault Joe brought up the topic of hook up culture on campus\nWell I Want to say first off the hook up as not by definition of sexual assault by any means um hookups can be many things that can be sexual assaults but they're certainly not always\nI think what generally students understand hookups as you know it's a it's some form of sexual intimacy it can be anything from kissing to various kinds of sexual intercourse with some form of sexual intimacy it's brief\nAnd I'm In theory it happens one but you know it may happen multiple times over the course of however long between two students\nBut then the third criteria is they're not supposed to get attached and in fact there is supposed to be apathetic about the sexual intimacy itself and about their partner so you're supposed to be able to walk away not caring about that person\nYou know in theory\nHookups there as opposed to these very empowering hum sexual encounters where students are able to sort of be with whoever they want to have this very exciting experience and then and then have to be temporary or or momentary\nThat would be great I think if students experience than that way but in reality you know hookups generally happen in a culture is looking up and in a culture of hooking up you have these new arms that are handed down to students\nAnd you know one of those neurons is that you're not supposed to care about your partner and you know you're not supposed to be attached to them and sex is supposed to be kind of meaningless it's supposed to be casual in a in a very literal sense\nAnd I think what's problematic for hookups when we're thinking about a culture of hooking up and those norms I just described\nAnd then consent which asks a person to check in with their partner to care about them to consider them in the context of you know sexual intimacy I think that it presents a paradox and so I think a culture of hooking up so not just individual hookups but a culture of looking up\nPerpetuates or feeds right into this idea we have of of rape culture which is you know where we talked about rape culture is systemic sexual violence as the circumstances are the conditions in which sexual violence can flourish and I do think that\nThe norms within a culture of hooking up include not caring about your partner you know this regarding your partner apathy towards your partner considering facts as a meaningless act that and I think that presents a real problem for ... because I think consent asks the opposite\nYou run into jumped through the book called the hierarchy of Bobby use\nYou write about women are socialized to blame and to doubt and you're right there is yet another type of shame and blame the dissent powers women the shame and blame we've learned to direct on ourselves girls and women are sort of was to monitor their own behavior and be aware of how it might invite\nWrong kind of attention how do we change that\nWell I mean I Would say that the question is how how do we change the way\nStreaming

no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog harness dot com\nTo to to sex and two two women if they're heterosexual and so\nYou know I think one of the things we need to do is just backing out from there as we need to do a lot of work as a culture in terms of sex education\nYou know we don't necessarily raise our children to be empowered sexual ... we don't raise them to ask big questions about who they are who they are in relation to sex what effects mean to them what do they want from it\nYou know I think there is a kind of lack of sexual self possession or sexual assaults awareness if you will\nYou know among both men and women of course this really creates problems and insecurities when young men and women become high school students and then and then college students and so I think we need to back up\nAnd ask questions about all genders\nAnd what is going on that you know we're raising our kids to to not be empowered around these issues to not have confidence with regard to themselves but also um their decision making around sex\nSo to wrap up I mean you you write this book is called the action for universities and faculty parents and students creed cultures of consent on their campuses and you write about what can be done\nSo as we include where do you think we are you mad and where does your optimism why in those points being made on\nWell I Would say we're really close we are also really far\nWhat I'm proposing and in the book is real practical advice on okay if we're going to try to tackle systemic sexual violence how can we do it and\nI think it needs to happen in the classroom there is no way that we can tackle this issue systemic societal issue with a one hour you know event at the beginning of freshman year and then maybe like a human resources like tutorial that everybody's got to take on campus like that's not where you deal with systemic issues\nI think you need to move the conversation into the classroom of course we have all the resources to do that right you know universities are full of classrooms\nAnd universities are full of brilliant minds who are specifically you know thinking about systemic issues and how to tackle them and so I Would say we're close in the sense that\nI think universities already have all the all the resources they need\nTo begin to tackle this problem and to try to transform it but I think the hurdle is of course you have to get people on board and thinking about consent more broadly about sex education\nIn a in a much bigger picture way and part of the problem is that we don't necessarily think about consent insect said something that should happen in a university classroom so I think we're very close and the sense that we have all the resources and the people you need already\nBut I think we're far in the sense that we haven't be gone to even think about consent education in this deeper broader\nWay again the name of Don afraid is his new book you

sexual education I'm Dr Lynn past gorilla president the association of American colleges and universities and today on the academic minute Rachel Robinson associate professor at the school of international service at American University explores how to different communities did just that\nParents educators and policymakers the world over worried that teaching teenagers about contraception will make them more likely to begin having sex earlier than they might otherwise spoiler alert it doesn't not in the United states and not an Africa\nBut those fears of triggering precocious sexual behavior are difficult to dispel despite the proven value of sexuality education in making teens healthier\nGiven these fears and it's surprising that Mississippi in Nigeria have come to require schools to offer a sex ed why comparing midsize state with the so called giant of Africa until recently only half the states in the U.S mandated sex ed by like ... like many other low income countries lack of such programs entirely\nMississippi is among the U. S. states with the highest teen pregnancy rate's while in Nigeria almost a quarter of women have begun childbearing by age Nineteen\nMississippi in Nigeria are also highly religious in rural with under funded education and health systems that it was somewhat unexpected win Nigeria mandated to teaching effects that in two thousand and one and Mississippi followed suit a decade later\nThe research my colleagues and I conducted looked at the elements that helped to overcome controversies around sex ed and the two areas first homegrown organizations lobbied linked people together and provided legitimacy to ideas that otherwise might have seemed foreign crucially these organizations were supported by outside funding\nSecond to promote sex ed these organizations and the people working for them to describe it as a solution to social problems the taxpayer cost of teen pregnancy and Mississippi and the HIV AIDS epidemic in Nigeria\nThird they also use contact specific strategies including highlighting parts of the curriculum that focused on overall health rather than sex while there is no universal pathway to ensuring access to sex ed our research shows that the commonality between Mississippi in Nigeria's experiences can be applied and other us states in developing countries\nThat was Rachel Rob instead of American University you can find to this other segments and more information about the professors at academic minute do RJ\nThe academic committed production of WAMC Northeast Public radio in partnership with the association of American colleges and universities [noise]", "show_name": "To The Best of Our Knowledge", "year": "2018", "city": "Albany", "day": "19", "locations": [["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Utica", 5.16977, -74.50134], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Massachusetts", 42.36565, -71.10832], ["Chester", 53.1905, -2.89189], ["Massachusetts", 42.36565, -71.10832], ["New York Saratoga Springs", 43.08313, -73.78457], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Pennsylvania", 39.95233, -75.16379], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Pennsylvania", 39.95233, -75.16379], ["Buffalo", 42.88645, -78.87837], ["Massachusetts", 42.36565, -71.10832], ["Paul", -21.00961, 55.27134], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Vermont", 44.00034, -72.74983], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Vermont", 44.00034, -72.74983], ["Guatemala", 15.5, -90.25], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Guatemala", 15.5, -90.25], ["Massachusetts", 42.36565, -71.10832], ["Massachusetts", 42.36565, -71.10832], ["Massachusetts", 42.36565, -71.10832], ["Bertrand", 18.48283, -73.51129], ["Massachusetts", 42.36565, -71.10832], ["Bertrand", 18.48283, -73.51129], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Obama", 17.04483, -61.86117], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Mississippi", 32.75041, -89.75036], ["Nigeria", 10.0, 8.0], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Mississippi", 32.75041, -89.75036], ["the U.
