an off the shelf edition of the book show in partnership with north drier bookstore in Manchester center Vermont and recorded before a live audience author historian and Pulitzer Prize winner Doris Kearns Goodwin latest work is leadership in turbulent times\nThe book chronicles a journey the four of our nation's President Abraham Lincoln theatre Roosevelt Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson through those history is good when it's worse questions of natural leadership ability versus developed ability the relationship between ambition or versus the on leadership growth\nAnd how leaders both perceive themselves and are perceived by others are bestsellers included Lyndon Johnson and the American dream no ordinary time\nFranklin an Eleanor Roosevelt the home front in World War two team of rivals and the bully pulpit it is a great pleasure to welcome Doris Kearns Goodwin to this week's bookshelf [noise]\nWhat a delightful\nThank you I'm Glad to be with you again to the ... trial and I noticed ah for we did for a team of rivals\nAnd for the bully pulpit and for a an for this book leadership in turbulent times so you've been at at work on this for a while what got you thinking about just this idea of leadership\nAnd I think what happened is that each time I finished one of my book so I finished FDR and went to link and I'd have to move off FDR's books out of my study go to link and then move Lincoln out to make room for teddy and I always felt a little guilty like I was leaving an old boyfriend behind\nSo I decided instead of finding some new guy this time I decided why don't I look at the four people as you mentioned and especially LBJ and civil rights and domestic stuff knowing the war in Vietnam would cut his legacy into but knowing what he did in that area\nAnd look at them through the lens of leadership when I was in graduate school we used to think about these big questions I may sound pretty nerdy but we go out at night and\nSay where does ambition come from does the men make the times is leadership born or is it made and I've been lecturing on leadership for the last couple of decades but without really looking at my people just from that point of view and I was out of college place one time and the kid raised his hand he said\nYou know you're talking about leadership and how people leave when they get to the White House but I'll never become one of them it's too far away it's remote there on Mount Rushmore there on the currency so I realized if I started with them when they were young when they first recognize themselves as leaders when they were still going to screw up\nThen maybe young people and other people just inspiring can be leaders could follow their journey it didn't seem already made before you know how it's going to end up so that's how I began and I learned so much about them when they were young that I didn't know\nOne of the fascinating things about the book though is is a warning about those early years and that no one is on the same time table right right as far as leadership and what we would consider great nose by the same token it's certainly becomes apparent very early on their watch\nKnow that's what's really interesting I think it's true for for other people as well as for these people at a certain moment they find their vocation\nUm they there's a saying by William James the philosopher he said that a certain point you reached that if you're lucky something tells you this is the real me this is the voice inside it says that Lincoln is is it's certain right away I mean when he's twenty three years old\nAnd he runs for office that first time and he has to put out of hand bill to say why he wants to have the job it's a state legislator and it's incredible already at the age of twenty three he's at everyone has his peculiar ambition\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nBy my fellow man and be worthy of there seemed to think of that when you're twenty three years old and then he says he knows that he's only been in the town for six months of new Salem\nThey may not vote for him and if so he won't be very much a grand because you've been so used to disappointment but then he makes it's amazing statement he says but I promise you I'm going to keep trying even if I fail in fact I think I'll Try five or six times\nAnd then if I keep failing it'll be who humiliating and I promise I Will try again I mean that's amazing so it showed that he had resilience from that first time and he's going in already with the desire to do something with ambition that's beyond himself teddy admits when he runs and twenty three\nThat he's just going in for the adventure somebody comes to them a political bond says why don't you run\nAnd he doesn't have any thought he said of helping other people but then through politics he begin to learn\nAbout decrepit tenements he learns about um child labor he's a police commissioner in New York and he sees what the slums or like at night and it was a soldier he's sharing is food and shelter with other soldiers and he develops empathy he develops that desire to help other people\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nHit so loved being in the center of attention when he was a kid that he always wanted to be the center of attention when he was an adult so much so that they want it to be the baby at the baptism and the bride at the wedding and the corps at the funeral\nSo sometimes it's the drive to recreate what you've had for FDR that was partly true too\nBut somewhere along the line as I say the real transference has to take place between just that desire for oneself and I think that is true for any of his any field and then wanting to do something that will make other people's lives better expand their lives or allow you to do something that stands the test of time and that's the big change that happens\nSo we're talking about ... what about ego and maybe even going further the amount of of a ... right I mean you know everyone has ... there's a certain number one and then take it to\nTo have let's face it any person who thinks that they can run this country has a minute ago\nRight absolutely huge ego there's no question about that I think the real question is and and to just think they can be president United States that they can take that responsibility that people are gonna want them to do that\nI think the question though along the way is are they willing as they're going up that journey to acknowledge that they have limitations do they have humility\nUm do they have you know the ability to see when they're doing something that's wrong and grow from that experience 'cause ego is going to give them as well that was true of Teddy Roosevelt when he was in the state legislature he had this blistering language and it was constantly going against it enemies and it made huge headlines of New York they loved it\nBut then after a while he couldn't get anything done in the state legislature so we realized that he had risen like a rocket and he was falling like a rock and so we have to make himself less\nLess annoying to other people less irritating and less ego driven so I think that at some point that ego is oh it has to be you even Lincoln he'd somehow imagines that he's going to have a different life than he was shocking corn and and cutting rails\nAnd that takes a lot of ego to think I could be something different from what I Am you can't get there without it but then you have to be able to contain it as it goes along\nBut doesn't this from you go to what you're just talking about you mentioned it twice before in our conversation amount of empathy where okay you may have a healthy you go but then wife ... around a little bit\nAnd you're you're brought down and you you have an impasse excited to other people and to the airport because of what you have gone through\nThink it's maybe the most important quality in a leader in fact I think if I were to worry and we can talk about this later about what's happening in the country today now\nTeddy Roosevelt said that the way democracy would founder\nIs if people from different classes sections and races don't have any fellow feeling which was the same thing for empathy for the other people they feel the other people or the other something different from them and that's when things split apart that's when divides happened\nAnd I think if a leader is going to be able to reach over class or section or racial lines they have to be able to understand the other people's point of view and feel it and that's from experience or sometimes has developed in them from these experiences that they had that was so tough in life and it's somehow you're right it knocks you down like somebody said FDR\nHow can you deal with all the pressures of the presidency and he said if you spent two years trying to wiggle your big toe um or if you tried to climb up the stairs as he did one step at a time hoisting yourself up until you got to the top and then you were having a huge triumph a celebration for this little victory then you would have\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nThe officers of hers\nAs an example the ... a book about President Obama you'll get a ... I'm a first year and then I mean if you're I mean there you can see it each year of a of a vow it's taking its toll on on the person um\nBut but that that's part of it is and and I mean that's that's an understanding of the responsibility but you have as a leader\nIn fact I think the most important thing that a leader has to have in addition to assuming that responsibility is the ability to somehow in the midst of all that pressure\nTo reduce the anxiety to find time to relax and replenish their energy or else even if their facial things look like they've gotten older their energy their heart their mind has to keep strong and each one of my guys except for LBJ and and I he's always as I say the outlier\nThey would somehow able to find that time we were talking earlier before coming in here that we in our twenty four seven world field so many people we can't take time away we have to have our emails whether they have to have our cell phones with us\nThey understood what we maybe do not that unless you get away from the pressures you will not only aged physically but mentally so Lincoln actually went to the theater a hundred times during the civil war they he said when the lights went down and the Shakespeare play came on for a few precious hours he could forget the war that was raging\nAnd that was once too many on board [laughter] yes if you got Ninety nine time wise guy would have been [laughter] so anyway\nAnd his also he got enormous relief from his anxiety to my sense of humor\nI mean he was able in the middle of the worst cabinet meetings to tell a funny story and then everybody would relax for a few moments and he too would in fact when they were making the movie Lincoln I was able to persuade Daniel Day Lewis and Spielberg to use my favorite Lincoln story it had to do with the revolutionary war hero Ethan Allen\nWho went to England after the war is Lincoln tell the story and the English wanted to embarrass him because they were still mad by putting a huge picture of General George Washington and the only outhouse we'd have to encounter it sooner or later\nAnd they figured it'd be very upset about the indignity of George Washington and out but he came out of the outhouse not upset at all and there's one thing in the George Washington Oh yes he said I think it was a perfectly appropriate place for what do you mean they said well he said there's nothing to make an Englishman faster than the site of General George [laughter]\nHow can you imagine if if he tells one of these stories and the middle of everything\nFor a few moments you'll laugh you said laughter with like what's going on sadness Teddy Roosevelt exercising two hours every afternoon every single afternoon a boxing match or wrestling game\nOr a favorite was a walk in Rock Creek park in the ... he made a rule you couldn't go around any optical 'cause he came to Iraq yet to climate if you came to practice you had to go down\nSo their stories of people falling by the wayside one after another of the best is a friendship Basset or who came in and sell cat so vast waiting to walk in the ... and they find themselves in the woods you can't keep up with Roosevelt they finally come to the stream\nIs just thank God it's over we'll go back and it's a judge in my ... and so the president on button his clothes and say it's an obstacle we can go around it so let's take off our clothes\nSo I Do for the honor of France took off my apparel\nHowever I left on my lap and the kid gloves it'd be most embarrassing if we met ladies on the other side and I didn't have my gloves\n[laughter] stories but Lyndon could\nRelax when I was with him and it's a ranch he had a pool and we would presumably go swimming in the pool but the pool was filled with floating um raft with flooding no pads and ...\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nMoment and he didn't want to go to the movies 'cause it would be too dark and he couldn't talk you know he didn't want to read a novel so it wait on him even more because he couldn't relax\nAnd that's just the mind always going right\nExactly exactly you just have to what Lincoln said as you have to change your mind to another channel of thought in order to be able to fully get some replenishing of energy\nWhen we vote in history are we're voting for leadership or we're voting for the person that we feel will be the best leader or is that too often left behind\nI think it's the most important thing we should be thinking about when we vote for a candidate and I think it is too often left behind in the old days when the party bosses chose the people you're really much voting for your party\nAnd even now you know you're voting for somebody in a debate who'd said something silly or ... voting for who has the most money who who represent certain issues that you may care about what you don't know whether he'll ever carry out those issues\nUnless you understand their temperament and their leadership you know are you somebody as we've talked about whatever they do have humility can you created team where you can share credit\nAnd you can shoulder blame for that team can you connect to the people emotionally um do you have a sense of being able to control your negative emotions think about these qualities that I mentioned right now I'm ... do you keep your word\nWe know all the people have come from somewhere before most of the time they'd come from another political office until this last situation\nUm but even with President Trump as a leader we could have seen what kind of leader was the what kind of team did he bill ... teams\nAnd you would know that about a governor and senator and if we could use that and that's the way journalists could cover candidates not just in a long magazine piece but how we talked about them temperament finally got raised in the last campaign at the end but it should be a ... a central quality I think we look at in our leaders\nBut under the new book is leadership in turbulent times it was published by Simon and

good leaders\nDon't know I mean that's a really good question I mean I think what politics does is to expose them to a large number of people that's why you know one of the things that saddened me about the twenty sixteen election was that political experience what's considered a liability rather than a strain but for someone like Teddy Roosevelt or Franklin all of them actually\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nFor the Senate the experience of being a politician means that you see people in other stages of life in politics is done right and you begin to identify with them and understand them and I think that's what makes you a deeper leader then you were at the beginning\nAbraham Lincoln theatre Roosevelt Franklin Roosevelt and women Johnson so\nI'll ask about why those four specific would've been obviously a little bit before you have the drug store and my\nGuys I lifted or God you know after a while when you live with these guys you feel like you're waking up with them in the morning you're going to sleep not going to sleep with them you're thinking about that when you go to sleep at night\nAnd and you feel like this is why am I doing this I'm spending my whole life with dead presidents and then I realized it wouldn't change it for anything in the world my only fear has always been that in the afterlife is going to be a panel of all these guys that I started\nAt every single one will tell me every single thing I got wrong about that more than I mess and the first person to scream at will be Lyndon Johnson how come that down book on the Kennedys were twice as long as the book you wrote about me [laughter]\n\nIf you will get a juice from historical perspective I guess the the one thing that doesn't belong on that court would would be drawn some maybe although you make a very good case for among those\nWell clearly I knew to Lyndon Johnson so I probably wouldn't have been a presidential historian without having worked for him so I did have that personal relationship with him and threw that relationship I help them in the last year of his presidency and that helps them on his memoirs with living with him ... times down at the ranch\nAnd I came to understand that however the war would always always tear apart everything he had done what he did domestically was extraordinary and in those last year all he was hoping that maybe he'd be remembered for civil rights\nAnd I think of the accumulation of what the great society programs meant he meant that he didn't belong in that same category as embodied belong to be analyzed and to figure out why he was so successful in one area\nAnd perhaps not in the other but think about it three great civil rights laws ending segregation in the south providing that right to vote to African Americans fair housing Medicare Medicaid PBS headstart NPR\nImmigration reform war on poverty it's extraordinary any one of those landmark laws would have made a presidential legacy\nSo I wanted to understand how he was able to do it especially in today's world how did he get Republicans and Democrats to go together and the Congress we needed so badly right now\nHow much of that is um is ingrained to think when I when we think of of leadership as you say as they come they they make all kinds of metrics um all kinds of horrible things on them and these are not perfect mom\nAnd yet when it comes to leadership and different types of leadership but so\nYou know just exploring this I think there are certain leadership qualities that are in born I mean for some reason with Lincoln I think he was born with empathy he just even as a little kid when there would be other kids that were putting hot coals on turtles to make them ... he was going to say this is wrong he felt the pain in some way\nAnd he obviously was born with a gift for language\nI'm with Teddy Roosevelt he was born with a photographic memory and with enormous curiosity\nFDR was bought gifted with this natural optimistic temperament a confident optimistic temperament and there'll be J just had unfounded energy but for the most part they all made themselves leaders and Teddy Roosevelt wrote an essay wants two kinds of success one who has natural talent that no one else can compete with like a great poet perhaps or even a link\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nHard sustained work develop whatever talents they have to extraordinary degree through the application of work\nBut then what they all went through that I think made them better leaders is they they all went through terrible adversity from what I've understood even about leadership as as Hemingway said once everyone has broken by life but after with some people are stronger in the broken places\nAnd that happened to my four guys Lincoln had a near suicidal depression when he was in the state legislature and he hadn't been able to deliver on a promise to its constituents and he thought his word was the chief gem of his character and he'd also broken up as engagement with Mary Todd we'd broken his word to her\nAnd it made him it's so sad but they took all knives and razors and scissors from his room and it's best friend came to aside and said Lincoln you must rally or you will die\nAnd he said I Know that and I just assumed die right now but I'm not yet accomplished anything to make any human being remembered that I have lived amazingly right that he can think that way when it comes out of the depression finishes the state legislature and then eventually gets a single term in Congress runs twice for the Senate loses twice and then when that runs is a dark with candidate for the presidency but\nHaving been through that adversity when the war came he was used to that knowing how strengths and resilience would somehow get him and the north through\nAnd then Teddy Roosevelt is in the state legislature and he is word that his young wife has given birth to their child is cigars go all around he gets a telegram\nThen a second telegram comes our later saying your wife is dying and your mother is dying to you must come home at once and his wife was in childbirth the mother was forty nine she'd come to take care of the wife she got typhoid fever he got home and time for her to die\nAnd then twelve hours later his wife died in childbirth\nAnd so depressed which he that he left the state legislature and he went to the badlands but he later said that experience of living two years in the west changed too he was with the best educational asset he ever had he became a Westerner as well as an Easterner he understood that the land and the nature which became has great conservation his legacy\nAnd then of course FDR had his polio I mean he was an interesting character before that but it's deep and his empathy and his feelings about other people\nUm when he's set up that rehabilitation center at Warm Springs he showed his vulnerability to the other patients they would swim together in this giant pool but he taught them not simply physical exercise\nBut he taught them how to get joy in life again they'd have water polo and tag or where they would um have dances at night and they're wheelchair that have cocktail parties and they said they finally learned that there could be joy in life again so he began to identify with other people to fade had dealt an unkind hand\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson of course he was always sort of the outlier he has a Senate lots of Nineteen forty one which shouldn't be on the power of these other huge losses\nUm but he felt it was a repudiation of himself\nAnd he goes into a depression but he goes in the opposite direction he loses some of the new deal is um that had started him into politics and the first place he becomes more conservative he goes after wealth and power\nAnd it's not until Nineteen fifty five when he was majority leader of the Senate\nAnd he's very powerful but he has a massive heart attack and then he asked himself that same question Lincoln did in a way\nWhat if I died now what would I be remembered for and then he gets civil rights through the Senate and then he comes into the presidency and that desire for his ambition to be something larger than us themselves takes root in the great society in the civil rights law so they all go through that and\nAnd that was really I hadn't thought about all those things until I was exploring this\nKearns Goodwin shows are just almost ... new book is ...\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med

say\nI'm ... without ambition the drive for its success I don't think any of us can get anywhere it's still a mystery wearing the mission comes from and people\nI mean whether or not it's it's a situation\nThat's in that's difficult in your family or whether you're trying to best somebody else or whether or not you've been privileged and you just want to recreate that privilege\nI mean they said about Teddy Roosevelt that he had so loved being in the center of attention when he was a kid that he always wanted to be the center of attention when he was an adult so much so that they want it to be the baby at the baptism and the bride at the wedding and the corps at the funeral\nSo I'm Talking to the drive to recreate what you've had for FDR that was partly true too but somewhere along the line as I say the real transference has to take place between just that desire for oneself and I think that is true for any of his any field\nAnd then wanting to do something that will make other people's lives better expand their lives or allow you to do something that stands the test of time and that's the big change that happened\nSo we're talking about ... what about ego and maybe even going further them out of of a ... right I mean you know everyone has ... there's a certain number one and then to take to\nTo have let's face it any person who thinks that they can run this country

create gags and and so that was that was about as as high as I was shooting in those early years as I was just trying to make people laugh\nYou're drawing these characters in depth and moving them through time and moving them through the ups and downs of of lives with something I just didn't imagine in fact I went on to to grad school and graphic design because I had no idea that this thing would have any kind of legs\nAnd no one was more surprised than I that as the years went by and twelve of them went by and I thought you know this isn't good to keep all of these characters a on a

write them in order because the time pressure is such that if I can think of an idea that's halfway through the story All right and draw that first and then I'll have to reverse engineer to get it back to where the story starts\nJust because of the pressure of of of getting those six strips out the door on friday evening [noise]\nUm it's it's a crazy way to work but but I\nYou know you find the work that sushi temperamental only and I I think of myself as as kind of a a a naturally lazy person and of course my whole family thinks\nI'm a I'm a workaholic and that's because I chose a a a profession where there was just no choice you just had to get a certain amount of work done in a certain amount of time\nAnd that turned into a career\nIn doing the and doing the the strip and creating these these iconic characters I mean we grew up with these characters you grow up with these ... yeah I mean that's\nA lovely thing to have I mean we're proud of our families and you've created expand well the big families of big sprawling family there about Seventy five characters that we have map you know we created a big key to all the characters for\nAn anthology just to help people out it's kind of if you haven't been reading the script through the years it it's kinda like opening a Russian novel in the middle and and expecting to make sense of it but but\nYou know I've ... I've ... I've always felt that if you if you are creating characters with enough enough ah specificity and care that if you got the details right that they would become sticky ultimately not that's not true of all of them there's there's dozens characters I've I've left behind\nBut for the most part the ones that that anyone remembers you know certain traits will emerge and when I worked in in\nIn in a TV years ago I did a show with Robert ... Tanner eighty or eighty eight and we did a sequel uh twelve years later for Sundance but in the first in the in the second one um Allman was famous for I'm pretty much ignoring the script\nAnd that's a little rough on a writer especially if you write with you know I mean for me every comic counts because there's so little space to work and\nAnd um there was one day where I\nIs seen there's no way you could have shot and we were in a restaurant and I'm In New York and with it and it's a ten character scene and so he just basically did what he wanted to do and when it was over he could see me sort of sitting gloom ally in a in a in a corner\nI'm I've been listening to the phones all day in vain for a word I've written\nAnd he came over he sat and I said sure why you write and I said and not so much today Bob and he said you right so the characters and know who they are\nAnd what he meant by that was if if the characters were were\nSo the characters and know who they are and what he meant by that was if if the characters were were\nWere you know nuanced and carefully conceived that that gave the actor\nEnough to follow him wherever he wanted to go and he was kind of a pipe piper\nWith actors they you know they just threw up their hands and just did what he asked because if they knew that he had their back they were never going to you know look ridiculous and less it was intentional um and that's a ... they just trusted him so\nYou know when we did the second when we did the ... the uh the last episode of that are that sequel and Cynthia Nixon was the star of the second one and and she gives this wonderful speech at the end and and a friend of mine said you know that's in the ... speech that was great\nAnd that was a nice piece of writing and said yeah well you know a Cynthia Nixon actually wrote it um [noise]\nBut as you know as a resource full an actress is she is she couldn't have done it had she not known who she was so\nThat was that's how I held on to my pride but but it but it you know writing this stuff is good training for that it's it's you know be careful as you create them don't just create archetypes I mean that's what I did in the beginning 'cause I didn't you know I had didn't have any experience with it\nBut you know create people that you know or understand are that are interesting in some way and um I think that that gives me an advantage as a satirist\nWhen I'm trying to you know deal with the current era is that I I can bounce all this stuff off my characters in a way that you know somebody who's just writing jokes can't what\nGives you solace when we have a rough day like Kavanaugh uh I've just come back from um I'm a two week road trip I'm a real road trip got a car like\nYou know my closest friend um we both had had this big birthday Seventy and so we done this when we turned sixty we we uh\nGot a car in Bozeman, Montana and came down to the national parks Yellowstone through Park City where my sister lives arches in Zion and and um all the way down to El Paso Carlsbad Caverns [noise]\nThat was extraordinary for me it from a therapeutic a standpoint you look at it that had monuments standing in the middle of Kenyans that are that are four hundred million years old\nAnd I'm geology just restores perspective and I'll tell you something else the other thing that really impress me our fellow visitors whenever we would pull over to a you know a vista to overlook a canyon or you know a forest or a meadow\nAnd there were other visitors they're\nAlmost without exception every single person we encountered\nSpoke in hushed tones like this when spring reverential\nIt was like I put the off back into awesome word that has a has lost its meaning in the last Twenty years it's some things so much grander than you are so much more you know it's not permanent but feels that when you're looking at it\nAnd there was something about the respect that people from all walks of life from all around the world felt in the presence of such rancher that just took took your bathroom way\nMust have been a beautiful trip especially to see it before the oil well start peering I mean we we did go through one monument that have been the listed um and there was you know a a great outcry in that community they were they they were not happy\nAnd where did you talk to people in that sense of sort of get a sense of people on the road or wasn't there not and I don't really I politics now it's all you don't want to do that what's next for you\nThe people in the sense of sort of get a sense of people on the road there wasn't a not certainly politics now it's all you don't want to do what's next for you\nWell hum as as I indicated earlier I I I Hope to do this as long as there are newspapers which is the kind of an open question I'm there we've lost an awful lot of them and in the last Fifteen Years or so you know I'll miss that I'm a this afternoon I was discussing with a a a colleague\nHum how this we feel like we're at the tail end of the greats a\nHundred and ten a hundred and twenty year cultural moment in which comics played a an outsized role in popular culture I mean if you look at the twenties and thirties they were at the very top along with jazz and talkies\nEverybody knew what every character was doing in every strip and it was it was part of our common cultural experience that's been a long time since that's been the case but you have this disgrace strip little limos and yellow kid back at the turn of the century\nAt one end and the book and I think is probably Calvin and Hobbes and far side and I'm I'm I'm not sure there's much of a future\nI certainly encourage young cartoon as these days who who typically if they have um artistic skills and in addition to writing skills that they did they go to fix our I don't see it happening on the Web I don't see comic strips really taking off their\nThey seemed to have you know coexist did with the right technology producing mass and newspapers for this wondered this century period and um and we're on to something else and you know our children and grandchildren will figure that out\nVery sure does new book is hashtags sad Doonesbury\nAnd the time of Trump is published by Andrews Nick male\nWe enjoy hearing from our listeners about our shows you can email us that book at WAMC that orgy and you can listen
