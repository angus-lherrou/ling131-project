Gloria Duffy president and CEO of the club and very pleased to be the moderator conversationalist with our distinguished visitor today [noise] joining us as you all know is the honorable John

thousand four and serving as secretary of State John Kerry has provided leadership as a military officer and activists an elected official\nAnd it appointed cabinet secretary he's experienced American politics across a very broad range of institutions and Arabs\nHis recent memoir delves into his relationships with other major political figures his views on recent American trends at such a hyper partisanship and his role in significant political moments like the Iran nuclear deal\nWe're so excited to have him with us here today to discuss these issues as well as the future of our democracy\nLadies and gentlemen please join me in a warm welcome to John Kerry\n[noise]\nSo I tell you sat down and wrote this book what stimulated you to become so reflective about the span of your life and your service\nWell first of all let me begin by by saying thank you too I'm Gloria\nSo the commonwealth club I I really I'm happy to be here this is a great organization I've had the privilege of being part of your conversations previously or even just making a speech a and it's really fun to be back in one of my favorites is in the world San Francisco so I'm happy to be here\nAnd thank you all for taking the time to come out and I hope the the the sort of part of your check list in terms of good citizenship because we have a lot to talk about right now [noise]\nAh\nWe really do is I mean the question of what our facts in life but how do we make our politics work there's so much to talk about I was the other day I noticed this really is true there was a report on info wars\nThat Hurricane Lane was bearing down on Hawaii had been split into by an energy being was fired from Antarctica by me [laughter]\nUm [noise]\nAnd and I thought well I I thought I thought to myself now we're really a ... this is terrible stuff how can they ... how did they missed the fact that I fired at from from the north pole\nBut seriously I very upset that they ever call David ... action for Florence coming out on the east coast but this is just we're dealing with a whole different world and for those of us who really do love our country and who consider ourselves patriots and who are on or the role of troops and\nThe sustaining of our democracy or this is a very\nPearl is an important moment so I look forward very very much to the conversation\nI think you know there'll be lots of questions from the audience but tell us again why did you sit around and reflect on your lawn out I live by that I think you actually you gave part of the answer\nNo no no I yeah I did get our news or\nI I did it because I think it's relevant to the moment that we're in I think Bob Woodward's book is a terrific summary an extraordinarily well reported as he does and every one of you in here knows that there is no way has publisher observing my publisher to and there is no way that she\nIs going to go to print without the lawyers being confident about sources and what he does yes\nAnd there is no way that he is going to go to print without the lawyers being confident about sources and what he does his hundreds of hours of tapes so people need to be careful what they wish for in terms of documentation here and yellow or you're going to hear denials here and denials there but\nI think everybody knows how it works my book is the sort of okay it's terrible\nWe now have the facts that document what is happening\nBut what do we do about it and what should America look like what should we be doing in terms of making our system work and bring ourselves back to ground zero [noise]\nDamn democratically little D\nAnd um I think my book in the tracing of the things I've been involved in from the beginning of my raising my right hand there's a chapter called raising our right hand where I talk about why we went in the service my my parents were greatest generation parents my mother\nI'm born in Paris or live the better part of our earlier not better by all of her early life in Europe because my grandfather was a was a\nBusinessman involved in a business in Europe at the time and live between England and France right up until World War two and a actually way back when he was involved with the surge in any in the founding of the bank of America\nAnd to my regret sold his stock too early [laughter] uh [noise] uh so my mother didn't come to America really into ... about twenty four years old [noise]\nBut she's American she comes from the Boston family and and she lived there and that introduced me to war at a very young stage I write in the book about how my earliest memories walking with my mother in France Nineteen forty seven I was four years old and holding her hand and she was crying\nAnd I didn't know why she was crying it upset me but\nI could feel that you could hear the glass crunching beneath my feet\nAs we walk through the ruins of what had been the family home and all that I remember seeing a chimney go up into the sky and the and a stairwell going up into the sky it was all of us left I remembered visiting the beaches Normandy four years after the war there was still the ... civil war on those beaches\nYou know blown out tanks and so forth Higgins boats\nAnd it became it it it it just didn't viewed me with a sense of service sense of duty sense of responsibility\nAnd a group of us at Yale uh my good friend Freddie Smith the founder of FedEx who\nFounded FedEx really in our dormitory when he got to see and is economics paper that that was fed ex\nUm and it's an a plus now ... a plush slash uh and and my room mate daddy by our bureau in into the Marines and and you know a bunch of us felt a sense of responsibility Nineteen sixty five Lyndon Johnson asked for troops and then we were part of that answer [noise]\nSo I write this because I think all of that journey without any arrogance without any sense of why outlook and me or something that's not what it's about I think it's an American story I think it's an American journey\nAnd I think it represents how you make America the best of what we know it can be because in Nineteen Seventy one made a president who broke the law\nThat it was adopted and what I argued in a very tense meeting couple of nights earlier when it almost fell apart as people were arguing to go back to the old formula about developed countries doing more and less developed countries which is a killer formula\nI pointed out that this was the single\nMost gala Terry and shared responsibility you could have lie because each country decided itself what it was going to do and no country decided to do anything that he couldn't do\nThat is why President Trump outright lied to Americans today pulled out\nBecause he stood up in front of the country and said this agreement pushed to greater burden on the United states and the answer is no it didn't\nIt only undertook to do what we knew we could do with us support of major fortune five hundred companies ranging from the Google and the apples and so forth all the way to Exxon Mobil\nAnd BP and others all of them said we need to do this so we cannot have parts of what was the significance of powers the significance of Paris is that we\nBasically put our faith and the private sector which I Believe I I've grown more and more private sector oriented over the years because as you watch the world changing as the dynamic changes we're witnessing industrial revolution sized changes and culture and society and workplace\nIn trade and in in globalization but it's happening\nCulture and society and workplace in trade and in in globalization but it's happening at digital pace is unprecedented\nAnd that's part of the anger that is filled American workers and the American people because they feel increasingly disenfranchised and shocked and shell shocked by it all uh and Dutch a lot of the voter that Donald Trump appeal to by the way it is also a voter the Bernie Sanders appeal to\nAnd it's out there it's also in the center you don't have to be on the right or left to feel that way government is not working in America folks and we know in some of the reasons why and what we have to do about it but the bottom line with respect to climate changes we were trying to send a message in Paris to the private sector\nOne hundred and Ninety six countries are all going to move in the same direction at the same time and that creates the largest market the world has ever seen\nThe energy market and why energy because energy is the solution to climate change there's nothing we can do to change the course were on that isn't subject to making better decisions about how we create electricity what we do with our buildings how we burn oil or gas or coal and other things and how we move to a renewable sustainable\nFuture the market that I knew in Massachusetts I represent Massachusetts twenty eight years we had a terrific tech base not quite Silicon Valley but\nIn the early years very very strong and still strong and we had a one trillion dollar market in the Nineteen nineties with with what a one billion users the energy market is today four to five billion user market and among type trillion dollar market\nAnd it's going to grow to nine billion users and the next Thirty years is the biggest market the world has ever seen and by Donald Trump pulling out of Paris he's pulled us out of the position of leadership and in that market\nSo but here's the rub this is why I said I'm going to be the skunk Paris goal was to keep the rise in the earth's temperature to two degrees centigrade\nWe're probably right around one point three one point five already today we're right there but my friends in this century my grandchildren yours I'm going to live to experience\nA four degree rise in temperature for degrees is what we are on track to see now what you see barreling towards the coast the Carolinas today\nThe size of the storm intensity that repetitive with which it formed\nIs a direct consequence of the warming of the water and the increase of the moisture you have therefore in the air and therefore more rain\nHarvey Irma and Maria\nAll deposit at one storm Harvey alone deposit it as much water as flows over Niagara Falls and an entire year\nFive days of flooding and Irma was the first storm to have a recorded one hundred and eighty five miles an hour sustain for\nTwenty four hours together these storms caused those two hundred and sixty five billion dollars one third of the entire budget of the defense department and more money than the Commerce Department the Energy Department of education department the by the whole bunch of departments together this is insanity insanity\nAs secretary of state I went to Norfolk, Virginia and the largest navy base in the world and we talked with the military but what they're having to do because\nOf the preparations they debate because of climate change and the rise of sea level I went to Antarctica because when I went to the Arctic the scientist there said Mr Secretary you got to go in the Arctic go to really understand what's happening in terms of the changes so I went to Antarctica\nAnd lo and behold yeah I heard from scientists room Seventeen different countries about the repetitive with which the west Antarctic ice sheet which is three and a half miles deep ice is melting and and shows a Fisher\nLarson ice sheet broke off larger than the size of the state of Rhode Island and floated out to sea and they're afraid that the whole thing may melt ... way we're going to him\nShe broke off larger than the size of the state of Rhode Island and floated out to sea and they're afraid that the whole thing may melt rent wait we're going the Himalayan glaciers melting glaciers are disappearing\nAll over the world we're seeing the diminished ... of the cycle and now you have an open seat in in the northwest passage in the summertime\nAnd people trying to exploited I mean it's changed last year for the first time in history\nWe're recorded above freezing temperatures in the Arctic in February so you know I get angry when I when I think about this\nDonald Trump's decision to pull out of that agreement is going to cost lives it just is as good a cost billions of dollars of damage to property and you're going to witness some of it and the next ... hours next days but that's just the beginning\nWe've had an average of seven hurricanes here since Nineteen Seventy two in the Atlantic which is more than normal and now they're two other hurricanes behind warns that are sort of building out there so my friends what do you do about it\nWhat is the solution but I'd be doing well I'll tell you what the ... United States and if I were president today I Would have an emergency meeting of the G twenty\nI take the richest countries in the world and I said we're not leaving the room to we put together\nA climate action fund that helps less developed countries not have to build a coal fired power plant\nAnd we should stop every single coal fire power plant in the world from being ...\nThat's what we have to do why the dirtiest fuel in the world and it is the single biggest culprit with respect to global climate change and we're at a point now where we are locked in not just to preventing this from happening were locked into mitigation adaptation so we're going to have to do things like the Dutch do\nTo prevent see from coming into the country this below sea level but guess what a lot of other places have got to find that challenge already the mayor of Miami is pumping water out of Miami Beach\nAnd the mayor of Miami Beach at night is pumping water out in order to get sunny day high tide flooding out of the way\nSo we have water coming over the Boston I'm In in in Boston at the seawall you know that comes in at a high tides any day now so my friends long answer to you but I got to tell you something this is one of the most serious issues we face is existential it is solvable\nThere's no excuse for not moving more rapidly to alternative renewable energy solar is now completely competitive with cold it's cheaper than coal 'cause there's no there's no truth and accounting I don't know how many of your business\nBut you know there's no truth and accounting in in this business today people say oh Cole is a three or four cents a kilowatt hour and solar is going to be sex with solar isn't a solar is letting contracts in the world at two point nine cents per kilowatt hour and so forth but coal\nWhich it doesn't ever taken the cost\nOf coal sludge coal dust black lung moving it by train or trucks from wherever it comes from the burning the cost of emphysema the cost of of of you know the single biggest cost of children being hospitalized America during the summer is environmentally induced asthma\nWe spent fifty five billion dollars a year to deal with that and we can't find a hundred billion dollars to fund the ... and ...\nSo I'm just telling you folks were the greatest democracy in the world we're not making choices about the future we've got to start to reclaim our democracy and reclaim our future by making real choices it's that simple [noise]\nThis is the commonwealth of California radio program\nYou can learn more about the commonwealth fund its many programs and how to become part of it coming\nCommonwealth club Don more you can find thousands of our podcast sign I tend to Google Play today's program features John Kerry in conversation with me now back to our program [noise]\nAnd we're experiencing a lot of the impact here in California we had a couple of hundred thousand acres gone up in flames this last year the smoke the health consequences of the smoke\nUh we have a seawall issue here in San Francisco on time [noise]\nSo if in fact our ability to accomplish the things that the federal level is impaired at this point there's a certain amount of us thought that states are going to have to take the lead a and I think that's Jerry Brown's attitude a he's just a announced a\nAn objective of having a California run completely on clean fuels by the year twenty forty five so what do you think about this idea that the the unit of the political unit for focus is really states at this point\nNames from the past but it extended and and went further and both parties have made contributions to it\nAnd fights that took place in the Senate for one reason or another there are\nAnd and went further and both parties have made contributions to it and fights that took place in the Senate for one reason or another there are arguments about what happened to John Tower nominated circulated fence their arguments or what happened to Robert Bork blah blah blah\nBut really it took hold in the Nineteen nineties where the Gingrich revolution people that I saw this people band that come over to the Senate who are just more ready to say ideology first one way my way or the highway little less involvement\nAnd you have people have tried to block that a little bit Jeff Flake from Arizona\nAnd and Bob Corker a little bit from Tennessee\nA but it's been tough it's been tough but I Believe you asked me what can we do look folks I Hope don't let this sound naive because I think in my book as you ... you'll see the the continuum that\nPeople make the difference every one of the major movements that may change happen when it needed to in the late Nineteen sixties civil rights\nMartin Luther king kids some of my classmates we raise money for the freedom buses the freedom rides where people get on those buses and go down south to register people to vote in Mississippi and Alabama places\nThe Mississippi voter registration drive drove us motivated and run really in large measure by young people the environment ... young people the anti war movement Sam Brown David mixture bunch of people young people did that marched link are these ... they took time off from school they went and made a difference\nI Believe in that still we called them the peanut butter and jelly brigade they went up to New Hampshire\nThey they supported Gene McCarthy they send a message to the president nine states Lyndon Johnson\nYou shouldn't run again and it was after the march primary that Lyndon Johnson took himself out of it so look at what I said about Earth Day look at what I said about environmental legislation look at what happened in terms of accountability for Watergate and then the Watergate babies who went to Congress and what we were able to do\nSo yeah it moves slowly sometimes it's not as responsible as you'd like it'd be Winston Churchill said that democracy is the worst form of government except for everything else think about it we've tried everything in the world ladies and gentlemen\nWe've had dictatorships all over the place we had a monarch for a while here till we threw off the yoke of that we've had constitutional monarchy we've had parliamentary Marta ... we've had socialism we've got communism we've had\nYou name it we've we've we've seen it experimented with one place or another and I still believe very very deeply that if you work at it properly and and the public is able to hold people and things accountable and you go vote\nYou can make a difference and here's the magic number fifty four point to that is the percentage of eligible Americans who voted in twenty sixteen when block Obama was elected in two thousand and eight it was sixty two\nPoint three percent when he was reelected against Romney it was fifty eight point five I think they see the gap the story of the last election is not the people who did go out to vote for Donald Trump's people who didn't vote and nine percent of Iraq Obama's vote went\nTo Trump and seven percent did not come out and vote that's sixteen percent\nThat swing that's why I Believe as I said here today I'm not kidding you I'm not Pollyanna air ... I'm not being naive\nWe can make our democracy work but it is work it's hard work you have to go out and be part of the family you have to drive people to go vote you have to go vote yourself you've got to give money to campaign so it can compete you've got to take part in it and and ...\nYou have to drive people to go vote you have to go vote yourself you've got to give money to campaign so it can compete you've got to take part in it\nAnd and ... I I just ask you remember the words of Ben Franklin when he walked down the steps of constitution hall after they had finished their labor on the next generation of the constitution the United states and a woman shouted at him Dr Franklin tell us what do we have and he said back to her\nOh she said do we have a monarchy or republic and he said a republic if you can keep it if you can keep it that's the work of today I kid you not\nJohn McCain you've talked about other colleagues in the ... a Republican and I all cross or at times you had a long relationship he leaves your fellow Vietnam veteran what do you have to say about John McCain and how how you worked with him and and your relationship with him over the years\nWhile I miss him as as I think America with medicine because he was a a truth teller\nA he knew he had some deviations himself one was on climate change when he was running for president because of the orthodoxy of this party and he was up front about those kinds of things which is one of the things people appreciate that about him but he had a as I wrote in an op ed after he passed away he had a great capacity for forgiveness\nWhich is which is partly what you need and what we need in our politics a little bit in the country\nJohn and I didn't know each other well when we went to this and I got to the Senate before John to try not to let him to get any given day as about two years apart and he came to campaign against me Massachusetts though he never attack may never mention my name and just talk to the other guy I write in the book about how that so that was the way the game was played back then not any more than\nBut in the Senate we were one day\nWe're on a delegation flying to Kuwait after the Desert Storm and a ... Kuwait was just liberated and\nWe flew over to ah talk to the troops and thank them but also to talk to the mirror and the other folks and see where we were going John and I were seated opposite each other he was flying backwards I was lying forward sitting opposite him\nWhich were assigned by seniority that's why it was important and I got there before\nUh and we started you know we we were uncomfortable little bit because I was the war protester and he was a POW so we started to talk about the navy were both navy guys and we both love the navy I Love the navy didn't like war but love the navy\nAnd we talked about I I asked him about Annapolis and what it was like to have a grandfather and a father\nFor scar admirals the weight of that what did that affect them in the in the in the academy and blah blah blah\nSo we had an amazing conversation that night but out of it came a\nWillful determine commitment by the two of us which we made that night on that plane\nThat we were going to work together because we both agreed that the war we still tearing America part is Nineteen eighty this Nineteen Ninety Ninety One and so we decided we're going to work together to try to make peace peace with the non\nAnd peace with ourselves in America and it began with the\nSort of ability to look beyond how we felt about each other's positions on the war he was pro war he came back as a upset at the people who are protesting the war because his war stopped the day was shot down Nineteen sixty seven and you have to hang on everything he had and believe for all those years in prison camp\nMy war was Nineteen sixty eight and sixty nine\nAnd when I came back I got to go around the country and argue against the war so we came from very different places\nBut my friends we we found the most amazing common ground we worked together for ten years to try to change that and um we all believe did we first with George Herbert Walker Bush we lifted the embargo with President Clinton we normalized ah we're we we mostly ... answer the questions for ...\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkeley Center for weight loss surgery with a focus on life skills and support for a long term success with we've ... in gastric bypass surgery monthly seminars open to the public for when three three nine five seven five one zero to register\nWith the system to be able to know what happened to somebody in a last scene last known alive report and there was a mythology remember in the early Nineteen nineties a cover of Newsweek had are they still alive prisoners in Vietnam and tiger cages and there was a mythology Rambo food films\nThat we'd forgotten people over there\nSo we have to undo that first and we went to amazing lengths to do it we went back to Vietnam I went back with John McCain\nWe we ... we had helicopters flying into hamlet sway the sound of the helicopter would bring back horrible memories of the war we we had a history houses we'd go in and talk to the people we actually interviewed general job and we interviewed the jailers of John McCain and his and the fellow prisoners\nSo we had this most exhaustive effort and in the end ladies and gentlemen I'm so proud that that that not only be get the answers and that's ongoing today today is we're sitting here in this theater we got American Soldiers on the ground and yet I'm trying to get remains back for families\nAnd and John McCain and I visited the cell he was in together we stood together and and I realized then that we had found this special common ground\nAnd if a POW at a protest or can do that about Vietnam in Hanoi we can do that anywhere in this country and make things better it's a it's a great story about what people can\nDo [noise] um [noise]\nTurning to another Asian country with which we have a ... relationship if you are a secretary of state what would you be doing about North Korea today\nWe did you know there's not a great I mean there's a ... style and in the process but an objective and based approach\nWe we wanted to try to sit down with North Korea we we tried very hard to get the north Koreans to come to the table but we were tougher in wanting certain definitions defined before we did so mind you\nKim Jong un's father and grandfather both wanted\nA meeting with the president United States and they never got it why did they never get it because we were never able to get satisfaction with respect to what they were willing to define or not to fine I think that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Commonwealth Club of California", "city": "Albany", "day": "17",

[noise]\nAll\nRight Steve I made the mistake of opening Twitter\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu [noise]\nWhich I think a key feature of the of that ad you spend a lot of time arguing the reverse that this is one of this might be the greatest time to be alive how so\nPeople are living longer and what's more fundamental for life people are a wealthier by that I don't mean the one percent but I mean uh the bottom ten percent that\nRates of extreme poverty have been plunging by about three quarters and just the last three decades a rates of literacy have\nHave increased about Ninety percent of the world's population under the age of twenty five can read and write\nRates of death in a from all forms of violence are in decline there are fewer people were killed in war in a\nStick decade than I and the nineties the eighties seventies sixties fifties to say nothing of the of the world's worst rates of violent crime had been declining for the violence against women or so in most measures of human well being\nYou see improvements over a span of decades and centuries\nIf I wasn't a mistake and you sound like a hyper optimist to me actually is that the point of this book you\nKnow the point actually it's not optimism that all the point is I knowing the facts\nThat it's not a question of well if if global poverty has fallen to um ten percent should we concentrate to be happy about the Ninety percent or upset about the ten percent the fact is we should note that the numbers are Ninety percent and ten percent most people don't know that most people when asked\n... is poverty across the world extreme poverty increasing or decreasing majorities say increasing or staying the same the correct answer is that it's decreasing there wasn't a question of optimism this is the question is just going facts likewise\nIs the rate of death in warfare higher or lower now than it was saying the Nineteen eighties now it's not a question of being optimistic that there are fewer wars or pessimistic but they're still in a off of wars in Syria and Yemen and elsewhere\nIt's question just knowing which way the world is going what\nThe late Swedish doctrine ... calls fact fullness\nFact fullness I like that knowing what the facts are now now should we be\nMy wife is going to call me full of facts later [laughter] I don't know how I feel about it why a return to the enlightenment of all the periods of human history to have to kind of crawl back towards whiny light minutes been two hundred plus years some\nYou know it's it's not it's not it's not a return is not calling back it's not ... bring back the light and that it's a question of affirming a set of ideals that were most articulate we stated er during the enlightenment but that are still relevant namely reason science and humanism\nLet's start to unpack those ideals but first to a minor history lesson what made those ideas emerge at that time\nSo we we it's it's a hard question to answer because it only happened once and so with as with any historical event we can't gonna replay of faith the tape a number of times and and the number of ways at times that went in different directions depending on what immediately proceeded it\nBut a plausibly the rise of print and literacy that if you were to look at something that happened before the say the second half of the Eighteenth century that's when you want to more or less center to the ah the the light and\nUm it was an era in which the population of European countries so past fifty\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nCosts of printing a book or a pamphlet plummeted us those greater mobility of people and ideas it may have been the historical memory of the wars of religion of the um sixteenth century or sixties seventeenth century\nFat people realized that killing people by the tens of millions depending on their interpretation of the holy trinity probably isn't the best way to run\nA society in part it was the fruits of the scientific revolution which show that a lot of ... human beliefs were were were outright false of which the ... the faith belief that the son\nWrote revolves around the earth is maybe the most famous example and perhaps the the result of uh the age of exploration that they were all of these continents that\nTeeming with life with people's with of a different cultures that\nPeople didn't even know existed until a century before sort of expanding people's horizons to all of the things we don't really know what was the cause but um but they all seem to come together\nAnd I want to unpack some of these ideas now so when you say reason I think that means something different nowadays than what you want you unpack in the book wait what do you mean by reading\nRationality logic uh LA it does not have had in good yeah rationality logic as opposed to\nAs opposed to dogma as opposed to\nParsing scriptures as opposed to authority as opposed to conventional wisdom or as opposed to gut feelings that the feeling of subjective certainty and after the glow of of a feeling that you're in the right because you're you and your your um this intimate infallible\nOr that someone else who you admire assessed that they are on this tour infallible superstitions a dog my\nFair a so those are all alternatives to reason\nAnd science I I think\nThe science the application of reason to the the natural world so not all of reason to science because there is also logic is also mathematics there's also a moral arguments but when you apply reason to the way through the way things are work than we call it science\nAnd then the the one that I I think most people haven't haven't heard of or at least some packages humanism\nYeah so humanism is just the idea that the ultimate moral good is to promote human well being that is the the ...\nHappiness the longevity the knowledge the experience of men women and children and other animals but we'll we'll we'll begin with humans\nAs opposed to now you can say well who could be opposed to that I mean who could be against people living longer and and I'm a been healthier and and uh having enough to eat well there are alternative moral system such as that the ultimate good is to carry out God's commandments or to\nMaximize the glory of the nation or the race or creed so even though it may seem to be completely unacceptable that you do what makes the most people better off\nTribalism of authoritarianism but there are intellectuals or defend Trump and they often alludes to counter enlightenment ideas or Steve Bannon considers himself an intellectual ah there were a\nTwo hundred academics who signed a statement in support of Trump a ... a couple of months prior to the two thousand sixteen election and the ideas behind Trump is an art counter and like the idea is there's no such thing as a humanity and they're just tribes either as a zero sum competition between tribes\nTo surrender national interest to global cooperation is to be a chump in a battle of a tribe against tribe race against race so he's our ideas I think that terrible ideas but they are ideas and the west\nBy no means a ... ever as you do these ideas to the debate that's going on within the west\nSo did you write this book in response to the rise of of Trump ism as you put it this tribalism that was emerging\n[noise] no I although not at the outset although I did have to incorporate that uh the I I began to book in two thousand Fifteen I signed a contract for the book in two thousand Thirteen\nAnd so the idea that Donald Trump or be president was a ... came out of The Simpsons quite literally [noise] I mean it was it was absurd at the time\nThe Simpsons has proven to be quite pressure you well yeah\n[laughter] ah so it didn't require and this was a pretty uh pretty conspicuous elephant in the room that I could not ignore in a book on progress and so I deal with\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nBecomes more efficient we're guaranteed to almost to think that things are getting worse even if as I'm getting better that's one reason\nAnd putting on my scientists that are ... are we evolved in ... in our evolutionary history is that a a situation that we're we're naturally predisposed to because our brains aren't moving at the ... at the speed of ... of news if you will in term yes it is it's development\nYeah I think that that's right that the uh\nData sets really didn't exist until quite recently where we're naturally numerous they uh arithmetic mathematics are recent inventions in human history a\nOf a existed for a fraction of the time we've been we've been ah human ... it's not a a catastrophic the fact that our mind goes with a samples and anecdotes because after all those are are not only available\nBefore the existence of literacy and data gathering organizations but they do reflect local conditions or\nAs a not a bad first approximation it really is true that there are more pigeons city than than than white breasted nuthatches and you know that without having to do a bird census you don't have to look a day that he was just consult your your images and that's a case where your images are are are correct and they often are correct\nBut not when it comes to a world of seven billion people\nYeah so this is the one of the things that struck me as if that doesn't come naturally to us this idea of of thinking in the world in these hyper rational ways through the lens of data because we are human we are predisposed to our evolutionary roots\nAren't you asking us to take a little bit of a leap of faith\nWell to to think this way\nNo it's not a leap of faith it's the week it's a leap of education it's the opposite of a leap of faith\nThat is we [noise]\n\nIt it certainly does require a inhibiting certain impulses in states north going with our our our gut feelings to uh to allow our best data are best reason are the fruits of our educational system to override our intuitions\nI just think back to um I Can't remember exactly when but George W. Bush talking about leading from its good and um how trapped of that was\nTo see a leader talked about it that way you describe like the leaders that we should really be attracted to the ones that speak to reason and science because they're going to be grounded in progress is is that a fair assessment of of of your point\nYeah so they the that um the policy should be based on rational\nAnalysis for sure I Know of course a politician in a democracy in order to be elected has to appeal to people with all of their biases and emotions and intuitions so skilled politician\nA and an admirable politician would be one who combines the most rational analysis of policy with the greatest skill in\nThe attention and and support of a of the people of the country so when they don't recall the person a demagogue ah when they do then that that's probably the best we can hope for leadership and a democracy\nOr the best we can hope for a few like that is resident right now um [noise] why go back two hundred years that timeline seems arbitrary on some point I understand you were going back to the enlightenment but why not fifty years ago or or more realistically for us\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nMy life in the context of wow and Seventeen Fifteen they weren't doing as well or as I Am now I tend to think about like how I was doing a year ago maybe even ten years ago\nWell the thing is that these these trends are a visible not just over centuries but over decades and and over the years I mean not all of them there's always goals that can be reversals that can be sickening lurk troops\nBut I'm going back to the extreme poverty a as a nation that's a hundred and thirty seven thousand people a day for the last Thirty years who've escaped extreme poverty\nUm when it comes to war and democracy just in my own lifetime I mean I I when I was a college student world had thirty one democracies today as a hundred and three there were wars to kill people at a rate of nine per hundred thousand per year now the rate is about one point for for a hundred thousand per year\nI have long had the sense that uh\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAnd you're offering something ... you're saying you're offering a rebuke against that idea yeah I'm ... ... talk about that a little bit your your thoughts are on pessimism or in a span opponent and the thing\nYeah there is a a um a a tendency to give more um ... some credence to to pass them is a there is a financial aid and Morgan house on said that a pessimist sound like they're trying to help you optimist sound like they're trying to sell you something\nThis may be a reflection of another a psychological feature they some of the negativity ... bias that bad\nWays I'm a more heavily than good we are we drive losses more than we look forward to gains a criticism stings more than praise or booms ah we\nAh remember recent bad events better than recent good events and so that may open up a leash for people to remind us of bad things that we may have overlooked and so we do a\nScribe greater moral seriousness to to pass them is ah the biblical profits are a good example we consider them both moral and they warned of him in and do\nIt it's easy it's it's kind of cheap and easy to be a\nPessimist 'cause they'll always be things that go wrong and you can if you assemble a list of all the worst things that are happening anywhere on the planet any given time it's always good look pretty depressing now of course something ... tons of things do get worse is not this is not an argument for optimism in the sense that we should always believe things get better\nThings don't always get better and then there's no reason to believe that they will left to their own devices [noise]\nIt's a rather that we should have the most accurate assessment that we can half of the state of the world and the direction that it's going to try to identify what it is that makes things better and do more of them\nI'm being missed allergic but I in my house I grew up and we would watch the news every night and it wasn't good news back then we'd watch Peter Jennings on ABC and there is always bad news they left one segment at the end that was sort of the good news\nBut it does feel like there is a prevailing sense when I turn on the news now that it feels more pessimistic than ever yeah why are we seeing a trend line in that direction with the coverage of the narratives that we see out\nThere there is a good question and it and it um you know I have to be careful not to say the phone to my own trap and say well for the the news is getting worse or the news getting more pessimistic without any data and so I did find that there is a a data scientist named ...\nWho did a a random algorithm that\nTallied up the number of positive or negative words in news stories in the New York times and in a sample of a global new services since the Nineteen forties\nAnd found that in fact it has gotten more more pessimistic for justice people are living longer and there's and and I received death in war been going down and racist literacy even going down\nThe news has been getting more and more morose and so this is the fact that there isn't just a a ...\nWho's leading the horse there is that reflective of something that we writ large as the public is inspiring the media to red light of that or is it the reverse\nA good question if it was just the negativity bias and human nature that would not protect that there should be a trend toward greater pessimism because human nature I haven't changed in the last Seventy years or it may be a combination of our greater ability\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nNews teams to the remote corners of the world now everyone with a smartphone as I can can beam\nVideo footage to the to the Web instantaneously is partly paradoxically the I'm a kind of a gift of are expanding circle of empathy that we care more about people and not just people other organisms and parts of the world\nThat may have fallen below leath our radar in the past so we care more about famines in Africa and uh and wars in in in now Yemen that our ancestors may happen little kids being bullied and um and women being sexually harassed which used to happen but just wasn't an issue now it is an issue [noise]\nUm and and the third part a possible answer your question is that there is a change I think in the culture of journalism where it's considered increasingly ah especially since the seventies I think that the\nUh mores of of of responsible journalism ... were a as increasingly been to point out what's going wrong to speak truth to power to to break the mock\nA and that there was a there is a revolt and I think in the culture of journalism to the old style of uh being complicit with um power structures not to show Roosevelt from the waist down because it wouldn't be wouldn't look as presidential\nTo overlook JFK's affairs to kind of be cheerleaders for the government now it's the other way around\nPerhaps even gone to an extreme where I every a civic institution is considered to be a target for an aggressive take down and there's a kind of cynicism that nothing could ever work everything is corrupt which may have had pernicious consequences\nBut there has been some criticism of your book a you're not that isn't new to you I'm In one of the the criticism came from from the right especially the religious right who saw this as a rebuke of the role of faith in society a and I'm curious what your thoughts were\nYeah uh yeah I don't think that faith as a role in society I mean there's no faith in the sense of bleeding something without a reason now this doesn't mean that there is no role for religious institutions in society and religious institutions\nUh half of all I'm many of them have become more humanistic even if they don't necessarily use that word\nBut um but yeah I don't think that that any collective decision should be based on a on faith in the sense of the leading something without a good reason on the basis of tradition or dogma or authority\nSo what could be the role of religious institutions going forward than like what opportunities to UC for them it in a world that is is driven by a latent ideal\nWorld religions have a um a a rich historical legacy they they are uh been synonymous with our culture and civilized nation and pretty much I'm Tovia enlightenment um it was probably only with the light minute you there was even a distinction between religious in non religious uh um institutions\nThey can be so sigh for um communal uh experience with people getting together and enjoying the warmth of a community the a reassurance of tradition the beauty of\nA liturgy and music and iconography or they can be ... civil society movements to a\nCharities um support for I'm at risk youth providers of of\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nVery weak civil society organizations they can be involved in I'm In a peacemaking in peacekeeping in justice and rule of law I'm some really there's a as\nLegacy institutions that command a great deal of loyalty there is a potential for religion is to be positive forces what they ... what what I Would call in and it's not not just me but but maybe it's just not to\nBase I any of the morality on a dog my authority scripture but just to to justify that health is good and pieces good and living together as good and tolerance is good and\nAh education is good to to the extent that these institutions dedicate themselves to those humanistic values then they can be massive forces for good\nYou've also face withering criticism from um opponents on the left\nA you are a professor on a campus he's still teach courses and you've been highly critical of politically correct environments on campus and and you even posted that given Ryan's to some uh some elements that our society they're completely undesirable can you talk about that\nYeah um I think the ah\nIt to my horror I have\nA former students who have gravitated to the ... All right um so these are not ignoramus is these are not skinheads um these are are in some cases extremely intelligent articulate a people but they have often been repelled by\nThe uh atmosphere of um of of um politically correct dogma on American campuses uh and and in in certain American media and often when they\nCome across politically incorrect I'm a fax they feel that the uh entire establishment has been systematically repressing\nI'm a a a a\nOf facts and feel emboldened that the exact opposite of the establishment must have a a a greater be much more in tune to the to the to the truth\nAnd therefore often embrace a extreme and unjustified interpretations of certain facts that simply can't be discussed\nAnd therefore we're never inoculated to them ... against the most extreme interpretation sounds all wouldn't it be concrete um the idea that that men and women are indistinguishable at our ... except for", "show_name": "Commonwealth Club of California", "year": "2018", "city": "Albany", "day": "10", "locations": [["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Syria", 35.0, 38.0], ["Yemen", 15.5, 47.5], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["LA", 34.052235, -118.243683], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Albany New York", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623], ["Yemen", 15.5, 47.5], ["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623]], "not_found": [], "ep_coords": ["Albany, NY", 42.65258, -73.75623], "in_country": ["Albany", "Albany", "California", "Albany", "Albany", "LA", "Albany", "Albany", "Albany New York", "Albany", "Albany"], "out_country": ["Syria", "Yemen", "Yemen"], "in_state": ["Albany", "Albany", "Albany", "Albany", "Albany", "Albany", "Albany New York", "Albany", "Albany"], "out_state": ["California", "Syria", "Yemen", "LA", "Yemen"]}, {"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WAMC", "content": "Which was Northeast Public radio WAMC up\n... points ... points reruns when you go\nTo William ...

you best happy to come back\nThink about you as a business rocks\nOr business rockstar wow that's a tall building had reading this\nBook I think the much more appropriate term which I just found so inspiring is as a change agent a change maker how do you define what it means to be a change maker and when did you know you were one\nYeah well I didn't I didn't grow aspire to be one when I was growing up that's for sure I to me change maker is I'm just somebody who just has a passion to discover what's new in what's next and you believe in a better way and you're going to make it happen\nIt's also a very entrepreneurial kind of trade right to believe in a better way and you're going to do whatever you can to make it happen so I think there's a there's a part of an entrepreneur that's a change maker and when did you know you were one I think\nDreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nPart of something better and different uh I'd say my biggest Tiffany came at one of the most formative jobs I ever had when I worked at NBC News\nKind of the second time and it was right after NBC had had a big crisis or the original fake news episode in the nineties where\nUh the news division was basically brought to its knees everyone got fired and I was brought in as part of a new team and it was the most entrepreneurial assignment I had had\nWe had nothing to lose because everything had almost in law said almost shut the news division down and so we were encouraged we what what was the incident the incident was um there was a dateline episode where they faked I'm a a General Motors car blowing up a effected by putting a rockets on the truck\nAnd blew it up for ... talk about entrepreneurial yeah was entrepreneurial and it basically got out almost every one fired out and so when you're in that position where you have nothing to lose you become very creative\nYou become like you bring this team together and so for me it was an incredible awakening that uh I could be part of change that I could be valued for an opinion that could form a team around it it was just freeing and to this day probably one of the best jobs I ever had so that was very early in my career\nI Would have probably been um you know early to mid thirties\nWow and so you know one of the things that was really striking to me and reading the book which it's awesome and I actually I found super inspiring to really sort of think about\nWhat does what does it mean to be an explorer I change maker as an individual as a leader of an organization and then also as an advisor you've played all three of the different different roles\nYou know ... one of the things in your story that is super interesting is the fact that\nYou know you have found yourself sort of time and time again being asked by someone to take on more responsibility to take on a big challenge and you haven't backed down from it\nAnd that's why I was curious one was kind of the moment that you knew you were not only capable but but excited for the thrill and the challenge of\nTaking on something that didn't seem like it was possible because what you're describing in terms of NBC News was before you went to ... for the time and they aren't going to share that story\nYeah well I um I grew up in NBC GE owns NBC I got a call one day from jak well saying hey come upstairs I Want to talk to you and he bought me energy and it was it was the height of ... g's ascension to you know rock star status as a company in him as rock star CEO and it was a time of\nAnd he was in the process of having a succession he had announced that um but the culture was very much of perfection and precision and um it was very much six sigma had rocketed did use that to you know kind of help\nThe company at NBC we did six sigma and like we didn't know what we were doing it was it was like imagine I mean six sigma in a broadcasting network I don't know we the best we came up with rebranded these hats that were really great we called him cue NBC was quality NBC and um\nMy first exposure to six segment with actually the third Iraq and\nYou know it's ... it's the best but people thought we were launching um the queer network where in DC and they became incredibly hot hat because people thought they were really really we're launching something really exciting and it wasn't that exciting but um so I go to the G and it was very much this precision culture\nAnd so jak leaves Jeff ... comes in and I think I was tasked with at the time I became chief marketing officer and just we had to innovate\nDreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAnd trust me like when you're flying a jet engine wherever you're going next time like what was like signal you want that to be as many signals as possible\nBut if you're going to innovate I'm a quest for perfection to hold your background so people ground measuring defects and if you made a mistake you were a defect that was the environment I walked into what\nI found reading the book that was so cool is there was a very specific reason that G. E. was moving from the six sigma\nFinancial operations and engineering and manufacturing excellence to innovation and exploration which was this move from you know essentially\nManufactured growth to organic roast what was that like to go through the transition of a corporate strategy and just what was that experience like and then there's also a really interesting aspect which was\nNot only were you entering an organization that had three hundred thousand employees and was moving to a very ... needed to move to a very different culture in a very different metric which was organic rose but you're also doing it in a role that you would never had before\nYeah so I mean the organic mend it was clear of the company has grown a lot through acquisition and I think that happens a lot in business where you grow throughout position but you need to grow it you have\nAnd the world was becoming more global and them grow the opportunity to grow meant you had to go to new markets or you had to discover all kinds of new trends you had to to be part of the world and\nThat was the mandate right and so I came in as the chief marketing officer you hadn't been one I hadn't\nBeen one I haven't even been like a marketing tool I didn't and NBC I had led advertising edgy but marketing and advertising advertisers just a small town of marketing and\nThe ... to me the opportunity was marketing is about the market like this is it it's about gross it's about making the market it's about and when when you take your job seriously it's about marketing live in the market you start to see change you start to see patterns\nAnd so that really became I think the discovery for us was hey marketing should be brought to the beginning of the process it's the GPS of an organization it's where's the world's going and that was really are calling card\nSo moving from it and that was that the expectation of G. E. your peers\nAnd no not at all and then they'll sex vacation that we he wanted he wanted a team that could help help us point\nTo where the world was going and to help drive new revenue that with organic growth new revenue\nAnd he just kind of said here go figure it out\nAnd I hadn't been trained classically I hadn't been to business school I grew up in media and so I had to kind of forge a new path people like why are you here\nThey didn't want to know what they didn't really even understand what marketing was nor did I really I um but the sense of it's not just what you tell the story you tell it's not just the ad you do [noise]\nUm so we went out and hired a bunch of great marketing people um\nWhy do we need to understand this and why is it relevant to us so [noise]\nUm and then you have to start bringing those those insights and I call them sparks you bring in people that um have expertise in this this new weird thing\nAnd you make the team feel really uncomfortable um because they provoke them I remember in the early days of blocked a I we've got some folks here her experts in block chain in bitcoin\n'em and bringing in some of the real early pioneers many of them from here into our financial services teen and forcing them over dinner for three hours to have really uncomfortable conversations people talking about things they had no idea what they were talking about [noise]\nUm but usually out of that they're like oh\nA and you're you're there translating in facilitating you see if this happens okay maybe it's not the crypto currency we care about\nBut what about a hyper ledger what about the ability to have a totally transparent ledger what was that due to the accounting systems of our company so your job is a bit of a ... in that role the outside or inside as a translator almost like a midwife you kind of\nTrying to bring along that process\nUm but people have to see it for themselves and I think that's where companies organizations fall down yes you need I Am big believer in futurist and consultants and people like that but\nWhat happens if you're if you're not careful as you're a bit of a like\nA cool kid trendy smarty pants and people like shut up I I don't know what you're talking about they have to see it for themselves they have to make room for it in their own way so that is a lot of those kind of group exercises the field trips you're doing together is that people have to make their sense of these that these new trends\nAnd how have you done that it is specially in established organizations you know the innovators dilemma you know the ...\nDreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nThis as an example from the digital advertising era that it's just such a great example of\nYou know everybody actually has a point of view that's accurate um yes it is less money today but how do you refrain people's perspectives especially people that\nYou are influencing as piers around and people that don't report to you that are more senior to you what have you found works because\nSeems like harnessing that kind of you know lightning in a bottle is something that each and every one of us can take into work tomorrow\nYeah well I um I think what doesn't work has to come in and go like your ... you you don't get to do which I've been incredibly guilty of doing in my career and you're talking about the digital pennies for the digital pennies versus analog dollars that was a big thing when I was at NBC and where the arrival of sort of take you back to that time\nUm it was the arrival of YouTube on the scene and if you were in media at the time you were equally equal parts bemused and horrified\nYou were bemused because it was like oh so cute these cats playing piano isn't that's so cute that's really clever and then you were panic because you're like well what if everybody likes cats playing piano and they don't want what we make anymore what are we going to do [noise]\nUm so the first thing you do is you try to bring in people who are good at doing videos of cats playing the piano [noise]\nUm and we did that right I mean we tried to bring in people early pioneers who did kind of short videos trying to embed them in this case working even in places like Saturday Night live in places like that where you're trying to embed some of that are taking the examples that are happening and\nAnd blowing them up in that case a Saturday Night live had a big hit with something called um\nCalled I'm lazy Monday lazy Monday and it was ... lazy Sunday sorry and it became a ... create all these fire hits on lazy Monday and other things but late Sunday was\nYou know this huge it kind of broke the Internet of its day and I'm like oh that's good like we can do that and let's bring in more people like that and so you salute the people inside who were doing that they become your heroes and you find a way to fund more of that and you said be like be like them\nUm so it's just a continual seeding of that environment um the worst thing you can do is just say okay this is a new thing now everybody change and this is it because people don't want don't want to\nDo that or allow for an organization and there's certainly happened during you know that that the dot com bust where it was like everybody who was in traditional media breathe a sigh of relief because this whole Internet thing was not actually going to happen yeah ah\nYou have to keep pushing it you have to keep pushing it and there are a lot of failures are a lot of things that don't work we did a big acquisitions\nAt the time we did a big acquisition called village that was this amazing community and it was a perfect strategy with community needs content and you know in in our mind we didn't we didn't have enough foresight to think this is an ex a Facebook Facebook was just arriving on the scene but you saw the pieces there but we totally botched it up\nWe put all the big company sort of east coast you killed at you rejected the you pick your property that probably wasn't wasn't as savvy it technically is it needed to be and then the organization just kills it so that's a lot of what you have to be prepared to do is you're getting ready for these new things\nAnd so you have to be patient if you're willing to put some dollars at work on things that aren't going to work out\nAnd you have to keep doing it now a decade later you look back and you say those things were going to happen but you often don't have a decade to say she told your side\nDreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nFor every I village there's a Hulu yeah and we're every um you know for for every\nFailure there's a ... nation you know and and these types of things that really not only delivered and this is\nThis is where I think the innovation that you really spearheaded and organized and collaborated and really shifted culture edgy is so impressive because you did it\nYet there was investment that but there was absolutely the expectation that there was it was about like eagle imagination was about the environment but also about economic you're going to make some money and\nAnd maybe you can share a little bit about that story because it's coming back to what we were talking about earlier of this cultural shift and uh a trend shift what you did with that um and what the leadership team and gee did with ... ... is pretty incredible\nYeah well it's a similar kind of what you're seeing a pattern hears I'm Talking I mean at the time we were hearing from our customers that they were uh in different industries air train energy that they were seeing regulation in Europe\nThey were fearful that they were gonna have a financial hardship of regulation came here and they weren't ready for it and they said what can you do you start to see the pattern recognition\nTeam goes to work let's go discover let's go on the market let's figure out what the trends are saying um and it was again back\nTo like cats playing piano is very silly a central generation energy business so you know wind is cute it's cute the energy from the sun yeah that that's cute like that's really cute but\nUm we we we and ... so you have to get out and discover you have to have a champion we had a champion and Jeff ... CEO and chairman a GED who who championed the discovery of those who made room for that you have to have that you have to have time to see the patterns and I say one of the best things that ... that I learned out of that is\nYou have to take some of those naysayers the the um stakeholders that are building that future and you have to dream together um so what often holds companies back is it's like well my customers will never go for that\nSo ugly ... green tech okay some customers want it but we got a lot of customers that are never going to go for that\nSo what we created we're dreaming sessions with customers where we came we brought top costs energy customers brought them together we dreamed we said we're going to dream about ten years we gave them virtual currency and it wasn't crypto currency but it was you know okay here's a million dollars what are you going to spend it on\nAnd we literally imagined it forward what's the future look like\nIf you're investing our money with us what technology out of that came a much more enhanced position and wind\nBut you did it together and the sales team that was very nervous like we're going to get ahead of our customers the finance team oh no we're going to get ahead of the market started to see like our customers will sign up for this they're buying in for this so you're getting over the fear that is what you're doing and you're creating a shared vision for the future and a story together\nAnd those things and then you have to go to work and so an ego we said okay we're going to\nInvest money we're going to hold ourselves accountable we are going to talk to a lot of people in the I'm In the clean space who\nPreviously criticized us 'cause we had a pretty harsh we fought the EPA on some things that we had to really put ourselves out there take risks to all the time you're working through the situation where ultimately the bottom line is people are afraid\nThey're afraid of taking a risk they're afraid of change they're afraid of losing business and this interesting sort of foot no to the ego effort is um we were all we were talking to customers who were planning the future other customers\nDreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\n... and you have to have that moment Jeff ... he didn't tell us the team that was developing it which I really appreciate it so you have to protect those nascent teams and make sure they're not losing confidence and that they keep pushing forward and that you have enough good insight that you're on the right path\nWell and I I Love that story because it really does speak to what it means to be a leader yeah it does is sometimes you have to actually take it\nAnd it's not about spreading you know spreading fear but rather you actually containing it and and that's also why I asked the question around how do you take care of yourself as a leader um\nAnd ensure that you actually have the resilience and the things that you need to push forward to that ten year vision and to that future that can have a number of different possibilities\nAnd say Hey Eric like relieving innovation that she can you come and talk to our company and he goes well you're not a start up like why would I Do that and I think he said and do I have to wear a suit and you're like yeah and he did come over here where he did come the first meeting in a suit without a tie but um and so we like Jack Dorsey yeah\nYeah so we tend to find in front of Congress yeah\nDreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAnd we said we're going to put a project together\nYou're in and he was able to sort of in a pretty short time show and integrated team they at the beginning he comes in I remember they were sitting like this they're like OK smarty pants you know software guy what do you know\nYou talk about ... a change or you can make fifty change orders in ... in a week we we can't make one order change in the year where do you know and he showed them what he knew when he challenged the thinking and he brought them in and\nYou know what what we learned it was a it was the fear that was holding people back and it gave birth to something we called fast works and lean start up with just a piece of it but it was really the tests and learn\nMinimally viable product became a really great way to get change going okay just just tested just give me a prototype and again software people and you know think that's the way you work but not every not every organization is used to doing that\nI think that is a a really important point at one of our audience members asked ... you're on a show you said what was sort of the most surprisingly innovative company out there and you said Walmart um\nWhy well I I'll get some contacts I think in terms of uh they they said you can't pick any new tech company okay so that as a bit of ... of qualifier\nI'm and I'm just because I worked for the company I'm into transformation stories I like it's easy to be disruptive when you start from scratch and you don't have legacy issues to deal with it's easy to be innovative it's not easy to be innovative in any situation on economic refrain that\nIt is really hard to transform when you've been around for a while and when you have big scale and look they've had a few missteps right they haven't gotten the digital thing right seemingly now they either with fear\nPatients whatever they've started to play to their strengths they acquired jet realizing they had to be digital and they've started to accept and recognize their need for their physical location in a way that I think is pretty smart and so I like some of these traditional companies and I guess I Would especially sitting here in Silicon valley\nYou've got Google down the road you've got apple down the road you've got you know Amazon above plane ride away on this coast\nThese are big ... these are becoming big companies\nThat um are at a huge scale with huge expectations about what they're going to do next\nAre they going to be able to reinvent what's next are they taking enough meaningful risks\nAre we asking those questions now and are we looking to some of these older companies that have had to go through this look at Tesla right down the road right now\nThere's a lot of challenges at Tesla I we could probably have a whole lecture on tests on I'm not an expert but\nI think one of one of their issues is scale and so are they learning from what GM has done yes we want to dismiss GM and say oh they're yesterday there the horse and buggy but there are some good things they've done so how\nCrazy would it be for the Tesla team to and they are hiring of kind of people to say huh\nTests that might have a cultural issue are they looking at more established companies that have really invested in the people in the culture and getting them to transform at scale as these companies here get to these places they need those kind of role models which maybe they're not thinking they they it's\nIt's interesting from a cultural perspective because if you think about you know raising a pirate flag outside of your company and rallying a really small team to be better than those stupid people over in Detroit or the stupid people up and see\nDreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu smarter better\nAt and doing something and that is actually if if if you've built the company or a product that achieves growth in scale doing that and not GE scale but like San Francisco's details like that's different Dale ... when you make that transformation and how you make that transition actually\nBecomes pretty challenging it does and you have\nTo keep renewing yourself and you still need those pirates with in it and that even test jobs finally took the Microsoft Money yeah you and but it's a fine balance if you're leading these scaled companies that you need both you need the people who can help you the the sort of precision operations and you need to constantly received the pirates\nAnd I think you look at these big companies I mean she's a classic case it's\nIt's in a tough place right now it's a really great company but you know you could say couldn't move faster\nThe complexity of that company I don't think people outside for sure and even inside appreciated the complexity that came with all that scale and how hard it is to re boot\nAs you reflect back on\nYour nearly Thirty years at at GE or at NBC Angie you know are there moments or the or their inflection points that as you fast forward a decade to today where\nYou know the the the complexity and the challenges are actually a little bit overwhelming story you how do you think about it um what's ... what's your sort of assessment and also just what's one practical thing that as you look back on any of us listening to this\nTonight or in the audience can kind of take away is we think about the story of gee\nI I think that um you don't get to be a hundred and twenty five year old company without knowing how to transform yourself\nSo they're always highs and lows\nAnd they're always going to be that and you always have to there has to be some part of the company that believes tomorrow's gonna be better than ... than today and so are you making room for that and I could point to show you right now if I were to take you to even del Ohio where they're creating the future of aviation and manufacturing\nThey they're three D printing and metal and creating a whole new way of working\nThat future exists there you have to believe that and you have to see it and so I think you have to have some patients\nI worry a little bit about our short term ism and are you know ... where where we are in the in the financial markets right now I'm it'd be easy to Justin blame investors they they return they ... they deserve a return\nBut um I Do think our lack of impatience and somewhat imagination for the future Stein me some of that and so what's my lesson is that you constantly\nHave to move with the speed of the market you can't get complacent your culture needs to feel energized and a bit of fear at the same time and you need those rebel pirates always within always within and you just can't become such a perfection machine\nThat you that you ignore the rebel pirates that you need with and\nIs it easier you know does the does the precision machine end up having more resilience than the rebel pirates and if you need both ... ... you need both but which ones are easier to or is it just basically time\nThink it's basically time okay I think it's basically time because you have to believe those rebel pirates are going to get you to the next level and then you have a team that knows how to get to scale and operate at scale right\nSo you kind of need both and we dismiss those people who are good seeding um things um what's the trajectory hears every are is your future as a start up founder is your future um ... played out what what are the scenarios for you in the future\nDreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu keep\nSustaining some level right\nAnd so are we go out of business do you go out of business right not happening tomorrow so that yeah but the the traditional thinking is you're either going to go public or you're going to get acquired yes and then once you got to either of those scenarios you get big\nAnd how are you going to start again you get acquired and you're going to leave 'cause you want to start something all over again and not want to start something I'll ever\nSince I've had that shouldn't be that has for people like you yes and yet that seems pretty dismal\nAnd and this is relevant to to a question\nFor you it's not the first album companies to not have that regeneration machine\nDo well and and that's actually one of the really interesting questions that that is from an audience member but apparently also super relevant to me at this point um which is\nYou know in a large company where there is a lot of ways in which you are protecting the organizational resiliency for the status quo super high if you are living in in in an innovation center or a nascent project\nThat loses its executive sponsor or you know the person who does the acquisition who then leaves or buys your product that then leaves how do you think about if you were on that team today as it looks like one of our audience members might be on you know how do you think about\nThe things that that team can do to preserve itself and also have the footprint\nA and potential to really sort of show something forward and maybe it's going to find a different executives\nIt is that's what you have to do because I think the chances are pretty good if you go into if you get a choir to go into a company thinking I I'm good because they got this champion they're going to be there they're not going to be there\nSo I think you have to so it's a lot of just building your building influence your building bigger organizations I think it's the same if you're running the city of San Francisco you're in the governor's office I mean organizations you need to have influence skills so you're constantly having to be out there and finding new people to\nJoin you're kind of Mary band of\nOf people who are

he spent twenty three years at the Washington Post\nDuring the course of his career Mr we also received widespread critical acclaim for his theory of documentaries including politics the new black power and forty six books including the nonfiction bestseller eyes on the prize America civil rights Nineteen fifty four to Nineteen sixty five and his new book Mr Williams argued\nThat while President Trump considers himself a protectorate for African American communities around the nation his words and actions demonstrate otherwise to discuss the state of civil rights and the country in general please welcome Mr Juan Williams\n[noise]\nSo how we have a diplomat you know you've been thinking about your questions that you can sum it up here to ask Mr Williams and I'll just sort of get us started but I really wanted to just give him an opportunity to sort of just give us a\nA synopsis of the book from the outset in his own words as to what sort of motivated him and and what I'm all went into play when he thought about this book the writing of it um and just sort of the whole engagement with this this tax as compared to maybe other books that you've written\nA professor Taylor it's a pleasure to have you with me and the pleasure to be here at the commonwealth club thanks to all of you for coming out\nThis afternoon this is a a tricky subject because racist so waited in our society for so many centuries not just in the current uh look\nBut the reality is that we are at a critical moment so normally for me\nTo answer to an answer to your question professor I have been a tremendously interested in the history of civil rights in the United states and the\nThe figure is the people who have been central to promoting social change on the most difficult issue of race so I've written\nA biography of Justice Marshall ... off you look back at eyes on the prize you can see that I'm very interested in people who were change agents\nIn this society so I'm Talking about\nPeople like you know Chaney Goodman and Schwerner going down south in Freedom Summer Nineteen sixty four who are these people who would put themselves at risk for the greater good and in that case become martyrs to the cause but in this moment\nI don't think there's much question that if you look at where we are as Americans with regard to race you'd say you know in the words of Charles Dickens that was the best of times and it was the worst of times\nIn the sense that it's the best of times you know in my lifetime just ten years ago we saw the election of a black president a black man is president of United States in my lifetime\nWe've seen the first black billionaire we've seen people emerge or in terms of the coach from you in a way that unimaginable people from Michael Jackson to Kendrick Lamar\nAh we've seen people from Denzel Washington to Jennifer Hudson would Academy Awards\nOr you know we've seen the first chair of the joint chiefs of staff the first secretary of state African Americans it's I can keep going in this way it's really been an incredible period a tremendous gains\nAnd most of all maybe the gain in terms of the black middle class in this country and again in terms of black political power right now we have a record number of black people serving in the U.S Congress record number of women serving in the\nStreaming support for WAMC come from ... Center for weight loss surgery with a focus on life skills in support for a long term success with we've got struck me in gastric bypass surgery monthly seminars open to the public for when three three nine five seven five one zero to register\nRight now people say that worse race relations are worse than they've ever been right now half of the American people forty nine percent say the president is a racist including eleven percent of Republicans\nSo you've come to think what what has happened how could it be that we have such tremendous progress such tremendous growth in terms of the black middle class black political voice black political opportunity record numbers of graduates from high school and college\nAnd yet people think race relations are going down the two I think you and I both know the answer\nHas to do with the rise of Donald Trump Trump who comes on the political scene with the birther movement saying that the first black president wasn't even an American that he's an illegitimate president\nSome kind of Machiavellian candidate Donald Trump who then comes down the golden escalator at Trump Tower and begins calling Mexicans rapists and criminals Donald Trump who goes on in terms of the kind of rhetoric that he uses to\nTalk about a black woman as a dog\nTo talk about NFL players who Neal in protest of police brutality during the anthem as s obese who should be fired\nA Donald Trump who says at one point that are an American born judge a Mexican parents cannot be fair to him can't do his job causing the speaker of the house Republican Paul Ryan to say that was the epitome of a racist statement\nThis is Donald Trump\nAnd he has successfully appealed\nTo white anger and fear in this society\nEven as the society is becoming more diverse and especially if we've seen an increase in the number of immigrants so he has become a force of the vision racial division ... division in terms of class in terms of so many\nAh points of division in this society he has been willing to exploit for political advantage so I'll stop there but at\nThe same time you you ground his own orientation in the anti seeding party\nOf of the Republican Party itself and that you kind of outline the ways in which there he's not the first one and he sort of not an outlier maybe in terms of his lack of decorum but in terms of the substance of his ideas you put him along the continuum of\nThere is a continuing to be but what you have to understand is that since the sixties since the passage of the sixty four civil rights act since the passage of the sixty five voting rights act as you know at that point President Johnson says we've lost the south now for a generation right\nThe south went from being mostly democratic to mostly Republican in the aftermath of those\nMoves and we know that President Nixon played to a southern strategy with just that in mind we know that someone like President Reagan opened his campaign by going down to Mississippi gr\nEr and going to the show the county fair or the county where Goodman Chaney Goodman is one or were killed a and people had lots of questions and we know\nBe put to use for black political outcomes in the way you'd like to see I I'm not quite in other words they'll be racist and he did more for blacks than any other president American\nHis I don't I Can't Donald Trump I think I think when you have to say on this yeah because I think LBJ came from Texas came out of that Dixiecrat\nWhole attitude and tradition\nA but he is someone who would work I think he was a schoolteacher in fact right with\nA Mexican children down in border communities he had a sense of that and I think he had a sense\nOf feeling as if he could be larger than life he could be a liberator and that in the winter and Asian Barry Goldwater was that way too while he beat go water and member and he he\nPilloried go water for his racial attitudes around the civil rights so that's why I resist the parental care of your question OK I'm OK\nOkay um so this question is do you find it difficult to talk about race relations while Trump is in office while you're working on Fox News [laughter] [noise]\nI can tell you I I I think if there was a a different kind of audience I rip off my shirt his show show your car and you know because it's so difficult to have meaningful conversations about race especially with my\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Tom ... what's the warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat

of life and here it is to to me I'm In the arena on a daily basis and\nAnd so the attitudes and the questions that I have to cope with and the kind of on a lot because I'm the exception not part of the mainstream or it can be heavy\nBut it's just a different reaction when you're in Studio there is one phenomena that happens to you but when you go out the door\nThere's a whole nother reality in terms of how people perceive video logically I think it was saying um that he was saying that sort of when you're out of the studio that oh you mean representative of a sort of liberal perspective in in in in Studio if I'm not mistaken\nWell no I I mean obviously if I'm Talking to Sean Hannity or not I'm not that kind of he inserted right right so you must be the liberal concedes that comes out but it's like that I just give you that as an extreme example but I mean what you ... ... you know in my life\nThink people have often tried to pitch in home you are you left you write right now where do you fit in there and that was my question to an end in so many areas you know it just becomes a question because I say you know what\nI think their policies that have not been productive I think we need to for example I wrote a book called enough ... which was about the failures of black leadership in this time you know black leadership not going after\nCritical issues like why do we have a community is the devil by drug dealers want we aren't there protesting the drug dealers\nOr why aren't we going after\nThe problem of poor quality schools why don't we more aggressive and thing need schools are not serving our commend his best interest as opposed to seeing them as simply providing jobs again often times in the black community but failing the black children and I think that's that's short term mhm a short sighted thinking\nOh you know so on so many levels I'm willing\nTo question the leadership and then people say well that means you must be conservative no I'm just trying to tell you\nI think we have to hold political leaders to account black white Asian Latino if they're not serving the community call 'em out but again that's more outside the studio but at the studio where I work for Fox right\nAm position then and posturing there as the lesson\nButton on this other questions related says I Love you owned the five but how do you prepare for the antics put downs and nonsensical tons of Jesse waters\nAnd I've I and I fast forward through most of what he says it see 'em a raw or is he playing a role or is he just and immature resentful person\n[laughter] well I Hope that I have a chance to come speak to this audience and they're very interesting\nNo I I think again Jesse represents a point of view and finds that for him there are people who are big supporters and people who find his uh his kind of presentation entertaining and it becomes entertainment but I think it's entertainment that sometimes is at a cost and\nA two perceptions of common destiny in common interest and common commonality as American\nRelated question Mr Williams how do you maintain your civility working with your colleagues at Fox News who consistently support an echo actions in words of such despicable and illegitimate of of of of a despicable and the legitimate president [laughter]\nWell again I have to cope\nThe idea that so many of my colleagues are in fact on the Trump bandwagon\nPresident [laughter] well again I have to cope\nWith the idea that so many of my colleagues are in fact on the Trump bandwagon a and I'm willing to challenge it and to speak out against it and again if my hat's\nOff to the idea that I'm there and the audience for the most part likes me so that's the you know that that's a a shock in some ways\nMhm mhm [noise]\nLet's question do you foresee fleas are free [noise]\nUm do you think African Americans should join with Latinos or Hispanics et cetera to be a bigger voting bloc and how do you get participation significantly higher\nWell I think that what you have to do is make it seem urgent\nMhm uh and if people have to see that it's directly impacts their lives now we're coming up on these midterm elections and historically minority communities educating people and Democrats do not turn out in high numbers mhm\nBut I think that because this has become something of a referendum on Trump and because of Trump's behavior including a lot of his racist behavior\nI think there is a sense of urgency and I think you're going to see a larger turnout in terms of the consequences\nSo this is all about your life my life\nOur communities our family\nAnd when people feel that politics makes a difference I think you see them\nBecome activated too often they felt you know what it doesn't make a difference that you know the Democrats might take you for granted a and the Republicans might ignore you but what we have now is a situation where people feel that they are being demonized and belittle mhm\nUh and hopefully that does create a common set of issues that drive them to the polls\nYou write with a sense sense of urgency and that was the question was going to ask you this book is written with a sense of urgency and I you know I've been around you know the last thirty forty years listening to people talk about this concept of race war\nAnd nobody takes has ever taking it seriously when you see Bannon out in Italy I'm Steve Miller in the in the White House um\nDo you take the concept of race war seriously at all I don't know what what you mean the idea that there was this project and I think it was coast that we'll see I see that are written a book called the coming race ... this whole idea that race war is coming and with the president sort of you know flat fanning the flames that you're things he's of fanning\nDo you take that concept that ... we're going to Balkan eyes as a society with these racial divisions in terms of violence\nOr no I don't think that's coming I think that you have episodes where there's racial violence in the country and people act out or it can be somebody\nUh you know in terms of we see it with all too frequent a ... regular without too much regularity of you know the police shooting somebody and saying why did you shoot et cetera and fear of black men and all the rest coming to the forefront but no I think that the nation is on a different track professor which is that we're becoming more diverse and\nA and in my lifetime or\nYou know I like in the book I say you know Trump is Seventy two hundred sixty four ... ...\nYou know eight years different but we lived through this tremendous change in America but he seems to have missed what I saw happening right right and the growth in the black middle class for example to me\nIs the most important thing that happened in my lifetime right right right I mean to compare my life and my father as I say in the back that if\nYou know my father you know lived in in his life was defined by his race in terms of where he lived his neighborhood in terms of his jobs right but for me or you know if he saw me living in an integrated neighborhood if he said you know what\nYou work and have contracts with major American media white owned media you're right\n... if he said you know what you work and have contracts with major American media white owned media you write books for white publishers\nA you know if he saw that his granddaughter my daughter was a graduate of Georgetown University law school who didn't accept black people until the late sixties\nHe said that's a different world and if he saw me at the White House having lunch\nAnd then saw that the other guy sitting there was a black man and realize that he's President Obama say oh my God that's a different universe where I Can't imagine that my dad would say right right so you stop and think about these things that have happened\nIn our lifetime but also in Trump's lifetime ... what an amazing thing forty percent of black America earning between thirty five and a hundred thousand dollars in additional twelve percent earning between a hundred and two hundred thousand dollars\nThat means more than half of black America is either on the edge of being\nMiddle class or solidly in it and beyond it mhm but he doesn't plug into that notion of people have sacrificed people have been in the vineyards working hard to allow this to occur instead he focuses I think quite intentionally on the dysfunction that chaos and poor black communities\nAnd uses that disturbed fear and division in the white community\nMeant that there are certain politicians white segregation so we're feeding them the bread of hate mhm that that was what they could say to themselves that they're better than those\nPin ... next question\nIt is increasingly difficult for you this is again a number of Fox questions so there's a bunch here um it is increasingly difficult for you to justify your\nContinued association with Fox given how the network program being has evolved against somebody wants you to comment on that oh well there's another question please explain how Fox News your affiliations supports or denies the plea for racial harmony you original thoughts about\nSolutions so I guess people want to know about you and and your relationship to Fox ... here in many different forms\nWell as I said earlier to me I think that Fox as such a major platform in American media the number one cable news station in the country\nOr is unimportant venue to have somebody come in and ... burst the bubble I have someone come in and offer\nA different set of perspectives in fact mhm so I find myself challenging so many of their top personalities and I'm I'm there every day mhm uh and no one is telling me what to say so to me this is an opportunity it comes at a tremendous cost 'cause I feel a beat up much of the time and I say like oh my God you're not hearing\nBut it's not the case that I Am not in fact thing what I Want to say and trying to reach and it's very interesting to pick up on a point I mean I'm ... I mentioned in passing earlier than\nThat there's so much oftentimes positive response from people that people will say to me at a ball game and the airport and the trains whatever they will say to me you know\nI don't agree with your politics but I like you and I like the fact that you're there you know when I go to the water fountain and I run into people it's not that I haven't heard the other side of the argument and so I'm performing a function there as a foil but I think also as a\nA source of a different perspective\n... I'm this is a kind of a funny one that says you used to be six for you take such a pounding every night or five [laughter] um let's see ah there's a what would you have again that was the repeated when\nDo you think former President Obama was a pot was a net positive or or for race relations he famously believes he was ten to Twenty years too early Obama well you'd think Obama was a ... positive for race relations\nOh I Do uh I think you know looking back on the Obama presidency boy you know I see people in tee shirts and simply say the miss me now\nAnd I think that that's very rare what a contrast in terms of uh you know class that lack of scandal you know all the rest I mean I Can't imagine if President Obama had been involved with a porn star\nHas been you know paying off people lying if his first national security advisor or had pled guilty\nHis campaign manager I think I think he would be long be gone you know I think it will not eat he\nHe's normally have the scandal that we see with ... why I say I just don't think there's any point of comparison with this question is related to this obviously political pressure and negative media attention don't change Trump's mind or behavior so what we'll do you think he will win a second term what will change Trump and will he went again\nI think they're two separate issues one is I don't think there's any changing the Seventy two year old man and a who tells people he's a stable genius\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of perks or health systems providing orthopedic services in the Berkshires including ... robotic surgery sports medicine and anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero zero\nI think that definitely applies to Trump [noise] um [noise] as to whether he might win re election well his numbers are just terrible even now um and they creep up at times and there was some good news for the Republicans this week in terms of\nApproval of the party was I think at forty seven just like slightly above Democrats at forty six in one Gallup poll but if you look at for example\nA generic party preference when it comes to this election Democrats haven't\nBeen able to pull away but they still maintain a strong a margin advantage end when it comes to engagement in energy among the voting base Democrats really have a strong advantage going into these midterms so when it comes to the twenty twenty race\nI think it'll have to do with who the Democrats are able to nominate and exactly how\nYou engage Trump because I think that's very difficult as we saw in the Republican primaries if you try to say hey this guy knows very little this guy you know as someone who says outrageous things called people names like cetera uh it's not not necessarily effective with his base\nSo his base is likely to nominate him again I don't know if John Case sake or whoever on the Republican side might hold out and challenged him and I think that's possible\nBut I don't see that person prevailing yeah but once it comes to a general election I think if the Democrats have someone who is able to not only take on front but to contrast\nOffer contrast in terms of political stability mhm\nAnd political experience to Trump and uh I think I think Trump's in big trouble\nYeah wow that's that's I think that's news\nUm what is your perspective on rising he says uh smoke a little bit about it but what is your perspective on rising socio economic inequality increase housing education health care costs and its impact on the future of minority middle class groups your opinion and also they want to know how related to that how you feel about Bernie Bernie Sanders\nWell I think that let's deal with the first part in the rising income inequality and how it impacts minorities in the country remember as I was saying to you earlier you have for the first time in American society a sizable black middle class\nThis to me is a tremendous achieve and I think the two major achievements of the civil rights movement one is that economic stability but\nSecondly would be political voice [noise] um and we touched on that with my with Obama but also a record number of blacks and congressman uh like black mayors are right now you have the possibility of a black governor or in Florida in\nGeorgia to Maine Maryland right you know these are amazing yeah it is so I mean this is again part of the growth and I think you know I don't see how you hold back that wave of change that sleeping America\nIt's almost like Trump is happening up here but there's something else going on with women and with minorities electorally are across the country\nWell let's see I wouldn't I wouldn't exclude whites I think everybody catered whites I think people you know and it and after the failure of the Trump tax cuts yeah I think there are people who are working class whites who say you know I don't I don't see it I don't know what's going to again that plays into what's going on in the midterms but you asked about\nHow this impacts then the black middle class and well I think they didn't if you look at it the question is how I think the question that would come from the black community to any president is what are you doing to help that black middle class grow and in particular\nI think the question that would come from the black community to any president is what are you doing to help that black middle class grow and in particular\nIn particular to overcome the wealth gap so that even as you have a stronger black middle class than ever before they remains a tremendous differential in terms of the wealth in terms of people buying houses stock\nDividends property investments that attends a\nAttaches to the white community and its apps and in the black community so it's more the kind of paycheck to paycheck and people coming along slowly that is the big difference in what I didn't to reiterate Trump is taking away some of those government support ... that were put in place to encourage entrepreneurship to encourage\nOr the growth of that black middle class one other point on this this one from comes in and says he's going to drain the swamp he starts cutting government remember\nBush comes in Obama comes in and they are repositioning reforming government but at the same time you see small increments and government\nFor minorities\nDisproportionate share of minorities working for government state local but also federal government I think it's like thirty three percent more of a likelihood for minority in because a biased in the private sector difficulties\nIn private sector employment mhm so when he's whacking at this when he's freezing payments for government workers\nWhen he's taking away tax base from local and state government\nHe is impacting that black and Latino middle class in a very real way\nMhm mhm [noise] um this is another question during the Clarence Thomas\nI forgot one thing was about Bernie Sanders yeah how do you feel about Bernie thinking and again I think Sanders it's so interesting there's a real commonality if you look at the numbers between so many Trump voters and Sanders voters they're populous yeah and they want somewhat of a disruption in terms of American\nPolitics um but again the difference is that\nFor the Sanders voters base the government as having a role and they do not believe that simply by giving more to the rich\nThat you are going to solve these problems like Elizabeth Warren and the consumer financial protection born you know Trump comes in and he wants to do away with that in the argument that he would make is that since overregulation burdensome on business\nWarren and Sanders make the case no what we see is big business in fact exploiting mhm taking advantage of people who are hard working Americans of all colors um and I think that's where the divide comes between the Sanders\nAnd the Trump a voting base and but make no mistake about it there's populist energy that I think is rebelling against the idea of the establishment and especially the upper income establishment as looking out for themselves and their children's at the expense of the rest of the country", "show_name": "Commonwealth Club of California", "year": "2018", "city": "Albany", "day": "31", "locations": [["Albany", 42.65258, -73.75623],
