R. G. Dave Lucas WAMC news\nThe fund for lake George as part of DC lake George partnership this past week gathered stakeholders for its fourth annual salt some at the conference focuses on building partnerships to reduce the use of road salt in the lake George Bass and to protect the health of the Adirondack lake\nI recently spoke with the funds executive director Eric side about this year's summit and the progress partners have made over the last few years\nIt has been an ever increasing problem and I like to put it in perspective that every year thirty thousand metric tons of road salt are applied in the lake George Bass and\nThat is enough salt to fill three hundred rail cars or a train three miles along every single year\nSo it's a it's a you can imagine it all ends up ultimately in the lake and in the soils uh in in the ground water so it's a huge problem and it's an are all in all out effort to solve it\nWhat sort of steps have been taken over the past four years since the fund for lake George first started this ... summit\nWell first and foremost the fund invested directly in a assessing application rates so even though we know volume's gross volume's we don't know by municipality or we haven't in the past\nHow much is being applied all we had were purchasing records so we retain one of the very best firms are in North America not the world the ace is\nIncorporated to do the first ever assessment for an entire watershed of application rates in the world there is nothing like it anywhere\nAnd and with that foundation of understanding application rates we can then a focus on how to reduce those rates\nThrough techniques through new equipment through really changing the culture that has prevailed for decades which is you apply more salt\nOr when the weather's worse and when the storm event is more severe that is not the smart use of salt so we have moved over this four year period or from using SALT I would uh say uh recklessly too much smarter\nA and it's a it's a sea change in both the a perceived importance of this issue and the breadth of commitment that is now engaged\nI think it's worth mentioning the memorandum of understanding a ... with all of the communities that are in the lake George Bass and and how they are cognizant of ah the using the application of salt\nAnd and you know it's it's great you mentioned that the the the ammo you that was a adopted formally by all of them in ...\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more

winter\n[noise] well you know there were a couple of of of new pieces of equipment part of these are some it's always includes demos\nOf the most popular being the live edge plow\nThat is much more efficient and removing a snow from a road surface kind of like a a a multi belated raiser for shaving it just\nTakes off much more efficiently the the material on the roadways requiring less salt as a consequence there was another type of plow at this year's event\nThere were some new liquid products ah which are essentially diluted a a salt a application I'm tools\nThat allow us to use less salt\nAs a consequence dramatically less salt and ...\nWith the steps and techniques that the lake George community has taken a re starting to see other communities across New York adopt or adapt to these strategies to help reduce the increase of of salt in New York water bodies\nMhm well you know that that's the most heartening thing of about this project it's been intended to ah serve as a a model working example of what it takes to reduce the use\nA and how to engage all sectors in this effort\nUm and so as we've grown as we've evolved as we've demonstrated results we're increasingly getting a participants from across the region and even across state boundaries we had a contingent here from Massachusetts\nI'm In other parts of the state um and and I think though even more important is that the state the O T\nHas become a a significant a participant to the point where this year they they presented a their plans for initiating a pilot salt reduction project at lake
