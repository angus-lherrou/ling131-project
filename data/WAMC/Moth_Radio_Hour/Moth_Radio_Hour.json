visible [noise]\nI'm In all the years uh of living under my parents' roof I never broke a bone um my mother and father never one time had to take me to the emergency room and I strongly suspect that um we never had to\nUh buy a second box of band aids and the reason for that was pretty simple my parents were spectacularly protective\nAh and and Harvard over me to make sure that no pain or physical injury should occur\nI Lived in a state of New Hampshire but never set my feet into ski boats um I don't think a piece of athletic equipment ever crossed our threshold my\nMother made sure

climbs the stairs to our attic and took out the vodka\nAnd through the night he drank and to paint and sometimes late in the night he some and to me to his addicts studio\nWhere he painted beautiful

level of artistic expression that heavy looted my two I'm enormously artistically gifted parents the goal that I found most elusive and wonderful was to be part of a happy family\nAnd I believe that my best shot of having happy relatives was to give birth to them [noise]\nSo I married quite young at twenty three an artist\nI'm and though I Would come to realize over the years that we had surprisingly little in common\nUm we did both share a passion uh creative passion although he was a painter and die with a writer I think we both felt that there was no a creative undertaking more

the best art of all\nAnd I think that was the moment that I knew [noise] the foolishness that's ever supposing that I could protect my children from pain and the folly of the ways that I had attempted

with an audience um and actually although I Love what I Do and I feel really extraordinarily lucky to have gotten to do to do this all the years that I have\nUm my one complaint about being a a writer for the page it's that I don't get to see\nAnd hear the response of a reader to my work I'm so at the mouth I did and I could hear people laugh and I could hear people gap sometimes um\nI also learned a lot I could feel when I can feel when you're losing somebody you can feel when you need to pull them back\nUm it it's it's a very immediate form of storytelling that actually has informed my writing for the page as well and not just my my memoir writing but but absolutely my fiction\nWe talked about how rarely writers get to experience firsthand the reactions of their audience back\nA million years ago when I was a reporter in New York City I remember one time riding the subway to Times Square and seeing somebody open up the New York times with a story that I had written and I was looking over her shoulder and I was so excited to watch her reading\nThat's so cool guy and I'm sure the person reading it would have died as she knew she was the next city off [laughter] I don't know I think there are probably greater thrilled and her life but\nBut for me um to be able to hear laughter that most of all to hear laughter\nPart of what makes you are writing so really it is your willingness to be vulnerable like very open on the page did you feel even more vulnerable on stage with direct experience with the audience\nThe more willing you are to to expose your flaws and failing I Would just say you're humanness the the more you will the more I Will relate to an audience moral audience will relate to me\nSo I wanted to ask for listeners who I Know what to do it just is how ... how

sleep\n\nThe next thing that I remember is a there was a screech and scream and a crash and we had been in a really terrible terrible car accident\nSo remember I was six years old and my only contact for car accidents was television so what I remember is if we had a musical soundtrack the music was gone and what was replaced was\nA heavy breathing and it was in slow motion and as I lifted my head and I looked to my left I was facing the back I looked at my little brother who is trying to catch his breath which is probably the heavy breathing I heard and I looked in front of me in the car had been split in half we're kind of we hit in the bank meant\nSomebody that hit us um and then I looked at my older brother and he had blood on his forehead and then I kept turning around and I looked into the front seat of the car I saw my father still in his seat belt unconscious lying on the seat\nAnd then the dashboard the center of the car with also split in half and on to the right of the

um do you know what that means going viral\nSet thing where everyone's path through on the same name or the same article ah we're all talking to each other on the Internet at the same time\nAnd that happened to me in two thousand and two not two thousand two as you remember what the wild west days of the Internet or there was no Twitter there was no YouTube very few people were on Facebook so it was really really hard to go viral back then\nUh and I say that so you'll be impressed [noise]\nSo and do that as you I was a college student at the University of Maryland and um it was really hard time in my life I was sad all the time uh and I was tired all the time and I didn't really make any friends on campus I just went to class and I didn't join in the activities I just\nOccasionally we're right on movie reviews for the college newspaper and I did that mostly because I really like free things um\nThey will go home and I was a direct my parents' basement and for work I worked at the local the Baltimore Sun the local paper um in their subscription complaints department I'm\nLiving [noise]\nAnd so people would call me if they didn't get their paper delivered in the morning I'm sometimes he would call me if they had a complaint about a an editorial I couldn't really do much about that and sometimes people just call me because they were lonely\nUm and so I Would go in and five and talk on the phone until noon and then I Would go to campus um and then I Would go back home\nAnd that was my life so I went viral in February um I was in the campus bookstore one afternoon

head down learn English go to school get good grades go to college\nNow yourself a nice Chinese husband have\nDreamy support for WAMC comes from Albany mid no open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAnd so these are all the things I learned and everyone around me believe them\nBecause I was born and raised in Manhattan Chinatown which was bustling with a Chinese immigrants and kids of immigrants like me\nMy mom worked odd jobs and sweat shops and ah and tiny bakeries my dad worked six days a week as a construction worker and when he'd come back on Sundays me and my brother to take turns massaging his back\nWhile I'm\nDoing all of this I'm also trying to grapple with being both Chinese and America American\n[noise] and\nSo I'm In fifth grade watching a soccer match with my parents and if the U.S versus China and I asked\nWho every rooting for [noise]\nI don't go well of course China\nBut we're here in America I thought I couldn't ask that question though because when you're a growing up here you know that in that tiny Chinatown apartment you're not supposed to speak up because you're just going to cause the rockets right but\nI found my way to figure out does identity issue when I was Thirteen I was\nExcited to watch a PBS documentary about becoming American the Chinese experience [noise]\nBefore that I'd seen three people who ever looked at like me Jackie Chan\nTrainee the yellow power ranger [noise]\nAnd moon line a cartoon character [noise] so I'm so excited to watch the last twenty minutes\nWhich talks about people marching and protesting people who look like me they're holding clever signs in English they're chanting in English I never even seen anyone in Chinatown march before for anything\nSo big that all of these people will go\nOn the street and risk their identity their life they were marching for this man named Vincent Chin Vincent Chin in Nineteen eighty two was a Chinese American men who was being said that\nHe was being to death by two white laid off auto workers who assumed he was Japanese during the auto workers crisis in Detroit where Japanese companies were booming and people thought the Japanese were stealing their job\nThey fought the guys chased Vincent Chin and beat him to death with a baseball bat on his bachelor party\n\nInstead of going to um his wedding his wedding guest wants his funeral and said the next week the two guys who killed Vincent Chin never served a day in jail and paid three thousand dollars for this man's death\nAnd so all of these groups of people Chinese people Korean people Japanese people Filipino people are now saying\nCould happen to this guy Vincent Chin this could happen to any of us and so they began to rally together and for the first time for many of them they came together under the term Asian American Asian American I never heard that term before\nAnd Vincent Chin must have been so important if he had brought all of these groups together so my mom happens to walk into the room as I'm watching the documentary and I'm thinking she's about to yell at me for being lazy on the couch and she points\nDreamy support for WAMC comes from Albany mid no open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu that's your

eighty two\nBut I'm Wondering like what happened I look up at my mom's face and there's just pain and anguish and her eyes that she didn't look like she had wanted to tell me the ...\nI think she felt she had to tell me how could I ask all these questions how could I ask\nAbout a murder man and our family I had nothing to say at that moment and I just decided I'm not going to come from my mother about this I don't want to hurt her\nSo I decide to do research like I've done since I was a kid I start looking up articles on line I find out there's a documentary called who killed Vincent Chin I look at all the New York public library branches and I can't find a single copy but\nLuckily when I was a freshman in college the Asian American alliance green the movie the movie featured heavily

relatives or making fun of the relatives and making jokes trying to set up the filmmakers of boyfriends\nAnd she was speaking in my native tongue toy Sonny's at some\nMoments during the documentary you could see little each and trying to hold back her tears because at the site of the cameras she was always reminded of her dead son Vincent Chin and I couldn't help but crime myself because of this woman looks so much and sounded so much like my grandmother my maternal grandmother\nAnd she was\nRallying and she was protesting she was nothing like any of the Chinese woman I'd ever seen before\nAnd I thought to myself I have to find out who will each in is because if lowly chin is indeed my family and she's related to me than high I have an example in my family or someone who spoke up\nTo be a pot again to be a busy body curious and be proud of that you know so now I'm like I have to find out who\nWillie ... and I have to find out who Vincent Chin is so I go to the only place

to be there\nI had to step father that I've had since I was seven years old and I didn't want to get into the politics of which guy on which arm so I decided to walk myself\nBut he didn't like it and so he chose not to come\nTo my mom called them I called him and he said well I send a check\nAs if that's the same thing\nI'm as only daughter and he chose not to come to my wedding and that will always be true but I Can't do a father and daughter danced by myself\nSo I I danced with his dad my grandfather and as we weighed beneath the big top he looked at me and said your dad should have been here\nAnd he should've been and then\nMaybe he would have seen the small fire we had in the kitchen [noise] all of our hamburger spiders just went up in flames [laughter]\nBut\nHe also missed the double rainbow that came out after the storm it finally passed by and he missed our friends singing a song from Britain to do and and also has to pay and jump around [noise]\nAnd\nSo after all it

spring morning in the middle of the back woods of Oregon and I am volunteering to cut trail with my partner ... he's just ahead of me on the path and just suddenly I Know that it's time for me to ask the question that's been building up between us for months now\nHave this do you want to have a baby silence\nHe turns around and I see that he is laughing at me\nThis is the stupidest idea you've ever had\nNo I don't want to have a baby\nIn his defense or we had our hands full we were actually already parents a one year into our relationship his sister couldn't take care of her kids and they came to stay with us for a little while\nI'm well a little while became a long while became forever and our adoption of Haley and Riley had just become final they were ages five and seven and we were just trying to get that taste of freedom that comes when you have big kids [noise]\nUh the second reason that he said no is because he knew that when I asked if we can have a baby and I was asking if I could get pregnant and give birth\nTo a baby\nThis isn't some kind of a feat of modern science or I'm just transgender ah for me that means that I was born female uh I was raised as a girl or the best way that I had when I was a teenager of explaining what was going on with me was I used to joke that I was a gay man trapped in a woman's body\nUm and as I got older um that's literal feeling a feeling trapped in the wrong body got more and more pervasive and painful until it became um literally unbearable and I wasn't sure I could keep going [noise]\nUm and then I met a transgender person\nAnd I realized that it wasn't a joke at all actually was a gay man trapped in a woman's body a and this was great news um because it meant that there was a solution to this problem um and there was a name for it and there was a community of people that I could go to um but most importantly it meant that um I could stay alive a and I could transition and I could be happy\nUm which is what I did um [noise]\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu [noise]\nUh I started taking testosterone and that made me look like I Do now like every other gay man in Portland [noise]\n\nAnd it turns out that I'm the kind of transgender person who was just like fine with just hormones I didn't have any other surgeries or anything which means that I have a fully functioning uterus and totally healthy eggs and this is not tramp he's just a normal gay dude he's not normal he's special [noise]\nYou know what I mean so between the two of us even though we are two men we have everything we need to make our own baby\nA and we'd known dozens of other transgender men like me with beards and everything's who have given birth to happy beautiful children we knew it was possible a but it had been hard for pretty much all of them and that was really worried about my safety um navigating the world as a pregnant ma'am\nI'm but I uh live in a world of rainbows and unicorns ah\nAnd I just hope that it was going to be okay and I also am not good at taking no for an answer I'm so eventually he did say yes and I went to a doctor and everything was in good working order I stopped my hormones um and we started trying a\nAnd a few months went by nothing happened um and I started to think maybe it wasn't going to happen for us after all and just when I started to feel peaceful about that I woke up one morning and I felt really gross [noise]\nAh [noise]\nAnd I had read all the pregnancy books you know everything about pregnancy and I've been tracking everything on the ... you know um but it wasn't the right time for me to get to be pregnant and so I refuse any that pregnancy tests and then just made me and I took it and there were two lines and I was pregnant\nAnd there was going to be a baby you know so but also super scared because you have to do a lot of things to get ready for a baby like pick a name and buy diapers and learn how to take care of a baby [noise]\nHayley in while even toddlers when they came to live with us so I didn't know what to do with a baby and then my body started to change really quickly I'm\nAn all of those ah markers of femininity everything just got bigger everywhere and I had anticipated this um that it would be the worst part of being pregnant\nBut it actually ended up being okay\nAnd I think it's because really early on to my transition I just had to like um accept the fact that my body is is going to be like different I Can't go back in time and be born with a body that's more like this or my dad than I could spend the rest of my life I'm obsessing over all the things I cannot do\nOr I could get excited about the thing that it can do that their bodies can't which is to create life so that's what I did um I just leaned into that and then I just let everything else go\nUh in white around this time we had a chance to tell her story publicly\nUm and I don't know about you all but basically every store I've ever heard about a transgender person has been um something terrible has happened to us um and that's I think why it had been I'm so scary for me to come out of trans um because our lives our misery says the media\nAnd I thought maybe we could tell a different kind of story um because yes that there is hardship and and being transgender especially for trans people who are not like me I'm transgender women and trans people of color\nBut for all of us there's also joy and love and and resilience and family and I wanted to tell that story and I and I hope the world was ready um\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu everybody else did [noise]\nUm and I don't know if they still say let go viral um but that is what happened um to our story basically overnight I'm pregnant man was everywhere like Yahoo News if anyone don't read that um [noise] CNN a Washington Post people magazine\nPregnant man and I thought that maybe this is good you know maybe people are ready for this next evolution and what it could mean I'm to be transgender and I live in Portland and let me tell you people were ready\nFor my story in Portland I'm In Portland like maybe if you see a pregnant man at Starbucks that's not the weirdest thing you've seen that day [noise]\nThey were into it you know um\nAnd like trans kids would come up to me with their parents like in the grocery store\nUm and just say thank you for helping them understand that there's a little more than one way to be a man and and more than one way to be trans um a lady once told me that she adopted her needs to and she thought it was marvelous that my body could give me the life I deserve while also bringing new life into the world\nBut outside of the Portland bubble I'm not everyone was ready for this story um\nI became really good friends with the ... and ... because I Would just get hundreds of messages on Facebook that was just that um people would tell me that I wasn't a man at all I'm just a really ugly\nHarry woman and that I was going to give birth to a monster\nAnd then one woman sent me a message that said as a Christian I Hope that you give birth to a dead baby [noise]\nBecause that baby will be better off than a baby that has to be born to someone like you\nI was six months pregnant when I read that message now I have been transfer a long time Fifteen Years\nI'm actually at age thirty five I'm I Am past the point of average life expectancy for a trans person in America today [noise] um I think that I'm resilient and and strong and and powerful",

more wars I felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it kept going back I remember the first time I froze in combat\nYou go to war you think you think you're going to be brave\nHave you don't think that you probably don't go to war and sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan outpost called Restrepo twenty man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and um but this day was really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against some sandbags\nAnd some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nAnd would you have to understand about bullets is that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoes that you so much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters\nThe first thing that happens is you you asked yourself am I getting shot at because the sound the bullets make when they go past you is pretty subtle and then the gunfire arrives moment later\nYes I Am getting shot at and then if everything goes crazy well the boy the boy a\nBullet hit two inches from that side of my head and kick dirt in my face that's what I felt\nWhat's the angles deviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right now what is the math on that angle you don't even want to think about it um and then it's all you can think about well I was paralyzed\nBullets were coming in hitting the ground hitting sandbags smacking and did everything I was paralyzed those behind some sandbags our gear was right right over there just a few feet away cameras bullet proof that\nWe're getting attacked from three sides they're coming up under the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire and I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington\nPhotographer we're on assignment out there he finally jumps across that gap and he grabs stuff he throws my camera to me it throws my bullet proof vest grabbed and stuff it's throwing a mode of soldiers does the soldiers are pinned down too\nAnd he gets back and I have my camera in my hand\nAnd I start shooting I start working and then I'm fine I'm not scared anymore Tim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer and obviously\nVery very brave a lot braver than me um\nBut he was also really kind of thoughtful about war\nAnd I remember at one point he said to me you know war might be the only situation where young men\nStraightening support for WAMC comes from my dog harness

this little spot on this rigid in eastern Afghanistan so we were going to alternate trips and I I tore my Achilles on this trip\nSo I had to go home to kind of heal up So Tim took the next trip\nHe was on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation up up in the mountains on foot very bad seen a lot of lot of guys got killed a lot of American Soldiers got killed and wounded\nAt one point um the American physicians got overrun they dragged off of wounded American soldier at night in the middle of a firefight\nThey got him back but it was bad out there\nWay worse than anyone back home really knew you know and in the middle of all that same broke his life he's a ten thousand feet up on the ... with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long\nAnd the medic examines his foot and says well it's broken and we can't get a medivac and we have to be off this mountain my daughter we are going to get hammered\nHere's two Advil and Tim new Jim knew that if you're not prepared to walk all night on a broken leg for the for the sake of thirty man you shouldn't be out there\nAnd he did it I don't know how but he did it got down off the mountain\nSo we finished up our deployment and um that's how we started to think of it are deployment I'm and I'm not you know the rest of it was okay the worst is in the beginning actually and uh and we started making our film Restrepo and um\n\nAnd if the the film did really well and started it started with the scene um that was very took me a long time to be able to watch it actually I Would always close
