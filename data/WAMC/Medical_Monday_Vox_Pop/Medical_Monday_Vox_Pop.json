I guess I Would agree that evolutionary speaking if if that is how we look at the vitamin K that that that could be true but what we found is is that really again it is something that is\nI I I hesitate to call it treatable preventable by giving an interim muscular injection of vitamin K\nUh other complications for babies born in the early side have to do a lot with just sort of progression of nutrition and risk for infection so those are babies who [noise]\nUm we'll get a combination of IV fluids um along with the meetings and then gradually again all feelings and more and more hospitals are recognizing the importance of mother's own milk and not just mothers or milk but also donor breast milk to again\nHelp those most premature babies again rooster reduced their risk of feeding complications\nBut a very early pre me will not know how to do feed\nCorrect so those are babies who actually receive id fluids and then receive\nYou know he's a doctor he's going to get paid to take a break eight hundred three for eight to five five one Dr Phillip ... is our guest they're always on call you know eight hundred three for eight to five five one we'll be right back [noise]\n\nSupport comes from the tank teaching museum of art gallery at Skidmore College providing exhibits public events and educational programs for audiences in the capital district and beyond Skidmore dot edu slash tang\nAdirondack oral surgery serving the capital region and beyond\nAccepting most commercial and managed care insurance plans offering a range of oil and Maxwell facial surgery Adirondack oral surgery dot com beach medical services Queens New York working to increase access to diabetes care weight management and primary care beach medical services dot com\nNathan lick our hospital lovers they'll New York less than fifty minutes from Albany offering minimally invasive procedures for back pain\nWith Dr ... and Dr ... and ...

Adams\nSubject cutting crying babies so many different theories lead in such cry pick them up don't pick them up please ask the doctor to talk about infant crying on what to do\nAll right man it's you're nickel go ahead [noise]\nWell when babies cry it's\nIn the NICU it's actually a lot easier my baby it's don't cry as much but when baby is actually a are at home and there's there's a challenge for parents uh I don't think that there's a simple answer for whether or not to let a baby cry or\nTo leave him alone because again it's important for you to obviously look into the various things that might cause a baby make a baby cry okay\nAll right well that's a good politically correct answer well done then why do babies cry when they first hit the world that's my question well\nThat's just the shock of the cold I think that the changes to in environment it actually is for the for us we're really happy to see actually a baby cry 'cause it'll actually opening the airway actually starting that whole circulation oxygen transfer all those important parts that make for healthy baby my baby is allowed\nAnd they're still allowed to this day or this one is from Joe I'm Wondering about newborns being addicted to nicotine from smoking mother seems logical could be part of the cranky ... baby story and that is from Joe\nWell nicotine has been shown or at least smoking has been shown to a a put a baby at risk again for being a smaller a lower birth weight compared to the ... to a baby again who's been annexed posed\nA in it as for whether or not they are addicted no these are babies who are addicted to the nicotine or but we do find that some babies again who are exposed to more smoking might again be a little bit more jittery ... or so again not exactly withdrawal but certainly again they met her symptoms again I've ... is\nOur guest today is Dr phil a pan and back to the phones we go at eight hundred three for eight to five five one Julian Middletown you've been

things that again moms are treated with\nA for diabetes um met foreign not necessarily through the pregnancy if I recall but again that's something that uh is more of an optical question rather than\nA a newborn questions or neonatal medicine question ah as for the the potential effect on babies are babies again Ken at first have problems with low blood sugars after they're born a long term there certainly is\nFamily history that plays a part in whether or not your baby will be at risk for diabetes but again that is something that is as an older I'm an older adults really a or you know older an adult\nAs an older I'm an older adult really or or you know older an\nAdolescence uh maybe that your baby again would then be at risk again for diabetes\nOkay thank you okay thanks Julie over to Betty and ripped and Betty Iran\nHi thank you for taking my call her a question I'm about twenty eight years ago I\nFor my son was actually at ten months and months and I he had to be rushed to the neonatal um area of Albany medical center from Hudson hospital which didn't have an occult that\nNATO area so pretty much a three hours after he was born he went up to Albany by ambulance and about two hours after that I was released from the hospital and I was back considered\nPatient once I went and basically they welcome to make a nurse by Don in San Juan ensuring wow if things have changed in the last Twenty years and if there's like a different sensibility about a baby sit get rushed to larger hospitals\nAnd what happens to them\nWell unfortunately the we haven't fully come to our senses I'm not sure if that's actually the right things I should be saying\nWell you said it's an hour so why are\nWe we certainly again recognize when a baby obviously is sick and needs to be separated from um uh and in those situations yes we we do put our priority in to making sure that the baby is cared for and that\nBut unfortunately a mom's again I Want to be with their babies and needed a correct and and so while again is it important for a mom to be with her baby I also recognize that\nIn many times again they're babies aren't healthy enough to actually be with their moms either or and so that there is a moment of separation or that time of separation\nI'm I'm Sorry that you were a relegated to actually nursing in a small room\nOr you don't have ... already why I'm trying not to [noise] um we certainly again or don't do that anymore a mom's actually at ... or a baby that over the medical center actually are in are these in the NICU are in single rooms\nAre and their moms are certainly welcome to again be with their babies and if they are able to maybe breast feeding\nUp but you're right in that moms actually will not be transferred from an outlying hospital to the medical center\nOr if they're babies again are transferred a for a different reason\nDr phil of pan is our guest today on medical Monday eight hundred three for eight to five five one is the

and speak loudly against that the congressman didn't adopt\nBefore the judge President Trump issued executive order reuniting family or stopping the policy the day before house and fast with said he's kinda right the legal reality is make it such that they after Donald Trump or president\nOr decided that it was wrong to separate children from families and their parents or the Congress we thought that it was appropriate to say was morally wrong that kind of a quid vacating that kind of going back and forth is not the kind of moral leadership we need right now thank you Congressman John ...\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkeley Center for weight loss surgery with a focus on life skills and support for a long term success with we've ... to me in gastric bypass surgery monthly seminars open to the public for when three three nine five seven five one zero to register\nI said right from the get go that separation of children and their parents at the border was wrong both morally and it has legal problems as well now the overall immigration system I've been one of those Republicans that has been fighting to get an immigration reform bill through the Congress I actually voted for one\nUnfortunately every single Democrat voted against that legislation which would affect stock which would have provided border security and on other reforms including dealt with the issue of separation of children at the border\nBecause the Democrats want the issue they don't want to solve the problem right now it is my hope after this election we can actually get some genuine reforms done\nUm agricultural labor I'm a co sponsor of bipartisan bill that I Hope we can pass in the lame duck session of Congress that would normalize the status of up to three million agricultural workers in the country in the Hudson Valley\nEvery farmer and in the Catskills every farmer tells you this is one of their biggest issues across our district employers tell you just generally they have jobs they can't find qualified people to fill the jobs\nSo we need to fix this immigration system I'm In the forefront of trying to do it and we also should be honest with our perspective constituents and not miss represent positions of others\n\nNow to the green field [laughter]\nThanks um boy is this ever not Ninety second question um each component of it let alone and all of them put together\nA you know of course I support DACA of course I support a path to citizenship for the dreamers are but it it's too small and too short sighted a discussion a Jew allowed to stand on its own\nI think this conversation needs to be expanded to all of the immigrant workers that are working in this country because they're all of equal value to this country and its economy\nAnd if you don't think so just ask any farmer ask anybody who owns a restaurant as anybody who owns a landscaping company ask anybody who owns a small contractor when you get work done at your home when you go buy food at a restaurant when you go buy food is a supermarket that food is being kept affordable to you and leaving Hewitt disposable income for other uses\nBecause immigrants are doing that work at incredibly low wages okay as far as the reform\nUm the congressman was talking about that farmers are are are hoping for it includes a ridiculous clause which is a forty five day period of returning people to their homes while they're in the middle of working\nHow is that what what does that do to protect our our immigration\nEverybody here to protect our border send them back for forty five days and bring them back again who's bearing the cost about why are we doing it if people are working here let them have a permanent work visa\nAnd looked at permanent work these it'd be something that can be gradually converted into permanent resident green cards that is and then from there into citizenship if they work productively pay taxes and live here long enough\nWhen they went so fast that did you want to see Steve misrepresented disposition this of this situation we would have a forty five day touch back every three years forty five days over a three year period\nThis is standard immigration practice otherwise we would be setting a parameters for this class of of immigrants to legalize themselves\nThat other people who have followed the law do not have to follow the forty five day touch back over a three year period is not owners are difficult they could do without a consulate in Canada for instance to their home country or go back to their home country and many of these folks actually do go back\n\nAnd I question a question goes to end\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkeley Center for weight loss surgery with a focus on life skills and support for a long term success with we've

um\nOught to be ... and I think that uh\nYou know to get there we should do out I on a multi national basis I think unilaterally are moving in that direction sending the wrong signal\nTo the region or if we're going to be a neutral arbiter a and a credible are bitter and resolving what we know a is a very intense conflict in the middle east um we need to act like it or we need to bring to bear all of our diplomatic tools or to do so\nUm you know my wife uh is Jewish and my children are Jewish um and this matters a lot I mean she's done a lot of work going off to Israel for a number of\nI'm a career a path and it's become clear to me that um you know being pro Israel and being pro peace is critical but I'm also pro democracy and as currently constructed um\nYou know Israel is not a Jewish democracy or those settlements making so that it can't be so we've got to have a two state solution and in order to accomplish that we need to bring a real incredible thoughtful responsible leadership to bear\nI and I don't know right now that we have that in fact I'm pretty confident that that's lacking right now are the highest levels of government and so uh from my vantage point um that since she was the wrong way\nOkay John fast so you're a term Israel is not a democracy Israel is a strong democracy it is a vibrant democracy it's got a vibrant free enterprise system it's got a vibrant agricultural system and culture\nIsrael is a democracy there are our main democratic ally in that region\nAnd in fact moving the embassy to Jerusalem was the right decision you know I've had my differences on a policy with Donald Trump I've had my differences sometimes on how he says things and does things but the fact of the matter is\nMoving the embassy was the right decision Congress's for over Twenty years have said we pass laws to say that we should move our ... our embassy to Jerusalem that is the capital of Israel they our main ally in the middle east we should respect their point of view and this is a dangerous position that my my friend on on my right or\nAdopt he supports the Iran deal which\nBillions of dollars went to the Iranian regime and they are the main phone Mansour a dispute and discord and and war in that region they are a threat not only to Lebanon\nAnd two but also to the state of Israel and so are his his views on this issue but I'm astonished he does not believe Israel is a democracy Israel is a democracy\nIs now thirty seconds good classic example\nI said it is not a Jewish democracy\nMeaning that given the fact that we have settlements currently in the region um it is not a can be deemed a nation of ... a Jewish democracy\nAnd until we do with the settlements or we're going to have that issue\nObviously um the uh the the mission of Israel is always been a beacon of an example of what democracy can be in a very difficult\nUh um and violent region and we have always stood with Israel we were the first to acknowledge and recognize

are issues that were so important about\nUm [noise] I Would like to be our congressman because I Am like you I'm very much\nLike all of you it's it's really fun sometimes I think about it every time I say a woman that has like super fancy nail them like ooh she and I have nothing in common because I'm always doing the things that we we always do around here whether it's you know taking garbage says ran for station or chopping wood or giving rise to my neighbors are working on my own plumbing\nThat kind of thing [noise] and most of the candidates agree they didn't want someone that doesn't represent them [noise]\nYou know and if he is one of these things that is really hard to have naturally most people don't understand what it's like to live through experiences unless it's happened to them personally but I understand what it's like personally I guess that my parents are in Medicare my sister is on Medicaid\nOn October first I lost my health insurance because of this drunk driver and now I have a pre existing condition it is terrifying did not\nKnow I mean I've got you can hear about this ... got a cold I'm like oh great do I go to the doctor do I not go to the doctor and the choices that people have to make every day which is going to buy their food or were they going to buy their medicine\nAnd so many people like right now forty percent of the members of the house or lawyers super duper but how many of them don't have health insurance how many of them struggle how many of them know what it's like to worry about whether we are going to be able to get an education or help their family their friends with anything they have\nAnd we have big problems in our district we have no information and infrastructure we have regular infrastructure projects that we need it can't do their home or we can get to places farmers can't get their products out and people can't take advantage of the free market if they can't even have access to it by selling their things on line of starting a small business [noise]\nBut we need somebody that is not beholden to the parties we need somebody that they have not paid for that can go and say I will do this for you and in the house that may very well be spent Oh thank you Steve Israel\nA face to everybody for coming down thanks for the invitation it was really great to be here and we really need more of this more voices in our democracy and not fewer so thanks to WAMC for making this possible\nUm I Can't believe that I've been through a number of these debates already and we still haven't talked about the drug crisis because if we did I Would have had to tell you that none of the treatment modality as we currently use of recovery rate that's distinguishable from spontaneous remission and everything we're about to spend on it is going to be completely wasted\nA I Can't believe that we didn't talk about wages uh because the wages have remained stagnant in this country since Nineteen Seventy three relative to

got back in the Nineteen twenties the stock market is an irrelevant statistics to people who are now earning relative to GDP what they got into the night and in the Nineteen twenties and it's been a bipartisan effort to make this happen\nI Wish we talked a little more about poverty and what we need to do about it because as I mentioned in my opening\nIf we're not talking about poverty we're not talking about the costs of poverty we're not talking about the cost of crime we're not talking about the cost of education and more importantly the cause of lack of education the crime problem the expense we pay for it the prison overcrowding crisis mass incarceration of people in color\nOr an all coming from communities that are impoverished\nUm we really need to talk about these things because they are all obstacles that are in the way of achieving all the other things that we have been talking about and all of these obstacles were arrest raised and left addressed by both parties\nSo it's time to let one person into Congress and the other four hundred and thirty four will maintain the status quo for the people that are interested in that I'll just be one vote\nBut it's

organization I'm a registered Democrat um so I Want to thank you for for holding this uh\nUh a debate and I hope that people support fast so because I I think we are latch fast so Delgado we've got to get rid of this fast of character thank you very much\nI think you very much for the call anybody want to comment well you didn't watch it you've thought Steve Greenfield at some point actually on of his own election hall ... said he's received and of course the nineteenth congressional district and saying that here's this black man scaring blond women and children I pretty much what he said yeah\nAnd then there was a reaction a ... reaction from the audience who was sitting there look this has been a big issue in this campaign of fat so has been saying I'm look I'm you know I I Can't control that that comes from Washington and it's a different group of people than I Am\nYou know I'm ... there is no question that um if John ... thought it was hurting him or he would say that the people in Washington you just cut it out and they'd cut it out\nBut it's ... it's obviously working or these when continue right I mean I hear your point but these ads keep going and they're coming from del got his camp as well I mean there there are untruths being told on both sides of the issue of the question is do you need to stick with the voters or motors going to go and vote based on the ad out of whatever party\nSome will be it I just want to say that I'm sort of proud of the decision that we had after a lot of hard meetings and a lot of time spent discussing it about including all the candidates\nUm we've had seven person Democratic primary debates we've had a five or six person attorney general democratic debate way back in twenty can where he left it open for Eric Schneiderman who never showed up\nSo it's not necessarily the mechanics of getting everybody up on that stage are but I'm proud of the artist Susan or just to say we're public radio or and you know maybe they're going to get one percent of the vote but that's not decided yet and I they have a right to be heard\nBut it's an important factor because there may be some who look at them and say well I may vote for one of the major party candidates based on something I heard here today and for every single vote in this district\nComing you better believe it or look we had a poll today that we saw in which there was a one point differential to understand how silly that is um it was a ... a quick ten is done in a on a queen queens one uh uh\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire

with the debate I have to say although I didn't hear one surprise from anybody could have been a so in the blank kind of debate but I wanted to point out\nThe cost of Social Security always befuddles me that no one wants to discuss the fact that Social Security is actually funded\nSystem where the younger people who were pay in and that supports the people who are retired but the biggest issue is Social Security starts with Paul Ryan and this gang who have been breaking unions as suppressing which wages which actually\nHave less money going into Social Security which gives them this why that they can tell that there's no money in the Social Security for the breaking of unions\nAnd keeping the middle class when just down is one of the biggest challenges a Social Security and I just wish that one of the candidates would point\nThat part of it out that it's not necessarily a savings account which actually funded count and it's the younger people are working are not making enough money are making less money because of union busting is one of them but also waged depression but that's the biggest threat to Social Security on the opinion on that\nWell I Do uh I got to tell you the years a Social Security trust fund was raided by the Congress that's how we we're balancing the budget because the cowards and Congress didn't want to come up with the money that they needed to fund the government\nUm and so uh you know ... if they had kept their hands off of it or they would be no problem now\nI think right hand gems like they're still\nTrying to get revenge on FDR's policies are trying to undo Social Security by making sure the nod and the money goes to ... to look at say it's broke I hear ya they're breaking it [laughter] All right I'll enjoy yourself you did a great job valid and really press\nThanks Rick go ahead house and by the way I think Steve Greenfield did a somewhat address that in his [laughter] his remarks I'm In any case you know we had an a A R P put out a Paul\nI'm On the on the ... ah they put an appalling rate and they also put out something on the issues on for just Antonio Delgado on congressman faster but what I wanted to say here and to the point of the pole in fact the fifty plus voter block it's the biggest voting bloc\nIn the nineteenth and so this is another you know that topic is extremely important Medicare Social security if you get to safety plots voting block out to vote and the polls by the way since the summer has been close this is the closest one we've seen but they I don't think there's been one more than five point difference\nWith no editing and Alison they'd been all over the place a win their votes that have shown they'll go winning and losing and it's all a bunch of bologna right\nNow it is the point is they've all been so close there's not one that had someone leading by ten twelve point\nIt's all about whether people come out and vote and the one thing that we didn't hear much about today and I was surprised was about Trump himself\nA because if this Congress goes over to the Democrat it for the first time one branch of government will be in a position or to hold Trump accountable so it's very interesting than in this whole thing nobody wanted to talk too much about Trump\nLet me jump in and say Allen on recorded a congressional corners series with Antonio Delgado that we'll be hearing in the coming days and pressed him on this very point about impeachment what the Democrats would do to hold his feet to the fire if they retake the house and uh for his part Antonio Delgado

[noise]\nThat's a really good question um it currently has not been found to be effective to screen the whole population has incidents of ... is quite low and so generally it's felt that the risk of screening the population is not worth it but that may change as the technology continues to improve\nSo is there are a genetic a history here in other words if your parents headed or do you have a better chance of getting it\nSo that's a really good question um as I got yes some questions some ... are felt to be genetic\nBut that is the uh\nThe exception rather than the rule most ah patients who have an ... either ruptured her on ruptured you not have a family history the only risk factor that we know for ... information and enters I'm ruptured smoking\nBut we do see plenty of patients who have enters who've never smoked before where there are other and you always wonder what is the smoke do we don't really know other than the fact that somehow it weakens the blood vessel wall or more than normal and those ... are more likely to rupture okay\nWe're off to David in Canaan All right David and can in your own\nAs for lawyers or any relationship between the build up a plaque or

absolutely and that's one of the things I really want to stress today is that the majority of strokes are preventable and their preventable by the same things that help prevent coronary artery disease which are I exercise healthy diet [noise]\nTreatment of diabetes those things that can help prevent coronary artery disease can also help prevent carotid artery disease\nWhich is out of the same effect a ... for the cerebral arteries says they do on the coronary arteries\nYes absolutely as well as aspirin or ... makes a lot okay\nI just read a study that came out and said that the ... the eighty one milligram aspirin was now somebody in doubt I've taken one all my life so we know about that\nSo that's any looked at patients who have no history of ah\nAny heart disease and so I think certainly most doctors would continue to recommend it daily aspirin for patients who had a history of heart disease or history of stroke\nThat that's any specifically looked at patients who have no other risk factors and found that the risks were higher than the benefits um and the risk is bleeding rescues bleeding usually GI bleeding ulcers learn so I think a larger studies still needs to be done but it did question what we generally think is a safe medication for patients who have no risk factors\nRight they always pull the rug out from under me I like that okay so it's a one eight hundred three for eight to five by one one eight hundred three for eight to five five one we'll go to Maurice in Bennington Hi Maurice\nWell good afternoon folks stuck to a sharp drop one of my heroes

rigid out by\nOkay and now on to the gym in mechanic bill or given mechanical you're on\nIts me [noise] um you were speaking just a few minutes ago about a screening for ... we were out there um [noise] they haven't yet been shown to be a there hasn't yet been shown to be a great need for that um\nHowever I you're probably aware of this there's there's a company that does screenings are called lifeline screenings yeah\nAnd I have had a had gone through their screening I just went through a back in June and one of the things that they actually do is for\nIs abdominal I'm ... I'm Sorry I just wonder if you could speak to the value of of um\nYou know that type of thing because it isn't covered by insurance and um but you know their their whole shtick is to uh you know do screenings for for things that are have health impacts but that are are not necessarily covered by insurance\nOkay here we go to Jim thank you for that question go ahead Dr\nSo sure I'm\nScreening for abdominal a near them and certainly easier because it's just an ultrasound test which is certainly more affordable I'm so that is something that I think is becoming more popular but the MRI a or the seats yeah that would be required to screen for ... is much more expensive\nAnd the CPA does carry a small risk of radiation as well I the contracts administration and so I think until we're able to have a better technology I we are working on ultrasounds for the brain which may be some day would be able to screen for ... um I think it's so then I remain in question\nDeport comes from the ... program at Adirondack health ... lake offering weight loss surgery and lifestyle education better health better lives Adirondack health dot org the pride center of the capital region honoring el ... community leaders\nThe two thousand Eighteen pride center gala friday October nineteenth at the Albany capitals center capital pride center dot org Adirondack oral surgery Albany ... glands falls offering a range of coral and Maximo facial surgery including with them the extraction dental implant oral pathology and more\nAdirondack oral surgery dot com mount Carmel care center in Lenox, Massachusetts offering a full range of care services including long term short term rehabilitation and respite care\nMount Carmel care dot org and from the ... foundation for hunks of New York honoring founder Jimmy ... continuing his work for over four decades and for generations helping the chemical dependent and their families battle addiction ... got or for inquiry [noise]\nAnd we are back crews are wonderful guests are Dr Alexandra poll of all the medical center who is here to discuss cerebral vascular health uh and we're getting a lot of colds or will try to get to everybody now All right let's go to a yeah bomb\nIn a car rental cars and gone above\nDoctor hello Bob ... a good question I burn\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot EDU\nHas cerebral vascular health uh and we're getting a lot of calls it a little further you get to everybody now All right let's go to a yeah bomb in a car rental cars and love your\nDoctor hello Bob\nOkay good question I asked for my monitor was Seventy five years old and had a stroke\nA bleeding stroke but for many many years the treasury arts writer St George ... almost every or our you know ... Jim medical school and I mentioned that she had a stroke\nAnd she he said well that can be an hereditary now what would it be more likely to have to be we're all we ask for drugs\nOr is it something I should be concerned about\nSo generally bleeding kinds of strokes which are not related to ... which I assume hers wasn't because there was no mention of an ...\nHas to do with high blood pressure and so while the aspirin could have potentially made the bleeding worse the stroke itself was likely caused by high blood pressure so if you have normal blood pressure and she did not\nHave any ... I don't think there's anything you need to be screened for\nAltered shoulder shame based strictly on thing spring caused her stroke correct correct\nRegular Bob All right now we're going to go over to June in gangs then or on June in king's then you're on\nHigh doctors I just had a question I was wearing I suffer from migraines and I wanted to know I take similar trip ten for it and it's um I as far as I Know it's a visual constructor and I wanted to know does that put you at higher risk crush stroke\n[noise] how'd you so much work and has done related to some\nCases of stroke a so I think if it is helping you their migraines it certainly find to continue but it is something that could be aware of and to try to reduce any other risk factors that you have for stroke so to continue to exercise and to eat a healthy diet and to not smoke\nUm and to just be aware that there is some small association between the trip tents and smoking and stroke\nOh okay great and should I Do regular screening is that something that you would do\nSo it wouldn't be for ... um it would be for stroke and there's really no screening that you could do to them I can with stroke\nOkay June thank you I'm so sorry I didn't mean to cut you off let's go to Eleanor in Linux or right Eleanor Linux go\nHello this is not so nice to talk with you both doctors um I had a rupture of bay and you're done in

cause and your wrists and\nYeah I think that's certainly possible no one has ever been able to study that but there's no reason why you know we've seen secondhand smoke causes a lot of other systemic diseases and so I think there's no reason why it could also not be partially responsible for uh problems with the ... as well so Eleanor did you spend a lot of time around a smoker and run and

responsible for uh problems with the ... as well join or did you spend a lot of time around a smoker and run and gun\nYeah sun ... way a very heavy smoker that um yeah my husband was a very heavy smoker and I uh also had had any exposure to the car we knock cyanide poisoning a traps about three or four years previous to that\nAs well with my entire family\nOh wow [noise] well I'm Glad you recover after a while okay\nEleanor thank you for your call All right now we're going to go to a Donna in Malta or I Don in Malta your own\n[noise] Oh hi thank you for taking my call I have a question in regards to my husband had a stroke three years ago in the hippocampus area of his brain and they had a very hard time finding it and he suffered from global amnesia for forty eight hours and then\nRecover and he's had a um follow up with neurology and\nCardiologists to had a ruled\nOut a trail said and any other causes for the stroke like high blood pressure so but he's getting forgetful again and I'm Wondering how\nCould that have damage that part of this spraying or should we be doing some other cast is there's surgery for that part of the brain just any ideas that would help me direct uh the care that um he might need at this time\nYou feel like he's progressively getting worse\nI feel like his memory he's starting to have um memory loss and [noise] it it's it's sort of reminds me of the same episodes he had right when he was\nGoing through this you know I mean it's kind of like the same questions you cant remember certain thing and this guy\nIs not pro fuse but it's everyday little things and I also know that Alzheimer's I guess hits the hippocampus\nRight actually first I think I'm not real it could be a number of things and buyers Donald laundering gonna look for the dock have a chance to go and dock\nOkay it sounds like it would be reasonable to get a new emmer eye of the brain and if he did have any areas of new stroke to get some imaging ups the blood vessels and that's where a potential surgery could come into place if there's any narrowing of the blood vessels that is putting him at risk for stroke then we could possibly do a procedure to try to balloon open those blood vessels\nOkay Donna okay so what do you see a neurologist for that\nSo I think seeing his neurologist to start would be a good place to start to get the MRI and then they could pay for it to an early version if needed\nHow you guys getting along these days is the neurosurgeons and am very well better again in front of me\n[laughter] well that that helps tremendous All right good luck Donna and I thought\nYeah thank you okay ah I remember the neurosurgeon used to say the rap on the on the other guys were you know diagnosing adios a [laughter] I think everybody's game yet are you that's good uh\nAnd now we're to Peter in Bennington bitter and venting their anger on\nHigh alert world you're okay you're very painful for um\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu and yet or\nYeah that's good uh and now we're to Peter in ... and ... and you're on\nHigh alert okay and\nUgly taking pay your taxes you know we're very painful or I'm I've been told I could have surgery to put in between the blood vessels sure does but of course he scares me want to know about the surgery I'm\nSure I'm where are you listening earlier when the a guy called in who previously had a micro Mackler decompression [noise] what's that mean if\nSomeone had previously called in who had a micro vascular decompression I didn't know if you are listening then but it is a surgery that I'm very familiar with\nUm it's a surgery where we remove part of the school and we pull aside the cerebellum or the bottom part of the brain and we find the blood vessel that is impinging on the nerve and we him in a small piece of caught in between the nerve in the blood vessel\nAnd that's a that's a great success rates are usually very good and so for patients who are having to build hating pain which is keeping them from eating or from kind of living their daily life we generally recommend that they undergo this surgery [noise]\nThere are some risks there's risk you have a fish a weakness was rescued have spinal fluid leaker infection but these risks are generally small and patients are usually quite satisfied with the outcome after the surge\nAnd what happens to that piece of the of the of the school that you've taken away\nSo we usually in this part of the brain which is the back part of the brain we usually cover it with a piece of a piece of match and some cement\nWow okay Peter thank you very much All right now\nOver into
