I understand is president of the United states to\nGet in front of me with a a regular source or right ... you would really downplayed what had actually\nTrue you would you add that you basically say yeah that's just that great yeah we get an email every day from a guy who's a former Albany high school principal every day\nHe writes to us and we just basically said yeah yeah you just throw it off to side he doesn't have anything to say I got a postcard like that every single day from a guy rarely day or every other day the post office and he's very young\nGuy some of the male we get the roundtable panel ice field I'm On the mailing list I see it all and there there are several people who write every day whose whose comments never get on the air and rightly so but they keep writing better know who they think is really look\nThat how do we change journalistic standards to Judy's point how do you do that if if you're wacko the the unreliable sources the president of the United states\nRight but something needs to be done\nTo take a look every day at the two major tabloids in New York City\nThe daily news which hates Trump with a passion that says no competitors and every headliners denigrate Trump I think quite properly and the New York post which is on the other side of the table and who you know just defense him known no matter what the rationale is there's no way to change that is their ex\n[noise] the tablets are always just ... I mean they're just a little bit of an exception but they have and you could say that from where you said it's very comfortable for you guys very respectable newspaper\nWith those guys they have like you know hundreds of thousands of of readers is still it's gotta be journalism well sure yeah journalism what was the question the question is well the ... I don't know [laughter]\nYou know he meaning drum has succeeded\nIn systemically changing the way half of the country views the media and has a world view so much so that when Trump leaves office in however mount of time and no matter what the circumstances of him leaving often the residue is going to be remaining behind\nAnd it's going to to I Believe it's going to take a generation at least\nIf there is no counterbalance sing\nFor us to get us back on an even keel where people believe what it is being reported in the mainstream press the only other thing that I think that could change that short term\nAnd I hate to predicted or say it is some sort of a major disaster whether it's a terrorist attack of large scale proportions or five major hurricanes at the same time\nIt is some sort of a major disaster whether it's a terrorist attack of large scale proportions or five major hurricanes at the same time or the country all sits around the fireplace metaphorically and turns on their favorite media outlet to learn factually\nWhat is going on now but I you're right\nYou know here's this guy comes from The Apprentice he comes from television he takes what he knows about how to turn it on a lot of people including some money and not all who are uneducated and who are in that basket that Hillary was talking about before and I don't think that's ever going to change now in other words that world view that\nGot them Roach is now something we have and anybody who comes on from now on I was watching Joe Biden the other night and Joe Biden was employing a lot of the tactics intensive is appealing to that crowd there that you would see\nFrom a Donald Trump you know that The Apprentice ratings eventually tank so [laughter]\n'cause I live my point is that I think journalism is respected at the local level and so I have hope that at the local radio station spoke of TV stations local reporters working for newspapers their readers do ... what makes you say that I'm sure you get some criticism from some of your readers listeners and I think\nWe do that but you need time but there is\nI think the locals do respect they appreciate what you do I I think\nThe local reporting that ... I Wish I could be as confident\nThat I look I look at the responses on Facebook to stories that my newspaper prints and it's vile often it's right out of the Trump playbook often it's fake news in caps often\nEven when it's your local on alert warning of apps ... well\nI mean I don't want to speak to you for the times you knew that this can actually use that and maybe this reflects negatively on my old newspaper but as long as I was at the daily frame and\nGoing back forty five years we heard from the community that nobody would buy the paper if it wasn't for the comics\nThe police ... and the ... and so nobody likes him interrupt fish with yeah I was at ... we had a radio guy in town who used to call us to shed rapper and that was his nickname never mentioned the name of the ... we were the shed rent and then there was no more shed and they couldn't have happened and then ran an idle guided prematurely what a shame\n[laughter]\nWe wish him do that but that that's how I mean I I've maybe you've heard this line before I've I've always grown up with a line that says\nNobody likes their local newspaper I can recall our newspaper going into the market that keeps the journal was serving and hearing from readers there is a boy we're glad you're here we hate the tickets eternal and then we would have\nVice versa this another newspaper there Middletown or Poughkeepsie would come into our market why I'm Glad to see there's another paper in town because we ate so nobody loves their no clear local news\nYeah there's some of that by the way if you ... media WAMC dot ORG Alan ...

I'm a Bernie Sanders among others are giving spirited really too but I never see them made it appears that the mainstream media is falling into the same trap that they were twenty sixteen\nGiving Trump millions of dollars in free advertising while shutting out the Democrats have\nI think our listeners that's absolutely right we should not be providing so much coverage but the problem is\nIf something newsworthy happens the journalists need to be there to bear witness and share it with the people who are not in attendance or did not see the rally so we have an obligation to be there as journalists at the same time we don't want to give him all those millions of dollars that our listeners so rightly made mentioned not\nYes I totally agree and and not only is he getting free coverage by having the snippets of ridiculous things that he is saying repeated and repeated and the people behind him cheering him it inadvertently lens and Arab credibility and believe ability to the things

people to speak freely and the value of his ability to be able to speak freely\nBecause in many of these countries like Saudi Arabia and he wrote citizens are either ill informed or misinformed because there isn't freedom of the press and the absence of information is really what is the perils of democracy you can't have effective democracy if people are lied to\nOr if the press doesn't get access to information which is why going back to the arguments about our president which is why we need to be so aggressive about faring out his lives because that is what leads to the demise of democracy\nBut we know that his allies the Washington Post says I'm up to two thousand lives three thousand lives whatever it is worth more than ... so they do so what it says if water is falling off the ducks back\nThis is the new normal this is the way things are so why do you know who cares if this is not Allen speaking now Allen talking about what certain people particularly people in the Republican Party are saying\nThat first show he I really hope that the national media and local media to keep it alive don't bury the story there's so many crazy things that keep happening\nIn this administration and in the world we cover it and then we move onto the next thing and we kind of forget to stay on top of the horrible thing that they're trying to distract us from remembering and\nSort of all the topics that need to our ten times that it's hard\nNot a nice drank we have to keep telling readers keep telling listeners every day what still going on well you know and that's hard and that is hard to do\nYou know it's interesting it came out in the beginning and you got guys like Lindsey Graham on him I don't like and other people\nAnd they were making it clear Trump better not do this and not and not take this terrible murder and put it under the under the rug and then all of a sudden that chorus of Republican senatorial voices has become dissipated and muted and more and more muted now it's up\nTo the media that's where it comes into the media\nTo a point that out hey Lindsey Graham the first day you were irate how can we haven't heard so much irate in his lengthy\nYeah well you know I think his color as Mandela he folds it's a just kind of ridiculous he he always gives up after him huffing and puffing\nAre pointed an editorial on this topic was what we don't know is whether the president's silence on this topic you know Donald Trump suggesting maybe rogue agents were responsible for the killing of ... which term I don't think was his own I think that was put in to his head 'cause that's not telling Trump's words you would have said you'll bad but\nAh but a rogue agents perhaps did this he suggested and maybe that's because he has a financial stake in an area being or financial say have a big Sledge taken him certainly\nThey take him bragging about in during the election over money that he has been getting from the Saudis and they play it on the tape now he gets up and he lives again and he says I don't have any relationship where there any physical relationship with them at all\nWell then why do we not have sanctions I I'm not on our actions I'm not arguing and the point if the crown prince ordered a hit on a journalist who has a dissident there should be sanctioned by the United states\nAnd that's another good thing you know ... political but that's another good thing that's going on in the press has been able to take all of those pictures of the road guys who supposedly road guys who showed up and then they show pictures of them with their friends so it's really something so\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no joke no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted

powerful lobby is named Ed Rogers he's chairman of the Bee Gees yard group which is a major loving from the posters told him if you don't drop Saudi Arabia as your client you will not be allowed to write for us anymore and that is I think until recently I give up that\nI think that is fascinating because the company for whom that's lobbyist works is making eighty thousand dollars a month from Saudi Arabia is ... and they've determined they would not take any more money from Saudi Arabia while this crisis is unveiling yet revealing about ... gallon\nBecause for so many decades we in the press have tried to say that we're going to present different points of view you can be coming from different places and now we're suddenly deciding which places you can represent who you can be

journalism is something about values certain values have to be representing your journalism and if the preservation of human life is not a value if you don't stand up and say we're not going to have

obvious thing to say is your full of Vilonia [laughter] actually Ira I'm going to be honest with you I was gonna say [laughter] and then I got diverted\nIf there's anyone here who has corner your

you asked there there is absolutely no means [laughter] except that for years it's been a very left wing city with a left wing press and ruled by in the old days anyway and in some of it has come down

it was just I mean\nIt was it any better in the middle of the night that it was in the morning here trust me it was no no I wouldn't have thought so well we have a variety of things we might talk about we we get to some good news I guess it would be considered good news let's talk about the White House it's hard to avoid Trump White house no matter what we talk about these days\nBut there is a report that until the race in Prescott\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nThere was only one White House press briefing for the entire month of September\nAnd then at the most recent semi press conference that Trump had which he tagged on after the announcement of the trade deal with Canada among other things Trump how shall I say it I'll use the word this but it's probably too light already did two female network reporters\nLet's pat ourselves on the back collectively for by the way this is the Media Project ... brown Judy Patrick announced charge like here on Northeast Public radio and all of our affiliates around the country [noise]\nThe New York times did a remarkable job by most measurements except Sara Sanders\nA with this little rather long investigative piece about the Trump and the tax situation than Trump's father on and on and on it just seems like something that could eventually be a movie like spotlight was in terms of the digging that was required for this\nI'm not asking really anything except do we not all sit here and marvel at the store as Alan going to take a country of you [laughter]\nYou're almost inviting after I wanted I wanted to see it on\nYour cell okay so here's the deal did up by the way it is for you guys who were ... people\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu no I was\nRaised reading a hearty oh okay well I'm Britain to him but I'm going to ask but I'm going to ask you this the New York times comes out with this incredible report I heard one report that said they had to add extra ... to the times to cover this major report\nHow many people are good I read it number one and what are the takeaways from it and the interpretations have been very different\nThe White House was so scared about it that they had to come out and say you know it's not true and respond to it that way and then the people who love the Trump White house who said well they all do it so it's okay [laughter] you know that it's OK they're all doing it\nTo me that take away was hey I don't cheat on my taxes and if I did somebody would be knocking on my door and saying let me or to you and here's the president in the United states who's getting away with it that out of this and tired ... huge excellent\nProbably Pulitzer winning approach is probably the only take away that I can walk away with\nWell I Walk away with the fact that lawlessness does not negate a person getting elected to the highest office in the land or eventually perhaps the highest court clearly laws were broken tax laws are in place the IRS and appear to fail to do its job\nAnd I don't know if the people who should be reading this will be reading it but it seems that individuals who are concerned that they are paying too much in taxes would wonder why they weren't afforded the same opportunity and the same breaks also the people who tended to vote for the current president\nOr the very people who then have their services caught and don't get that sort of government help that they might\nNeed they do that because I Wonder about that every day I scratch\nMy takeaway was thank goodness for journalism I mean and for the New York times you know small papers tend to say oh yeah well that's New York times they can do these kinds of things but if you read it they did some hard digging and they also did some basic shoe leather journalism by you know knocking on doors repeatedly calling people getting some freedom of information request\nFor sales my lingering question though is you know how did they get those big boxes of tax returns from Fred Trump\nIs ... how did they land a lot of the documents because they must have been difficult to get\nYou know I was gonna say what Judy said I think it's just remarkable from a journalistic standpoint\nThis is the sort of thing that New York times is almost uniquely capable of doing\nPutting these three or four reporters giving them their own office they were the only ones that had the key to the office locking them away and and them doing this kind of reporting is astonishing to me an encouraging to me\nThat's one but one day is the fact that Trump over the long haul has so prime the pump among his base to be sure\nTo not believe for the New York times to not believe what what is real factual journalism that there are people many people too many people or shrug this off as just another job by the liberal media and\nAll that is what he said he said this is another job\nNot a hit job at document based digging it's all fact based and double checked and triple check and I'm not arguing so I Know\nI I you're quoting the president of the United states who says it to his base which eighty seven percent or something like that women and men believe everything the guy says and he says it's another his job and guess what color they believe that\nYou know I like the fact that they printed it all in one day seven pages just\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAdditional big story like that would have been spread over several days\nYeah the thing that I thought a little bit short with interactive pieces that they had I\nUm maybe it's just because I'm a reader but I was fascinated by the quality of the writing and I didn't really bother to look at a lot of the interactive that they had posted and defining director for shooting and that would be they had an interactive map where you can zoom in and see where these buildings where they were talking about they had some videos\nAgain from my perspective I wanted to get through and actually read the words\nWell if you listen to this program on Sunday night\nAt six get to a TV set a nine thirty on Showtime there is going to be a documentary\nAbout this whole story and the process parents ethically one of the producers is a kings to native but a lot of important that it is very important to kings donates but if you're already watching the circuits on Showtime which many of us do this is on right after it tonight I thought they had keys to the office as well [laughter]\nLet's go to a little bit more pleasant or perhaps hopeful news or perhaps not and that's the increasing reliance and growth of non profit news sites in the light of what is going on in our industry which has been largely negative financially that New York times investigative story not withstanding\nThere is a corner of the Institute for non profit news estimated revenues of between three hundred and twenty five to three hundred and fifty million dollars has been generated by non profit news sites\nAnd that upwards of three thousand people have been employed by the sights twenty two hundred of of whom are journalists and that also comes on the heels of a profit making venture is which would be the Philadelphia Inquirer Pittsburgh Post Gazette\nAnd something called the gal and the media group which has announced that they're working together to cover the state Capitol in Pennsylvania but for the exactly\nAbout that cooperation if you remember\nPeople doing things that would have been unimaginable before I wanted to ask you a question as somebody who was a publisher and editor\nAnd know this stuff backwards and forwards and that is how bad is the ... in the commercial press in other words we know they're making less money than they did we know they're firing a lot of people when I Want to know and I think all Americans want to know is how much\nHow in danger is the commercial press are they in danger of going out of business in some cases they have but you know right here in Albany ... Times Union we have other places and you know I Know there's a lot of seeing the blues by these folks but how bad it\nWell the short answer is it's bad I mean how bad it's very bad life in danger rings yes she said yeah I think before you see a number of publications literally go out of business on the front side you're going to see an increasing number of daily newspapers district the number of days they print\nOkay so back to your original question do you think that if you're the public you let's say you're the publisher of a local paper maybe the times you may be some Schenectady pay what you to use the word and you look and you see WAMC for example last year is approaching\nFour million dollars in underwriting on this station you get sick to the stomach do you think hey maybe that was the money that used to be mine get angry\nAs a former publisher and then it's not just WAMC it's all of the other print and broadcast competitors that has sprung up and the last ten or Fifteen Years taking a bite of the pie that we used to control them if you did a pie chart in in my market a relatively small market in the old days when I started in the in the seventies\nYou could look at that pie chart and see the size of\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAdvertising revenue and then there'd be this one little slice it went to the local radio station will that slice of the pie is changed dramatically I don't have the most recent numbers but I dare say that the daily newspaper which used to get Ninety percent is now getting less than fifty percent to ...\nYou were the editor of disconnected he paper major paper in our area certainly you at your ear to the ground with the grumbling\nWas unhappiness or the other guys are getting so I think there's always been competition and underwriting at WAMC I Know we call it underwriting but it sounded like ads to me I Know [laughter] and that well that means they're not [laughter]\nBut they are they just have some restrictions\nThat that's always fun to cater to people that are scooping up or reading most of the pie or Facebook and Google that's really the problem I mean that's the competition and the local market is always been there you just have to make the case\nI think as you get the convergence of media where and newspapers are traditional media offer audio where stations like WAMC offer print on line\nWe get the British you're going to see more of the competition for the local college\nI tend to disagree a little bit with Ira about how bad it is for print media I'm optimistic that these small local community newspapers will\nWill continue to survive and perhaps even thrive they're coming to a reckoning about how they spend their money I feel I was going to say that but based on what\nJudy I mean after all they're firing a lot of their borders\nYou know there's still a lot of money coming in through subscriptions and you know I look at this story about the local non profit news sites generating three hundred and twenty five million dollar and revenue well as someone who used to run in his room and saying okay there's ... there's the revenue about what were the expenses\nYou know sure and I'm guessing that your experience with the ... which was a privately owned family owned newspaper is different than what most of us now have experience because we've been purchased by corporations were there is more of a bottom line

we get started there is a public service announcements from a retired school librarian and the public library trustee thank you Pauline who\nBecause we invite our readers to read it and she pointed out that after the debate that she had just seen between the nineteenth congressional district candidates there was a short discussion concerning the difficulty in separating fact from fiction and she hopes to remind our listeners that real research consist of more than a five minute Google Search\nAnd that their school in public libraries enough to find a plethora of valid and appropriate sources in fact more schools had full time librarians who are given the time to partner and coordinate with teachers starting in elementary school we could be educating everyone was true research skills in all forms\nOf media in these difficult times it is more important than ever to make sure the libraries and librarians or support in our town in school budgets\nTo which I say bravo bravo indeed you know we worry we talk a lot of the show about people not having the analytical skills that good reading of the media\nDoesn't educated a readership might could give them\nThis is a a potential solution here anyway we have to talk today about some of the issues that have come to light at the time you are taping involving the bombs that have been sent around the country because their immediate issues involved as we're speaking we don't have a suspect in custody\nThere is a lot of investigation going on but we have had bombs that have shown up in different places targeting democratic political leaders and one that went to CNN\nThe question being is it's it's an attack on the media or is it not that CNN bomb and what do we think about the coverage in general well\nOne of the things that I thought it was so interesting on the CNN thing was\nWe know that Trump himself the president has been um basically agreeing with the ... at all of his rallies which is to CNN I Believe that CNN sucks and right that's what they say yeah and they do it by the thousands and so now when CNN gets that you have the president and his hypocritical Mike\nStanding up and saying we have to be nice to each other when he's been meeting these chains and talking about the press is the enemy of the people and setting up the stage\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire

basket of deplorable ... that were never going to get them she was trying to encourage your supporters to reach out to the other half of them\nAnd of course that was blown up that Hillary Hillary

news listeners and the less of\nAn because a Democrat is leading in the race right and so the followers was I described before may be journalistic prostitutes and do what they have to do\nYeah yeah I thought that I Need a whole rethinking about how we turn to listen and the age of ... because we're following the rules and he's not following the rules I watched Twitter and I think\nNobody I really now as a real person actually reads Twitter they find out what the president says I'm trapped because then mass media mass reports it and even though I think we need to report when he says on Twitter I think that breathless leads about his tweets or when he says something wrong\nAll of us if we're in a newsroom and we had a source that was repeatedly St faults things at one point we would say you know we're not going to listen to him as much we're not going to give him ... I understand is president of the United states to\nGet in front of me he was a a regular source or re route tension you would really downplayed what\nThat's true you would do it at you basically say yeah that that creates yeah we get an email every day from a guy who's a former Albany high school principal every day he writes to us and we just basically it's like yeah yeah you just throw it off to side he doesn't have anything to say\nI got a postcard looked at every single day from a guy really day or every other day the post office or the ferry now that guy some of the\nMale we get in the roundtable panel I see a bomb on the mailing list I see it all and there there are several people who write every day whose whose comments never get on the air and rightly so but they keep writing but I don't know who they think is ... look\nAt how do we change journalistic standards to Judy's point how do you do that if if you're wacko the the unreliable sources the president of the United states\nBut something needs to be done to take a look every day at the two major tabloids in New York City\nThe daily news which hates Trump with a passion that serves no competitors and every headline is denigrate Trump I think quite properly and the New York post which is on the other side of the table and who you know just defends him known no matter what the rationale is there's no way to change that is their ex\n[noise] the tabloids are always just a case it I mean they're just a little bit of an exception but they have and you could say that from where you said it's very comfortable for you and you're a very respectable newspaper\nThose guys they have you know hundreds of thousands of of readers is still it's gotta be journalism well sure yeah journalism what was the question the question well who does the ... I don't [laughter]\nYou know he meaning drum has succeeded in systemically changing the way half of the country views the media and has a world view so much so that when Trump leaves office in however amount of time\nAnd no matter what the circumstances of and leaving often\nThe residue is going to be remaining behind and it's going to to I Believe it's going to take a generation at least if there is no counter bouncing\nFours to get us back on an even keel where people believe what it is being reported in the mainstream press the only other thing that I think that could change that short term

including some money and not all who are uneducated and who are in that basket that Hillary was talking about before and I don't think that's ever going to change now in other words that worldview that\nThat approach is now something we have and anybody who comes on from now on I was watching Joe Biden the other night and Joe Biden was employing a lot of the tactics in terms of is appealing to that crowd there that you would see from a Donald Trump you know that The Apprentice ratings eventually tank so [laughter]\n'cause I ... my point\nIs that I think journalism is respected at the local level and so I have hope that at the local radio station spoke a TV stations local reporters working for newspapers their readers do trust what makes you say sure you get some criticism from some of your readers listeners and any new ...\nNew [laughter] time but there is\nI think the locals do respect they appreciate what you do I I think\nHe's a little reporting that is that why I I Wish I could

it's your local ... well I mean I don't want to speak for the times you knew that this can actually use that\nAnd maybe this reflects negatively on my old newspaper but as long as I was at the daily

listener in Charleston South Carolina how 'bout that super says you can download the app and listen to ... and see anywhere\nFrom Rob in Charleston says I'm a weekly listeners should the media projects and I would like to ask you to discuss the coverage of Trump rallies actually we dealt with this in passing\nA couple of weeks ago why is it that even MSNBC and NBC give him so much coverage and you rarely see democratic rallies I'm sure that lives with war in Iraq a bomb a Bernie Sanders among others are getting spirited really too but\nI never see them made it appears that the mainstream media is falling into the same trap that they were in twenty sixteen giving Trump millions of dollars in free advertising while shutting out the Democrats and\nI think our listeners that's absolutely right we should not be providing so much coverage\nBut the problem is if something newsworthy happens the journalists need to be there to bear witness and share it with the people who are not in attendance or did not see the rally so we have an obligation to be there as journalists at the same time we don't want to give him all those millions of dollars that our listeners so rightly made mentioned not\nYes I totally agree and and not only is he getting\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no ... no ... dog harness invented to make walks easier for

that he is saying\nAnd says well we don't know it's not been proven even though the Turks believe that they have\nAudio of him being killed and its member and tortured the president of the United states when they start to quiz him about it he gets nasty with the reporters who were quizzing him about it so I think it's entirely appropriate considering the context that he is set up about how bad the presses and one more thing on that if I may\nAnd that is look the press has done some things that I consider to be despicable\nYou take a look I always say that directs look at the New York post look at this and that and then what happens is along comes trumpet he attacks the press and as one the media probably appropriately rises up and you do this like when you say a press can do now\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no ... no ... dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com\nDown if I'm wrong and injustices in society jak and this particular instance this is a human rights issue the fact that it's a journalist from those of us who have a deep interest in journalism we can see this is especially egregious obviously this is an effort to silence voices especially a voice who was dissenting\nFortunately the Washington Post was able to publish ... last column very recently and which one was the last thing he wrote about the ability for people to speak freely and the value of his ability to be able to speak freely because\nIn many of these countries like Saudi Arabia as he wrote citizens are either ill informed or misinformed because they're in freedom of the press and the absence of information is really what is the perils of democracy you can't have effective democracy if people are lied to\nOr if the press doesn't get access to information which is why going back to the arguments about our president which is why we need to be so aggressive about fair eating out his lives because that is what leads to the demise of democracy\nBut we know that his allies the Washington Post as I'm up there two thousand lives three thousand lives whatever it is worth more than we were four thousand lies so they do so what it says if water is falling off the ducks back\nThis is the new normal is is the way things are so why do you know who cares if this is not Allen speaking now Allen talking about what certain people particularly people in the Republican Party are saying\nThat first show he I really hope that the national media and local media to keep it alive don't bury the story there's so many crazy things that keep happening\nIn this administration and in the world we cover it and then we move onto the next thing and we kind of forget to stay on top of the horrible thing that they're trying to distract us from remembering and\nSo many topics that need a large ... that it's hard\nNot to track we have to keep telling readers keep telling listeners every day what still going on well you know and that's hard and that is hard to do\nYou know it's interesting it came out in the beginning and you get guys like Lindsey Graham on him I don't like and other people and they were making it clear Trump better not do this and not not take this terrible murder and put it under the under the rug and then all of a sudden that chorus of Republican senatorial voices\nHas become dissipated and muted and more and more muted now it's up\nTo the media that's where it comes into the media to a point that out hey Lindsey Graham the first day you were irate how can we haven't heard so much irate in his late ...\nYeah well you know I think it color is manila he folds\nIt's a just kind of ridiculous he he always gives up after I'm huffing and puffing\nAre pointed an editorial on this topic was what we don't know is whether the president's silence on this topic you know Donald Trump suggesting maybe rogue agents were responsible for the killing of ... which term I don't think was his own I think that was put in to his head 'cause that's not telling Trump's words he would have said you'll bad but\nUh but a rogue agents perhaps did this he suggested and maybe that's because he has financial stake in an area being or financial say have a big sticking him certainly\nThey take him bragging about in during the election all the money that he has been getting from the Saudis and they play it on the tape now he gets up and he lives again and he says I don't have any relationship with any physical relationship with them at all\nThen why do we not have sanctions\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot

then they show pictures of them with their friends so it's really something\nSo through all kinds of how it follows is one of them is the Washington Post has this blog in which they have contributors
