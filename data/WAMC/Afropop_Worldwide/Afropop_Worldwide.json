when I first sat down with them I asked John and banning what it meant to them to follow the heart well\nIt goes way back for me because my mother used to use that expression you know and you know we were raised in the sixties and my parents were pretty they were pretty liberal and they they always sort of had that ethic of you should do what you love\nI always had this conflict all through my formative years of I Love the writing and I love music and I really said both of them were things that you had to dedicate yourself to entirely so so it's like which one do I love more and I never really was able to make that\nDecision so I Do both but it is exactly what it sounds like you do what polls you you don't think about\nYou know the practical or or economic implications to an extent you do but in the beginning I I was I was driven by just going to places I wanted to go pursuing this things I wanted to playing the music I wanted to play writing\nThings in some of them a lot of them didn't work but\nI I still basically operate on that\nParents with very similar philosophy there was all about don't force your kids to do what you want them to do because no wind up resenting you and allow them\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog hardest dot com and no joke ... dog harness that did to make it easier for both dogs and their humid no need to pull no need to tell

swimming and binds insulin litter on the hiking in the big national\nParks out west that was my passion and he checking here there and everywhere but really it was music that kind of pulled it altogether for me is I'm I'm not a musician but I studied music and I kind of\nI was aware of like some big aesthetic principles that guided\nJob in these Indian African music and so on so I started doing a radio which has a passion for me and up in Alaska\nWhere I worked as a commercial fisherman and a cold storage worker and then and travel I Love to travel that was a big passion them and I think I tell all insurance who come here\nWhatever you do take time off from school and go traveling you know ... live in Morocco you know spend time in an Egyptian monastery whatever you know like you know become a an assistant to a\nGame where in Tanzania and you know that this stuff you really learn from [noise]\nSo is there anyone who inspired you and you're a kid who you looked up to\nI Would start with my mother she inspired me a lot artistically well first of all she played guitar and singing songs\nAnd when she was in college you know in the\nThirties or forties she traveled through Mexico collecting folk song and she always had this idea of found music and that that that was actually what started me playing guitar and she also made mobile she was a visual artist and\nJust her dedication to creativity would just put the whole idea of being an artist and in my mind very clearly\nThere were many another one I Would point to would be a particular teacher that I had in high school whose name was Gilbert Burnett and he'd been in the ... which was the precursor of the CIA he taught anthropology and biology and he was just very studious very demanding\nTeacher but he was so incredibly open minded and there were so many ideas\nThat I was introduced to as a high school student that really stuck with me ever since just ideas on that culture and how culture makes people who they are still was the first person who really really talked about culture [noise]\nAnd a bit of a control freak too and it was a so so that the kind of a kind of seminal moment for me was\nThere I and I listen to this little dive bar in Kinshasa\nAnd this guy turns to me as a high God it's Franco he's wearing a ... and Frank was big guy like three hundred pounds and a deep voice I'd interviewed him so he knew who I was I was an American journalist or something and he turned to me and said we use that as\nWe know at least the Franklin James Brown Otis dean but you know Americans you know one of our music\nAnd it was this like cry from the heart that just like pure my\nBecause he was right of course all this phenomenal this is the best in Africa and why was it so little known in the world\nAnd not more than ten years after the rumble in general when that was all supposed to be thrown open by that big festival they didn't happen so he was ...\nHe was very frustrated and he and he wasn't speaking about me not knowing 'cause obviously I was there and I was learning he was talking about me representing American citizens like\nOh you're right you're right it was really bad situation I'll I'll Try to do something about it or something like that and that came through but\nAnyway um and then the next time I went to Africa invited to banning to come with me as a co producer and we also went to ... you can just named the names of the stars at that moment we're there ... or\nA four year old ... D a taboo early I mean just so many other artists\nAnd unfortunately you know because we have recordings you can actually listen to the hardest on this one a lot of them are dead but um [noise] uh anyways uh there's always new artist kind got so so we really were on a roll at that point actually we're ... we we had gotten funding from\nThe corporation for public broadcasting so I came back from this reputation said oh I could put together a little Thirteen part series and the big dog at CPB that and the radio program recommend\nRest in peace he said to me well on the list\nDreaming support

this is in the wake of Graceland you know God Bless Paul Simon and we're kind of the right place at the right time to [noise]\nWe had the right concept you know and and and of course mostly the music are so powerful a and unknown and that's the point of public broadcasting isn't it to introduce people to learn new things for their aesthetic enjoyment and for their spiritual consideration of\nThem are not might\nNew thing is that you can join and you're very welcome situation like that and that's what we're doing here from up worldwide\nAnd listening back to excerpts from the ... a show of heart from an episode in which post Rosemary Pritzker book with Shawn Otto\nBanning Eyre that to me George hey how are you I'm good I'm good at George I'm breaking for apparent leaping out of the podcast dimension because I think\nListeners want to hear from you too about the birth of afro pop we've dug into your back story and other programs I Know but today we'd really like to hear your version of how you came to host this program\nHow does that happen while dining Nineteen eighty eight I had already been broadcasting for three years I had several radio shows on the voice of America daily French breakfast show Maxine whom the English evening program\nTone deaf sold et cetera et cetera well they weren't all I must say quite successful with audience is\nCounting millions I was presenting American music to Africa and the world in general\nI played a lot of what the called race music James Brown within the get Jimmy Smith and all these amazing people who are unknown on international airwaves but I\nGoing to press my African released and it was my listeners made up of villagers winners high officials and presidents and even people in the United states we're on track to use music and also by the high power DJ styles that I had\nThe only difference with the U.S radio drunks was my banter presenting life in America life in America what do you mean by that\nWhile I was presenting America to Africa but I also found that my new country the\nStates of America needed to know more\nAbout Africa land that had brought them the great African American musicians managed to conquer the artistic world with them and blues rock and roll blues and jazz but you also lived in Paris right where you worked with a lot of African\nIn them right and\nYou know in the Nineteen seventies I was living in berries where I was sleeping my radio shows on the voice of America industry doing that was set up an American embassy I don't know if the bachelor knew about it\nI was also works on various projects an African musical that went bankrupt I'd contract with several record companies for example with Warner Brothers and I would get all these record companies to contemplate\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog hardest dot com and no joke nope ... dog harness that did to make it easier for both dogs and their humid no need to pull no need to tell you what your dog with was crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nThousands of reviews at my credit dot com\nThat they would present this enormously talented oddities when I went back to America wanted Americans to know them the idea was to produce a radio program\nPresenting these beautiful African musicians to radio stations in the U.S [noise] but\nThe wherewithal and the concentration to accomplish this project I was involved in the program working with and Jews around writing songs\nAnd then one day a friend at the voice of America I told me that a radio producer was looking for somebody to present a program on African music on public radio radio what\nI was invited to go ... in the industry that is to do was in the big brick warehouse in the ... the New York avenue and\nI was really the nervous system as\nHave worked in many Jews but none like this this sound engineer open the many security rocks and introduced me to a tall lanky\nTackled and beyond the gentleman who has that a public radio demeanor as the caller said the sound engineer accent treating the French pronounced vision of George meets Sean ...\nSharma was hardly smiling side ...\nHeard a lot of good things about you as you heard I Need somebody to present this programs that I intend to produce for NPR recorded in ...\nOh [laughter] so how did that go\nDown the recording is showing at the region except for the estimate is that usually forget to pronounce juicy would you not pronouns says in France all went mostly\nTo Sean professionalism and rubber amen to sound engineer move engineering I must say that the sound of that Sergio was white amazing [noise]\nSo that's how long relationship started and liking own relationship everyone brings his gift to make it work Sean is fast manager and an excellent radio writer\nAnd me while I bring my knowledge of Africa and my and food for presenting my continent to the world and maybe also for something to do is eat the banning\nBack to my story yeah and your voice has a lot to do with it but thank you that's a really wonderful to hear your story [noise]\nI mean out tomorrow in Charlotte and banning from the ... to

City this is part of his could die tour so it was a deeply moving enjoy it but emotional experience\nWell the thing is that John Johnny Was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer\nCouple of years ago and he's now been through chemotherapy twice and basically is prospects are good but he was in remission and so he decided to do a world tourists farewell tour in kind of make the show the kind of summed up his life\nAnd you know I mean you've met so many artist so for years and sometimes they kind of remember you and they're friendly sometimes they don't remember you at all\nBut Johnny has always been really president you know he remembers right back to that first time we man and he's given us some just really spectacular very deep interviews over the years so in this case he was singing one of the songs that he often ends to show with\nDaylight which is really a beautiful song it's kind of a song about longing and it has this great line that I think I Know why the doghouse afternoon yeah and then he sings just incredibly moving chorus and everyone singing along\nAnd then it has this refrain I burn for you and right when he hit it he's spotted made the audience and he pointed right at

was to do lectures and to arrange for concerts and that was an artist Louise singer who was supposed to come on the ship and perform and they showed up\nAnd it was late in those kind of becoming stressful so I went down to my laptop and opened it up to find the contact number the person that I was supposed to be talking to\nAnd there was this email from Sean saying that we just wanted to the body\nAnd it was it was it was a real I mean that was a wonderful day in the number of ways from that point on buddy but it was funny because the the director of him that there was this British woman and she had never heard of you know I didn't even really know what the body but you know I mentioned it to her she immediately got on the computer and the funny thing was that\nThe other person who got the institutional word that was David Attenborough and then he was like God to her and it was like you wanted to say that we're so it was a funny day boy that's a real high\nBoom boom boom boom
