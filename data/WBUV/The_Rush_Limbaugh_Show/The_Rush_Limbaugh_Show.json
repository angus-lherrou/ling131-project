instinct of the drive by\nMedia has\nAnd not what I say drive by media may as well be selling it saying a Democrat part of the first instinct they have is to try to find a way\nTo link who ever committed the bad deed to the Republican Party or\nThe so called conservative movement\nAnd of course now it's blamed Trump everything everything at all what ever it is blame Donald Trump\nBlame me blame you blame anybody that supported Donald Trump\nAnd frankly I Walk out with this reaction I have had it I Am fed up with it's been this way for years\nOr showed up during the Obama administration there were mass murders and at no time did the drive by media ever try to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten wasn't inflammatory\nJust say that Republicans were going to be responsible for millions of deaths if Obamacare was not passing it along with anybody remember that because I sure as hell do because I was set up when it then\nWe're trying to oppose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world are trying to take them to prevent a bunch of incompetence a bunch of government bureaucrats in the left wing politicians from taking over the American health care system\nMeanwhile Obama is lying to everybody about it claiming that they like their doctor keep their plan they didn't get get get to and that their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie\nAfter lie after lie not called out not reported\nAnd then the Republicans come along and try to impose it on substantive grounds and the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not\nHow many years have average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens that Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets fixed\nIt's why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stops in other words you have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years [laughter] excuse me\nThen decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the falls into political party or it's the fault of a president's and and so predictable because they hate the president will do and then they\nCan to get rid of him they spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him they're fit to be tied over their failure they're ratcheting up this this anger and\nIf it were getting so far away from the notion that whoever did it is the person it did it we're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do whatever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative movement\nAs far as the drive by meeting is concerned it's not because somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives the media doesn't care about that except to the extent they can link the Trump\nWell I've I for one am am fed up with it I Am sick of this reaction to every freaking event\nEven though whether we can even get away from it from a weather extreme weather happens it's our fault it's the problem of the Republicans or Trump because we don't sign on to this asinine manmade global warming theory so we ended up being responsible for deaths in print Domenico\n\nAnd then when we stand up and defend ourselves against then all of a sudden we're attacked and we're assaulted for being anti war many anti anti black anti minority what have you\nBecause they politicized literally everything [noise] and you know what if I have gotten to the point I Can't tune it out in his mind your men to pay attention to it it is my\nMan to come here and pay attention to it tells you what I think

the midterms are going to pretend the rats at least two things\nUp to try to get people to somehow vote against Donald Trump may you must not believe like Nate Silver says eighty five percent chance that you're going to take the house\nNo you have to take these too sad unfortunate events in and build them up and just somehow they are Donald Trump's fault and this is why you should vote against Republicans in the midterms\nI can tell you right now but that doesn't ... do not know it from a exact hands on knowledge I'm just telling my gut is that there are millions of Americans wants this stuff starts they tune it out they're fed up with being blamed\nThey're fed up with the people they love and support being blamed\nThey're fed up with their country being blamed\nAnd so they just they just tune it out\nThey think about all of the mass shootings have cops\nBack during the Obama those and those were supported\nYou had the support those you have the support black lives matter and they weren't condemned there weren't any consequences for the protesters could roll into Ferguson, Missouri\nAnd and literally tear up a town on why they create a lie about the shooter in that in that in ... the Mike Brown good what is the first name was\nWho was held up a convenience store and so whatever they just totally making up turn it inside out\nAll for the express purpose of blaming Donald

year old allegation can be made for which there is no evidence for which for supposedly witnesses candy been placed themselves at the place because the victim doesn't aware it happened doesn't know when it happened but it becomes real and we've got to destroy somebody's life we have to destroy somebody's career we've got and Kavanaugh is supposed\nTo sit back and just take it he's just see those are the old rules in Washington people under assault take it\nThe best way to deal with it they are advised to non make waves sit there and take it and that's how\nResponsible reasonable Republicans always acted well that's not a Donald Trump is it wasn't elected to act that way\nYou ask me the wrong people being told tone it down\nThe left needs to tone down it's organized violence the left needs to tone down all of these political stunts that are in many ways designed to provoke a reaction from people\nBecause they\nUtilize abuses of power and character assassination\nAnd the the character being assassinated just supposed to sit there just supposed to take it\nThat's how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take it you just sit there and you take it\nAnd you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh don't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we can't let you on the Supreme Court and you're gonna have to sit there and that's the price you're gonna have to pay for this guy be it'll like that and he's supposed to sit there and take\nHe wasn't supposed to be angry\nWhile he was mayor and while his family was threatened in his life and future we're in the process of being destroyed he wasn't supposed to say anything\n\nJust to sit there and take it that's the rules that's the way it works in Washington\nNot personal just business just politics and then a couple of years afterwards everybody forgets it and everybody likes Kevin except Kevin O's life was ruined and he's never supposed to want to get even he's never supposed to fight for him\nSo Trump ditto not supposed to stand up to this not but that's who Trump is they're not used to it they thought they would have sent Trump packing a year and a half ago they thought they'd be rid of Donald Trump\n\nAnd they still aren't let's go to the phones we have Steve in Pittsburgh with us You're up for us today Steve thank you for calling hello\nHey rushed pleasure to speak with you thank you sir\nAre probably the last week in front of the Pittsburgh School board they had a proposal to arming the school police and it was voted down to one\nThing that happened at a school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented and then you have a Mayor Bill Clinton was very very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop that's what we need is more gun control\nI mean how many more things that happen before they realized it more gun control markets are not putting someone with a gun the can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the one tells you but uh there's no amount of ...\nOh there's no amount of shooting whatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes because you say it's really not about guns he thinks it is in his supporter but it's not really about guns it's about something much larger than\nThat it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that can't but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us left us [noise] uh yeah and you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except in east or because of it but but but we're all for freedom as we define that he mentioned this let's\nGo to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with a [noise] Trump himself that says this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked\nA on Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews\nIt used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint based business well it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by the unified I'm only a cotton joint base where multiple services are on the same place\nAnd so that's that's where air force one is parked for Trump takes the helicopter to get on board air force one way is going to travel a reporter said\nMr President do you think you need to revisit see sowing guy goes nuts in a synagogue and spoil hill\nAnd the first question a drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit gun laws\n[noise] by the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns this guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is\nTrump being responsible for this and that in all the other things\nAnd anti Semitism they think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focused on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise\nAnd that tells you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by not really focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground here and that would be Trump is an anti Semite or a big it or as a racist anyway\nSilent crime it's why people have life like half life luck to protect them from every kind of

[laughter]\nWell there was one of the reason I ask you about specific question was because many people do not understand how a liberal Jew is like the New York times ownership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is\nThis it it it it it's it's the Jewish state and yet there is there's so much anti Israeli sentiment among Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal that people scratch their heads and do quite understand it\n'cause it's a lot because it's anti that religion is not anti the race they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's if the religion air time the religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from religion I don't think you can and it you know any any time you're Jewish and you're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation\nWith liberal Israel comes that no way that I did this flame or I'm Jewish but I totally disagree with everything Israel feeling that it yeah that comes up and that it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics is associated with with Israel as a poke 'cause if their entire religion\nThat's big I mean the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform an orthodox and and the other branches how many\nDifferent flavors [laughter] um yeah but\nI I don't I used I used to feel that way I feel like it but yeah with a push toward Indians that many theaters they're anti Christian Tito um I don't\nSee them as necessarily being seeing Islam but I you know but I Do the right guy\nThat's exactly right I says where Mrs all headed this is all headed towards atheism anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are\nThe trend is towards atheism and no God or at least agnostic ... because that removes any judgmental ism right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else if there is no ultimate power that can meet out\nApprove or disapprove hurtful ones X. men one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I I just I'm so\nHow this of this event in Pittsburgh given everything else that you say that you are\nThe all the liberalism creep into Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about it is rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so\nThis event in Pittsburgh did it did it adds to any of the uh discomfort or on is you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah I I I don't I don't feel like that there's a million people out there are targeting\nA Jews in a way that they would want to go she got the thing is I think that that these are isolated is an incident in this country that causes the country it's so good that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he went he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nAnd I I mean I don't I don't feel unsafe\nAs a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish I and I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the mid term or anything like that I Am\nGlad used because I'll tell you there's a lot of people that think and they're predominant ... thank you thank you so much Rachel I precepts racial from thousand\nOaks California [noise] um [noise] I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with the midterms [noise] a lot of people do\nA lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what do you think I'm wrong or you\nKnow I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like ... now after Caesar say a dare I say this year I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\nCaesar sidewalk and his pipe bombs none of which exploded what do you think\nThe odds are that the drive by the Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember and even Trump alluded to the fact\nThat that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that\nOK well there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat [noise] and then the second event happens\nOn Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people to politicize everything\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American laughter people look politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in in the fringes everywhere who [noise] irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political mountains [noise]\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this is going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump\nI have I have an\nEntirely different fits why I did the show open today but I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people in fact\nI think the media in their natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since the Sunday talk shows yesterday with this\nThe attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThey can't help themselves they have spent the past two and a half years trying to get rid of Donald Trump they have thrown everything they know\nInto the public domain hoping to influence people to abandon Trump and it hasn't happened to these two events come along and they but ah this is that this has to be what it is their thinking and they just can't help themselves they start blaming Trump for the synagogue shooting started\nThe president what he's going to do about guns as you have a different view on it as though he somehow responsible and what it does it portrays it gives away the fact that as far as the American the left is concerned everything centers around Washington\nThat Washington is the solution for everything and how it's Washington the solution Washington is the solution because Washington is where\nThe enemies of the laughter going to be punished is where the enemies of the left are going to be dealt with that's the role of government as far as the left is concerned\nGovernment as an agent of power to enforce punitive punishing policies on the enemies of the American left that's its purpose so shooting anywhere it takes ... says\nWhat's the president's going to do it by the president nothing to do with it in the first place\nThe president has nothing to do with gun control laws except as a supporter or opponent Congress writes the laws but the idea that Washington should be able to command anything at any time is what the left wants\nThis isn't an

I called my final summation that happened on friday about why we're suspicious\nOf the drive by media and the left in general\nThey have made me suspicious and all of you that attempt this ongoing attempt to destroy Donald Trump to overturn the election results two thousand sixteen and it was codified epitomize if you will in what they tried to Brett Kavanaugh it's no different\nAnd they aren't going to stop I don't need to be told reminded how fit to be tied enraged they are over their failure to get rid of the ...\nI Know they're psychology I Know these people in the media and I know that these Democrats they are just ...\nBeside themselves that every thing's they've got in their arsenal of weapons hasn't worked\nSo given that this is the sum total of\nIntelligence guided by experience I don't believe I'm not going to believe just because I'm told that something happened the way it did\nAnd that's a shame it's a shame that the highest levels of our government have gotten to the point where this trusting them is a common sense ethical thing to do but they've brought this on\nAll of these nameless faceless anonymous sources with all of this order be asked\nEvery day for two years New York times CNN intelligence community resources and former American intelligence officials tell the New York times ... blah blah blah blah blah blah every day sometimes many times a day for a year\nTwo years stuff's made up out of whole cloth news stories literally made up\nAll to advance advance the agenda of essentially canceling the election results from two thousand sixteen and finding a way to get Donald Trump out of office and it was to people\nDemocrats Republicans moderates independents never Trump voters on the conservative side the whole of the Washington establishment so\nHere we are two weeks before the midterm elections the Democrats [noise]\nWe have to weigh in it\nAnd told everybody that the American people are tired at Trump and they want to get rid of it and they realize their mistakes even telling everybody there's gonna be a blue wave it's fate accompli Nate Silver eighty five\nPercent chance two weeks out a bunch of bombs started showing up in places

I don't even like you're looking at the straight number but we're going to plug those numbers and if there's another pension when does it turn out so that gives us some basis of numbers and if we're short\nFrom those income that are coming in then we're going to plug in water we taking from the assets what do I mean assets you know the savings you have the non qualified\nMoney you've put away for retirement that are raised the four one K. ...\nThose tools that you have do you have any other income sources we haven't\nTalked about so wherever we're short ... we're going to look at polling income or distributions from those assets and we might look at are we starting with our race or are we blending it do you have a good mixture of pre tax money\nTax free money an expert tax money will look at how to blend that or if you're really loaded up with\nAll pre tax money means everything to tax as ordinary income so that gives us a different tax look as well then what about required minimum distributions you know I'm looking at one here where the individuals are uh early sixties so it means and\nLooking Fifteen Years out of Fred here he said sixty two which means in your Fifteen he's going to be Seventy six so we're having the fact okay what are the required mental distributions watch that\nWell that's a number when you turn suddenly and a half there is a minimum a male the\nGovernment are ras treasury are expecting you to take out of that account which means that's a taxable\nEvent that could also ... ... even when you're not meeting it so we have cases where that helps that people's needing it sometimes it gets too big so we go to like water ... what can we do to reduce that back in maybe take more on the front of you\nOr I really don't need it but you've got to take it what and yet bounces your tax bracket up that's why you see\nAll these things we need to talk about\nThis it and come in shove the statement across a desk what can you do for me well we're gonna do mathematical planning we're going to talk about all these\nThings are going to talk about reasonable expectation of return we're going to look at all the income sources and see how that is affecting the assets sometimes conversation leads to as you don't have enough assets to retire in January and generate that income without spend now\nIf you're going to spend out are you still going to have money at age a hundred and ten that's what we would hope for some cases gosh I'm going to have more on a three percent return at a hundred and ten so we could really conserve a number\nAnd assets can take off what I've got lots of questions and you don't even probably know all the questions asked I'm going to help you with that so you can look at all these different things and have truly an understanding of where you're going to be then we'd get in to what your risks number\nHow do we love awhile volatility these are all things that you need to know from an income planning standpoint and our three I'm going to touch on how we pulled this together in a particular case for Fred\nAnd talked about that 'cause we're that spreadsheet print out what do you call it what's that system called the guided planning cyst hadn't said that all segment just want to get out at it but yeah okay yeah the guided planning system I love doing that stuff income planning\nAnd just putting everything together and that's not a software package that Gregory went and bought a best buy is a proprietary system that you develop we've developed over the past dozen years program a spreadsheet pretty good huh All right I I had help quite a bit of help\nI so doing science our guest coming up in the next hour\nHost of mortgage gumbo which comes on after the show on this station he's the mortgage guy for the total over forty\nAnd we've got a lot to talk to this guy\nWill the fed slow down their rates raising in this new volatility area\nEvery finances stop with the rates going up\nAnd he's going to cover some miss a reverse mortgage despite all four to six zero zero nine Ninety five I'm James Parker we are winning it life with ...

I see that in any form or fashion were at three percent tenure treasuries now ... what is your thirty year fixed for ... for point nine five\nAnd you're jumbos jumbos at four point three eight\nAnd yeah it's going to go up so that should be making preparations not necessarily I I'm I'm gonna wait to see if the textile I Do not see that coming maybe they increases might slow a bet on next year and maybe not\nYeah you could say that you we could see it ... the two year treasury could easily be a one percent higher by the end of next year or so then ... where you're at your approach you're five and a half the six mortgages well listen we're\nLocking were locking people win at five point seven five and six percent when I'm telling you full point not for that's not Joe blow that walks off the street that's had a couple of skin nice\nYou know what I'm saying those those are at a guy's whoa that's perfect that's twenty percent they fought they've fitness small little box so you know that that's not a majority of folks are getting ... to ... the Fifteen right now is that four and a half percent that\nMeans we're talking about over six Oh absolutely average\nChild by average no doubt no doubt did I get into a three point eight seven five mortgage she stole money we were taught number what we were describing just a short time ago but I've got four percent on a jumbo us\nWe'll look a little bit further down road which we stole a ... percent on a jumbo yeah flak oh wow and when we were talking\nAbout looking five ten years these are going to be amazing rates well we're not even five years out I guess I'm five years from my house purchase but these are already amazing grace and\nWell but I understand is to the arm the five one on right because you know and I know I get calls all the time well should should I or look at an interest only or should I look at an adjustable rate mortgage no because the five one five year on right now is that full point four or five\nSo why in the world for less than a half a point would you put something where we all who knows where we're going to be in five years\nYou know so why in the world would you even think about doing something like that\nYeah I Wonder if that arms is going to go up\nWell it it every week it's going up which is odd because it ... the ... over history when I used to ... you know always keep an eye on his\nAss fixed rate went up you could always expect to arm in debt debt debt to kind of go down right it it just kind of worked off of each other but now everything's going up to your ten year treasuries now

B. U. V. [noise]\nThis is the weekly route host Gregory wreck [noise]\nThe talk radio we have Weinstein hosts the mortgage gumbo was the remainder of this hour James Parker\nIs here in Studio as well I'm your host Gregory Rick's call us bubble four to six zero zero\nNine nine to five you know we've been talking about interest rates so I'll throw at a thought here here's one of the\nBiggest problems we're facing out there and it's the student loan debt crisis so we're talking about interest rates going up it's the a consumer\nLoan area\nYou know household loans that's the continuous largest growing segment of that since the great recession their student loans are the fastest growing segment of household that seeing a hundred and\nFifty percent increase since the great recession and now they're facing let's see what is the U.S\n[noise] you know we've got ... you know student loans currently faced highest Ninety plus delinquency rate of all households that\nAnd I think the real ... straight movement there that\nYou know they're seeing interest rates go up on subsidized loans jumped to five percent this year the highest rate since two thousand and nine and professional degrees now face six point six percent interest rate according to the U.S department of education\nThat mobiles going to pop oh it\nThere's no ... yeah I even got into the private for profit colleges and those that\nAre going to get a degree and don't complete that process that's where the highest of faults are\nAs well but just a matter of interest rates moving up and we've seen how that compounds and they're getting behind the curve they're getting disillusioned and there's no escape patch\nYeah and I know and we've talked about it with with the wind and joins talked about mortgage gumbo is this is affecting the overall\nEconomy well\nAnd that ... that's one of the things we hear Dwayne telling the stories of people who are refinancing their house getting some cash out to help the kids with college or to pay off their own\nDebts and so coming back to ... you were explaining 'cause I'm a cursory look with the rates going up you would think refinances that business would slow down or they're you know there's at least an incentive to not keep it up but you're saying people are still doing ... left and right and you were starting to explain it but we got in a commercial but how does that work\nWell it here here's why okay a couple of years ago when rates were at all time low see is what you had okay\nYou had anybody that could fall Camaro end alone business okay and you had people that are out there who said yeah let me do a a a rape term refinance which basically means James calls me and says hey I'm sitting at four and a half percent\nBut I Want it to a Fifteen year note at two point eight seven five what with the order takers did was they just lowered their no they didn't maybe look at their entire picture and said Well James has got forty thousand dollars in credit card debt\nMaybe we can take care of some of that so what's happened is you've had all these folks all this time that's had rape term they got these re term revised so that number on a piece of paper James like yourself at that three and a half percent or whatever you got on your mortgage right\nIt looks amazing you feel good right when you're talking about it on winning it life you're like yeah take that showed you but you know what that number doesn't do that number doesn't help you buy bread milk\nBut for the for the kids and for the family\nAnd what people are what people are understanding as these freight start to go up\nWhen I hear so many of these stories of folks now Gregory you just see looted wanted a top things people call me on is they took out a ... put the kids through college okay or the kids have student loans and the parents are coming and going I Want to be able to help because\nThose student loans when they ... into ... or they were sitting at zero percent\nOr not moving up did not matter now these folks\nOkay they were to go to school come out you get your degree you're gonna make five hundred thousand bucks okay and you know what that's what we'll waive all your student loan sounded great right that was that was the last thing that they're able to come to school will wave all your student loans okay which is\nBaloney never going to happen but so especially in at the federal government owns it why would they give that away\nSo what's happening with the student loans now is we're starting to see a lot more delinquency but the reason to re Pfizer up is because of the delinquency you got student loans that are up you've got credit card debt that is just going through the roof right now going through the roof because that\nFour thousand dollar credit card bill that was eighty two dollars now just because of the federal funds rate increase is now a hundred and twenty something bucks so now all of a sudden you've got people who\nAre in my all of a sudden get a live on a budget\nAm I going to you know not going to go to sonic than I Am I going to go to the grocery and start cooking see it takes time and that's why we're seeing is delinquency it takes time for people to see to force through the trees so\nWhat people are finally being able to take advantage of is while they still do have equity keep in mind before the break one of the things I mentioned appreciation is slowing down and we've been warning people about this all year\nWe've been warning people your house it just can't continue to go up\nPart of your disclosure says you sign a service agreement okay and most of it will say it'll have percentages on their ... percent uh like for instance a cross country the farm I I I represent\nNow we we close the loans in our names the reason why we're able to do that is we're able to negotiate better deals with\nUh your ... your case your other banks out there your bank of America's however what'll happen is sometimes on a secondary market there's what's called servicing companies and the reason why we're able to give the clients a better rate than if they go to the brick and mortar is\nThat servicing company looks at and goes hey this is a quality person we want this person\nIt's it from an affordability standpoint for a company or to be able to have a servicing department do the lending do all that that would all have to trickle back to the client and we don't want to do that in all cases sometimes um they do hold loans but for the most part\nThose loans are so now with that being said and here's what I like for folks to understand when they do business with me\nI all the time somebody will call me and say I have a question about this and you know what they call me we get in touch with the lender or the service sir and we help them through that it's not like when you close alone hey we abandon them and I'll see you later that's it you know because the bottom line is we still services but do we\nDo we put that piece of paper in a file cabinet and go All right hey all that uh all the loans are right here no but we're still here to help them with the servicing of the loan so that's a good point in in a lot of people have to understand the day and age of going down to corner\nA to the to the the the savings and loans place\nA lot of that does not happen where those things stay local and one hundred percent of the time when I asked somebody um hey what's what's the most important thing to you\nWhile rate is always up there or you know and saving money\nIf I go to them go hey I could put you with this company at five percent but I can put you with this other company at three and a half percent\nThey always choose three and a half percent I've yet to have somebody go you know what no I like five percent and what you pay more to keep it alone right well listen ... Wells Fargo right they're all over the news\nFor for goofy things their execs did however they're servicing departments pretty good and and that's a company that we do loan so if somebody goes well I don't know if I Want to be ... and I go well wells is a quarter point cheaper you know what All right ...\nYeah yeah so what is wrong with that you know there what bad can happen to you if somebody has your loan ... that's the loans to contract cry cyclone satirist Joe this and get paid\nAnd I think people get a little bit concerned and and rightfully so and I understand they they ate will something changed no your contract is your contract your loan is you're alone when that service or take that on there taking on that loan as is\nAs is correct okay like back in the day they used to take on the low ... some services maybe didn't allow a bi weekly payments or different things like that now everybody's all in the same boat everybody's offering the same stuff right so in reality when you get something from a company saying hey your loans now with me\nLook at it as a positive because somebody chose you somebody said we want that well because they have an option and so when you get that letter in the mail set of looking at a bad go hey All right Joe blow wants to be a way that stamp doesn't really matter if you got the best deal\nBut I I totally agree with that is there any loans that are done that are guaranteed not to be settled or all of them have the disclosure on\nYeah now nowadays pretty much all all all of them are there's a couple of grant programs uh that that we do that if they go through a grant they stay with them a because you know the lenders are like hey that's a specific program to the grant or the bond money I'm so they'll stay with that particular lender\nAnd ... banks have to shift that stuff and we go back to first NBC which was an ugly deal here and causes the government a billion dollars when the bank went under but some of that trying to shore up they sold off loans to make money there as well and of course when they were taken over\nBy the feds guess walk all loans moved to somebody else in that case and just putting that out you know\nThat guy to try that guys don't have FDIC and that that that's ugly I mean we've done\nWith some of those but it's ... it's also to Gregory it's it's almost like hey listen you know do you want the insurance company a handling your mortgage no let them stick to what they do so to servicing company just set up to handle your loan on the back yeah yeah\nAll right we've got a few minutes here it was and we still have to talk about reverse mortgages now let me share it with your Dwayne a little update in the scenario that I've\nNoticed in that these these commercials the longer versions of some of them are like two minutes long like the Tom Selleck won and they've started adding more features and I think I saw a commercial where they mentioned\nThat you can activate a reverse\nMortgage and the unused portion of your line of credit can still\nGame now I he managed to make of that into\nA distinct one sentence and it was really vague but I knew what he was talking about so we're seeing the evolution happening and not just the reverse mortgage market but the way they're advertised what people know about them but they're still a lot of missed out there what what still hit you in the head when people come in with a reverse mortgage questions\nNumber one is always you know I I I Want to own my own home and that is always number one is I don't want the bank to take my home and I think it's important that I explained to every body it is a non\nRecourse loan and you go are cool non recourse great well what does that mean\nWhat a non recourse loan means listeners is ultimately\nYou're giving your property as collateral and that's your pay back for the loan that does not mean that you can't sell the property it basically means that you've said hey if if everything goes to hack and we're on a plane and something happens and and there's no airs or there's no equity laugh\nA non recourse loans being the banks not going to come back and get your home they accepted and agreed that your ... your property is the ultimate collateral for that long so I think people need to understand what that means by non recourse and it means that they're just not going to come knock on your door for that so\nUh does does do I own my own home or I don't want to pay you hold the title\nI explain that to several verse ... this week you hold the title you will sign multiple documents that will say if you need to pay the place if you want to update the place there's a whole section on it that you will sign that says hey you're responsible you don't need anybody's permission for it\nSo that it that is one the other thing is do I have to pay taxes on any of the proceeds I get absolutely not now here's my ... find proceeds so so any cash that you get it's not considered income\nAny phones that you get from a reverse mortgage off your Social Security and you go get forty thousand dollars well if you went got to forty dollars an hour job that would probably affect your Social Security right but it does it with a reverse mortgage\nOkay now I Would advise you again hey if you're working with Gregory get what's your financial advisor find out hey how's it going to work how can we take advantage of this winter out benefits but you're proceeds the money that you get from a reverse mortgage is not taxable\nOkay I Want to make sure that is explained\nThe other thing people axis woken I control my phone's yes it's your money if you're getting a a a if you're not getting a if you're getting at and will\nReverse mortgage which means you're going to have a line of credit you can do whatever you want with those funds if you're getting a fixed reverse mortgage all that means is you could do whatever you want with those monies you're just going to get one lump sum\nSo James to allude to what I call a magnum PI when I meet with people because it's fun or has all the young folks magnum PI enough on dry you see Henry Winkler on there so so what people would I Want folks to understand is\nPeople are starting to talk about we've been talking about it for years on here right is how much money they make on these lines of credit this week at a client signed\nFive point nine seven is their return on their money the first year\nFive point nine seven is going to be their return on their money dispersed year that you go that's pretty good and and now they're even starting to get a little bit more aggressive with a jumbo reverses and stuff like that so uh where they're going to start instead of being a lump sum they are going to revolve that allow them to get a lot of credit is\nWilling to give me twenty seconds on what's coming up on mortgage gumbo and an hour\nYup listen we're going to talk about credit and we're going to talk about debt settlement companies versus credit repair so much people\nDon't know about it so we're going to cover that our areas to great lengths die and he's the mortgage guy the total wealth authority of Gregory ... associates and the host the mortgage gumbo coming on the station at one o'clock\nIf you want to find a mortgage gumbo dot com ... ... the financial ... a question not quite sure what to do Gregory is available for another hour five oh four to six zero zero nine Ninety five um James\n[noise] GMC studios [noise] this is talk going on for now I don't even [laughter] point and I urge radio station\n[noise] this is a ...\nPennsylvania governor Tom Wolfe now with the scene of a deadly mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh calling it an absolute tragedy Pittsburgh Police spokesman Chris ...\nAnd and we've got father expansion that we're talking about but that gives us a lot larger easier reach as the destination\nFrom well and there's another office opening on\nWe call it the north shore here in the New Orleans area and I don't know what they would call it up missing from Hattiesburg did they all have a name for the north shore of what we call the north shore down here now now\nWould ... we're talking about Mandeville Covington three children that I Would say would be\nA ... you go to Hammond dental ... even puts us closer to Baton Rouge age as well when you talked about guff port Biloxi that gives us reach eastward to\nBill Bill Florida Panhandle ... and ... and I didn't mention the reach of the show was a we're probably beyond ... rude to the west and we're in taxes because at the Dallas show that was picked up recently\nAnd then when we're going east were hurt as far as the panhandle of Florida I Know the offshore rigs hear us so they'll tell him where all those folks work but we get calls from listeners and this is the air feed so the air feed reaches up in the Tennessee as well in Alabama\n... Louisiana so from the air feet wide a list or ... I I I don't even I did at one time have a handle on on the millions but that puts us probably reached to anywhere from five to ten million listeners that any\n... as far as the population in areas where we have live show now in the stream it's an\nMilwaukee so we do get calls from all over the country as well in regard to that but that's also cause of why we've done some expanding\nOkay so I think a good way to describe this or the officers on the north shore for us is on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain it's across the lake from New Orleans\nWhat that means if you're on the ice fifty five court or going anywhere up ... home all the way to Jackson that's Ruy heck all the way up to a Memphis if you are coming to New Orleans you know how long that drive is shaping our off of that and that's how long it's going to take you to get to the north shore office is going to be opening soon\nSo we're we're we're we're working our way up there and if that's not close enough for him\nMaybe we'll have to get a little closer but people have been just asking for for years\nAnd we're finally making the step in pretty exciting\nBut when you you kind of think of reasonable distance ... say on our like from from the Gulf port ... that gives easy reach up to had a spark\nAnd above their uh out to Bill Bill a Picayune will calm and such and the other direction and the north shore shrinks for a lot of folks as well\nSo it can be kinda cool to go back into your home town you know you had to leave to build an empire but now you get to go back to your old haunts there's some ... aspect of that yeah it really does now what's your actual home town we say has Berg but you're from a small town outside of has Berg give it give us some love what is it\nUh well it would be ... county uh the oak grove area of growth high school is where I went to high school so it's just right outside of ...\nWhat was your mascot the warriors nice in generic I like that All right\nDid you have a financial situation not quite sure what to do call Gregory you know he grew up in the winter grove in high school but since then he's becoming\nHe's become a hall of fame financial advisor and that's one of the things he loves doing is taking all this knowledge that he's crammed into your head\nAnd we filled calls and people try and get some help where they think that there's no help available and I'll be darned if they don't find it on the show so five oh four to six zero zero nine nine five if you want to call in\nAnd ask you a question of Gregory five oh four to six zero zero nine Ninety five we also have the winning it live\nAt so if you download that\nYou don't have to remember phone calls and phone numbers anymore you just hit the on the front screen there's a call button on the front screen there's also a button if you want a text if you have to step away from the radio and you want to keep listening on your phone there is a button right there for listening and if you want to watch and see how incredibly handsome we aren't there is an option for you to watch the video feed of the show on\nThe front of the ap as well or you go to Facebook Live repair scopes up to you but\nUh the phone is still the most common and I see the calls lining up five oh four to six zero zero nine Ninety five we're gonna talk about some income planning next how you make multiple streams of income 'cause that's what really makes retirement worked and Greg who's gonna address that next\nI'm James Parker we are winning it lives with Gregory ...

Want to talk about so he comes in\nBut he sets up pretty neat to me as he said I just want to start off this meeting by thinking you okay\nWhat did I Do\nHe said I was listening to your show and Utah or having a discussion about\nThat and he said\nYou changed my life and I will tell me a little bit of what was going on he said\nWell over a hundred thousand in credit card debt wow biggest above or heard about\nAnd I had shared about strategies about how to\nGet that to go away but what you really need is a plan and to stick to it and there's an inexpensive software that recommended that he used cold ... H works is Eli L. C. H. W O R K yes and\nI mean I've recommended that probably for more than a dozen years now when it comes up and he basically said yeah I ... and I I don't know it may cost Nineteen\nDollars back ... and then went to twenty nine might cost thirty my idol mode but when you do a lot of money whether it's ten thousand thirty or more than a hundred thousand you won't get from under it that's meant a skill compared to all those ...\nCharges coast they're expensive and you can't seem to get away from it so he said in his strategy that he went with he started paying off the\nHighest interest straight and then the money would shift to the other cards until it was gone so when you plug that in it actually gives you an end date of when\nIt will be paid off and and you could add more money to the plan but you just keeps shifting when you pay you want all that money shift to the next and he followed it and he said actually in fact he paid it off a had a schedule COSI then added money\nTo it as well because he was it became was like just like oh I've got to do so when when you you get committed to it dedicated the mindset it's it's actually an awesome thing to knock that out in the magic and the [noise] instead of the war\nAnd the pressure and and that extra bills you're paying so that was pretty cool discussion to have\nWell if it helps them any that sort of inspiring to me because what what is my New Year's resolution for twenty Eighteen pay off my credit cards and I'm not even halfway to where I wanted to be at this point has money expected expenses came up they are paid down\nThe man if hearing about this do paying off a hundred thousand dollars worth of credit cards and I can't pay down nine thousand dollars worth of credit cards\nI Need to buck up I Need I Need to get on a game a little bit if it's not going to happen this year I'm just got to try harder next year but if this guy can deal with that kind of gives me hope\nYeah and it's it's something you need to do you need to get that\nDown to where ultimately what's the best way to handle credit cards to pay them off\nAt the end of each month now you're not a guy who is use credit cards in total you actually have credit cards and use them but you have a system\nYeah I pay all the credit card each month now have I have some a little bit of revolving ... bought something for the gym at home and uh one of those trainer\nMachine cross train or what the electrical thing and they are the lip tickle your device yeah and it's a torture device Fifteen minutes of misery every morning you know that kind of thing but it was zero percent for twelve months or something like that I've said I\nCan do that at any mechanics at it that and then you just\nPlug it in an odd because of what you can do bill paying all you can just automate that and it's boom but the whole thing is I could just writer I don't know it was less than a grand I write a check at any point and pay that off but sometimes you like to have free\nFree money so that's the only case because the majority of what I Do and we do run expanses and such a personal side and the business side through that and their whatever it is is paid off each month so you also got to manage doing that\nBecause you don't want to say wow it doesn't matter all chart because I pay it off what what if you do too much\nWith\nYour goal to pay it off you you still have to manage what you're doing so that it does it keep on going and\nBecome re occurring you know we were in a\nMeeting the other day [noise]\nI'm up in Jackson, Mississippi\nAnd ... one of the

children and parents attempt to make their way to the U.S Mexico border President Trump resumed tweeting about the ... caravan asserting that criminals an unknown middle Easterners or amid the crowd for which he offered no evidence he also said Democrats are to blame for not working with his administration on immigration reform\nIn the forefront of his supporters mines so I've been studying the media to trying to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may hit ... even if it's just sixty percent of their time on ... they're not focusing on the care of him that tells me\nThat if the caravan wore a Democrat idea design too embarrassed that they would be\nCovering it and building it up\nAnd with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be it'd be mental treated abuse what a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America\nAnd that may yet happened down the road but CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show Gabe\nAnd of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now and there are higher than Obama's war\nAt this stage in the uh\nIn his mid terms with the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence that could be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election as an happened yet everybody\nWants to rely on polling data to suggest is going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand six dean of the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a\nA microcosm of what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming that on Trump maybe what they're hoping is that Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't all white ... infant didn't want it but last so he did what he could change it I\nI Do know this\nDespite everything that you think you would know but common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still there so you about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them if they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually you're not going to do with anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya\nIf Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump\nThere's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his belt voters began to\nI don't doubt is the right where they would be my totally disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get him\nIf if if if some Republicans are behind this than than it is obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking we we've got how many\nTwo thousand miles stop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day just decided to start walking to the United states to thousands of miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze all what their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because the money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so you've got seven thousand people\nWho all of a sudden it aside all of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people to sign to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom we don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it I\nMean look at random video you might you might see some people truly things I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see and are they just urinating and rivers and streams and what would the environmentalist wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the deaf occasions in the street and they got maps in San Francisco for the tourists can blame the piles of human feces\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a ...\nRemember they're vowing altogether I just hit the southern border of Mexico they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know how\nMany miles a day you can walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest for the next day\nThat people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if that makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest\n\nA hundred days for those every unreal Linda that's over three months\nAnd the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day so if they had been walking for what two and a half months have we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may become\nTen thousand [noise] and\nThen of course ah ladies and gentlemen the caravan now has been joined by a second the caravan\nThat we are just hearing about Fox News and the a P report that his second the caravan of illegal

motivation of some organizes the care of it by the way the [noise] the details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants invaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into my ego claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the day\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it rains mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and the party that believes in open borders they will never report anything\nNegative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who when their\nRight mind would want any of this illegal immigration now right mind would promote this didn't want this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world would want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for\nAmerica what ever motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what stakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals political world is so damn hard\nTo understand about this I think it's a classic illustration of how soft discovery is getting\nIn one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't\nLived long enough to know what's best for being driven stolen by a motion govern stolen by a motion\nNot any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd Kirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a mess the bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and said to the world come on in\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democrat Party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party has calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd so the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as an entitlement\nWe have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe\nAnd I haven't believe for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taken a generic polls\nFind out how you can win five hundred bucks in a drink or big Halloween photo contest and you talk to ... dot com boom [noise]\n\nI'm going to get to that CNN [noise] CNN\nPlaying an impartial ... invited me to make it look like I was trying to make the case that can show you deserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said that in fact the exact opposite so yeah\nYeah a lot of people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it or ... same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert by again bill hammer\nOutward concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned or is this ... saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but I don't know our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops to stop and invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because a positive comments out of ...\nThat normally prevents military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there's nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what went through a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border\nAnd make sure nobody forces their way into\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you know you you you know\nHe may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis isn't about what is one of seven thousand Russians were about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections what if we can make that case what do you think that people will be demanding Trump do\nStand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communist think always trying to get in\n\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family is all doing good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're a militarized is the border if they\nBomb rushed the border like that down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and do a national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or their wife passed legislation specifically saying that this mob uh seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacles that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is by the people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where he can try to deal with this on his own she leaves to put everybody else's but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in any way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a it's a dangerous

this because if they did it would\nPut the lie to the notion of the all the energy is on the Democratic side meanwhile there's not a single Democrat drawing anywhere near these kinds of\nRallies these

just watching all this go by but this guy's making\nSpectacle and I watched him talk about this on Fox today and they were talking about such A M the weight loss of loyalty and so forth\nAnd this isn't this isn't about civility this is about what I brought up three weeks ago this is not how decent people behave\nAnd I said decent people don't know how to deal with this kind of in decent seat which is what we're up against the on the Democratic side of whatever you want to call a lack of civility in decency whatever it is it is not the things you associate with winning\nIt's not the kind of behavior you associate with good times good vibes positive outlook\nThese are people in a rage and angry disappointed depressed what have you\n\nThe the contrast here is striking and that's why you do not see any news coverage of the size of let me tell you something\n\nThat's the number of people the size of crowds to get into a Donald Trump rally\nIs ten times the size of this mob that is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you've seen those pictures of the media is happy to show your those pictures\nThe media can't wait to show you this so called caravan of seven thousand people soon to be a thousand people and they claim might end up being ten thousand they'll show your pictures those people all day well here's what you need to do when you see that picture a seven\nThousand people or what is said to be seven thousand people multiply that times can that's the number of people trying to get into a Donald Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona and even more than that at a rally in Texas\n\nI Wish they'd use AT and T. stadium is Jerry Jones palace where the cowboys play put a hundred thousand people in there\n\nSo you think that Democrats can get together a mob of seven thousand people have march jumped through Mexico mad walk out who they are those people really and we're supposed to sympathize with it they don't show you\nThe thousands upon thousands standing outside the lining up twenty four hours in advance to get into a Donald Trump rally and I'm telling you that kind of thing does not happen to people losing elections were about to lose elections who are losing favor with the American people it does not happen\n\nGeorgia great to have you with us on the E R B network Hi thanks for having me on Russia appreciate you about well that's great have you here\nHe thinks the reason why I called I spend a lotta years military are retired from the gory interesting although we are very good a lot of things we're not good\nAt basically civilian type a non lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it since Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one saying throughout the years we not good at so this situation and look I'm One hundred percent for putting the military before but this one is perilous and we have to be careful\nWell when when you said the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about ... this is not a military invasion of talking about a ... a human way of uh invasion of people\nThat are largely are going to be thought of is starving thirsty poverty stricken this kind of things simply demanding\nLife well my I let it\nIn the military is not used to standing up to people like that certainly not in Flint thing and the harm on them is that what you're saying\nYeah I think the difference is you know when it comes to locality we're very good when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we're individual you're sort of very good at it but\nThat wouldn't be enough to okay what about this what about just the president's here's the U.S military standing at the border you will not\nCross okay what happens then if they do and whether or\nNot the problem that's the peril is part of the problem\nWe're about you know you and your like you you don't use bullet you use a ... one of the dummy is called I forgot the use use some kind of force but not lethal\nAnd we have a variety of different things you but you know all it takes one person going down and squeal like a pig and then it's you know we we just have to fold up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the president's would be tremendous\nBut the president's would be okay so there's ... you think the military showing up is let me just put\nWords in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong and interpreting you you think the military showing up as a lose lose proposition\nNo I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next step\nWell but you say we can't take the next step because the next step is not what they're good at they're not used to it I don't know how to do it\nNow that's the power you know I ... I think we should but we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily\nWell then what is it what's the preparation it'd be ... you'd have to be prepared to use deadly force like\nOkay well let's let's let's let me give you a scenario then okay I'm just doing this in the interest of time I'm not that may it may sound in since I don't mean that\nThey hold the line I hold the line provide a visual presents a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome do not cross there will be constant warnings but somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nThat we'd have to shoot one I'll tell you I think you'd see a lot of people fall in line it probably would Bush which or I'm Talking about members of the immigrants illegal aliens but we'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two gotta hit them with storm that caused the mob in rain storm the\nMilitary just in and and and\nIt essentially stormed the bullet storm that guns do you think they would cease and desist\nI think they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you guys have a tendency to fold up when they are met with equal strength and we just have to\nBut even if there is a casualty or to the drive by it's half of their story Trump Terry fires on harmless or an armed hopeless people\nAnd there's the peril yeah okay so the alternative is to let them in no no\nAfter ... and like I say if somebody's you know what the Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to tell you one for the team or the political legalized now let's see it's unfortunate but this is what they this was what they take it all by taking this just\nOwn okay right so the ...\nSponsors ability for what happened to them has to be on that you'd think the media is going to allow the apps that this is um I left I I look I Can't start another thought because I couldn't finish it we've got to take a break\nRush Limbaugh speaking on radio\nAgain you're listening to the ER network\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there who\nAdvised the home advisor helped me find them back home pros in my area in the handle any kind of project you can read reviews them from check their bail ability even book appointments online and what my wife I Love most is that home advisor is completely three to you\nGo to ... dot com or download them ... to get started\nIt's people we believe investment advice is about more than helping you manage your well our investment advice is about it's about providing your kids with opportunities for head start in life feeling secure and your retirement and realizing your dreams just may become a reality because you have a point\nWe believe in\nThe bathroom investment advice starts with your people financial advisor find your new steeple financial advisor rich people dot com that's S C I F E L people make with some company incorporated member S.

a just a static flat line\nJust a ... a walking echo chamber for whatever leftist leadership in the Senate wants done whether it's a benefit to Florida or not but\nThe Santa would be great defense is is a is a Reagan night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with\nTrump a but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing\nHere and it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least in surveys then they have expressed in quite a while\nThe trend is constantly upward people have have ah exceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing me\nExtreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\nIt wouldn't constitute rolling back\nEvery achievement that has been made in the past ... if you want to go back to flat line economics of decline where\nThe president tells you this is as good as it gets and you've got to eat better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really wasn't deserved\nWe wave stole a lot of what we had we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats I\nCan't I Can't imagine people who are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved when ... in any way want to put the brakes on this\nAnd for what reason because they don't like Trump tweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\n\nTrump is supportive because he's in the last line to hold off\nOn this attempt transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped\nBy like this\nThis mob the seven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to beat and you've got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democratic party of today wants to happen successful\nAmerican needs to be punished whatever else is going on is still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nAre you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democrat Party believes your not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can\nThey don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content on your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually\nWant government to do is punish\nThe Democratic party has become a party of groups\nOf victims and these victims have turned over to their own futures to the Democratic party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me in and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference\nAnd so more and more what they want by voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful\nOr anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness\nThe Democratic party has become a party of mean spirited extremism the Democratic party has become the home of people sadly what psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders and normalize them\nAnd that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't succeed and the way\nI mean this is just hands down at nist Andrew Gillum personified eyes personify the in fact total wrong direction to take at any time but especially now let me go to these photos put but one of these up\nThe digital camera if you're watching this is Joe Biden at a rally for Andrew Gillum the media is trying to hide the fact that nobody is showing up\nThat is one view of a ...

he said yeah I said well what do you mean\nYou blew up\nThe entire intelligence community excuse or a story\nOr having evidence of how ... died they were out there saying that there were probably going to get proof of his interrogation in murder because it does apple watching here you come blowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's technologically not possible\nYou blow it up and you didn't even know it did I said well no because I wasn't aware of they were using the watch as that central if at at elements\nProving their case but then when snugly said this to me I have the pause I had to contemplate and then I have to consider he has a point but there was one of these things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just I Know it's impossible\nThere is no way that Jamal ... watch could have recorded anything can happen to him and there's no way it could have\nTransmitted or transferred it\nTo his iPhone which was in the possession in his fiance in the car in the parking lot of the consulate there's just no way especially sense apple has yet to activate L T E service\nOn watches sold them operated in Turkey so unless ... had entered the password for the

work on why five most people think they got to have the phone right next to watch in Ninety nine percent of the time they're right\nBut if you're a watch learns a why finding work like at your home

although although there is even more survey data now that the cabinet story was a one way benefits to the Republicans that he has not benefited the Democrats\nAnd the Democrats are seen as the angry party\nAnd at the cabinet are scenario as it played out benefited and continues to benefit Republicans\n\nHold a media is getting a little worried the Elizabeth Warren folk honest thing blows up to

Don Mueller's wrapped it up my mother is gonna be releasing at\nAny moment I got to be talking about\nBefore the midterms in hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping that the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done we'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump stole the election is imminent that is what they're hoping\nThey are hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed up near the ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe that it's only a matter of time\nBefore this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that well then he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is they will create\nThis cloud of suspicion this cloud of\nDanger that port\nHandles disaster for Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms\nWhen mullet releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might\nAll of this is going to happen to one degree or another the second thing\nThis tells me is that Mahler himself is waiting to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really end\nThis because his report goes to Rosenstein\nWho is technically his bosses at the department of justice and to Congress and there is deciding whether or not that it is made\nPublic so if the Democrats do when the house they're going to insist that Muller not conclude\nDuring the campaign OK okay or the campaign and one of the reasons that I see\nA during the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay\nAgainst a seven anyway he um [noise] I became a a Trump supporter one of the reasons was because she's got to be so good for the country and he is and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life that these people aren't happy to see the country doing well\nThat's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair and my dad was a Democrat my mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy and try to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high\nRight now for not only my shelf people in the neighborhood because she said it before with Stuart gardening\nUm he said the Trump ... and he says the only reason the only way I can get my message out well his choice to good but not that many people really here and I can't understand why he is not addressed the nation I don't understand\nWait a minute when you say when you say package you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm going to really losing a lot of energy and frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which ... most of the time and the press conference they ... they skew anyway\nSo if he addresses the nation any should it should be proud of what he's done this is the greatest time economically that I can never remembered I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made of the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit for the country doing well and that shocked you ride\nYou know not any more at a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country they really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen\nHow we can take the bullets day after day I mean he's ... guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with us from because he won't do a nationalist press and try to reach people that his tweets don't rich or audio ... that he that he doesn't rage but your real frustration of the U.S\nIs with a news media and many people are in the same boat who were doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed at frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't do it ... me it was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people are going to go out and vote and that you know like your newscast and they\nWhy do you think you are well why do you think you're one of the few people that led realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListened to you if the race\nThey are but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them a ... wage is going up on my machine aging my\nPoint is I think you can be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of this and that more people are aware of it than you may know\nAnd of course you could be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse\nWhy about it and you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard with Warren here they could not carry this October surprise they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that I think it's also helping get the truth about Trump's a cheap\nTo take a

newspapers in the current era in this modern day and it's amazing how honest if he is about what journalism is now this\nIs not about contemporary events there is nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era of generic piece in other words the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's big one of them small one of them is very curious to take them to feel very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise] don't focus on celebrities the other one is nothing more than\n... trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees\nThey're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does it's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people\n\nBoth of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out or some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig\nPeople powerful people rich people there obviously has to be something they're doing with breaking the rules that is the concerts breaking the rules there has to be something\nMistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists the U.S a call 'em out and\nAnd and ruin them which many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking\nTo some people about it and they said you have to understand what journalism is I said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist and these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a or a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbs led if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\nAnd it remains so today it's just\nIt's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin on it's all about destroying the but the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them and and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers and I haven't taken the time to Google any of them but I watched this\nI've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing and how brave Italy honest this is one of the the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is fixable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected by life\nTo him everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why his favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the way he guides his journalists is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job they're trying to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there they they have some kind of a relationship not pretending like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ... to file\n\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being a Pete if I was about somebody else for the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in and the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you and I'm ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like and live with it\n\nAnd the president I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to pursue the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise]\nIt's just it's ... it's it's perfect if the kind of personality you would have to be if your job is destroying people\nNo conscience the belief\nThat everybody is flawed that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\n\nNobody's decent nobody's white [laughter] it's amazing how this in the eyes\nOf a journalist an editor now I imagine\nReal journalists are going to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's\nIt exposes too much uh\nPeople have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than the entertained by it it it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women\nThe competing editor of the clean paper above board and paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirm that Peter file story while the other paper\nPuts it on the cover of having confirmed it because the editor at the other ... doesn't care whether it's true or not wondering calls that got us Peter found just get it up there and get it on the news stands whereas the female editor didn't have the\nGuts still running until the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking they obviously you're not worried about me too movement here that would put this thing together so the name of this press\nI have no idea it's it's I think it just completed airing 'cause I've got all six of them so I just competed completed it's um it's run cycle in the u._k. which means it's going to be on Netflix\nAmazon Prime wherever I don't know where it's going to be but it won't be long and if you remember me talking about it here and if you watch these kinds of things it's it's fascinating 'cause it's not about politics not about current post not about Trump it's not about conservatives liberals any of that\n[noise] if it's\nA it's a bad hip everybody everybody as a rubber meets including the people at the papers\nThe reporters [noise] um\nI I have to admit I was so [noise] anyway here's non of Brazil now I was I did not lose my play she's ... bill hammered a day and they're talking about the blue wave where she thinks we're headed\nAnd remember now this is a woman that used to be one of the head honcho zoo the DNC the Democratic party who in her normal countenance would be out there's oil yeah blue wave Democrat's gonna win big gets it's our time people are fed up but that's not how she found\nSee how many days in a long time in ...

is now higher than are tied with\nThree of the past six presidents at the same point in their first terms he is currently tied with Obama at forty four percent he's above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader point here Democrats in the media keep describing Trump as a hugely divisive figure\nBut the polls show that his approval is starting to line up with previous presidents and what's more Trump's low numbers are almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed to one\nAnother poll quote\nAt this point in Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved for the job he was doing\nAnd that was after the failed pork you it was it was after the signing of Obamacare in after the signing of Dodd Frank another policies highly antagonistic\nTo Republicans Trump on the other hand\nGets approval from only five percent of Republicans and that's where it's been throughout his presidency so Republicans in

think this massive caravan arriving\nIn the United states at our border close to the election who thinks this is going to help Democrats how what it helped Democrats\n\nIt's not just Trump separating as Trump not letting them in\nEither there has to be what it is these people actually are figuring that a massive ... they don't understand that this kind of thing is why Donald Trump was elected\nDonald Trump was elected to stop this kind of thing to stop this invasion and that's what this is this is an organized bought and paid for invasion and it's growing so obviously the plan is for this group of people including the children to arrive here\nVery close to the election and for Trump just sick ice on them and the border patrol on them and to deny them entry or\nTo separate the children from the adults so that the\nDrive by media can then kick into gear with stories that are\nAlready ... that are all ready taped\nInterviews with people on the caravan all ready in the

about\nThe costs of pictures of Trump smiling as people are denied in three Democrats think\nThis\nYou know I I Would think that if somebody politically did this it'd be a conservative group might do this\nTo promote Republican turnout\nThat we don't have anybody on our side who thinks that way but it makes more sense that way or am I missing something\nSomehow a massive group of four thousand people it's growing including kids\nMarching toward the United states with no attempt to making patently obvious what it is because you're not people fleeing anything these are not people fleeing the

this is supposed to end up making the United states look bad\n\nI'm I'm not ... if that's the way these people are figuring it going to play out now we have the Mueller report\nThat\nWill not be released before the election but we're being told that it is nearing completion and then it is ready to go\nI went through yesterday what the what the hope here is uh the hope here is to revive the Trump colluded with Russia narrative and to make people think that we're just days or weeks away from proof being released\nWhether we can't do it before the election because of regulations and this is what we're not going to influence the outcome of elections but Muller is ready to go at once in a while I've been doing well Mueller has been looking for evidence of Trump colluded with Russia so if monitors ready to go Mahler must have found the but this is what they want everybody to think\n\nAbout the fact of the matter is it's probably the exact opposite I'll let me find the justices Lee finely soundbite here [noise]\nThat puts this in perspective hang on and when I look at this [noise] yeah it won't take long hair folks I as I say I'm having a compressed everything here it is not pretend audio soundbite number tens and this is this is deep\nState ranking member Phil Mudd he is a former intelligence official now works as a commentator on CNN last night Wolf Blitzer show the situation room he's\nA counterterrorism center specials what he is and bless your said do you think that Muller is preparing new indictments\nThe really interesting part of this is a potential report a draft report and narrative if you will from other going over Rosenstein let me play this out Washington Rosenstein gets the narrative that says not only\nThis is what we found that my violate the law this is my picture of what happened during the investigation there is going to be some dirt and there are so in addition to the indictments I really want to see what's in that narrative or for\nK. so this\nIs where this is going to Mueller report is going to be full of supposedly horrible stuff\nTrump is none none of which\nIs probably going to be in ... none of which is going to be impeachable although the Democrats win the house they're gonna make moves in that direction anyway um but he says the important point of the smaller report will be the dirt ... not the in\nWhich\nThere's nothing for it less they make it up there never has\nBeen any Trump collusion and never has been the evidence or less they make it up [noise] so the smart money is that it's going to be filled with things that are accusatory that blamed\nTrump's incompetence ineptitude essentially blame Trump for being so in over his head that it looked like the Russians haven't worked with him to steal the election despite the fact that there is any hard evidence it's hard to refute the idea\nOf going to make it look like Trump is in over his head doesn't know what he's doing threatens the country with his

put yard signs out because literally afraid of leftist mobs coming to their homes and not just ripping the signs out but doing damage to their houses and so people who are tending to vote Republican are not putting yard signs that remember\nWe had a call here I just maybe three weeks ago now from a caller who said Russia I'm worried I'm not seeing in the yard signs we saw Trump's yard signs everywhere in two thousand six now I'm not seeing any yard signs at all\nI said well Bette camp the camp that looked into it and I found out that there is the leftist scaring the hell out of a lot of people and if that's right\nAlso includes scaring them not to go vote\nThere are a lot of people scared to death with these maniacs and that's why\nYard signs without being put I I I just part of me understands it another part of me she's afraid of yard\nSigns are you kidding [laughter] from the country that stormed the beaches in Normandy we're afraid of a yard sign\nBut it's a different era and these people on the left or crazed or making doing good job of making themselves look that way\nI have a video taken by it tend crew was worker I Can't I'm not going to show your video on the digital camera so I put it took ...\nStill shot that would have papa pop up here just second this picture you're going to see us from a video taken by cruise worker who was putting up crews campaign signs in uh Houston neighborhood Montrose and there was this guy\nGet mon make looking guy following the Cruz supporter around ripping up every yard sign ripping it out of the ground and then they're ripping

storming the Cruz supporter who is holding the camera\nHe actually got within two inches of the camera I didn't still shocked that point 'cause all you see is the guy's flaring nostrils\nBut this guy is out there following cruise people around taken a cruise yard signs out and then threatening\nCruise supporters who have videotape him doing this by the way this guy so long haired maggot infested rock and roll type you can see that and he's a he's wearing mustard yellow slacks you don't see that in the steel shop here [noise] but this is happening\nReaders to know this left turn is by golly by gosh for real\n\nThe sub had like many overnight sensations it has been years in the making what we know this to like go back to the Nineteen twenties and the Soviet Union if you want to trace the beginnings of this\n\nOver the past Eighteen years millions of Mr Thomas Bee and so the Democrat electorate has most steadily to the left as liberals have displaced moderates self identified the liberals of all races and ethnicities now command a majority in the Democratic party\nRaising the possibility that view is once confined mainly the party elite have spread to the rank and come on\nCome on up the Democrat\nParty elite sad to say we're never these radical left is now I'm going back ... Clinton\nThe Democrat Party moderate elite has been overtaken\nBy the left wing radicals\nAnd that's why some are scratching their heads anyway from two thousand one or two thousand Eighteen to share a Democrat voters would describe themselves as liberal has grown from thirty to fifty percent yeah well you don't want to know something else the percentage of Americans that call themselves liberal is shrinking now into the high mid thirties\nThirty five percent tops the American people identify themselves as liberal he doesn't say that [noise]\nI'm adding that the percentage of Democrats who say they are moderate has fallen from forty four thirty five percent percentage of self identified conservative Democrats has gone from twenty five to Thirteen percent that here we go now this is a long piece but this next Grapel is is the money\nGraph ready well educated whites especially white women\nAre pushing the Democrat Party this site simply leftward according to Gallup the Cheryl White Democrats calling themselves liberal on social issues has grown\nSince two thousand and one from thirty nine sixty one percent of because of this growth white liberals are now roughly forty percent of all democratic voters\nWhile a substantial percentage or a Democrat minorities identifies liberals those percentages have not\nBeen growing and anywhere near the rate they have for white Democrat wait a minute in two\nThousand eleven all white working class was told I go to hell\nNow all of a sudden the white women are the majority of the party and the the percentage of the Democrats represented by\nMinorities is not growing\nYou mean\nI guess that's why Trump's approval number amongst Hispanics Latinos and African Americans is that a record\nHigh for Republican candidates\nWhile a substantial percentage a Democrat minorities identify as liberal those percentages have not been growing anywhere near\nThe rates that they have been for white Democrats so blacks and Hispanics have not contributed significantly to the rising percentage of self identified Democrats liberals\nIn fact says Mr Thomas Bee ends all white liberals are well to the left of love black electorate on some social issues take the issue of discrimination as a factor\nHolding back African American advancement white liberals are to the left of black Democrats\n\nPlacing a much stronger emphasis then African Americans\nNow wait because earlier this week we had a story about the Republican Party owns white suburban women right we did so who is who is white\nWomen making up the majority of Democrat liberalism\nWho are back back in the mountains [laughter] shrimp boats were sheltered [laughter] you know I'd be met for\nA five year old brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down these are the

it's just another Trump tweet in an on going pattern when you constantly behave in an outrageous fashion people get immunized and numb to it\nAnd in fact [noise]\nRight on cue I have a piece in the wall Street Journal they're written it was just ... just the name of Lance tomorrow ring a bell to you\n[noise] Lance Morrow used to practically run time magazine back in this I mean he was the premier journalist not was not an executive but he practically ran the place [noise]\nI met him at Mr ... home he and ... you were good buds but Lance tomorrow was a a\nTypical turtles which means means weapons so far he's got a piece in the wall Street Journal\nThat is the headline is we've grown accustomed to Trump the always concern is that Trump's outrageousness\nNo longer fuels anger on the left as it should give people just got used to it\nEnded up the anger subsides it's bad because that's the only thing that Democrats have to get their people to the polls\nAnd here comes Liz mayor a Republican strategist making the same point but she's not doing it in a positive way yeah you know what this guy's been er ripper bay for so long and just people who have gotten used to it\nShe says\nI don't believe the headline Trump attached fuel Republican maybe the headline is true the Republican fearful about losing suburban women but I don't think Trump's comments stop and think for a minute here\nThere may be an isolated case of a suburban woman thinking that\nI Can't support this guy he just called a porn star a horse race\nBut\nThis election is really important and people that are involved in this election now how important it is and people that have voted for Trump in the past\nAnd have voted Republican ... I just don't I don't think the media's merges lesson yet this is not the kind of thing that is going to cause Trump to lose an election you mean in a few votes here\nIt may it may have caused other Republican candidates to Louis maybe hold elections\nBut but not Trump I just think it's all part of the equation in which Trump critics still don't get it they don't get the bond between Trump and his supporters they never will understand it because they're not curious to understand that\nAnd so they take these things that they think are just outrageous insults\nJust so totally\nPermissible in American politics and they assume this has it dead zip Trump's finished this has to be yet and not even the Access Hollywood video then it\nThis isn't going to do it\nFrom the hill dot com Trump threatens military action of Mexico does not stop this immigration onslaught\nPresident Trump today warned that he may take military action to stop immigrants from crossing the southern border into the U.S may just not take action to stop the this is the caravan it's headed our way\nTrump railed against Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador are saying that they have almost no control over their population I'm watching the Democratic\nParty land because they want to open borders an existing week laws I'm watching a Democrat Party whether salt on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people including many criminals entering from Mexico to the U.S [noise]\nThese people I don't I was talking earlier I'm ...
