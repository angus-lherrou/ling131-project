Caldwell pope is so much worse than he was the last year\nAnd the second thing is the Lakers aren't just bad defensively they are here darkly awful we're still very lovely to the middle of the most sports when they they are dead last so that's not a recipe but in a game against Denver which was a great comfort began went for the Lakers\nOnes of all had five deals in that game so if I were the Lakers right now here's what I Would do I would have brunch with Ingram coups ... ball and hard\nYour future why why am I wasting time with John Doe or Stephen you don't want to bring these veterans are like ... yeah and here's the deal around those effectiveness\nIs diminished coming off the bench because there was only there should be the guy to stand up to have that edge and its diminished when you're coming off the bat but now it's just you don't want to play with a guy Rondo who bit\nIn LeBron's best friend face it seemed Chris Paul is that they are and whatever their God parents each other's kids and Ron do even if he didn't spit in Chris Paul space I'm abroad and you're going to get in the face of my best friend how do you think you might Stevenson were brought in\nTo do the dirty work yeah that was wrong legitimacy that's fine but now with my best friend uh\nThere's there's value with rod though there's value with rod so you would start Rhonda over law that would have to finish the game yeah your lawn so going to say it was always your is your future why what do you plenty I'm On hold for\nHe ultimately is going to be the guy playing with the brunt of the ... let me ask you this are you going to sign a Rondo to a three year extension after no not at all then why are you starting him now keep 'em off the bench for because you don't want to throw away your investment after five games\nThing while he's in a Laker uniform use him to his best to\nDo is your future at this why you began not only wrong you know what I said why why can you understand what he says it I Would I mean I I'm not under any that I Want to hear you guys right now\nIf you're you're ... where are you God if you're the Lakers would you celebrate a gate with against the nuggets as a

years and when she fell apart against the cardinals in seven sending\nHe's pitching over two hundred and twenty and he's in the regular season he was carrying his team they wouldn't have been there without him [noise] the fact is that they don't really account for that the wear and tear and just pressure\nOf the season and then all of a sudden the post season and the weather kind of changes sure they have splits sure they have what you pitch in certain leather [noise]\nWhich you can't account for pressure of the moment combined with the tea combined with who is in the index circle combined

and the way they think they can win is by being sued by using some sort of numerical long range formula that holds the only one workout but doesn't play\nIn a seven game series [noise] I'm not telling you anything you didn't know but if you didn't know the red Sox are clearly better than the Dodgers the Dodgers having played well that doesn't seem to matter\nBecause the Dodgers are so tied to analytics said\nTo get the rest of your what Doug said ... searching the dung godly show as always you can hear that a godly show we dated three eastern new Pacific right here on Fox Sports radio\nLadies and gentlemen this is Dan Patrick show\nWhich quarterback ... do you think the brown to regret the most they passed on to Sean launches passed on Carson went and they passed\nOn chatty Bridgewater in their car that was twenty ... well I think I don't know if they regret that at the time we we had a story when they took me in jail that those two guys looked really good early Bridgewater didn't want to go to Cleveland and he said that when\nWe had him on the show he said thank God I they didn't draft you know I didn't want to go there [noise] uh Darren car I was told from

everything's okay we got Baker maybe as a fourth option they're fit it all worked out the way it should but I don't think you're going to get them to say you know what [noise] Baker Mayfield okay but boy certainly wouldn't be nice to have Carson winds here\n[laughter] Dan Patrick show oh man it's a fun we have nine am eastern six specific ... is the\nTime and time again about LeBron James being a Laker and he's just been completely supportive I kind of odd leave really doesn't want LeBron to see but you know what I'm starting to believe that he does\nThis is his place he was here for Twenty years I'd live around the fair I think he wants to liberal on the fly off\nYou are listening hitting a cell phone with Chris Broussard Enron Parker singled out that we see that seven pm eastern four pm switched it back\nOn TALK more\nThan ... show\n[noise] [noise] [noise] the giants in raiders have\nDecided by NFL standards we are going to take one of the things that would fall people bragged about said it was if they never male ... video you can have baseball teams give up to throw up the white flags in basketball teams do it but he says that's part of the ... fault DNA\n... nights at two AM eastern eleven pm Pacific Fox Sports radio\n[noise]\nFox Sports friendly\nIn college football number two Clemson a fifty nine to ten winner at Florida State at Northwestern on Fox TV you got a home victory over number twenty Wisconsin thirty one Seventeen online car shopping can be confusing not anymore with troop price for through car\nSo here's one thing that I see\nAnd it's not easily shed however I Do think there are some things we can do here I Love the movie Moneyball and it's one of my favorite lines in a movie when Brad Pitt said adapt or die and baseball has by and large all adapted now they need to adapt to back\nThere is a problem analytics aren't fun\nAnalytics might be right analytics or mathematical therefore I can sit here and say oh my team is a better chance to win if I make this pitching move\nOr my ... my team has a better chance to win if I use my backup right fielder in this game there is a problem that's not what anybody wants to see it doesn't matter\nIf you might be right but in the end you're wrong because baseball at its core in the end what are we doing here Bucky this is an entertainment\nEntity that's what it is and so in game one of the world series features the Dodgers bench in their top for homerun hitters\nThat's positive analytics and its anti fan\nAnd you got to stop you have to stop I don't know how you deregulate analytics you got a third baseman standing in right field stopping base hits you gotta stop it's not fun I don't care if it's right I don't care if it's effective it's not fun and Bucky I think we sign up to be here for the fun\nI mean we certainly did sign up to be there for the fun of it is supposed to be about entertainment and I love\nLike strategy I Love the tactics that managers throughout a love seeing a manager's be able to put the imprint on games however\nYou are right the shifting um the thing that analytics have given um managers in terms of the way they can defend certain players it has taken some of the office of the game right near the defenses ahead of the office\nUm but I don't know how you can regulate it I don't know how you can say like oh there we were forbidding shifting those\nThings that's easy that's easy like in the in the NBA you've got a legal defense there's certain spots you can't stand hey third baseman you need to be All right surveys Harry [laughter] I Need to in filters on the left side of second base and he joined filters on the right side that's a real period\nWhat's wrong with that get rid of the shift it's killing it it's absolutely doing nothing for anybody\nIn the name it does nothing for anybody\nI mean it doesn't do anything from an office in\n... and water all bug can we talk about this every week water all sports doing they're making rules that are unfair to favor the off chance in the NBA teams are hitting a buck fifty every night right now\nI mean they are in the book fifty and how ... how many how much we're watching the games when the ... used to play when I was a kid and dug Mohammed them up and down this law right I mean they I mean buckets are just dropping like today I Do like to pick up that they are given\nBuckets and how many quarterbacks ever quarterback reading on a hundred in half the league is unbelievable okay so baseball\nHello [laughter]\nBut you're saying there's going to make a difference when it comes to the rating no but you do need to move you need all fenced\nYou need movement you need your support to move and I certainly don't want to spend I don't know I haven't even looked at this you guys know what's it costs to get into Dodger Stadium tonight what's the what's getting price I don't know what to do a couple of hundred bucks I has to be at least right\nOkay do state to say you're a what what's the what's interesting about the world series like it or see if I Want to go to the game tonight I'm a ... last night in upper level seats were over four hundred dollar okay I'm going to pay for\nThere are certain teams that resonate more than other teams you have the reason why are we talking about the Dallas Cowboys a lot there's a reason why we talked about the New England patriots than others\nUm just because they resonate there's a reason why we may not talked about the Detroit Lions because they don't necessarily draw a big number we are trying to make sure we give the people what they want the people's chance\nCome on man that's what we're doing here so uh what would make you watch more baseball age seven seven Ninety nine of us will keep going with your calls but bell flashy who are as I said just got home from Dodger Stadium moments ago\n[laughter] I just want to go yes he's panting and he's going to live in a moment but let's just have to say you're in here right now with the latest\nUh there is a lot of college football going on\nToday there is and Fox TV will have game for the world series tonight eight pm eastern by the way we do know the red Sox starter Eduardo Rodriguez he only through six pitches last night so he'll be starting and they didn't use ... at all so he could\nGo faithful to their national plenty of all the bad guy he's seven hundred pitches last night I mean my gosh and felt like he was pitching for six hours\nIt was phenomenal well close it was nearly a hundred pitches in relief Rick poor cello normally a starter through over sixty pitches in relief so we expect\nTo LA to enrich hill as the starter tonight and it is official Clayton cursed show all star game five tomorrow the red Sox don't need to overreact they don't need to pitch Chris Sale on short rest he can go tomorrow night there is still leading in the series by the way in the world series history\nGoing up two games to none sixteen of the last Seventeen of those teams went on to win the title Boston still won a hundred and eight games this year they still have five finalists for gold glove all three outfielders by the way you see with no da and the national league park they put JD Martinez in his or her ankle in left field at a couple of times the manager\nCame out of the dug out and said\nThere is a right handed poll hitter up can you not play left field and they switched the left and right field there is to try and keep him out of the equation of course the Dodgers as a team are betting to await this postseason so let's just keep that in mind reinforcing what we talked about last segment\nGame two of the world series the Dodgers only had three hits that game in Austin and all three were on the force ending so the rest of the game they were over twenty four and last night after the tense the Dodgers were to for twenty three\nI actually it's really last night I Would like to go for Halloween as a run scoring hit has anyone know where I was I went to a party city I was ... I Can't find one of those anywhere\nMan didn't the royals when a World Series very recently getting clutch singles they're just such thing in our college football top ten match up at Georgia is now bulldogs ten seven over Florida early second quarter on Fox TV eighth ranked Oklahoma sooner leads Seventeen nothing against Kansas State first and goal for K state early second quarter\nTop twenty match up Iowa leads at Penn State twelve seven early in the second\nIs that Missouri twelfth rank twelfth ranked Kentucky had three nothing leader at ... late in the first quarter and Houston ahead of number Twenty one South Florida fourteen to six in the second Houston all American defensive lineman at Oliver is out today with a bruised knee wins already for claims in northwestern back to you\nAll right excellent stuff through the same girl who was that the entire game last night and will be going to hide him as well um so yes there are still baseball fans in this world and then there are also people to work the games\nAre like Bill Cosby columnist LA Times were alive and the guy so far sports radio studios easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance would Geico Geico dot com or called eight hundred nine four seven out only heard part figuring out which way it's easier when times get home last night but I\nGot home at four o'clock in the morning [laughter] and I'm back here at the ballpark and you know what [laughter] but it's you know what it was so worth it it was such a great now was it was a terrible don't\nMan aside this let's don't try to paint this as baseball so beautiful it's endless this time was it was excruciating\n[laughter]\nIt was ... it was horrific and you'll ... you'll know what I'm Talking about what\nDo we do now I mean this is what we've actually just been talking about is when you could have the Dodgers play the red sauce at Dodger Stadium in a World Series game three was so much on the line that's something so I think happened yet bill it's still not entertaining\nLike it was just telling you how to watch out an obligation not because you were like wow I Can't turn this off\nI talk I talk I talk to my girlfriend today to the stands and she said\nIt was like the same thing happen over and over and over again for Eighteen in it was unbelievable yes it was the same wherever you want to say it was it was not there was no entertainment value at all but there was but that will be could potentially lead to a huge entertainment value\nIf the Dodgers have trains you turn the whole ... woman round on this thing and the series is turn I think that's possible I think that's possible because the red Sox remember they were one out\nLittle kids are holds on to that ball they probably get often Barnes out they win that game the red Sox were went up and being up thrill and now they're pitch was decimated they're roughly two to one and they've got an above what potential go to second basic you know and uh you know and and the Dodgers were all fired up you know maybe we'll get one or two hits is diamond twenty\nAnd it's I don't know [laughter]\nYeah you're dealing in thinking about that so now going in the game for the pitching is all a mess because everyone can use the majority of their pitchers how does it affect both teams has effect the red Sox when it comes to their rotation how would that affect the Dodgers were\nWhat effect it affects the red Sox more because they use Nathan evolve he had the starting pitcher who pitched fix it fix any in relief pitchers so it it takes away whether it hurts hurts a lot more towards the Dodgers of doctors that ritual healthy ready\nTo go the red Sox don't really have a decent starter left at least for today the red Sox have gone through most of their book and the Dodgers have more long relievers down there is they have more aren't more and more innings left it affects your thoughts about one of the Dodgers Dodgers are seem to be on a much better path much more rested it all in all and all that this\nBill I Want to ask you about Dave Roberts because uh everybody in Los Angeles right now seems poised to pounce especially if they had lost last night there are two sides is a I don't even know what managers really do any more 'cause I don't trust them to decisions are coming from them\nBut secondly when it's he makes the world series two years in a row ... what are we talking about here like now so now everybody wanted to find them if you lost this Eighteen any game or he didn't now they want to keep him isn't it's stupid to have a decision come down to a few innings of baseball\nIt's really dumb and you saw the first thing you said was so right we don't know what he does they won't say it and I was closest with anybody and it's just hard\nTo understand that there were very secretive about exactly who does a lot they said it's a collaborative effort to line up they see all the moves they're collaborative or they did they take over the responsibility for what you're but you're right mark we don't know who does what so it's hard to judge you gotta just judges can he is the leader of men\nCan get them in a position to win any two straight World Series that's pretty damn good so I think you know I think there is no way they're going to fire him if they lose a series there's no way\nAnd ... and they're going to get rid of a contract with the more you're up there on contract it's going to be fine because again we don't like as soon as she's wanting to line up he'll take responsibility for it but we don't know if that's actually true everybody su he make all the changes he takes his responsibility for it we don't know if that scripted\nSo we just don't know with the with the whole analytics and with Andrew Freeman at Barnes eighty running the show here you just don't know so yes judge them\nNow he leads you've done a good job as a leader\n... he seems to be a gathering Dodger films don't get me started but then he started but then it seems like in the playoffs whenever the Dodgers have needed something he's come through ... was she well he's both ...\nHere's the thing the fans love him\nThe fans who this is the biggest disparity between what I've written in what I'm thinking what the fans thing\nI'd written issue trade them at the end of the year and I think they will try to the team and that's been fed up with his antics throughout the season all the good equals doesn't over way all the bad during the course of a sees all the distractions all the funny stuff but the fans just love him and ownership loves watching them\nSo it's a big disparity there'll be it but he has come through big but he's also you know made mistakes all the bases we played too shallow on that ball that Judy Martinez said that one of the game for the Boston it back in Boston you know he does he he he overthrew will cut off man and game on\nSo it just he it's kind of was that the sum total of his part is is entertaining player he makes a great place but does he always is it was at work is worth a distraction\nAnd I think they can probably get some form this winter it's the last year was contract going into I think you'll probably I think it will treat them the bands will be crazy and they'll be yelled at me and blaming me for it\nBut I and blamed the Dodgers I think it's probably the best thing\nOh my God what are they are they're warming up the Oregon already did I mainly what what are they doing all they give the Oregon is to break she was oh no no\nNo no no what happens is the topic than experiments after singer the inexperienced anthem singers come up here in practice before they happen with the organist either rural and that's what they're doing now so he must have an inexperienced person today maybe not some big movie star or something but yes so their their practice in the bathroom right now\nIt was weird though you know what they did the other we were in I think we're we're in Atlanta I Believe in the playoffs they actually there were ... in the stands and they came down and they practice the anthem on the field with fans in the stands like at six o'clock if they didn't know what to do so it's betting practice sitting around ... thereby kind of stands up\nTheir lives you know just a dress rehearsal about how [noise]", "show_name": "Fox Sports Weekends", "year": "2018", "city":

as always know who you're dealing with asking plenty of questions and make sure your broker is if the new year\nFor the financial safari news network said oh\nI kind of getting a\nLittle number two don't take advantage of I didn't move [laughter] I did have a a a cool over driver once and he would he turns out he was a prison guard full time at bar were butter Isabel Island Railroad and he basically new Bernie Madoff sure already was a hero inside the prison because you know bodies the guy and all the guys got hit by a\nRobot never learn sometimes they don't read the new trade well ... road\nSo I mean do you have to be careful about these pumping dumps to right oh yeah Mm let's talk about a couple of where buckets I Want to make sure that the bucket a strategy folks as it's just a way\nIt's not an end all be all but it's a way for you to divide mentally to begin with but then physically hopefully your money into three different places one is for immediate emergencies we call that the yellow bucket nuts for emergencies or money you need within six to twelve months the next\nWell we call we yell and read so it can be mixed it could be orange or can be read all the way it's it's your if your financial goals bucket or maybe your dream bucket and the timeframe for this book it should be at least one year that's yellow part\nAnd could be two five ten or Twenty years that's read part of getting and I'll say I'll tell you why because basically anything that you're saving\nFor that can't pay out the normal cash flow in other words you have to have that money and we used a one year time rising 'cause a lot of money goes tied to the market that's what we call it the risk and go up and down so you want to leave that money alone\nBecause that's why we have the number one so if you need the money you don't want to take money out of your your red account your bucket to if the market is down because you're walking into losses so having those two accounts those two buckets yellow and the red one together makes sense but then\nYou say well gosh there's got to be a better way to save and not worry about the money long term\nAnd so that's a bucket number three which we called the green bucket and this is your retirement bucket and this is the most important bucket and this one that a lot of people that are listening to listening now he said gosh we don't have a great book if he's got all her money or four one K. we've been told us our retirement yeah we don't have any safe options and there's really not that that's a red bucket not agree bucket\nBut there are ways of your fifty nine and older\nYou can roll out some of your money in four one K. and get into your own personal ice cream bucket or if you've left a job or two and you still have those for one case or give IRAs\nThese could be transferred into green buckets to your retirement bucket and any funds that you'll say specifically\nTo provide income when you retire when of course you need to be at least fifty nine and a half and the green bucket before you take money out because if you're under the yeah the ... percent federal penalty of ...\nAnd this money would fall into the green bucket and what a lot of the accounts we see a nice the green book at our traditional raw step simple erase board when the spoils reduce the SPs they all are vehicles that could be in the green bucket\nRight again because think about it why do we save in all those accounts I just mentioned we save their to have retirement but then we put the money into account where we could lose the money\nAnd so you know with Murphy is always ... ... if it's going to happen it happens bad or whatever like Kelly Brown got along well if you have all your money at risk\nAnd you're counting that money to be your retirement money and then when retirement comes a day you reach retirement gosh it's happened to be able to do you reach retirement the market decides to take a forty percent point what happens to retire ouch now you're gonna do forty percent less things probably sixty percent less thing because now you're worried and retirement and wanted to do\nYou're basically going to sit home and sit on the couch and watch Jerry Springer all day you know that's entertaining for me for one hour but I couldn't imagine doing that eight hours a day for seven days a week I lost about twenty minutes yeah and so it's not as much as you can take so again that's this is why we call it a bucket ballots you have to balance your buckets properly\nAnd no one's going to tell you about this if you're in the four one K. it's all when the risk bucket there's no say well the safe option gives you a one percent interest or something that's not safe that's losing money safely need to be keeping up with inflation at least three percent growth every single year or you're losing money safely\nI Know is that the bank it's in the CD and you're all happy because you say it's safe but if each and every year we have inflation growing by three percent and you're only already one percent you're buying power shrinking revenues financial evaporation we can't have\nAnd the successful retirement plan that should last to be designed we designed our plans to last stage one hundred and Twenty one and beyond\nWe can go further but no I haven't seen anybody won Twenty one yet but Atlanta go forever and then when you pass away whatever's left goes on in your next again that's how it through planned is that the truth but if the plan and it has all three buckets to read the green together buckets one two three balance your buckets folks balance your buckets if you're not sure about this call right now we'll put together your very own customized\nBus getting strategy that can give you that total confidence as you approach retirement folks keep in mind a proper bucking strategy has these three items and these three out of the most important items at any financial or retirement plan gross\nMaking sure the potential growth ... years you have the money they're protection protecting your money from taxes protecting get as much as you can from Texas protecting from risk these commissions\nVery important protection just like a quarterback has an office of wind you didn't office of wine or on your portfolio and then income for the rest of your life with no questions consist of persistent reliable income\nWhen you decide to take it for the rest of your life no questions asked and hopefully that you have a couple of other green buckets one two three you'll have increasing and come away through retirement we can set that up where you are with the next ... two hundred thousand there'll be no cost her obligation and you'll get that financial education and personalized bucket of strategy that you deserve Steve do how to do that\nJust like we've been tackling problems on the show today we can help you assess your plan and your outlook for retirement to make sure that you are on a secure path\nJust limited but complementary review will help you determine how prepared your investments are to handle all the retirement pitfalls we talked about on the show those include inflation Social Security healthcare emergencies so many things the stock market volatility risk taxation but here's the thing folks most important we want to show you how to produce a lifetime\nRetirement income plan that's right folks an income plan to last your entire lifetime not just the lifespan of a bank account now the number to call in and meet with Paul

I mean obviously you want your team to win however you your team has to get into the world series to have an opportunity to win it there one game away from doing I think every reasonable fan base\nWould say look if you get so we can sign up and say that my team is in game seven to go to the world series signed me up then we have a series last year but it isn't as it right on the verge this year in the sixties in\nTitles in a row\nAnd you got nothing to show you gotta you got a bucket of nothing\nOut of that\nWith the highest payroll and baseball and the best pitcher in baseball not any more oh during that time\nOh always in the mix oh yeah oh I mean it would be disappointed ... always in the mix do you have to be in the yeah the\nBridesmaids her in the mix at a wedding okay so you rather be I mean so you rather be the Miami Marlins I'm playing devil's advocate you round the Miami Marlins I'm with you when it\nBut then you disappear for Twenty years on you know\nNo baseball shouldn't even be in Miami it's clear by now and I don't say that against anybody in Miami but you can't you cannot conduct a ... a franchise the way they conduct that franchise rice just wrong it is it's wrong but\nThey get two World Series so I guess that's okay but it's like I appreciate consistent right but by the way who cares [laughter] who cares that the Marlins won two World Series does anybody care is anybody cherishing those World Series\nYeah but right now the way that you're talking about\nOh I just made it should be disappointed you don't go do should I just know the way they will react\nI Know the way they will react Roberta I'm sitting here ... I mean so really are ... you're going to be mad right if they deny you look at this season how\nDoes the failures X ray division titles and nothing to show for it failure you know those two\nT shirts and [laughter] it's a whole lot of shift pay for the Dodgers if I go to do they go on about how about your father was a little are six years dresser drawer for\nAll kinds of stuff just Joelle I tell you what I'm with you especially baseball it's quirky the ball flies a certain way it's tough because although it just shows up a lot of luck involved well what happens too is I Know the same way this fan base looks at you ... there's a mini mini version of it last night\nWith review a well oh don't know ... what do they get if they didn't know\nWhat ... what about him get disappointed we\nBut my point is you can't boil ... fans do this and it's not fair you can't boil baseball down to one night and then make up your mind\nBecause it's baseball and the worst team in the league can beat the best team in the league on a given night you can't do that in football\nYour kid Charlotte is not going to beat the warriors\n... they're not going to not even once if the gay mattered not even watch but you can the royals can beat the red Sox won a given night so you can't get to a game seven and go okay guys let's see if you're worth anything\nAnd then the pitcher goes out curve balls not curbing that night and\nThat was driven yeah but that because that's baseball it doesn't always work that currently I was just there last night we may may may but you get your you give us a chance well but that's boring runs for president first baseball baseball\nBaseball you throw a perfect pitch some guy defensive swing goes off the the label on his bat twice or the first baseman had laughing there for a double\nBut that's not what was that baseball but that's not what happened at all I understand that no no those are all out I Know it wasn't going to do by some days where do you wake up your own fame every day no okay it's baseball when they go through Austin and forget just light drinker [laughter]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fox Sports Weekends", "city": "Moss Point", "day":

through retirement there you go through and so they have the fastest sprinter it had to to to get to that point but when you get to retirement you need a marathon runner make fun of something and so a lot of people don't have\nThat so we need to have that yearly paycheck and I for one day and it's not offered so how do we do it while we roll the money tax free into our own retirement plan and we built a yearly income component into their ... and if we build it right we have lifetime income for the rest of our life we can have increasing income if we use the marketing strategy\nAnd we can also have some of that money dedicated for long term care while\nAnd if we include that into a total retirement plan we can also have something called a super will transfer so that when you pass away your children will get a tax free or your spouse will get a tax free income for the rest of your life instead of taxable and we can do something called a spending leaf plan\nWhere if you're worried about wanting to leave money to the ... what if you could spend all the money you want it to today or this year or in your lifetime short and when you pass away your children or whatever whoever your grandchildren you're leaving the money to\nGet exactly or more than what you started with oh probably spent it and now you're leaving okay well that are a lot of people haven't had heard of the snow and then and then when people see it actually in writing which it all was in writing they are in disbelief number one\nThe main disbelief is not that is true because it's all backed up right twenty five years in the financial never had a complaint I mean I I'm not just say and stuff so to say thanks short of disbelief because the current plan or never told them about it and the main reason unfortunately\nAnd I have to apologize for the financial industry for this is that many advisors are compensated by keeping you at risk ... ... if you're going to a doctor and he was describing your prescription it had nothing to do with what you needed it made it may be made you to press instead of happy\nAnd you went to the doctor and say why were you prescribe and as for years to me and he said well compensated by the drug companies six to keep you on drugs I wouldn't be surprised well that's about it what we're talking about here if someone's got you in the wrong place financially and it's not helping you a matter of fact is hurting you 'cause you're not building an income plan why they doing it\nWell it reminds me how we really do have to take that initiative on our own ... really search out and find folks who are you've mentioned fiduciary in the past how important it is to find someone who is a fiduciary and it's not just claiming to be working in your best interest 'cause that's really the heart of the conversation isn't it\nGo to the advisor who specializes in risk and ask them how to have a safe income plan and here's what you hear\n[noise] and that's unfortunate because if we are fifty two older and I started before it was the cause I'm In this financial arena and I want\nTo make sure the bill myself retirement plans I was called back of the day when they the ... channel did a biography about me it's appeared on about our show when everything oh well they called me the Mike you the financial world because I Try everything before I recommended any but okay and so maybe the life sort of commercial may and so if\nI'm like a human guinea pig here vote in tests rapid and Peter Rabbit right so what else what I'll do though was not talk about something on the air unless I really believe in it and\nWe unfortunately in this financial world when we're talking about retirement planning\nMany people are ignoring that\nAnd they're hoping that everything would just work out fine they've got a lump sum again lump sum great sure but until you can translate what that lump sum really means for not income for next year or ten years but for a lifetime but not only you but for your spouse and if he passed away two so which anytime you best ways to sue we wanted we call it taken the limousine they haven't right that's right but when that happens\nYou want to make sure that whatever money you have put aside doesn't disappear it go onto the next to Ken doesn't disappear and going someone else's pocket and that's called planning\nAnd it's not just financial sales putting in the best investments for today that's crazy by the way it is it is putting you into a plan and once we have that planned built then we can take the leftover money money that you don't need for income and you can you can basically take risk with if you want yeah but what you know what people usually tell me if we build the perfect plan for retirement was that 'cause I Want to put more in it [laughter]\nI don't want to put this money exposed right yeah but I Do have a lot of people I recommend keep maybe fifty thousand at a Scott trade account or something like that okay and buy and sell some stocks on their own or whatever just keeps your mind sharp yeah yeah yeah and it keeps them you know happy and researching and all that but it's even if they lost all that money\nThey still have okay they still have the more they're young they're important for the rock is they haven't rock is there is going to be there it's going to give them income for the rest of their life\nAnd this is very important to me it really is and that's the way too many people have seen in my years in twenty five years I see people who thought they were fine\nUntil the market rip the carpet out from under him\nAnd then they had to rebuild all over again sort of like taking an ant hill over there you know it's come back and rebuild but all the time that could have been building a palace precisely it high but how are you there having to start over again and that's what happens starting over again is not any fun now and\nEspecially if you're already we're to the point where you don't need to take any risk because you already have the income you need for retired so you already have the money that could get you didn't come you need a retirement but your current winner hadn't told you about ... so if you're one of the next twenty callers as we leave for the week here keeping my folks have you get a busy signal keep trying Thomas is going to give you a number out in a minute\nBut if you're one of the next twenty people who call we're going to do for you a one page financial review and this review will indicate if you're in need of a full blown financial a retirement plan and this is a very important review and it's about a nine hundred million dollar value when you when you factor in all the time\nWe're going to give us away you get into the next twenty people no obligation or fees\nAnd it's ...\nIf you want the next twenty people who have at least two hundred thousand dollar save for retirement now what this will consist of is taking the mystery of the retirement planning process by mapping out for you where you are right now\nWe're also going to run a fee report folks and this was enlightening it's not it does make you happy sometimes but will help you won tangle with working with your current planner advisor is truly costing you\nAnd to see if by simply protecting your retirement investment you could experience what we call dramatic growth potential\nYou know who hates us the analysis who's at your current advisor many time home though 'cause we expose things that have been financial termites in show you what you have financial evaporation and your portfolio that doesn't need to be happening street we're also going to perform attacks analysis that also could reveal how you could possibly reduce your tax is very important because the more money we can save you the more money you have for retirement what yourself\nWe're going to also run the most important part as a customized income plan that utilizes the proven pocketing strategy and strength other strategies and techniques which could turbo charged retirement income\nIf you do that folks you take the war he out of living in retirement and short will help you take a guess work out of the financial end retirement planning process for the next twenty callers that is a comprehensive plan to review going to give away it's a nine hundred dollar value no obligation again for the next twenty callers\nJust like we've been tackling problems on the show today we can help you assess your plan and your outlook for retirement to make sure that you are on a secure path\nThis limited but complementary review will help you determine how prepared your investments are to handle all the retirement pitfalls we talked about on the show does include inflation Social Security healthcare emergency so many things the stock market volatility risk taxation\nBut here's the thing folks most important we want to show you how to produce a lifetime retirement income planned or his right folks an income plan to last your entire lifetime not just the lifespan of a bank account\nNow the number to call in and meet with Paul Roberts who is coach Pete's local trusted financial coach in the Biloxi\nArea is eight hundred eight nine one eight six eight\nZero when you call and you will receive a comprehensive retirement review that'll show you where you are now but much more important it'll show you a roadmap to get you where you need to be folks there really is nothing to lose ... on and take advantage that number once\nAgain eight hundred eight nine one eighty six eighty again that's eight hundred eight nine one eight six eight zero\nVery very good show very fast show very good to have you back in the studio to what the folks for a for ... for Thomas estimates coach feet will join your next week right here on the financial support\n[noise]\nCars the information provided it was very it was his only investment tax where we would have been a painful forces that are going to be reliable when we leave this year we interview or Jay Root for his wife\nUses it for me she was always the goal in mind\nI mean when you hear me neither I frankly claims playing ability we want to thoroughly review and offering more specific details\nOn companies withdrawing\nDeferred annuities are shall we\nFrom the mental us GMC studios here talk going on for nine\nPoint and I heard a radio station [noise]\nFox Sports trending\nGame two of the NFL Championship series about to start on Fox TV today Dodgers that Milwaukee Brewers took the open or the best to seven last night at home Milwaukee is one twelve straight games the ALCOA starts this evening with Houston at Boston in college football Baylor has a seven three lead at ninth ranked Texas late in the first quarter\nThey lost six football games that is unacceptable out of breath like taxes and their word Texas fans going huh did this not work either well how do you like me now\nAnd I'm now in screaming out from the beginning now Tom\nHarm in in a year where coming in wasn't even expecting to do this this quickly Tom Hartmann is in the top ten and as Texas in position to potentially if things go perfectly the rest of the way this guy could end up in the college football playoff this year that's what happens if you just have a mental patients\nBut when we're not in that business now well I don't want we shouldn't be they actually in that kind of high price environment I think\nYou have to be can't give out contract like that and they lied on them all six weeks later\nOnly if the world we live by mark Willard standards to be honest with you we being a great place however how many coaches are sitting on their college right now at home eating chips and guacamole with Shaq getting mailbox money checks that are coming they don't have to do anything about\nThis is on the Lakers ended up paying for three four or five I don't do drugs are paying some well they are they're still paying some coaches and watch how the Luke Walton thing\nOff suddenly works because what Brian James is on his roster that is what it was all along you could blame the coach this that and the other at the end of the day sports comes down to players now you could have a bad coach mess up good players\nAnd you then you can have a really good coach get some more out of players that maybe aren't up to snuff but really when it all boils down to it you know yeah it's like you said the chefs got to have the food and they've got to have the ingredient\nI don't fully but clearly let's just yes players matter the but as for the period there I'm with you on that but I Do think there's more to organizational strength and success than just simply we have good play no of course because this is why\nBob Kraft great honor Bill Belichick great coach and GM and then\nObviously we have a great players and it's ... you know Julie I Would say he's good I Would say is great but you know we've got some good players in some\nGreat players are on both sides of the ball and now all of a sudden what happens you get guys who go to their they have to buy into the system that the minds of the way they practice the meticulous way their approach to the game and I think that that's why guys go there and it's to see that's why Lugar blocking go there and win a championship in guys come in you know who's who's who's white oh there was a\nRunning back and he's avid you can have success because of that I think that's why guys the year and year out the ... the spurs drafted guy you go\nIn there always good to a drive in the back end of the first round if not the second round and then the next thing you know there's some I'm not saying all great but there's solid places

today gentlemen or one nothing victory at Armenia\nMaybe the bad news is when they play those national anthems before the game the er people up in the press boosted Armenia they played the Lichtenstein national [laughter] so why are wrong small country\nBut nice try just what I'm trying to enjoy my victory you paid early player on\nSomething that I tell you what they're just add some controversies in every country okay we're alive and the guy on Fox Sports radio studios easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance of Geico guy cannot calm eight or nine four seven out on the hard part figured out which way it's easier serious XM NFL insider\nItem Kaplan now joins us live follow him on Twitter at Kaplan NFL out of it is great to have you know what I'm thinking about this New York giants quarterback situation\nAnd what's the answer a white guy and when you see something this early in the season how how do they even how do they get out of this what are what are they going to do going forward\nThere's not much because the only option would be to turn to work you call a letter\nOr who's a fourth from pick who I thought the ... who really put himself with a map I don't know if he would have even been drafted and they don't have that great scene about weight but it really opened my eyes were on the national football league getting really help himself\nThroughout the drip process but he he's in he's in an active so you'd have to do what you gotta start getting him number two apps and eventually get them number one there there are ways away from doing that\nSo I looked at the giants you saw two weeks ago that crushing loss or to the Panthers on the road game if they blow their mostly we're not there they were just not ready against the eagles and the ... of it uh the Superbowl champs put them away and put them away early\nAnd ... and here's the thing remember they cut they was whether it was the third round pick a couple of years ago so they didn't think he was the answer to this point if you're the giants\nYou're gonna have to draft that guy next year now Herbert the the argue quarterback cocker personnel people is by far the best available quarterback assuming he enters the draft and if ... if the team that has the first pick overall needs a quarterback right now guys that they would take him\nYou know what am I Want to talk about these two two and one teams there's of course the Vikings you got the browns or got Pittsburgh and a missing one more uh but there there are there is Green Bay\nSo out of these teams who was the team that you can say I this was a strange you know five games with them but they look good going the rest of the way\nWell that's a great way to ... to\nForm that question because some things have happened this year it I wasn't expecting 'cause I didn't expect the Vikings to struggle like they weren't out last week in Philly they were phenomenal cut costs it's probably\nOne of the best case for a quarterback I've ever see alive ... being at that game I was blown away with some of those that he's made and uh they're they're doing a great job of managing him he's having a great season so far by the way it's their defense it's surprisingly not played as well as we we thought\nThat the team of the group\nOf of the under achievers that I think will be better now the eagles are three and three they're going to win that he had a feast\nOr they get me out I think the Vikings ... the two to one team's so funny we are talking about that records like who would have believed\nAs much so it was a stranger and yeah it's\nCrazy I mean it's it's it's you know particular that these ties it's it's insane and the browns almost that two of them but the bottom line is I think the light of that group I think that's the one team of the two to one teams that writes itself it gets in the playoffs\nAdam Joplin with us out and we're going to get a look at the first start of the year for game is Winston tomorrow interested to see how that goes but in general where would you say the status stand in terms of Seamus as the long term\nThey're in Tampa Bay\nYeah I don't think that right now he could ... anyone could say that he definitely is because of the off the field concerns it has up at performance situation though I think at times it's been a consistent\nOr this to me is that for him I mean he's got to get 'em ... knowledge you have to stay out of trouble or know that could be no issues off the field he's got to play a really good football here all of the defense is better challenge that it did last year the defense is not play at the level that it needs to he doesn't have to run against poured it they're great at wide receiver off it was actually pretty good\nI think gave us tomorrow at Atlanta it starts there are many this is a game where the falcons effect to struggle mightily with other injuries this\nWas a game regime is has to get himself together here in the rye fitzpatrick they took the job from him in early joining the lose it but they want to go back to James let him get the job back up but to answer a question in the end I don't know that he's the franchise quarterback anymore I think he's got a proof of self and it starts tomorrow in Atlanta\nI Want to stay in the same division they had the Panthers no they're franchise quarterback and uh that is of course can do and his favorite receiver and target maybe ... how good are they are they under the radar as it's just what they simply do and how big is it going to be able to get ... back for this office\nYeah guys they play at the Redskins to march you must really offer they got blown out of it at all at once we saw that they got the they were embarrassed by that gave me would sit there would be bouncing back at home with Caroline is one of these teams they play good defense anywhere they got that portable game plan you know they're going to come in running the football with McCaffrey has shown that\nHe could handle high volume of cars which we didn't know he could come into the season was north charter um\nTherefore I don't remember the coming off there by a they got Curtis have all their outstanding young receiver they absolutely love they're they're actually deepened passive targets Greg also look really good I'm told a practice this week\nUh they just have to make a final decision there but it looks like he's going to play barring a step back\nUm and we don't play this is definitely the next week give us a barn set back remember he report the same for the book last year and it grabs a guy that's got a great future and TV I remember when I was an ESPN with him\nWatching him work this guy is their their suppliers who who come off the field of go into the booth that's one guy Greg Olson the path or study and who absolutely will be able to do it\nOut I'm real quick thing is you are you made reference earlier to who could have seen all these ties coming and I'm thinking now that I've watched that ten minute clock in the overtime we should've known like there have been a bunch of other games that were really close and we're going to keep seeing that
