that you feel the same way that any of us would do anything in our power to prevent this kind of a master from happening to help anyone who was\nCaught in such a horrific circumstances and now we do what we can with in some cases direct aid and assistance but also just just prayer and uh and words of support and everything else that we can do\nFor the Jewish community in this country and yet it immediately turns into a political issue\nAnd without a moment self reflection without taking just to be sure let the American people more than they make this about Trump these people who do this\nEvery day on every issue at all times are are sick they have a problem they really do there are no longer capable of being objective\nYou know last week we were told that\nWas a bomber who Trump is responsible for because this guy who had already called it a bomb threat you know over it\nA decade before Trump's presidential run in ... a career criminal clearly you know psychological problems\nBut Trump's responsible because he criticized as people in the political arena and those are the people that were being targeted\nThey can't point to Trump ever ... ever inciting or or calling for violence against any of those individuals but they say that Trump is basically responsible did they use these kind of weasel words they'll say oh well he's he bears some share of the blame and you know 'cause they know the Trump didn't\nPack the bombs himself you know Trump wasn't wasn't crushing a glass to use the shrapnel for they're not that crazy I suppose they're not that stupid but they'll say that Trump was the reason for this in some way\nAnd what the point you as well he had his van this guy had this van say oc covered in Trump's stickers covered in all this pro mug up paraphernalia and so we had to deal with this last week we talked about on the show now here we are over the weekend there's this terrible shooting on on Saturday on on the Jewish Sabbath\nAnd we are\nTold that even though this shooter it is clear did not like Trump because specifically Trump was too friendly and too favorable and too much of a friend to the Jews\nIt still Trump's fault now\nIf we take this theory at face value this theory that Trump has just raised hate in America\nLet's be clear that that means that not Trump is responsible no matter who in gauges it a hate crime against anyone else\nYou know if there is an anti Christian an anti Catholic you know hate crime in this country let's say you know be ... or ... you know if there's if there's an Islamist extremists let's just put it this is a jihadist kills a bunch of people in his that Trump's fault\nI Want to know where the lines are drawn here and I think the answer by the way they would claim it's Trump's wall because you see somebody from the Islamic community if they were radicalized it would be because of Trump's anti Muslim rhetoric so he would bear some of the share of responsibility for that too\nIf they you know neo Nazi white nationalist kill somebody somewhere at Trump's fault because he has implicitly encourage them they'll say\nIf a anti Semite who is anti Trump you know you get on this list doesn't matter who does Trump is always responsible\n\nNo matter what the situation if it's a terrible circumstance if there is violence and bloodshed here in America and there's there's hate and there's venom and there's nastiness\nAt it's at the root of it all eat is Trump's fault they say this is delusional\nAnd it's really destructive to how can you have a conversation with somebody about Trump's policies when they really believe that he's dog whistling to white supremacist all the time in ways that\nI Can't even begin to fathom I\nI I'm paying attention to politics all day I'm hearing the swamp I this is I live eat and brief politics and national security and I have no idea what some of these other pundits and and ... and such you're talking about sometimes no I'm like what are they what it will play something for you later you'll here's what is that even me\nWho are these idiots\nWho's paying so much to be so stupid on TV all the time and so they they talk about division as they are creating divisions I mean this is how you know that the left cannot be taken seriously on this\nThey will try to escalate rhetoric\nWhile saying the rest of rhetoric needs to be de escalated they'll say the reason we have terrorism and hate in this country is because of Donald Trump so Donald Trump needs to stop saying that the other side is bad\nOh\nThat seems like a brilliant idea for Trump why not just caved your political opponents\nLet them beach you into submission bludgeon\nYou into silence on issues that matter to you by attaching all these issues all these\nProblems all this violence is nothing to do with their calling President Trump an anti Semite I mean President Trump grew up in New York City he's served as did I which is a city that has\nI Believe the largest Jewish population anywhere outside of Israel in the world Trump is is has had countless friends who are Jewish his personal lawyer Michael Cohen I Know they've had a falling out but you know he was Jewish son in law's Jewish bonkers converted to Judaism is grandkids are Trump is not an anti Semite\nNot even a little bit not even close but they say this the\nMedia says they pat themselves in the back oh that's right yeah we're speaking truth to power know you're a punch of destructive little ... that are saying this\nIt's immoral to make these claims it's immoral to call someone an anti Semite was blood on his hands because somebody else who hates the president who justify this his position for Jews\nDecides to be violent engages in his in his replicate crime and he's now facing the death penalty and good this guy should get the death penalty for what he he did and that's in a guy trying to track attached drawn to this though it's\nJust so intellectually dishonest it show unfair\nAnd it just goes to show you that there is there was no effort in good faith there's no let's have a real you know last week was all okay let's let's tone things down let's have a different a different kind of conversation going for let's talk about policy let's come together as Americans All right you know the press is under assault by the press drives I I agree with Trump\nAnd that the press does drive a lot of this\nBecause the press is full of a bunch of preening\nSelf obsessed self righteous jerks\nNot all of them obviously and I know ... book you're in the media the I'm telling you what Ninety percent of the media is like\nThey are not good people\nThey're not honest or not ethical it's all about the self it's all about the agenda they are activists posing as truth tellers eighties destroying this country from the inside they're the ones undermining institutions they're the ones undermining public trust\nAnd they turn around and accused everybody else of exactly that they tell you that Trump won't take responsibility they take responsibility for nothing\nWrong story after wrong story all critical of Trump oh that's just a coincidence as if we're idiots we're really supposed to believe that yeah sure it's just a coincidence\n\nThey are disgraceful and they were tearing this country apart and I have to say that it's very frustrating as well because if the if we were able to focus on what's really happening in America and that in the direction of the country right now and how we're all doing\nThis country is doing very well this country is on the right path\nBut the left can't make a fair argument about why it's not so what do they do they make it about a motion to make it about anger and viciousness\nAnd destructive politics and lots and that's what they're doing that's what the name of the president and we're going to continue to see this unfortunate where we're going to talk about the caravan coming up got some big updates on that for you as well as\nUm some more following the last week with a bomber and and we we got a a whole bunch of show planting so stay right there I'll be right back [noise]\n\nWith all the

certainly people on the fringes of American Life but it is telling them that what you're doing is okay and that's why yes there are always been a anti Semitic incidents in American history\nNationalism goes hand in hand with anti Semitism that's higher idea of anti Semitism is to put ... outside the body politic outside the death of ... of ... and that's what Donald Trump does that his team that's what his party is now committed to doing\nA limitation is rhetoric and the president has not been dabbling in elimination his rhetoric at some point he doesn't dog whistle teams as megaphones to tell these tribes that they belong to him and this is waiting to violence directly\nDirectly leading to violence they say it is not\nSomewhat or partially Trump's fault I mean I saw a a an editorial about this over the weekend in the Washington Post no less saying that uh\nIt is directly somewhat you know that ... they'll always put his paw fire its Trump's fall to the extent\nYou know or you know Trump Trump shit old some some level of of the blame here uh this is this is disgusting it's disgraceful what when you have the\nIndividuals in the media who have taken Trump's entire presidency so personally as an affront to their greatness and their values and how wonderful they are are there are no limits really on the bio but they will throw at this present there\nNo there's no good faith there's no decency whatsoever that they will extend to him an angel supporters to all of us remember it's not just about Trump underneath all of this there's always this evening hatred of the Trump voter to\nA that's a part of the anti Trump movement they despise the voters they don't cause they don't think that really we've been fooled they have figured out enough now I Believe the left is in the media and the Democrat Party I figured out that we've made this bargaining weren't good with it were like yeah I like Trump I I Know he's not perfect I Know we make mistakes\nBut I think Trump is actually the right choice for America right now so they hate us because of all that\nAnd that's why they feel completely justified in saying just the most despicable disgusting things I mean here's here's a another Washington Post personal over at MSNBC play three\nThere's always been the old right or its equivalent the difference is it was always\nOn the French and the mainstream elements of the party and certainly the president's ah never validated this ah what's happening what's so extremely dangerous about this is you now have the man with the largest megaphone in the world\nGiving a nod in a way sometimes outright praise or to the folks who are carrying on these conspiracy theories edited is telling them these people that\nIt's okay that they're getting a a blessing to do this you know it's\nIt's interesting that that he can go on TV that Dana Milbank Washington Post and say that Trump gives them a blessing right after he is explicitly openly repeatedly condemn this\nBut you see this is one of the games that they play they'll say why doesn't Trump ... why does in Trump's condemn white nationalist\nAnd people will say okay well he did he just condemned them a couple of days ago well well he hasn't announced it enough and then people will do a little Google surgery and I will say well we're on a second Trump is called white nationalist losers he said there's no place in America for hate he said this many many times then they'll say well why does Trump talk about white nationalist so\nMuch you can't win folks you you know there's nothing he can do that will make them stop calling him a racist stop calling him a white nationalist they they do not extend the most basic level of\nGood faith to him in any of these discussions and and they love to try it out these these fake conservatism is fake Republicans like Jennifer Reuben who's the she is the queen of fake Republicans the Washington Post still list or as a Republican when she writes thing which is just amazing but you know she she blames Trump not just for what\nHappened over the weekend what happened last week but for the overall increasing hate in America she says like the poor\nAnd I've got a ... gallon ... high in fat I Love faith and we've had at fifty seven percent tax and the last hair and anti snack hate crimes\nFor the biggest ... theme and anti Semitism is that here's our outsiders they are Atlanta they need to find a nation by\nI Would say to them [noise] you are the ones who are out of step with our society [noise]\nYou are the ones who willfully violate the meaning of a dream that as America [noise] and this country because of what it stands for\nWill not stand for your time to [noise]\n\nThe greatest president in my lifetime with the possible exception of Donald Trump will see how it how it goes we'll see how many years in office he has hopefully eight and we'll see what\nThe full measure of his accomplishes look Reagan defeated Soviet Union and probably save the planet from annihilation so that that's a ... that's a tough one to that's a tough one to be that's a tough record to\nCompare against but Trump so far is doing a pretty remarkable job in his own way but I play that for your just because I I think that it is helpful for all of us in fact I I Would argue that it is necessary for all of us to remind each other and those of us who are conservatives\nThat as our movements and our ideology our belief system our principles\nAre rooted in a respect for the individual individual rights human dignity human life liberty that's that is the foundation of our of our belief system that we're all star\nAnd so true anti Semitism and drew racism and I say that with a qualifier true because we know the left calls everything I Do some calls everything racist I mean they're they use it as a political cultural\nOr true anti Semitism and racism and a ... and bigotry is not just non conservative eighties anti set a goal to conservatism\nBecause if we are not all God's creation in doubt by our creator with the ... rights and if we're not all equal in the eyes of God and in the eyes of the law then there was no such thing really us conservatism and conservatism as we know it in this country does not exist\nIt it is not possible to be a conservative\nAnd believe that a white person or any any black person or a black person than a Hispanic person and a white person at that that they do not all have equal dignity equal rights equal worse as human beings and as citizens of this great nation\nSo when the last try so hard to create this perception that people who are conservative I I Can't speak to the right I mean the right\nIt would mean meaning all of it I was at its peak the write in general terms but you know there are some fringe elements of the right that you that that day 'cause of themselves and the right and you'd say well hold on a second in what meaningful way are they conservatives though you know this is where you start to really get into what is right wing or left wing even mean\nYou know if you are more in favor of individual rights if you were about the individual instead of the collective right the left in this country is all about the collective and there are about collective guilt collective identity collective economics they are collective is\nThey believe in groups they believe in\nThe common good as defined by a core of elites\nThat all speak in the language of equality in commonality but leaves as elites in separate from the masses but use the envy and antagonism of the masses in order to beat the other side politically which would be us\nWe are the individual is we are the individual rights we are\nAll God's creation we're all human beings in this struggle together and should help each other and respect each other at each other's rights and dignity and life and that has an obligation on all of us um when when they try to\nMake this case that racism and anti Semitism and these different ... and bigotry exist on the right I just I have a\nA real feeling of uh of outrage at that because they show on true and so unfair and I think that the reason they push it so it's not just because it works it's dirty politics but it is useful for them\nA it is a shame that so many of the\nClasses that the Democrats view as victims whether it's just the working poor or African Americans or a or Hispanics Latinos women whatever the group maybe it's a shame that so many of them have been propagandize to such that they they really believe that I Know this from talking to them they really believe that conservatives\nAre racist they believe that\nAnd you and I said you knowing that that is a lot it's not true we're not racist in fact we're the ones that are always advocating for people of all races to be treated equally under the law is the left\nThat advocates for disparate treatment in the eyes of the law based upon race based upon skin color based upon not even real but perceived gender they're the ones that want these differentiation and then they turn around and say that we're the ones who are obsessed with\nWith race and gender and these other differences among among human beings\nAre when at the end of the day I I think it couldn't be any more clear that our side the side of conservatives unconstitutional is are the ones that advocate for individual rights and the dignity of all people and\nThere has always been this effort to rewrite the histories of the ... the two parties this is why Democrats you get so there I said triggered when you just brought up that they are the part of the Democrats are the part or a party of slavery segregation Jim Crow just go down the list it was it was historically always the Democrats\nDemocrats have been and are the party of the mob mob mentality the mob feeling how does the mass feel how does the masses view an issue what did they demand what did they show what where's their rage direct that has been\nThe aid that has been at the core of the Democratic party there's always been an intellectual straining conservatism that has been first and foremost about the American founding in the constitution and\nThe rights of each and every individual and the natural law that underpins all of this but it's not really just about what the founding fathers said at the founding fathers were able to harness a sense of what is a universal and eternal truths about human beings\nWhat is always true about people what is always good for society to promote and what does always necessary for society to try and prevent it to condemn those universal truths are at the heart of conservatism\nAnd so it's just [noise] it is the fact opposite of a true conservative to believe the first thing is less than because of their skin color is a person is less than because of gender less then because of religious [noise] that is not who we are [noise]\nAnd I know that you

least have fidelity to the law\nWhere were you honor requests from Donald Trump's ice agents they if they provided the pain or requests will you honor it is governor or you work with Donald Trump proceed with your time\nThey won't answer them Jake that's important because that's what happens when somebody of Germany but I'm probably the curator I work with law enforcement when they're in the system they are convicted maybe they start ten years\nWhen it comes time to come out there is it the pain or requests from ice you either turn him over to ice or release them into the community that the only two options Andrew will not answer the question that failed her me let me would be willing to release center like new\nHe won't answer the question that was Gillum and dissent is a dissent is was the one who is pushing them on that issue\nBoth candidates for ah ah for the governor of Florida\nAnd and trying to trying to get that last push here as we get very close and people are going to look at Florida they're going to say there is a bellwether state this tells you a lot about the direction of the country for the midterm election they're going to say that this is you know really\nUh depends if the Democrats win it if you and wins who is the uh mayor of Tallahassee\nAnother person who I don't think they're going to run him and twenty twenty but they see him in a young a charismatic Obama ask mole so a lot of Democrats very excited about\nAbout Gillum and it was a ... a socialist I mean he's pretty he's pretty open about he wants single payer he wants to raise taxes will be will say that\nAsk them how do you pay for this a bunch of things and you know we'll find some ways but just that this was pushing them here on the issue of ice detained requests and noticed have Gillum would not answer\nBecause what this really is is a question about sanctuary city policies sanctuary cities do nots and now there's some variations year depending on which jurisdiction of the ... century city as a as a general rule do not\nAdhered to or do not on her\nEyes to ... what that means is when someone is already in custody of law enforcement and immigration and Customs Enforcement is informed that that person is in custody day Sunday detain request if they want that person to be turned over to them for the purposes of deportation\nThey\nRefuse sanctuary city jurisdictions refused to do that and what to send his nose and he had been a prosecutor is it that means that there are people who are a danger to the community who are convicted criminals people who have served sentences including sometimes are violent crimes\nAnd local jurisdictions because of the politics around illegals and because of the pandering to generally the Latino community by Democrats\nJurisdictions will not honor these chain of requests which means that people who are criminals and illegal aliens get released back out into the general population and can become repeat offenders\nAnd this is really a question of do you believe\nThat law enforcement should work together you know I cannot think of another issue where if the FBI requested uh for example the FBI requested help from a sheriff or local law enforcement they wouldn't just knock it help they will be shown will we refused to help you as a matter of policy\nRight and people realized that there's a lot of crossover there's a lot of ways unfortunately but it is true that even local crimes can get tangled up and the federal Web\nAnd so there are ... and just the FBI is viewed as illegitimate law enforcement body by most folks and so there's a lot of cooperation between those reading I here here's a verb example I work in the NYPD and told his division I would sit in a city with seeded with pardon me a\nSit in with an FBI agents DEA ... ah people from all these different federal immigrations and Customs Enforcement all these different agencies were all singing to gather because stuffed them come on my radar would also be on their radar and we work together as a fusion center that's what I was doing that's my ... and of course also it\nOn the federal counterterrorism side in particular\nBut winter center there's a lot of crossover law enforcement will somebody who is a drug dealer who's also illegal alien is causing problems for the law in multiple ways and one law enforcement agencies should support the other law enforcement agencies legitimate law enforcement functions\nWhat Gillum is telling you without telling you is that he prefers lawlessness because it is politically advantageous\nHe won't say it but dissent is was right to push him on this one and this then goes to a a refrain that you heard a lot from the left and I really hope becomes a huge problem for them in the in the midterms which is remember when\nAll about how he's going to be Ted Cruz when now that just laughable but there's another race that maybe deserves a second look here at least for what it tells us about the Democratic party if not what it tells us about the\nPossibility of this race going for the Republicans Kim Strasser will join just not talking about what's going on in New Jersey she's a peace up on the wall Street Journal where she is on the editorial board\nSmiling at corruption Democrats tried to save Bob Mendez months after his bipartisan as admonished bitch a Kim great to have you back it's great to be here\nAll right what's going on in in the Garden State which I always feel a certain love hate relationship for the New Yorker what's going on up there\n[noise] [noise] yeah well as you said you know what's notable here is that ... the entire media is felt obsessing over Texas where those numbers look Ted Cruz's it's not like pulling away from work and the races even within a smaller margin of error and in New Jersey where a Democrat Bob Menendez wet\nYou mentioned um he was censored by his colleague rather modest by his colleague back earlier this year I'm after she had been found to have accepted also get from a man who is now convicted felon who ran one of the biggest Medicare fraud on the government an all time\nI'm not only was he accepting a lot of gifts from this guy and not acknowledging that under Senate Ethics rules but he was working on behalf of the guy to help them with his business interests in Washington including gone so far it's a lot of health and Human Services secretary on his bat\nSo um he he was actually indicted for this uh the the FBI ultimately I'm Sorry the department of justice ultimately dropped the charges after the Supreme Court\nThat changed the standard um on what it would take to convict him but he wasn't honest and he's now facing a very tough race against Bob you get in the Republican businessman who's been highlighting this and it it's really driving a favor\nHow did you say there is a a deafening silence Kim\nFrom so many of the au Jared Kushner must have some shady relationship with Saudi Arabia I hear this people to be able to Tom and I said okay well what is it and then there's there's nothing there's all these whispers of corruption around Trump meanwhile Menendez who\nWhether people want to just parse out the legality of what he did or not what he did was gross and the guy he was associated with even grosser and there does open a Bush has got to go on for the Democrats\nYeah many Democrats are actually out there running a campaign focused on so called Republican corruption Nancy Pelosi that are actually handed out to her members a toolkit\nA talking point how they ultimately go after Republican corruption Trump and all sorts and butter issues none of which as you said there was any real evidence for\nBut in the meantime they just close their eyes in some cases actually are outright helping I mean look the Democrat that's why I call the called smiling corruption\nAt the biggest superPAC out their majorities superPAC helping Senate Democrats just decided to reroute million dollars to help Bob and that does in his race on night they're taking away from even more important races for them or whether they're trying to unseat\nOn and places where Trump one I'm ... so much trouble in essence this is the Democratic party say hey you know what we're OK with corruption I guess they're all trail of evidence that very clear in fact the Senate is on record saying that he engaged in corruption but\nWe're still going to do everything we can return to office\nYeah and I have to say that there are two areas where I see a tremendous or boxing loving and one of them is on this or is on the notion of corruption as much as you pointed out is is a talking point against the Republicans but you have so many Democrats you start thinking of all the Democrats that have gone to prison and just in the last\nFour or five years for incredibly obvious a very shady corruption and that never gets brought up in any of this discussion as I said there's always this big old Trump most you know someone started telling me about the Mali months calls get them you know that that tends to be what I hear about a\n... but also on on the notion of mobs I I have to say I am I have been surprised and I take it very dim view of much of the of the journalists class which I Know technically you definitely are journalists on something else but I'm pretty close to journal led\nA but most journalists I think act in a way that is really surprising to me but on the mobs Kim I'm seeing a lot of people would say you know they have no other they have no other way to make their case and these are people that write for the Washington Post\nIt's it's crazy looking absolutely unacceptable okay the whole reason we have\nCivil society we have to pay it so that we don't have mob rule just because you're citing election just because your person didn't get in office or just because you lost your Supreme Court nomination\nThere definitely nothing written in any formal or informal rules at our society that give you the right to shape Mitch McConnell or Ted Cruz added ... hound them at a restaurant\nUm ... ... ... per se I say why he have a ballot box and elections and anybody who's out there whether it's on CNN I've seen a couple on there and well I Am not a ma and be they're just saying what they think\nWe all know that's not true I'm saying what you think is when you write an op ed or a letter to a newspaper um or you go to vote\nBut you know harassing people on the street is not and that's the best and then conservatives should actually feel pretty good that they're winning on the policy merits\nNow I Know that it's it's really tight and so to to ask you to make a prediction and who really knows but just in in a minute or so we have less you're Kim how to eat where what's the main dynamic you see right now in the house race that's going to determine whether it ends up being the Republicans the Democrats win the day\nBut I think the most important thing which is why hearing what mainstream media is how different it is today than it was just three weeks ago okay we can already saying complete definite proof\nThat the Democrats blown it to a certain extent a they were talking about a wave three weeks ago they messed up with Kavanaugh it's not going to be a way I think it's going to come down by the one way or the other right on whoever does win and going to have a huge majority but I think Republicans are still and\nAll right give us rascal everybody on the wall Street Journal check out her columns also her book the intimidation game Jim always appreciate you make the time for us come back soon\nAnd\nYeah I I think he was spot on there with the it's gonna be five seats it's going to be such a narrow margin I I don't think that we're going to know we're certainly not going to know who controls the house by the time I'm although you should listen for all of the show election I obviously but we're not going to know who control the house I think I'm by\nThe time this show is is over um I think it's going to stretch well I guess the polls closed around age there's no way we would know okay yeah this is not even close but we might not even know till I don't know maybe the next morning it's going to just going to be drawn out\nAnd it's going to be very very tight which goes to tell you you know they've been telling us the Trump is a fascist and destroying America\nAnd now they're praying and hoping that they can not have a blue wave but a little blue ripple a little bit [noise]\nIt's crazy right now you got the left freaking out chases people at a restaurant screaming at little old ladies and\nAnybody that shows up at a Trump rally in words demographer hat you've got all kinds of nonsense going

C. and they really think that there's actual they don't want anyone to tell them otherwise\nThe initiative and she always I always get the sense from all these journalists that this is the only profession they could ever even consider having you know that that the notion of showing up to a job and just doing something else to them once they once they tasted a certain level of success in journalism is just oh it's horrifying to them\nWork with the sleeves again oh no many of them have never done that by the way\nThey go right out of right out of school right into some J. program somewhere and that's that's the pathway anyway\nUh this is just idiocy though from roads\nAnd then you have this whole conspiracy theory about pushing her and ... where they could get cushion the Saudis are very important strategic player in the middle east right now that's a fact\nWe don't get to ignore that the fact\nNew administration no administration has ever stood up to the Saudis in a meaningful way for running one of the crappy as countries on earth despite all of its oil wealth\nNo administration no president including Obama who's battling literally vowing to the Saudis okay so everyone needs to just blow their role and chill out on this\nStopped making this about cheap partisan points against Trump that's all they want to do I don't care about this guy to show the they have a little more solidarity with them they would otherwise because he was not even sure he's a columnist\nThe guy was an as an opinion writer for now I'm not saying that means that you know anything as it happened to him but the way they're talking about him it's like he's ... you know he he is one of them meanwhile as anybody ever writes that opinion column anywhere somebody that now get special treatment\nIn terms of the media's view of them I can tell you this much if it were a conservative who had been attacked I mean ... an American conservative Lebanon attacked somewhere else in the world you hear a lot less\nAbout this just the fact it is just they if if it was someone who are critical of fundamentalist Islam and that was the primary attack that Islam in Saudi Arabia is a destructive oppressive tyrannical force and the Saudis took that guy out that say well\nYou know there's a lot of Islamophobia going on there I mean you know they shouldn't they shouldn't have murdered him but you know there's a lot of Islamophobia meanwhile if you've been bring up the coast Yogi was and this is a fact and Islamist meaning he believed in political Islam and was very friendly and cozy with the Muslim Brotherhood\nIt's like you're trampling on the man's great that's that's just telling the truth he wasn't Islamist nobody he wouldn't\nDeny disappear alive nobody denies it doesn't mean you should have been brutally murdered oh I I almost left out that he\nAlso a ... they dress the somewhat up as a body double in his clothing after they killed him to try to create footage of him leaving so that was the plan they they were going to try to and they must not have known that the fiance was outside\nBecause they were going to try and say that he left in the day had no knowledge and ... they were going to disappear and that was the plan to disappear him and they are just really really dumb about it\nAnd let me give you a little bit of in jail\nAgency inside here in terms of what I what I learned when I was in the CIA about how foreign intelligence often operates this is a little bit of an inside baseball for you to like that kind of thing\nThere are a lot of countries that are very effective their services are very effective at surveillance and at a certain you know the regime's security issues that that's generally what most intelligence agencies are\nTheir primary concern is right regime and keeping the people in power in power and stopping any threats against them most countries aren't really worried about foreign invasion most countries are worried about toppling from from the inside\nUm and they get very adapted dealing\nWith that threat but they also often operate in places where they can be really ham fisted I guess that's kind of the wrong term for Saudi Arabia but you know what I mean they can be clumsy and sloppy and get away with it\nAnd that's what I think happened here the Saudis the Saudi intelligence services the Saudi police state can be selfish in Saudi Arabia and can be thug issue in other Middle Eastern countries where they have a lot of sway\nCan't really be self sufficient turkey and that may have been miscalculation here they thought that they\nCould get away with this and they're not used to operating on foreign soil where there's also a very by the way sluggish intelligence apparatus apparatus that is at work so a lot of intrigue here we'll be right back\nThere's been a change in the last few months people have started to realize that social media platforms are not a

that is a\nKind of public service announcement from Amnesty International which is an organization that apparently has a lot of time on a chance and Amnesty International thinks that people need to be told via fairy tale that there should be no uh no kissing women who are asleep\nThis guy also this this it's a cartoon we played the audio from it he kinda like reaches like he's going to do a little group group thing a while this woman's passed out and you know this follows last week when you had Christian Bale who is a celebrity a talent or does not\nTo me as very bright shouldn't have a fine actors I guess I don't know she kind of plays at a you know attractive youngest blonde female or I don't I've never seen a really extend herself the man who cares I'm not a thespian critic\nOr a critic of the attack\nA but she said that she's worried about what will happen to young women that see or people in general including her daughter I think she said with a fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty who was ... to wake her up from her dream because that there was a violation of could send that goes on there now I put it out to you last week that\nThe the point is really not that there's a consent issue because they were talking about it which who has a magic apples and somebody's in a coma from eating the apple and it is a it is a fairy tale\nAnd really the only way for her to be awoken which is the the storyline is by a print to kiss her she saved her life like kissing her show it's really almost like he's performing mouth to mouth resuscitation I Would say and\nTherefore he does have consent if we're going to take it to this weird place where we're talking about this because if somebody is choking and you give the mouth to mouth resuscitation you don't have to say hey can you can you verbalize that your choking and I'm going to give you or you know or they're ... they're hard to stop and choking as the Heimlich hard to stop you get the idea\nAh some out the mouth resuscitation you know in in a fairy tale is really we're talking about here but they ran with this\nThey didn't stop they weren't they weren't it wasn't enough for them to just say I have an actress say that because there was another one I forget who another actress came out oh I'm worried about fairy tales and the patriarchy so they're they're destroying centuries old stories\nThat is instill very basic one creative sensibility and young people but also have some basic morality and sales of good and evil and then they're fairy tales they're meant for amusement I promise you I don't know a single guy who in college age was like well\nBecause the handsome prince getting his the girl in a coma or I can kissed this girl in real life you're like no one would ever think that nobody no human being has ever ever ever thought that\nSo this was a problem that did not exist but now they've gone even further with it and you know in that video I don't want to play it again for you 'cause you're already heard it but you know there's some very dirt first of all there's a curse and there's some\n... and they make it very clear that there are some are kind of crude sexual humor in there as well and referring to the initials that he uses and everything and he's clearly supposed to be in a title frat bro the prints I mean there's there's all the the patriarchy left wing stuff is there\nBut you know this is what the what the left doesn't yet grass is that they lose on this stuff they lose on these cultural issues where they are acting like maniacs\nUm and and this brings me to not just this battle over fairy tales and consent\nBut this whole this whole story that broke today about how Trump is are taking is telling the audio Jane now um that they should do this this is the story line at

employee at treasury financial crimes enforcement network was arrested and charged with disclosing banks suspicious activity reports tied Jew\nWho wants to guess what investigation who wants to guess the Russia investigation what a shock\nSo here's somebody who is a government employee who thought you know what I'll do to try to jam up somebody in Trump's orbit I've read today that they think it was about Michael Cohen's finances they had the wrong Michael Cohen though there's more than one\nA and released this information to it is believed buzzfeed news\nAnd bust be of course then there's this whole story now that's not confirmed yet but that is what I've read they think happens here\nI'm so quote the criminal complaint against ms Edwards alleged that she leaked materials that led to about a dozen articles\nIn twenty Seventeen and twenty Eighteen pertaining to among other people in matters Paul Manafort Richard Gates Maria Butina the Russian ambassador in Washington and a unit of

twelve articles cited in the complaint\nSo here is a woman who is taking\nFinancial remember these are folks this is not reports about crimes they just they see a suspicious activity reports this is the equivalent of releasing raw FBI background investigation and then using it for a report oh you mean the kind of like the stuff you might get for the ...\nBut this is highly confidential legally protected for good reason because you can destroy someone's business with this oh yeah you're so and so it's got a few a few suspicious financial transactions you know what that means nothing\nIt means the government flags it and then they might look into it a little bit it does not mean that anyone has broken the law in fact the vast majority of them do not involve law breaking but here's somebody who\nForty year old woman thought that she would leak this information\nThe press to hurt Trump and his associates that she would break her oath that you would violate the law and ruined her career and now now probably her life along with it because it was just as that important to try to get Trump\nDo you remember anybody during the Obama years from the federal government who was ... it explicitly to go after Obama and hurt Obama do you remember anyone\nWho was leaking classified information or sensitive information about individuals and businesses right this is stuff since ... on on anybody\nThis isn't even intelligence world stuff is there there could be a suspicious financial transaction just because you put a thousand dollars in cash and the bank you know maybe you ought to banks sale\nThat's why they keep this stuff so close hold that's also why the IRS actually tries to protect people's information\nBecause they understand that if ... if it gets out there it can do a lot of damage that people's reputations will be harmed\nBy this so you have to wonder how many other\nFederal government employees were willing to break the law and share information with the left wing press to embarrass the administration was there was ... from what I understand\nThere was nothing in any of this that tied to Trump was just people around him understand this though it sends a message sense it very\nClear message if you worked for Trump if you work with Trump you could be the subject of this kind of government activism somebody within the bowels of the bureaucracy with high level sensitive access could decide to release information about you too\nI'm not saying it will happen to you but now it's something you have to think about isn't it\nIt's not just people that worked for Trump how vocal you're going to be in your support for Trump how willing argue to stand up publicly and say this and then what is the cost that you would encourage you'd be willing to incur\nIn

humongous show gates secretary of state Mike Pompeo saying simply investigation should be allowed to proceed\nSo do the Saudis a bunch of thugs yeah of course the Saudis are bad news or there's no there's no good guys in that whole spat between the Saudis and the Turks and what's going on there's there's nobody that we can look at and say oh we can trust their word on this one now we've got to verify\nBut this idea that because Trump calls Jim Acosta clown which I Would note that oh you know Obama used the trash Fox News ... network that provided anything of a voice of opposition at all\nObama used the trash Fox News on a on a on a regular basis and no one said anything about it really was the one network that stood against it and you know that they're saying that because Trump is critical of the press because he expresses his opinion about uh media apparatus that is entirely against it\nBecause of that I'm\n... years somehow complicit in the murder of his journalist journalists have been oppressed\nAnd detained and murdered in foreign countries for as long as they're journalists isn't new\nBut this is all the anything bad that happens in the world is Trump's fall to the left anything bad happens anywhere in the world of any consequences you can say it's Trump's fault if their sexism somewhere it's comfortable it there's racism somewhere at Trump's fault ... whatever it took ... dictators desperate stressful\nThey get past the fact that as I said to you yesterday Obama's inaction and did the ring and cowardice as commander in chief contributed to a half a million people just chewed up in the meat grinder that was the Syrian civil war horrific violence\nAnd you know Obama was is nowhere to be seen in terms of leadership nothing if anybody made the situation worse made sure that there were arms that got into the hands of the hottest I mean that's what happened\nSo we're we're going to hear from the people that are okay with that about how Trump isn't able to do this but it's just so typical isn't it it's just so standard operating procedure from the left and I got I\nGot to ask Dr Gorka today Sebastian Gorka was on was on rising demand got to ask them and say you know\nHold on a second um what do you say doctor gee I'd like to um to jeeze good guy\nWhen he's not going to feed the people that are always talking about Trump Brazil cozy with dictators you just look at the actions look at what he does I mean you know Trump has his way of trying to immigration him so he's trying to do his own high level diplomacy with these foreign heads of state\nAnd this whole standard that they set up is nonsense the standard that you know Trump path to talk or you know super aggressively to everybody and he needs to hold to the calendar is just nonsense this is complete and utter nonsense\nBut this is what they pretend is the new standard under Trump that he that he should go into meetings uprooting that Kim Jong un these others and essentially spit in their faces and anything short of that show that he's a coward anything short of that shows that he's a bad guy\nOr you know they're they're not operating in good faith and I think that's really essential\nWe can't lose sight of that they they're not criticizing the president because they really want to do something differently it's all just an excuse for Trump rage that\nHey Trump that's what this is whether it's foreign policy the economy immigration every criticism of Trump from the less now is infused with this anti Trump rage\nOh you know they are really they cause

about the enthusiasm the blue wave but I think we have tremendous centers yeah\nI Do think we have a lot of enthusiasm\nAnd I spoke to Donald Trump junior yesterday and sure enough he uh he is I could tell very optimistic about how it's looking for the Republicans going into the midterms you know I think that he's I'm really feeling it when he's going out there and meeting with all these different people on the campaign trail [noise]\nBut you know the this is going to be very close it's going to be very very tight indeed and there was one thing that Trump brought up in that same interview a I think it was not same interview that that is really got me\nA concern and it has to do with what happens if the economy takes a nosedive and if if if it's\nCyclical I don't think that's going to necessarily be on Trump play a clip six\nOr anything in this country or say oh there's ... there's no inflation is very low um hey Powell my thing\nIs that because the fed is ranging range just too fast and it's independent so I don't speak to him out I'm not happy with what he's doing because\nTotally too fast because he looked at the last inflation numbers are very\nLow this is going to result in some painful stuff going forward ah this is going to be an issue\nAnd I say this there were people that were writing books right after the crash in two thousand nine saying things like you know this time is a this time is different or how this is a unique and uniquely dangerous moment in our economic history and and there was a there was a real clarity around\nWe're in uncharted territory here starting in two thousand or ... or so\nAnd I think we've been a little complacent for a while now even with the debt Twenty one trillion dollars we've reached this point where there's all this prosperity Trump is cutting regulations cut taxes so much good stuff is happening\nAround the country and sure enough I'm what I think we're starting to see now is an understanding that there is going to be some rough water and that's a very gentle way I think\nOf saying it as a result of unraveling all this all this money we put out in the system all this chewy and these things that have been done last ten years\nTo keep the economy going to try and and do you know Keynesian stimulus and you know you have people like Krugman who are saying oh this stimulus isn't enough right that was the problem them but we spent all this money\nAnd you have an enormous or a series of enormous debt bubbles a student loan debt trillion dollars credit card debt trillion dollars auto loans especially subprime auto loans\nVery very high uh we're more indebted now that when we were at the time of crisis in many ways and you know deeper or deeper in debt and we are deeper in debt when it comes to national debt and we haven't really fixed any of this stuff structurally now\nBe impossible for Trump to fix it right away but here's my concern that I'm not I cannot do economic prognostications I really can't right that's not something that is in my daily way political stuff maybe national security stuff shore but\nHere's where I see there being an issue right now and ... and that's your cue John and uh all these other groups out there these far left wackos\nAre considered very fringe will you'll notice that the the media apparatus in general is very slow to condemn them and generally uh does not seek to um\nYou know talk about them any more than they have to and I think it's because they do have a certain ideological solidarity with the right they maybe they don't agree with all of what ... does all of its rhetoric but they like that they view themselves as resistance to Trump bright they like it they view themselves as a opposite oppositional\nAnd willing to take action about all this\nAnd with that\nUh I I think we have to remember that they could very quickly become a much bigger part of the political conversation if this is the ... this is what worries me if we have a major economic\nA reset right if the debt turns into a crisis if all of a sudden we we get to the point where the rising interest rates means that we're paying more and more money just because of the money we've already spent like that interest payments on the debt struck a crowd out the private sector and the and the rest of our economy", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "year": "2018",

thirty thousand oh my gosh he's like a tell all the ... he's a monster\nWell hold on a second we're already taking in a million a year are we allowed to discuss that number changing the kind of number only go in one direction can only get larger\nThis is also why yes we do need a wall because it's not realistic to expect the president's gonna keep having first of all we have a Democrat president going to do anything and if we have Trump even in office for if we're lucky the next six years\nTo try and stem the tide of recurrent migrant marches to the border is just not realistic by sending additional forces by dealing with this on a one off basis you need a permanent barrier you need a wall\nDemocrats don't want to do because\nWal first off would prove its utility very quickly and then they don't look for what you're saying oh walls don't work no pretty sure walls work you\nKnow if you're if you're going to walk on your neighbors' property and there's nothing there that's pretty easy for going to walk her neighbors' property and has a ten foot cement wall things just got a little harder you may think twice about walking on to their property in trespassing right this couldn't be any more straightforward but they said oh walls don't work and works in San Diego San Diego sector of the border\nFence they're absolutely works\nSo why wouldn't workouts where all they don't have any good answers for you\nThey just don't want it to get built because once it's built we can see that it works and once we see that it works\nAnd they're they can't do very much about it I don't think they're going to be successful with you know break the wall down\nThis is one area where Trump has an on look he has an unfulfilled promise now as to who's behind this march\nAnd who's\nPulling the strings here I Know there's a lot of theories out there I don't know\nBut I Do know that this is not a coincidence\nThat you have the largest of these migrants caravans that I that I Know of\nJust a couple of weeks before the midterm elections on the way the border this allows the media to play the emotional manipulation game this allows them to forget about the fact that the economy is incredibly strong to forget about the fact that all their\nPredictions about economic calamity because of Trump and all the things that they've said twenty Fifth Amendment he has to be removed 'cause he's crazy Russia collusion that the mainstream media has wasted over a year the American people's time\nOn this fantasy that Trump colluded with Russia\nWorse than a fantasy minute it's a plot it's a plot that was put into motion by anti Trump elements in our own government to undermine the president I'd states they wasted a year of our time on this year\nAnd a half of our times it's insane is absolutely insane but\nThey can get enough people at the border looking sad and looking hopeless take lots of photos of lots of videos and talking about how heartless Trump is for enforcing the law that was the law in the books during the Obama administration about how the safety of all involved and also yes as a deterrent you separate people from their children at the border you should reunite\nThem but this is the process that they have had\nAnd if they do this again I Know the Trump administration's changed the way that they're going to do it because the outcry originally but if there's any separation whatsoever even a temporary separation I mean even a matter of hours we're going to be told that it's heartless it's cruel it's you know it's evil it's a it's a Nazi concentration camps all over again\nI'm not making that up people were saying that about this people that we're still supposed to take seriously in public discourse which is\nIn itself just astonishing\nWe are in a fight my friends and we need to understand that such the other side plays dirty what's at stake here the future of the Trump agenda and the trajectory of this country for at least the next two years really the next six\nGot a couple of weeks to figure out what we're going to do and how we're going to do it\nWe'll talk more about it right after this break [noise]\n\nThe

you know we were going to ... ... what does that mean\nThis is my favorite question to ask people what is what what are you really saying what does that mean how is it in power were about to have a big election and a lot of people are going to vote one way and a lot of people are gonna put another way what what is the peril democracies in right now there's just like when people say oh the first amendment is under threat by Trump how\nBecause he uses the first amendment do we ever get to hear an explanation of this is just rhetoric\nIt's just empty it offers nothing it tells you nothing just democracy is not a spectator sport gee that's brilliant maybe you could put that on a mug and give it to somebody\nWhere do we find these Democrats\nFor show sanctimonious so full of demagoguery and don't add anything to conversation there are interesting liberals out there there are fascinating leftists there are people you can talk to you I I I Know people anarchist and I love talking to you I Know people that have all kinds of really interesting belief systems in\nAt least it's worth engaging you learn something but the the marquee Democrats\nThese days it's just all pitiful it's all

wealth defending our democracy\nThat's not that that's not a policy solution is an interesting people have been talking about that for a very long time and get them very far I'm going to do is very bad things up\nBut there's there's nothing that's even more listening to most of these people about Bernie Sanders has a kind of charm and a ... an authenticity that comes across 'cause you don't govern Brooklyn so I looked him 'cause he runs that people do know from Brooklyn and\n\nYou know you hear him talk about these things you say okay well that's not he sounds like he's well intentioned but then when you start to get the things like math you go well this isn't gonna work this is crazy\nSome really bad idea\nSame thing with all of them\nWhat is what is Kamala Harris stand for whatever the Democratic party tells you to stand for what is Cory Booker stand for same what does was with orange that for basically the same Bernie Sanders' same Joe Biden a number warm CNN poll recently about who they think's\nGoing to run for president they've got nothing and I think that's part of why there's such a desperation and why they're being violent weather attacking people either hurting people\n'cause they've got nothing\nI mean they have the usual slogans on the class warfare and all that but I mean in terms of can age in terms of a bench\n\nKamala Harris I see here is is thinking about uh giving American families you know five hundred dollars a month you're going to hear more about I think universal basic income I think they're actually trying it now in a a trying it in a city in California right they're pushing for it out there\nThey have no new ideas they have nothing to tell people about that can get them excited all the news get people angry and telling them how terrible and awful or the Republicans are\nI think there are also in a bit of shock and this is where I'll talk to you a somewhat about the the Kavanaugh effect which is very very real these senators who are leading the charge against Brett Kavanaugh on the Senate\nAnd max and with the Fox business report I'm calling\nBecause whether you're weren't Jeanette ... stay informed new\nTraffic and whether you talk going on for nine [noise]\nDo does the country want to put a check on Donald Trump\nDo we want to put a check on Trump ism\nDo we want to repudiate it or do we want to validate it because should the Republicans\nMaintain majority control in the house should they maintain majority control in the Senate this president will not only be unchecked he will be emboldened and at the core what he's doing\nIs stoking hold civil war in this country ... million people use battered our eyes and in in the history of the country who makes new preach about being the leader of the American people he's the leader\nIn Ninety eight or nine\nAnd I send me sees political analysis such crash\nSee Schmidt is among the very worst we'll talk more about it he's going to get another appearance later the show he does the dumbest stuff on TV so that means that you know fun to use them for commentary purposes they put them on TV a lot on MSNBC though what he's saying is true by the way\nWhat he's saying is is not accurate I maybe thinks he's being kind of women's Ikle or something but it's not just trumpets on the ballot and in fact what we're seeing is that it is not a the Republicans are not treating it as old as only Trump on the ballot\nFirst of all every single congressional election has its own idiosyncrasies and realities and a media markets that should you think a guy that ran a very unsuccessful McCain presidential campaign should should know that\nOut but beyond that there's a there's a clear dynamic that has unfolded in the last couple of weeks last few weeks that could change the selection much how you got it right now and in fact I spoke to\nI'll tell you I I had a I had a chat with the Lindsey Graham flashlight spoken for about twenty minutes we sort of sat down we're over Fox I was I was up Lindsey we weren't off the record but I was giving him a little bit of what I think's going to he was give me a little bit of what do you think's going on and here's the bottom line\nThe Kavanaugh effect is very real Lindsey certainly knows that because he had his proudest moment I think ever in the Senate defending Kavanaugh\nBut here's what's happening and the reason that this is trending toward the Republicans at this stage of the game 'cause you know Democrats are are they're running a a campaign at\nAll the local level of a or a local elections\nRather a you're not the state and and congressional level of healthcare you don't hear about it much but that's what they're messaging has healthcare help your health care at the national level they're making this whole Trump issue but really they're pushing the health care issue very hard because they know the polling shows that that actually for people who are going to vote\nThat matters Republicans do have had a gift recently and what you see is that the\nCabin all effect in any state that's read where there's a Democrat who's trying to pull the usual you know Democrat oh I'm kind of centrist on these things I'm sort of a conservative Democrat had fake is that's not gonna fly that's not good\nI work um [noise] the dynamic as it's playing out right now\nIs the uh\nThe dynamics playing out is that in states where\nIt's clearly a red state and the conservatives Republicans have the advantage Trump showing up for base turnout trumpet showing up to make sure the base remembers that they need to be a part of what's going on here in this midterm election\nBut the dynamic and I think is really interesting and you're not hearing you talk about the media because they're all they're they're actively wishing in a way they hope it goes away\nAnd it is that in\nA elections that are in states where it's kind of a you know a a Democrat in a in a red state you know it's a little bit of a of a close circle all across the board\nThey want people to come and speak about the cabinet issue went speak because that's a reminder to anyone who's toward the center of just how you cannot trust the Democrats with power\nSo in very red in very red states to get the base out you're going to have a lot of talk about you're going to have Trump visiting Trump's getting the base fired up is going to get them to show up at the polls are great\nBut in states where it's a closer call where it's a little more purple where there you're going to have the Lindsey Graham's of the G O P showing up and saying remember what they did the Kavanaugh you can't put these people you can't trust these people with power you are not\nBeing a responsible citizen if you think that these Democrats should be given any if any more authority now already have all the wives the American people a cabinet could be the game changer think about what a political miscalculation the Democrats made their\nThink about what that what really happened they thought\nThat they would stop the Supreme Court sheet from going to a conservative constitution list and even if they couldn't stop it they would be rewarded by their base\nFor just going thermonuclear to try to stop just huge a scorched earth do everything they could but what we're seeing is dating anticipate that in a lot of close fought elections in suburban parts of America are a lot of Republican women\nAre scary is about what happened to Capitol furious\nAnd they want to make a statement and they're coming out to vote you know if your a pink hat wearing you know meet your T shirt emblazoned left wing feminist\nYou already we're going to vote and you hate Trump doesn't matter but if you're somebody was like well you know sometimes I I'm a little bit you know ... with some of what Trump has drawn but you're you're a Republican woman\nAnd you see what they did the Kavanaugh what the Democrats did and what that would mean for the future of this country going forward a lot of them are absolutely\nFired up about this and that could be the game changer it could be the enthusiasm among center right wing in suburban districts that makes this house contract it's going to be down to the wire\nThis is going to be really close I think\nCould still go to the Republicans oh that would feel like a miracle but it could still happen\nAnd\nIt's going to be because of Kavanaugh so folks that fight that we had to defend Kavanaugh is critical [noise]\nI've got a couple of it in my hands right now my friend black

think that there is a very\nPossibility here that the Saudis are I'm sure they're going to suffer some consequences but they're gonna probably live to fight another day diplomatically on this one because they're going to say that it's just\nIt's something that happened they were in control of it and you know things things go bad and ah there'll be better in the future or something like that and got to remember the Saudis are in the region are pretty important player for us play quipped sex as secretary of state palm pay Oregon\nTitle for the Trump this morning that we ought to give them

... alliance the United states we need to be mindful of that as well\nIt's an important ally not something that we want to just discount and just fly off the handle decide that we're going to try and make some big statement here\nThere are plenty of places all over the world were very very bad things happen to people on a daily basis we can't make all of at our problem\nI Know that there's symbolism ear journalist he was he was a green card holder he was a permanent was in this country not the same as being a citizen but he definitely had very real ties to America\nThis was this happened on foreign soil however and so the people that are calling for an investigation I think just don't realize what all the hurdles are in place of that investigation we have no basis you certainly don't have any jurisdiction but no basis for sending any kind of investigative\nTeam and last one the Turks allow it 'cause it's Turkish\nDitch Turkish sovereignty here I mean is on Turkish soil and to the Saudis would have to allow because of the council it so you are multiple levels of complexity added into what would already\nBe an investigation as highly sensitive\nAnd I don't know who we think we can really trust and that whole process either I mean if we don't send Americans to do this I Would be very suspicious of what information we get and how we get it but if we do send Americans um well I just I doubt that's going to happen unless they were\nBrought along kinda riding shotgun so to speak vice president Pence however is saying that there will be consequences play clip ten oh I can assure you\n[noise]\nTo lie\nThere will be consequences the vice president says noticed that people are pretty pretty thin on details\nOf what those consequences would be and it's because not only do we have to be concerned with the immediate Saudi response which would be both overt covert I'm sure against our interest in a whole bunch of different ways we also think about the unintended consequences here and what would happen from a major fracture\nIn the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia truth is we don't want a major break with the Saudis and the Saudis are in some ways useful right now and here's what nobody really wants to say\nThe scariest scenario for America when it comes to Saudi Arabia in a lot of ways is actually a revolution and then democracy um the Saudi people in charge of what goes on in that country and representation in Saudi Arabia for look just remember what happened with the Arab Spring\nWith at all it's going to be great in Egypt they're going to\nElect people western style democracy is going to be great there's going to be human rights and women are going to school and all these things which I mean that was happening in Egypt beforehand but you know what I mean\nAnd it's going to be a really big step forward\nAnd then the Muslim Brotherhood came into power\n[noise] let me tell you something if they had elections in Saudi Arabia the Islamists would be in power there too and I would offer to you probably much more hard line Islamist than anybody wants to admit or or would a would realize right now because the\nClerics that are allowed to preach in Saudi Arabia right now only do so with the acceptance and the and they say so of the government if you actually had\nThe top pulled off this thing and the people of Saudi Arabia were calling the shots and the preachers were whoever they were listening to uh I Will be bad very quickly and that's that's kind of a nightmare scenario it's one of the reasons why the Saudis and the Pakistanis for example get away with as much as they do in terms of our relationship with them\nIs because the worst case scenario is not that they're mad at us the worst case scenarios of the government is overthrown in either of those places and Pakistan because you have nuclear missiles in the equation it's particularly scary ah in Saudi Arabia\nWe have very few powerful military allies left the middle east is dwindling we've Israel and then\nIt starts to get pretty thin\nJordan is a good ally but it's a small country not but not a picky wealthier powerful one of the Turks are increasingly Islam eyes and they can't be counted on to be our friends in the Mid East\nSaudis obviously we've got this problem playing out right now got our concerns there Egypt is just not what it once was not as reliable a partner and it's got its own problems a new look around the region like who can we turn to who will be helpful I mean Iraq we're just hoping to place\nDoesn't collapse into some kind of ethnic civil war and you got it wrong clearly is not perfectly fine to the United states so when we talk about consequences for the Saudi Government because it would be against the whole state of Saudi Arabia I mean I don't think that there's going to say\nWe want a Magnitsky sanctions against just a few individuals I don't think that would be\nA sufficient response people are talking about a hundred billion dollar arms deal uh getting shifted around a one way or another getting stopped ... whatever they they end up doing\nA this these are major consequences these are major consequences and then you have to look at the other side of this which is the people who are the loudest voices on this issue many of them that Chinese people were the loudest voices on this do not have\nAmerica's interest necessarily at heart\nThey view this as an opportunity\nTo both criticized and antagonize the Trump Administration that's right as I've been telling you this is supposed to

they think they have an opening to whack a finger at the other side over instability which remember wouldn't be the instability of a mob it wouldn't be the instability of an entire movement it would just be maybe\nOne wacko who is sending what increasingly looks like yard bombs to very very prominent Democrats and leftists and\nThey want to lecture all of us and they claim that they're not doing which just goes to show you\nHow much gas lighting goes on in our conversations with the left I I Will give you examples of as we will spend a bit of our time this hour working through just how

circumstances there was a press conference today with the NYPD in fact one of my uh some of my former colleagues were named in the press conference I had a bit of nostalgia\nBut they talked about how the bombs that haven't gone off it kept getting asked the question by the press are they real bombs or the ... the YPG is going to have\nTo say you have to treat these as real threats because just imagine for a moment that the largest police department the country's as no these are these are\nThe odds and then the next suspicious packages that goes out whether it's by the same person or not but look similar person opens it up and goes well I Know it's a dog and then we have a tragedy someone loses limbs site maybe dogs from one of these pipe bombs or\nThe NYPD can't take that risk not yet I Can't say that these bombs wouldn't have gone off under any circumstances but I'm here to tell you that I think that is increasingly likely to be the case\nAnd if that is in fact what's going on here let's just take a step back I Know I'm not supposed to say I know I'm not supposed to go there but\nThen again I actually professionally did this on like Ninety percent of the clowns going on MSNBC and CNN to talk about it and in the past when they've tried to tell me if those places what is and it's not real when it comes to terrorism or they have\nTended to get buck slapped rather hard here's

but the people in places like Indiana and Tennessee and Nevada who are figuring out who to vote for gas what they don't much like the idea that the Democrat Party\nIs effectively an open borders party\nPrivileges certain people from certain places of the world's getting around the rest of the immigration system because it benefits the Democrats electoral prospects they don't like that and so if you wanted to switch that narrative if that was the purpose it has been master fully achieved here\nNow is in fact possible\nSome would even say probable I'm I'm not quite there yet I Need I Need

that is the case\nHowever\nAm I willing to discount am I willing to push aside that if this was in fact somebody whose purpose was to change the conversation right before the midterm I don't think anybody believes this is a coincidence in terms of the time and\nIf the purpose was to was to push aside conversations that were damaging for the Democrats and in the process make the anti Trump media

strategy\nI'm not saying it happened I'm saying would these things all be true if this were a false black\nAnswers obviously yes so that's why I'm unwilling to just discount this out of hand and that's why I refused to take the position that\nWell because the left has already started not just to blame the right for this but to blame the president of the United states for\nThis that's where I think we have to draw a very hard and fast line the Democrats have created not alone but primarily predominantly\nThey have created this vicious toxic political environment\nThey have never thought

referral is going to be tough to ignore the department of justice is going to have to look into this and that means folks\nThat there could be unlike the proceeding that the left was so excited to use to try and smear Kavanaugh which was not\nA standard criminal proceedings right there they could not subpoena people they could not uh take their phone records it by the way they're no phone records to take the allegations were from thirty five years ago or whatever it was just the whole thing was insane\nAnd I'm so I'm going to say this I Am so proud\nOf what we did hear on the show me and bike and John the whole team and all of you supporting me when that was\nA really difficult a couple of weeks especially in the early days we knew it was garbage and we ... we kept her she'll tie yes we did we held the line on this one and people notice by the way\nThere was a front line on defending capital and we hear in the freedom that we were on that front lawn publicly in every possible way I was in contact with the White House emails trying to get in through the confirmation on a near daily basis\nSo um\nThat Grassley is not passing this thing up and saying okay you know we'll let bygones be bygones is the right move\nAnd this could did this will mean that the OJ now has the ability to pull records you know they they might be able to see some communication's perhaps between sweating ache and other people but you know this ...\nYou want to play in this game you want to try to lie and get somebody ruined and smear them you're going to sign ridiculous sworn statements with no ... nobody would be able to tell you yes or no I mean the whole thing\nIf they can prove she lied if they can prove ... he was part of a conspiracy for her to lie they must both be criminally prosecuted the law either matters or it doesn't there's really not a lot of room for interpretation here if they can prove it now\nThere is the possibility that they won't be able to prove that sweating collide because her charges were so vague or the statement that she swore was so vague I was at a party in the eighties and there were gang rapes and I think maybe Kavanaugh was near the punch maybe he wasn't but then again she changed her\nTestimony publicly from what the sworn statement was which is when we all knew that this was not just a fix but an obvious fix my that was when it was clear to anyone paying attention okay this really is too much\nThis person has a problem this person is ill is sick so um and that's\nWhere I think we are now but if they\nThey're they're going to try to do two things on the left now because by the way they really don't want can you imagine if Julie sweat neck faces criminal prosecution for what happened there what then we're supposed to think what the other two women just they were the ones that were really attack but Julie sweating it just came out of nowhere to lie I think about what that does to the narrative\nAnd I am very clear on this one for if you can prove somebody makes a false criminal allegation against anyone they must suffer consequences because they are doing violence to the truth and they were trying to ruin someone's life is an attempted ruin nation of the human beings life that must be punished\nCrystal Gail magnum I told you this this was the uh the stripper who claimed with Mike knife on that despicable district attorney down in Durham North Carolina\nThat the Duke lacrosse team raped her it was a complete fabrication a total lie she claimed the guy was raping or who was miles away in an ATM machine and they had him on video and using his card there so kind of hard for him to raping her when he's a few miles away\nA complete fabrication they didn't press charges against her they did ... and he should have gone to prison for a long time but the justice part him\nShe went on to kill her boyfriend seven to death later on maybe she should have actually had to deal with justice of course you should have had to deal with justice perhaps somebody would be alive today not only did Kavanaugh survive and therefore due process survive with him through this process\nBut if we really do care about truth and decency and justice in our system if we care about due process and the right to protect your reputation the right to face the acute the to face your accuser the right not to be destroyed\nAt the political whims of the left for their convenience than people who lie in order to destroy you under oath must be punished the left is going to kick scream over this one because it's a very bad look for them they know it\nNow will they be able to prove this I Can't say quite yet is it clear to me that sweating it as a liar absolutely\nAbsolutely I as I Know she's a liar not just based on statements he made a base in the contradictions overstatement if you don't say I think someone's spiked punch at a party which what what would that even mean\nThat was such a crazy thing to say in the first place he spiking what he's drinking the punch how would you spiking the punch he's gonna he's got a poison we're very or get super drunk all of his male friends too so that they pass out and can't move\nThink about that she didn't she didn't say spiking of drinks spiking an entire punishable that everyone drinks yeah maybe he was putting alcohol in it so that everybody could have some alcohol but he was the whole thing it's just it's none of it rang true it was a fabrication out of this woman's mind she's deranged she's range I mean\nAnd that's where they're going to say if if they really nail her on the lie the story will be she's not sound mind let's let this go she suffered a novel that kind of stuff I'm Sorry I Know if she was a sound mind enough to bring these charges and try to put the final nail in Kavanaugh's\nConfirmation coughing she's of sound mind enough to have to face the consequences of our actions to have to actually stand up and defend what it was that she was saying and how she was saying it and she ... she sworn affidavit\nThat either has meaning or does it so I Hope Grassley\nPushes this and the DEA OJ needs to investigate this and we'll see how far they're able to be

I've been telling you that's not going to that's just there's never going to be real enforcement alright what can be done about this I'm not going to hear all bucket oh what do you go to the issue the\nUltimately the thirty thousand foot level Congress needs to change the law so that it is very clear that asylum they\nThen need to change the asylum process so that you apply in your in your country or in the nearest country you can get you out of a U.S embassy and there's a process as it should not be that you just present yourself in this way out of port of entry\nUm because you are and walking within walking distance to the United states that's not that's not the way that this law should be but ah\nAs important that there's something called a safe third part say third country agreement is well I like to tell you things on the show that you want to hear from other people because I actually read lots of things and do lots of research because if you were kind enough to spend your time with me I have a mandate to make sure that his time well spent team\nSo the say third a third country agreement would mean and we have one with Canada by the way so this is not some crazy concoction and we've we've discussed the possibility of this uh at the government government level with Mexico but what it would mean is that we would\nSet up at the border but on the Mexican side of the border and were you yes we would probably have to pay for this I Know his book they should they should pay for it will go a lot faster and much more effective if we pay for it\nWe would set up a centrally trailers you know a a holding facility sounds like it's not attention facility but it's\nA what would be somewhat similar to a a refugee camp situation it would be a place where people you know they have\nUh they're they're able to stay safe there's water there's food um but it's on the Mexican side of the border and we would move infrastructure down to the border so that you have\nAt port of entry courts\nSo you would start would move the judicial infrastructure to deal with these immigration cases right down to the border\nAnd people that were waiting for their adjudication ... so that would speed it up obviously and people that are waiting for their education process would be on the Mexican side of the U.S border which means that they don't or\nThat they're not able to just go further and further and ensure United States and get some you know immigrant rights lawyer to represent them pro bono to keep suing the federal government all the rest of it if their claim is denied guess what they they get to stay in Mexico\nOr or the Mexican government then can can hand them off to their country of origin\nI put that way you prevent what's happening right now which is using the legal system and it's very important we understand that they are not illegal immigrants\nThey may cross illegally so then they are in the U.S illegal but at the moment that they say I have a credible fear of my safety these Honduran immigrants go into the asylum process and then they're due process allows them to stay in the United states that is the law I've talked\nTo senior immigrations officials about this is talk of wars about this that's how this works\nSo we need to take action here beyond just we're going to enforce the law at the border that's great that's a good start but if you have this caravan of seven thousand that gets all the way even if it's only a thousand that gets to the border", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss
