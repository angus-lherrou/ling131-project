you know it's only been a couple of centuries 'em\nBefore a lot of recognized animals were were found to exist in the first place so I think it's important to remember that it's um you know there are surprised he's still out as much of the the world which still remains under explored\nYeah you have a several of the creatures are monsters that are in your book they're based on things that we know

those stories were unfolding and seemed like every couple of days or be a new citing or a a new angle on it\nAnd it was kind of fun it was like an oddity almost like a circus ... kind of a a story or something to put somebody in a costume or\nA ... an oddity like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose bumps such as the story you tell in this book about something called the wind man it's a story from staffordshire England in two thousand nine you remember the details\n[noise] oh yeah ... ironically um that was at a place called the kind of chase in central England only about five miles from where I grew up as a kid so\nI Know the area very well and it's a it's a large area of a woodland ... and\nAnd I'm like certain places around the world that seem to be to the hot spots for power normal phenomena the kind of chase he's just the same you know they'd be coming out his window areas where it seems every fit and his brother come through you know at various times\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local newspaper the chase post and somebody had same this um what looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or a soaring would be a better term to use\nOver the woods I'm at a high speed um you know kind of a\nLike a flying mine I'm not unlike I guess the you know the stories coming out of ... in\nThe sixties or with a ... something you know kind of power outage in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of them even spoke to the local police or I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have this spate of weird activity in this area which is already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough light the dog mine and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nYou know they said that she's a ... or ... or or possibility um [noise]\nYou know I'm not going to tell people they're big forty some strange creature that come from the far side of\nThe moon but you know [laughter] I don't

something you go that's called that squash and you share that with us\nWell yeah the the the ... is he really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees the more than anything else is something that's\nSort of pops up he's not seen again I'm just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people who do I want to know was the fact\nAnd then he'd never seen again but this particular case is an interesting one um it ... and I pulled Nineteen sixty four in Buckley, Washington and I'm actually quite close to my room there on the witness in mind I'm young man named Brian Khan failed\nUm he sold the strange creatures while he was driving along the road\nAnd it was sort of humanoid with this huge wings\nBut it was kind of Harry as well [noise] scares me and had the shining a yellow eyes\nBut the sort of the ... the hair angle combined with the large wings um you know the the the Harry body and the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he kind of looks a bit like\n... ... and um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these\nYou know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend and you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I have talked about that before a that might be a ... year than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nWell I've got to be honest with you ... I mean I've done five books now on on these phenomena foreign the men in black and one on the women and black\nAnd I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI and say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies they typically are described as looking ... you know go on and the skins live ... white white\nUm um people talk about how vaccines have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them\nPay for the even talks about when they're in close proximity to them that they fall and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women in black of turned up in homes right after paid for using wage of ... which puts in ...\nTheir angle to it um but\nThere's no doubt in my mind again um you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe fish but many black mistreat Bobby on you know just guys in a black suit walking\nI guess I'm you know\nI'm asking it into contact sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans and helicopters are that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seemed like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we are going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction files but where in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nUh pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or or other investigators\nWell yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about the kind of shows you know you've got a really weird and actually a couple and then some which are here to explain\nThere is a parallel with demanding black but you know but in some cases I think the government agencies are responsible for them I think it's a very small gotcha great they genuinely unexplained ones and the way it was\nWhat I think it happened on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support this\nIs over the years agencies may actually unemployed that elections are demanding black I was amazed to cover their tracks in other words\nIt might have within government you know that many black to radio but I don't know what they are but it doesn't prevent them from using the legend them out hey\nAs a main too quiet April who may not want to I've been talking about cases so the government actually not know who the men in black really are and I don't think they do fully\nBut that sort of lead us into where we're heading into the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction ... what the government doesn't want you to know that ...\nLatest book uh whether or not you believe alien abductions are real the files on alien abductions are real when I tell ya what might be going on there based on some of the or real life or documents that nicotine squeezed out of the U.S in the u._k. government that the outlaws take us into the break with maybe the greatest\nGhost story goes song ever written a ghost writers in the sky we write back [noise]\nYou access the audio archives of ... am log on to ... dot com [noise]\n\n\n\nWork to build a house for nine cars this hour we'll give you something else about shall we talk going on for nine W.

George finds hassle\nTrue and bathroom ... all of them had FBI falls out putting on them one of the main reasons pain was because they claimed when I'm interviewed by the FBI that yes they ... they are and say Israel eons but\nThey told the FBI that they the Iranians had a government or governments very different two hours and bordering on communism and I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example George Hans hassles FBI file\n'em is extremely extensively about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages\nI'm ... was about four to and so on\nSo you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape people now\nIn the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the abduction phenomenon in September sixty one a with a bacterium Bonnie hill case which is I guess he's a defining moments you follow gee when it wasn't the first abduction case on record but it was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn full of wrote his book on the case they interrupted journey\nNow in the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky\nAnd then things kind of get weighed a they don't fail rights they you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd I get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board the strange craft would they be strange creatures\nAnd they subject to to um strange and intrusive\nExperiments now what's particularly intriguing\nIs that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around among Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning to I Am an essay was driving these vehicles to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nAnd they ... they should become now to say the vehicle interference phenomenon with a new holiday what's intriguing\nIs that they they ah British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused coal they promised them security services are sort of like they\nThe James Bond if you like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the file it talks about how the they ... they promised them security services interviewed Ronald Wildman of ... to with a with a ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him\nAnd the most telling and intriguing aspect\nIs that he told the police so this is a direct quotes that he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time on goal of abduction law in today's world but Ronald while in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO coming down\nLights went out of his vehicle and then he kind of fell to ... strange checked his watch\nAnd there was something that ... it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact ... and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject and thinking sort of bemused meant well there were there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys telling you is crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking them literally but when you realize that the government is really does followed them around it takes it seriously for whatever reason\nIt makes me think of like the Roberts and men or that the CIA scientist studied the UFO topic and they include\nThe UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting UFOs might be because\nMaybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion is that a justification for following around people like a dam ski bathroom those books\nOh yeah because I mean George ... is a first book flying saucers have landed published in the early fifties that\nThat sold him huge figures gigantic numbers of books with salt I'm On a ski went on the ... it's a all around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this\nSort of a communist type of governments um the communism was the way of the future and the FBI open that file on a damn ... um\nPredominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with aliens bucked\nThe FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by the communist angle and I'm\n[noise]\n\nTwenty team victory march the fourth world series for the Boston Red Sox in the

book\nWell yeah I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and um he clearly a real one um they do seem to be tied to both ... and um the id and abduction phenomena and\nOne of the things that's as being notation I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these whoever's flying these helicopters\nPotentially I think is part of an organization that up right outside of

religion and culture he's interested in religion and science spirituality and on church religion\nNew religious movements electronic media in popular culture and is currently a professor of religion at Vassar College his new book other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions is a spectacular and mind bending Christopher welcome to the program\nMorning George thanks for having me on the show\nThanks for staying up so late or ... I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch Greece for doing it\n[laughter] give me um [noise] no it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it it's um you know a lot of people and\nCultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or you know we do we do get a pass to study really cool fantastic things right on people's um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences\nPeak experiences what whatever you want to call them so yeah it is kind of the privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of follow my interests and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that look that sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know this one movement in New directions by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how it's the sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to um have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about your death experiences and and the variances and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world in popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how a belief in church um a formal religion organized religion is sort of\n... around the western world but interest and spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or you may increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is\nYou know people still in America seem to have a lot of I guess would be called spiritual beliefs they ... pretty high numbers in America\nI'm believing and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional really with traditional religious congregations those things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about is how can we talk about those you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very real buff sense of belief and\nOther world um and spirituality and the abdomen are really in the absence of participation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and\nTry to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and\nI think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multiverse with thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves embrace with ... with offensive on mystery and I wonder\nI think those concepts are sort of uh the seed bed for for a new spiritual infections and I and that's and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard time to normally Georgia's\nToo late [laughter] yeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you'd sort of reached out to look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given a they're a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it it hurts to even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kind of concepts are so commonly held so um\nThat that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nUm I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the and the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question of well what what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say a word about that for\nThem for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm going to hear\nAnother demand the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and hide\nAnd those are are are three directions or dimensions if there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension um send Feinstein in that time so we live in a four dimensional space time a world\nI spoke about this but some other people I talk about in my book talk about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction and space or a dimension of space that different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line of a one dimensional objects as length\nIf you then draw last where on that same piece of paper it has to directions or dimensions has links and with\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and height and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be you know this would be an object that has links with\nHeight and something else and the the phone thing else has the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and actually others from philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really on the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility\nLike kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um

sat in\n[noise]\n\n\nWe're back with Christopher white Christopher I at one of the great things about the book is is how you\nTell the story about other worlds and our our modern perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it you'd tell the story of people who've struggled but getting their own heads around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific use came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story\nYeah yeah yeah yeah his his wife is is quite a story um but you're right there there's Hinton and there's many others in the book who sort of struggle with the\nUm you know sort of like a habit being raised religious in a scientific time and feeling that they can no longer or an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace the religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and his ... am\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension and has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual up levels are worlds to reality I Am hinted incomes an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he he falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make it right in the situation as he he embraces mathematics and geometry as a kind of a and he kind of hangs onto that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty 'em to him\nBut I think is his story a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nAs I say in the book he develops the whole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions and he gets very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nSee I'm into the future and he writes these ideas up in a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know I sometimes give talks about this in different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that then happen or does that happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job blue or were they ought to be in some other reality\nAnd then they come back to this one sided audio ... what's the how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of those experiences as well also in that chapter six um\nAnd then a little bit in the chapter on C. S. Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's the famous writer of wrinkle in time just recently a movie made a vat\nOf that book but she talks about time slips and time travel um and so on and some of her books so yeah how do they make sense is that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my presence could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time as just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense that time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that\nOf the ways that we experience time is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of our own consciousness that Einstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe that could be\nA block universe universe that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe\nI'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through passing through that that block right are we occupy a little portion of that block but every moment in our past in in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future\nAnd and all of our descendants future's all of those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the the laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions to discuss if anyone wants to look at it\nScott my book but you can also look at Brian Greene for he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so\nI'm done and I was only laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies tackle all the time\nYeah you're right you're right it it lays out these big issue right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how we are we to make choices um and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that you treat your moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more positive or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow lifted up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should start ... world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension dreaming up he said and lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moment\nAnd Don believe that um you know using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space last or is there um that's what he believed happening some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and if we could talk about that as an additional visual dimension or we could talk about that is\nNow maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and he he thought everybody everybody's sleeping so had this degree of freedom and he he also believe that every one of the cabin kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and and they followed a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believe that if everyone did they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and after that I'm sort of mixed up together\nWell I get the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences or to talk about science is a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we have discussed on this program before might fit into our discussion of

Seventy reached out and grab a simple as up so we can understand the true nature of reality what do you think\nOh sure I mean I think that you know it depends on how you think about those dimensions and what's in them but I mean you certainly have had\nYou know religious and spiritual people over the last hundred years say things just like that right I mean in fact you've had\nPeople um even even cs Lewis talk about you know God in Christ as higher dimensional um and as beans that calmed down and insert themselves\nInto our lower dimensional world just like the sphere did that in and I'm an avid spoke a flat land so yes people have definitely thought about um\nWhat we say thought about visitors from from higher rounds or ... or spiritual beings are angels or whatever I'm as higher dimensional hum and as I was kind of the higher dimensional objects that than ... entire world\nThat sounds perilously close to saying that science and religion could coexist that uh you know that the paranormal beliefs could coexist with a scientific ... is scientifically acceptable version of reality\nYeah yeah I think so I mean in my book I Try to put you know a number of different people in the story so I have\nPeople who have let's say these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experience like a near death experience um and then I have them talking about their experience and then I also have scientists in the book as well and some skeptics so I have different voices in the book\nUm you know talking about\nWhat the meaning of these events are and and you know there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret\nWhat's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is is are these people who have these kinds of uncanny experiences are remarkable experiences\nMoments of insider intuition or near death experiences are out of body experiences um and so on and and that they are ... than using scientific concepts to to understand what what could be happening and I think that you know figures in my book like like the all of us today I mean I think that\nWe all want to use science you know I think we I think science is for the authoritative\nI'm set of this courses that we used to talk about talk about reality so I think I think that's what they're doing I think you know just like Jay W done right who have these dreams that seem to predict the future where did he go you know he didn't he\nDidn't actually go to the Bible at that point to figure it out he went to Einstein you know he went to he went to sort of like popular science book um and I think that you know that's one point I tried to make in the book that I think a lot of us are sort of inspired by a man interested and fantastic scientific concept um\nWell I mean humans humans have been trying to reach a other higher dimensions rather realities for a long time prayer would be an example are reaching out to some invisible world there I'm absolutely yeah I Know remote viewing\nYeah yeah yeah there's there's all kinds of things that would fit into that you're right and people have been trying to\nTo reach the transcendent uh ever since there have been humans on earth right on ... reaching for something else reaching beyond our own subjectivity um and we talked about dreams earlier I think\nA through dreams and you know in the sixties and other times you know Americans used psychedelic drugs to open up a what they believe it was like a doorway of consciousness into\nAnother realm and in other cultures you might use other plants or substances are losing the gyms to to reach a transcendent but prayer meditation absolutely there are all different\nAll different different methods\nAh so I'm Wondering if the example of remote viewing where people project your consciousness over space and time seemingly independent of space and time to access information that they shouldn't be able to get that that does that make sense because of the idea of other worlds higher dimensions\nWell um let's see I think I think people have certainly talked about remote viewing and other uh parents came on and\nOn ... ... has higher dimensional because uh you know maybe we can go back to Abbott's book flat land for a minute because\nYou know flat line what happens is you know you can imagine a two dimensional world of characters of very flat right sliding around the surface of your desk they don't they know a length and wet but they don't know that third direction or dimension which is\nWhich is up or down so when you're if you're a figure in and flat line and let's say you're just a flat square and you're sliding around on the surface of your flat world and let's say you look out um you know you look around and and what do you see well\nIf you're a flat square sliding around on a flat world you you actually don't see her whole world you just see a line right let's say a friend comes toward you and he's a triangle\nAnd he's fighting towards your what do you see what you just see a line on every everyone and flat land can just see a one dimensional line but what happens when the flat square gets pulled off of his two dimensional world\nUp into a higher space a three dimensional space in the story is suddenly he can see the full dimension analogy of his flat world so he looks\nHe looks and he sees flat land before him all laid out and he can suddenly\nA he suddenly has powers of vision that he never had right he can look down at flat land we can see for the first time\nNot just lines that he can see\nA People's homes he can see into their homes right 'cause he's looking down on the whole flat world so you can see he can see all of his friends whether they're triangles or squares or lines\nHe can see all of their dimensions he can see even inside right say let's say he has a friend who's a triangle 'em all he saw before was their line coming towards them but now he can see the whole triangle he can even see inside the try like in the inside homes\nSo I raise this as an example because\nSome people have uses the say aha you know um well if we were raised somehow in consciousness up into a higher spatial dimensions maybe we could look back on our three dimensional world and have amazing power as a vision\nSo um you know maybe we are just like the square right when raised to hire dimension we would look back on our world and what we see we would see all sides of everything at once you could look\nDown on your home for instance and see all the rooms laid out you know you could see the insides of everyone's bodies you could see the outside of everyone's body you can see the top of the house and the bottom of the house um\nSo you would have a kind of a higher dimensional vision\nUm and so people do indeed use these ideas to talk about things like remote viewing right um or or they use these ideas actually to talk about near death experiences because sometimes people have near death experiences they talk about having this kind of um having this kind of special vision where they can see things I never saw before [noise]\nSo so yeah and so maybe remote viewing is a a you know is a higher dimensional phenomena but I don't know you know I'm certainly\nPeople have talked about it\nI'm that way and I in my book and especially in the later chapters and an epilogue um is where I talk about sort of near near death experiences from her parents psychological phenomena like like feeling\nYeah Raymond Moody is somebody I've met in a ... person and interviewed and it's just you know he's a trailblazer in in discussing that those\nExperiences in so many people have had and trying to put it in context and this I think this kind of idea makes it easier to understand those experience yeah\nI looked at his his books to ah he's he's really interesting I Love the book um I looked at as books too because I was studying um near death experiences for like the epilogue of the book and that the last couple of chapters of the book and you know what you do find or what I found is that people do use this kind of language\nA community

we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nAn ABC News or from the

Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nHarbor day of my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked ... uh uh later on or\nIf you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think an elite group of science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in into very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I\nI I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary Roach\nOh you're missing missing terrific tell me and\nYou know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she loves to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars in which she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen and she is very I Love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her and this is very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the sciences there but um anybody can follow these stories in everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this when I was to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ... and\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King to hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you are\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook\nBasically [laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that as far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years ah you know they're in the stories that I walked me had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um\nWhat I ... in a sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... saw it more likely that um what Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um onto a super computer and then download it on to a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is artificial intelligence robots that third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAnd I was reading some of those sections and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not that big emphasis on it\nBut there is still this hope that people have about preserving their accents and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like\nYou might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else [noise] I think it's\nVery real or in I mean you know ... and you indicated about my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world uh I tell for example\nWell the story of Iran must uh being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars who's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also got his finger in this whole neural net of business is the really the new one of the new hot topics

well as the author and the new book is ah is this is great it's a the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that base in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about about the idea of preserving physical life uh on this planet\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know do we really want to do this and\nThere's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are I Do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're nominate traits in other words we are flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural\nFlow were defined the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you know don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah I Know it's not like the mother nature\nThat one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the Marshall was margarine night it was very mired in for a merger and right now and we all know margarine is not so great for like\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits than suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price and he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know a ... billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution\nRight where we need to do that if we take it on or who was going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah I you know this is the ultimate question and I I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or a peach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um I tell this story about a this guy I think his name as a Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets myself in the sun but he\nRecently applied to the IRS and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence and you know on the surface it sounds a little bit\nCrazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing is he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt ... it is inevitable that one day a artificial intelligence robots\nPowered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because they know everything they see everything they they control\nEverything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well to start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because God I did that this technology we're creating well run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can be a chance that you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around\nGo yeah yeah I play in every once in a while you write in artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in\nI mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post or we once boasted about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... button that up I think they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that day of the singularity that's for the day when all singularity him when they will have the equivalent IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so yeah\nI think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is with you you said a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right to go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know I used to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on her own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine\nNo I like that the cushy Murphy ... yeah I'm right because you know what the old saying if you don't use it lose it you lose a\nYeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that that you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers now how ... easy with that the right now I fully believe that completely and ... and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendships [noise]\nI think our life as we

I Know several people who have a ... who has a\nTrouble walking or they lost their ability to walk into bed spinal injuries and and that this to them as a dream I mean the I ... just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\n... I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a ... where are you with that one no\nI I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about trans humanism and you know that's it there's actually a movement a called the trans human movement where\nAs you say the uh the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories as the usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable there's wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I there this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of this guy from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power lines when he touched a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he'd lost both arms ... them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life\nKnow of severely crippled and now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses but see these are\nArtificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms you know that we're mechanical that requires you to wear a harness and you have to ...\nYou know these are these are arms that he can move with his car so they're they're wired\nTo his mind and I and I was amazed and fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you\nKnow she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I agree with you and maybe even end um [noise] even in the military setting\nI mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there yeah where you know write it just it just ... you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell a skeleton to take some of that load off their own skeletons I I think that's a\nI think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I I think that\nMean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why it there's always this belief somehow that if we can if we can come up with the technology\nUm that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm\nAbout maybe some of our advancements should not be consequence free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then it never really it's a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to [noise] and ah you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are\nEqually realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogates going into war and so we stairs\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah\nI Know and and now and and the ... group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is\nVery upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some other stuff soon or using their own that says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain\nThe question then becomes do you give such warriors the right to make the decision to shoot or not should in other words you give them complete autonomy\nAnd and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are\nThinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then that basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in we're going to be now in another escalating arms race right\nYeah ... it in some ways you know that I often I often think to myself you know all this technology is brand new it's unprecedented but we had our just still the same\nYou know sell our faults in our foibles and our weaknesses\nAnd are downsides just get magnified by this technology the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses and our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose\nTo you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of\nUnintended consequences would dictate the Sarah Connor conundrum\nNot the Terminator conundrum but to Sarah Connor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology of the euro opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism ...\nYou know I mean that's that's how they actually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending some terminal but you know what I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to you know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nOr at his weaknesses but\nBut positive person because whenever you mentioned Russian scientist I'm reminded of the story\nAbout the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old head on a new body right\nYeah yeah okay well we had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one\nOf those Halloween you kind of moments right there were like All right now that this is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with it I can understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit [noise]\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nAh where they yeah they separate the monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden or by that they are\nTurning their attention to doing it to humans and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently or who is a quadriplegic a you know otherwise mentally very

I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing the deceased woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit and they found out that the they could actually get this\nCalculate how many feet she walked and it didn't square with the story from the hospital and then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah\nThey they won't have soles God didn't make them they will have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and I'm like no they weren't so I mean I think some of it as an education peas and and I think that's where a great science writing and science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right Kenya right after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant right because by that time the beds and you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know let me go to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into I D I F when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the your schedule right are you going to be on the big the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will\nYeah yeah I don't give it a little plug for an up [laughter] they're I think you\nYou were talking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality\nAnd when the wrath of God is or out of a ... fine it says that they will pray that they would die and they were not able to and they asked for the the mountains in the stones to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this this period that you're talking where we've achieved get more Callow\nThis is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse or you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible\nThat might give us some glimpse are some hint as to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating\nEr and and so I I'd I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does\nDoes a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of um of a mental a question or\nA mental experiment that people talk about a lot of it we don't we reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence bean whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a hunky all is a a kind of a role of human like robot but gets so complex\nAnd so the non ... you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\n[laughter] you know it's like the sky net running it's like running on on\nEnergy that it absorbs from the environment I mean that's\nWord from saying or for the crush soul\nThe people it's dumped on an ... you know getting are going to get itself coffee yeah I get that I think that happens\nWith some of our technology now right happy I haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop\nYou know that it's a piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and plug it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher six so\nJack Lew that after this exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity\nDegree I Would just say it's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them\nSo keep that in my let me go to a let me go to David who is in Arizona on coast to coast am David\nYeah hey my question for example and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\nUm one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing that gives it sounds like a really good question [laughter]\nYeah they do we just leave them and we just left\nA oh no Well James is in the in the Washington Let's try him while we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nYeah I uh enjoy your show but um [noise] I've been on a kicking machine going on forty five years Yes sir\nAnd I was a banker degeneration I'd like you know from your guest or would you feel that the shoe will be overcome through CRISPR or a a a genetically modified pigs I'll take my answer off the air\nAnd hang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine is\nHe on he's on dialysis is on kidney machines and he has macular degeneration\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful\nUm they they are making enormous strides now uh with restoring people fight with macular degeneration I'd actually interviewed a woman who had the operation and you know even though her\nFight is still not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes

hundred times this first time I've gotten through this is such a great privilege it if I can and I would like to share something a ... about the Bible\nA and there's a great truth that we need to realize in any discipline uh\nAny discipline that you study whether it be science or whether it be ah the Bible for instance uh you can't just take a sip if you go to the wealth of knowledge you need to take a drink and the and the Bible as something to be studied\nAnd pondered over all three of the model the estate religions from the middle east began their roots what the Bible and polluting the ... the Korean has deep roots in the Old Testament and\n... and the Newton is and the New Testament to the current estimate yeah I mean the\nThe story the story of the prophet Jesus and the Koran is is significant it's a it's a big portion of the current\nThat try and even the story of the floods the story of Jesus in the ... all of that validates not counting the historical\nValues a historical cruise you know that that line up with a so many of the stories in the Bible a mini that many of the critics don't believe that it's even possible for Daniel to be real because\nOf the historical value of the book uh Daniel is so accurate\nAnd ah and if it hadn't been found and the dead sea scrolls you know they ... they were you know people would have said well it was impossible for Daniel to know as much of the future as far as he did but\nThat that Cruz when you look at the troops there and you look at a big picture the heart the grace of the Old Testament and the New Testament this\nHas done so much for humanity\nYou know oh I agree I agree we yeah we stray\nAway from that and people and people like to take two or three versus\nAn edge a whole right that's terrible whole book or you know and they'll\nA settled in and you know it's called proved texting and it's yeah it's there's a\nThere's an old saying I've I've said it before I go ... but as soon as the first in St learned in seminary was\nThat some people\nUm some people rely on a on scripture\nI'm like a drunk leans on a lamp post not so much for illumination but for support\nAnd I think it's the illumination part that I always go for another support I like I like it when I find new things that make me think differently and I'll tell you some interesting about the current I don't know if you know it just sounds like you're a learned guy but\nI did a I'm a I was writing I wrote an article about um about the true crime texts I'm interested in how true crime stories are told\nAnd I was interested in how many troops um how many murder stories there are in the Bible\nAnd that the basis for true crime as we know it today the ... the popular genre on any platform that the basis for that it starts in the Bible and that these true crime stories really are these murders stories or or had the same effect they're teaching us a lesson which is what these murders stories still do\nWhat I found was when I looked at um the ways stories were told in the Koran they actually use the word murder with regard to Jesus\nThey where is the Bible says you know in in the Greek portion of the the Bible and the New Testament the Greek word says kill but actually the word that's often used\nUh the Arabic word is the genius who was murdered and I find that very a very interesting distinction that that Muslims see that and that's the way they look at it that he was murdered and I don't think murder comes up a lot when we think about him\nIn a Judeo Christian context but I'm just throwing that out to you I don't know if they find that interesting or not but I did\nThat that corporate I Want to be careful how I say this do you think that corporate Christianity\nHas a you know or Christianity for higher so to speak where people are wanting to build\nA legacies ... do you think that that has hurt us and gotten us away from the central message of the Bible in a whole ah\nYeah I think I think your question answers that you know and I think that what we you know I think anytime there's always the ... been the big difference of shooting a bullet in the name of God or taking a bullet in the name of God\nAnd I'm I'm In the taking the bullet camp [laughter] I'll take the bullet and protecting somebody else I'm a ... you know people go way far onto their way to create these structures were there shooting people killing other\nPeople in the name of God and I and that's where I draw the line you can join the conversation the rigging you've got a great town I'll let you get back to work too but um last time I was in a Bowling Green actually and they were doing work I was on my way to the airport in Nashville and I came across it and we get to a Charles in Portland, Oregon coast to coast Charles\nAnd good

uh where do you want to take\nA just what you said a minute ago difference being murdering show that's fascinating that's going to be ... that lives with me for a week in the\nIsn't it isn't it just ... and the fact that it's Islam where they say murder the Jesus was murdered\nYeah that's it really is I don't know I'm ... go ahead\nWell I yeah I wanted to take us back to the Bible um I was telling the screener I'm a I'm for lack of a better term hardcore atheist and everything but ah I Believe in in you know seeing wisdom\nWhere you find it I I heard a whole lot of wisdom in the ... if you read it at the\nFive ... uh I I don't see much value but if you look at it is how people were thinking two thousand four thousand years ago um it's fascinating I mean you read genesis and if you actually go back and look for you know the gardening eat and you're going to be disappointed but if you look at it is\nYou know what separates humans from the animal knowledge of good and evil how to

um what Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um onto a supercomputer and then downloaded onto it very realistic robot so that Larry King can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with

that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they tell the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big for the encounter in the mountains of the the earth\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked that

I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild\nWalking into the wilderness and found a spot and studied year after year so they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the eighth gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever but we have how I'd while or giant human bones found\nAnd that's that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions any articles uh are made me chuckle a little bit\nBecause the writers who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining\nIt must have been old a ... who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown here all over his body\nThat I [laughter]\nI chuckled with you on those and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation\nUm and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows house Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd and grow hair all over his body like that a snake long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from the late Seventeen hundreds\nYou had a notation at the bottom that said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find an archive news article about it but I saw other secondary in third level things that were written about with Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo\nYeah and\nThe description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you're really not going to find that you have to dig really deep and and find out what maybe some explorers wrote about\nThey hurt which he encountered so but again and tribal but I've written about things were an ex or the water\nWas coming across the country on a horse and you wrote in his or know that this thing came up to I'm always on its worst in them I I actually watch Harry bike\nNever seen before that matched the description of a wild man or fix it and it came from the arc or whether they church latter day saints church and it didn't it so that they have it happen\nOr the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from shock ballet you wrote about it and have a clip from September Seventy sixteen eighty it was a report it in his book wonder in the sky a large black wild like mass\nLanded in a field releasing a huge your cupboard being that we're seeing briefly and disappear now that's the kind of thing that will drive um big foot people who think it's an eight just crazy\n[laughter] [noise] you know I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a book about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and ...

later I don't think there's anything quite like it in in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt\nThese look like human faces these are individual faces that he's drawn a forensic drawings based on witness descriptions are\nThey looked like a people are just big hairy people but people\nNo I I think that's a general consensus or a\nThird of matches what other tribes dated all across the U.S and ah\nWhen you try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and hundreds of years and occupy the land to find a group or an animal I never could find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nLook back at the Patterson gambling film I and it's you know if people can argue about it all they want as far as I'm concerned that has not been debunked but that that's being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or eight\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the beings that that that you're you have drawings up in this and the beings that are described in the in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much less\nSo when I did with ah the gambling film it and one thing Harvey has the ability yet is let's say somebody goes into a bank robbed the bank has a beard on has a hat on\nAnd they're caught on camera leaving Harvey has this innate ability to take the beard off the face\nSo you can see what the face looks like so you can identify the suspect so apply that to the Paterson given one film Harvey took the hair off the face of the Paterson given by pad\nIt's in tribal Dick foot and it's stunning it looks like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made in probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your ... accounts and news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female specimens that are seen right\nWell I I think people forget how different humans are\nAre in my presentation to conferences they sometimes will take a variety of photos of Amazon tribal members of people from northern Ukraine or of people from China\nAnd I put these pictures up there and it's it's phenomenal how different humans look if they are some type of human as I think they are\nThen it it just follows what what was what we understand about our own people\nYeah fewer ... came here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ... you know you might have some trouble or they can't all look like that you know from 'cause we we buried so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a in ... in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were sure they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just signed up playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid who doesn't have much association with fire not grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds\nAnd I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on originally and they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things do an unusual things other times or they're seen in a lake\nPlaying like kids in the water um it's again the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well it must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder to chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big but that supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who saw it how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's\nConclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on it for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things [noise]\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and\nSince the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say and every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth\nKeep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people did not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say if it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I wouldn't have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you know there was never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who saw it and why aren't the names there and if somebody's writing about it since it\nSeems to be a there are instances where in in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as you know I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context to gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to him and it ... I I have never heard of a hunter say\nOh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nOr policemen credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got gotta skew where they said they started looking like him or apes than animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one maybe some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them but it's not going to happen\nThere are some reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and hey invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nMexican agents who briefly blocked them at the Guatemalan border Fox is William ...\nThe actual languages will offer safe passage to the immigrants that as the headlines in the afternoon vapor that we just saw a few minutes ago but he is guaranteed release told residents of Honduras Guatemala baby will offer them safe passage we saw a riot police earlier today they back down\nWe've seen maybe three five hundred cops here in riot gear you didn't have buses and go away\nThe migrants receiving help from sympathetic Mexicans such as food water clothing and rides and pick up venting cargo trucks taking aim at Mexico's Pacific coast hurricane Wilma a category for storm landfill as expected in West central and south western Mexico with maximum sustained winds of one hundred forty five miles per hour\nPrecipitation flash flooding storm surge in of course a very very strong wins or will be impacting ... probably expect uh the outer reaches of the tropical storm force winds are like laid off later tonight or early Tuesday Morning\nHurricane specialist Dave Robert is with the national Hurricane Center I head of the midterms Facebook is setting up a war room at its California headquarters to take aim at fake information Fox is Claudia ... was in the war\nWe got a chance to tour of this new war room which is actually a converted meeting space at Facebook's mellow park campus and we saw dozens of security experts in data scientists and engineers working around the clock to root out bad actors trying to mislead users about who they are and what they're doing\nFacebook criticized by Congress after Russian government linked operatives used the platform debate\nAmericans in twenty sixteen is Fox News\nThis is talk went on for now I didn't even [noise]\nSaudi foreign minister a gel I'll bear sat down for an exclusive interview with Fox has Brett there to explain why his government story keeps changing and the debt that Saudi journalist ...\n... to be the first step of the long term we are determined to uncover every stone we are determined to find out all the facts and we are determined to punish those who I was home schooled with this for the murder\nThe minister saying it was a rogue operation gone wrong a lot of police officers in the U.S wear body cameras now thousands in one of the country's largest departments will take them off the NYPD\nHas pulled nearly three thousand body camps off the streets after one exploded inside of Staten Island precinct early Sunday\nPolice spokesman says an officer noticed there was smoke exiting from the bottom portal and removed it immediately after that the device exploded the officer wasn't hurt the incident revealed a potential for the battery inside the camera to ignite\nThe company that owns the cameras are there working closely with the NYPD to investigate the issue ...

disaster in us naval history the two authors are Sarah ... an acclaimed documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis he became obsessed with the story at the age Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of Lebanon non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program ah I I'm blown away by your book great Debbie here\nRight here or\nA Sarah like to start with you how did you get hooked on the story at age Thirteen ah most ah teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nWell actually it was a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of this ship to a single line which was it was a ship that carry the bomb and sunk\nAdd to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library\n[laughter] imagine that and you know through looking to what was available at the library I still really couldn't find anything so I I Hope someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and so I\nYou know I thought out what I could but thought you know someone will tell the story before I'm old enough to do it and you know flash forward graduated from college and then well no one told the story you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who is the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion\nAnd that's where I actually got to meet them the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean you know I was a kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and they exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so you\nKnow they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visited them at their homes they asked me to be their storyteller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it [noise]\nAnd Lynn for you how did you uh hook up with Sarah on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be um an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very exciting project from either way I got involved when I had actually been praying I'm I I pray that my work and I had been praying to have an opportunity to work on an iconic well worth the story\nAnd all of a sudden in two thousand eleven additive flu I get this email from this young filmmaker and Sarah ... well what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis with that\nI'm being Indianapolis a storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay\nAnd she actually did that she wrote a an eight part\nLenny theory than she pitched it to a major production company and they said hey this is the best thing we can stand a\nBrother that we only the many theories on foot\nSo you're getting ready for a while she and a screenwriter I don't know how to write stuff though very family and friends she reached out and and they contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I Am and maybe a veteran who didn't know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one um [noise] and\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting to fight and I wanted to help her write the book [laughter] so uh my\nJoke is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or in the way to help her but uh eventually over the course of several\nMonths we finally met and then ah\nWe agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest into twenty four and um and then when we did it I guess the project pick a three and a half years\nSo Sarah where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the the people who had who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I I knew a small part of that um that would definitely\nPart of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she'd been reduced to\nThinking story or shark story and no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral Brent commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaign that have participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on so it was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did a besides being sent [noise]\nOr I'll tell you you grab ... my father was a at Okinawa and he ... he drove a landing craft from uh the ships took good troops on to the shores so of course you know that the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those complex grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn why don't we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the capitalize version of what the world knows about the the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that that you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned ... ... ... ... and I'm a small park that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle of half an hour where your father drove the\nLanding craft and I'm\nThe weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she with his opinion the shore of environment and during that time and march very first Nineteen forty five she'll be hit by kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty sick injured and that was what really that are on the fateful journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as victorious flagship of the world war two at the theater I'm Victoria\nAnd now as well as nine other major battle\nBut instead she went back to their island California for repairs and that's where she was on July sixteenth Nineteen forty five when general Leslie grows and the other leaders of Manhattan Project including President Truman decided that they want us to send the components of the atomic bomb\nThe questions as we go forward number one [noise] how old they get to the U.

D board somebody\n[noise]\n\n\nSaloon Vincent I interrupted you before the break we were about to tell me about the uh Japanese commander a little bit\nYes a commander ... lieutenant commander ... as I was saying we tried to present the Japanese point of view\nIn a sympathetic way I'm meaning that they were acting out of there since their conscience and conviction and so um we were able to make great use of ...\nUm\nWell it was it and then more sports that we've published after the war who first published in Nineteen fifty two and a Japanese language and it was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America in English\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two but written from men are hashing modus point of view and there was a chapter on his devoted to Indianapolis\nThat because we were looking at the larger Pacific War in the end of the of World War two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot he was the commander who cared for his men\nHe was a commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese submarines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military\nUm he went around saying on doors asking for radar and more technology for his that Marines because Japanese submarines didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was seeing a lot of his brother said commanders\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and then we're spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked\nAnd there was nothing left and so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of\nThe rescuers accounts because by the time that the rescue arrived the men were really incoherent they were able to tell or know what was happening by that point in the story but\nYou know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark and to attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know\nHow much sharks realize things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts um the attacks increased and you know this is I Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think seeing one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported\nThey were so sick they could walk on their backs you know from shark the shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they could stand on them\nThere's want to kill you have the sailor you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking things drugs they oh there's food just reached out and grab some food right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young and some by the name of John ... and he actually took his socks off and\nThinking he was going to wiggle his toes as bait to lower the sharks in and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realized oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and\nManaged to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSome of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah everyone knows it's almost the end of the war they were having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippine see\n'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but as Sarah mentioned there were only a sixteen\nRats between there were there were four groups was it three groups that there were four groups of four rap or three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right so so there were so any water that was available was only available\nOn the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in in the third day and they were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were some men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the dehydration itself was perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nThat some of them to come to the idea that they could strain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up a torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into this into\nNow and thinking that that would string folk out well of course that didn't and then other when you know take mall heard is that the water I'm hoping that no one would see them and talk and out of it but then eventually they would just begin coping it like they were hoping it out of a mountain stream\nAnd what happened with this is a condition called hyper ...\nAnd bought that food for blood cell ...\nFrom the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they die very horrible death from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself something else has to be around you that or it without a site all the sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess it immediately that it it sunk that quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a somewhere I was a pilot who ends up testifying at the court marshal later\nOr an American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention uh we got to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who had been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit with him and it's a late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see that you know kind of explosion coming from Milo and there's no report coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action do you think well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah I get to see any kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times and yeah the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he still want to hear a navy personnel at Guam I Believe\nYou know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in that area don't worry about it\nSo you know there's actually more to the story with that where you know they his son who you know the gentleman richer the friends that have passed away but his son carried on a story and you know there he\nActually had diary entries of the time and coordinate the one he saw this and it didn't line up with it but he didn't find out and tell a few days after when were released about it that he when\nWe're talking with Linda ... about Indianapolis

there didn't need to be a report made\nOh he wasn't the brightest guy in the world and a as a matter of fact I had received a fitness report saying as much but he thought well\nIf I don't have to reporter rivals have combatant ships I guess that means I don't have to report non arrivals either\nAnd then you know to be fair to the navy the entire focus was on the impending invasion of the Japanese home islands so all of these things along with the lack of a distress signals combine to make it says in Indianapolis slip through the cracks\nAnd it wasn't until a PD one venture a bomber piloted by lieutenant check when I'm just happened to be flying over the area that the survivors responded in the water\nThere is a very poignant story you tell in the books are about these pilots do dropped all the supplies and try to give these guys are the water or something you hang onto and they're they can't do any more they're out of supplies they have to hit back and there was one guy who's swimming way up\nIn the middle all by himself just swimming is a I don't know where he was swimming do or what he was doing but there was nothing they could do for them\nI mean I imagine that being\nSo terrible to witness you know your did everything you could you find out there's no there's nothing left and your plane to help this little loan swimmer\nAnd you know and then I Believe when they got to land they actually found one more life jacket or something they could have thrown and you know speaking to any of these men reading\nTheir testimonies later on it affected them the rest of their lives they were devastated about not being able to do more and that was really the sentiment and most of the rescuers you know they were out there feeling like they were playing God you know are these men alive or they\nYou know who do we take for you know our ship or else the VP is the landing craft is full what do we do if we can't say one more man and he's still alive and you know that was a burden they carry till the end of their lives\nYou know it's war time is when the focus is on you know Japan and ending the war and a lot of big stuff going on so things did fall through the cracks but uh [noise] is it an accident that the story was kept out of the newspapers until BJ day well reporters\nAre reporting on at the at reporting on the incident at the times did not believe it was an accident\nSo the rescue occurred beginning on August second uh Nineteen forty five and the war ended on August fourteenth that between the time zones fourteenth fifteenth Nineteen forty five\nAnd they did not announce that Indianapolis had been sunk the newspapers did not release it Washington not didn't Washington did not release it\nUntil VJ Day until they announced that Japan had surrendered and that the war was over so if you can imagine huge banner headlines on August fifteenth Nineteen forty five I mean Seventy two point headlines\nYou know Japan quit the war is over\nThen maybe below the fold in a very small article you with us Indianapolis cruiser sunk and reporters that time believed that Washington and the navy specifically did that to divert attention away from this disaster that was\nYou know resulted in the loss of almost nine hundred men on the very brink of the end of the war\nSooner or talk to me about the captain McVeigh and what's going through his head and then was the court marshal inevitable let him slide given that the war just did or did they have to pursue this\nWill really there was an enormous pressure from the eight hundred and Seventy nine families who lost loved ones on the ship to have answers to have someone to point a finger at and so you know this is\nA tremendous loss for the navy and you know so many people and it was a very public you know\nLike Clinton said this was announced when the victory of Japan over Japan was announced to the world and people are out celebrating the ... in the streets split their family is now grieving that their son or their brother their uncle is not coming home and people wanted answers and so\nYou know it wasn't obvious that a court martial would be taking place I think on the onset\nBut as the investigation started you know revealing things and who was involved and who knew what was happening and what did happen prior to the sinking and how it could have prevented and maybe not the sinking prevented but certainly the fact that no one knew they were missing and that they were left out there to die you know\nSomeone needed to be to blame\nAnd a lot of people got blamed right\nThere were there were a lot of people who were brought in for questioning there was a quarter of inquiry that was done and you know it's revealing that\nThese are pretty important people that had information that could have prevented this situation and so really you know at the time these names you know admiral king Bruins limits and all these these men who were\nEssentially the rock stars of that area you know we won the war and\nIn the American public you know holds these men on this high platform and we can and they are the same time are we supposed to bring them into a courtroom\nAnd have them testify and turned her surname sick I don't think that the navy wanted to take that route and essentially you know the captain is responsible for the vessel so the moment that he was\nBrought to court martial there was nothing to do but find him guilty even though it wasn't just\nA little is talking about the court martial of our mentioned earlier the unusual step of bringing the the Japanese commander in justify that had never happened before and then uh I guess the main thrust of the argument against the captain that he will do the exact the exact thing could have prevented the Japanese from sinking ship\nThat was one of the two charges on and not only was it unprecedented to bring in command her how she might have to testify but it was unprecedented that a captain with the court martialed at all for having his shit sunk in World War two there were hundreds of vessels fund\nAnd kept in Charles McVeigh was the only cap and he was court martialed [noise]\nExcuse me and I'm\nSo glad he did have to charges against him one was and by the way the navy we we found in a records because we went to the national archives we went to the library of Congress Naval War college and so forth\nAnd we found these records where the navy was actually casting about to find that charge that they thought would pick\n'em and as Sarah mentioned there were all these leading lights of the Pacific war who were involved in this you know the the commander of specific forces the commander in Guam and these were men who had really been the architects of this new global sea power\nAnd admiral Ernest King who was the fleet admiral\nOur theory is that he didn't want to see all these leading lights dragged into court and so that's why they were casting about for something that would stick\nWith Nick day and so what they charged him with was\nFailure to call a band and shit in a timely manner which was quickly disproven because there were a lot of witnesses who um heard him call abandoned ship and then heard it passed man demand the second shift as you are the second charge rather as you mentioned with failure to think that\n... was an anti submarine warfare tactic worship which they're back and forth across based course\nHoping to throw off the aim of the Japanese said commander\nAnd indeed happened make they did the stick as the ... at evening twilight or just before the ship was sunk but the standing orders of the military put that in his purview that was at his discretion and he chose to exercise that discretion\nUm and then one commander ... testified at the trial he said that he would

working imagination the name of the book Nicholas how many twilight zone episodes were there a hundred and fifty six\nWell that's why I think ... gallery that came out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately\nWhat was his role\nWell he he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called my gallery it was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even ... he's the one will probably pitched it to the network will I bring all\nThe yeah after that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and and he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see\nThat kind of his absence come up all the time in episode where you say uh you know rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow can we never wrote a book\nWell he never wrote a novel he did write your collections of short stories\n... sure but I mean the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually\nThe stories that made up tonight gallery movie uh they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary um some but he never\nHad the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with tells you know he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away for long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThere's there's going to be removed the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out or is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it\nAnd from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise]\nYou know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kinda thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with the new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know the going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are that can be ... reintroduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wandering around surely one of the co writers a planet of the apes\nHe sure was and a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was\nHe didn't really get credit for it to\nWell he did get literally get credit for you on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling\nA so called credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of you know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was not gallery your twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a\nHeat you know Carol Serling was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer to give she said that he wanted to believe\nHe had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know we only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own you never saw a spaceship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular ah documentaries about this\nThe thing you know search you mentioned astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of and during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess minus commercial time there were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays or thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four year last commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed routes for like write a story in a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often\nA complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story in twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pin point your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah as you said they're so they're so different it was very hard to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know hard science fiction fantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so\nUm you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to\nThrow a couple of my favorite at this point probably is is walking distance rod Serling first season a episode about his kind of archetype will you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know really this youth and go back to a easier less stressful\nLife was that the Willoughby or it's just like well yeah it's kind of a stop it will be a kind of a companion piece to distance\nYeah so they both very similar and they're both among among the favorites and that was that was a big theme visceral English this idea of going\nBack to his innocent youth in in Binghamton New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was a classic a\nMan is absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still now to this day they know that ending its a cookbook you know they that's\nThat's [laughter] ever [laughter] and they're just so many good the uh what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and start a average Sloan who actually started rod Serling his very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater\nOr he started that and you start in the fever and yeah exactly he was he was against gambling and he got ... kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine that he thinks is taunting him\nAnd it drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah\nAll right

have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens more often\nThan you would think George is\nWell the money used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans are today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized all any program [noise] ah so the federal tax payer puts the money out\nA and the federal taxpayer 'em\nAnd let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education a ended sort of crony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that\nEssentially away from the taxpayer and they keep it for themselves [laughter] ah but um so yeah this is a federal program money it ultimately comes from the taxpayer who\nAt this point as I said is making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit\nOr and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's uh something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in various states\nThere are there are state use three laws in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fared\n... practice laws\nFederal um a fruit than lending laws uh and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of this the genesis of\nThis really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway ... ball of bankers a which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes\nServed on the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae\nWho had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system so you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nUh like many of the state run guaranteed horse in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the\nThe fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for a parent to you is child has a ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the only good advice that I can give it to this point George is June borrow and if you have to borrow\nYour not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy rights are and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collector practices treated lending a state your three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections but I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you absolutely have to borrow [noise]\nGo to a private bank guinea private line of credit or and do it that way because we then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type\nOf loan whatever happened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded people\nWell you know George ... of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices are so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding et cetera\nCan keep up with their budgets um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University is now Seventy thousand dollars\nA year well I can guarantee you now you're per year that's tuition room OR Books um for a four year course for a four year college\nAnd by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the cat birth she they can't because there's there's a winning programs to anybody in the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing to polish much dead on the actual students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raised their prices but\nAlso really straining to students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the pre your cautious just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars and that\nThere was a story just recently where they see\nA guy walked out of school with a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder if that's all uh the belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know at this really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um [noise] have to charge a huge amount to pay off that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments for people like Jamie diamond a gp Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how the student loan problem is\nReally affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off\nThat's Ninety million dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses

years\n[noise]\n\n\nWell come back to ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loans game what was it Allen that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans I've three degrees in engineering and um\nI graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for short amount of time [noise] uh and I tried everything I could to keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera uh but what I fell into in what uh\nProbably forty percent of everybody out there with student loans is falling into\nA is a system that actually want you to default and so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is what happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine a and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with the Leslie stall you know a a piece for which\nSallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed I might\nAdd a and so it's sort of snowball from there I\nUnfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that will change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits\nOr have a a very difficult time to make payments seemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick\nIn by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory are that are geared mark for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got these student loans situations and one of the worst icy are these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them with just what you said they want the default so what they'll do is\nThey'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans\nIt's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look it's has great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know this car has no brakes what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know\nUh and this in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income\nPeople um you know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this is rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans\nAnd it's about I mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and how cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the Lenny system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs Raziq greasy once once the tuition like in Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse early as probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nAnd there are even more schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three or four\nYears I should have pushed my kids into sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece crazy so this has\nJust gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college well\nYou know those days are long gone on the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid flying\nLet's go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge high on a good thank you\nGeorge I got good news for you too man a Trump rally over there and laugh at it on the other day\nYeah there was a big signs they drop support sealed and he looked right at the whole ...\n[laughter] I Love it\nBut uh anyway uh I I drive a little bit of traits will do\nA ... a day to work or I got on egg wildly and when a company went under the under the conflict and I'm a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know and it was a sad time but ah pretty much went under and they laid everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people too so I looked at her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone as fast as I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without too\nWell and I think also for a couple of years you know\nYou probably in more and more experience than most people\nYeah and I looked at the local school there and they were voting for thousands of dollars that go for oh I think it was a two month course just don't take well you know their way\nSo I ended up going and less than ... dollars on a great little are learning to drive semi thrive and then I felt like I got ... I found out that I could have done it for about half the price down\nLet's get your reaction to the cell and where do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket you know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that\nUh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools are as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the\nGordon and Lakeland, Florida Gordy go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em out to publicly think Alan he's the one pointed out to me that the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages credit card lending um and of course a tuition inflation I I already knew\nThat the more you subsidize the lungs especially the taxpayer on the hook 'em it's going to crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total that his college did\nI Want to find out what happened where is this fall and we will probably know that by the end of the\nPresident says he has asked turkey to share the audio recording which they claim proves the Washington Post contributor was murdered in a city council it in Turkey newspaper will be paying tribute on Thursday\nI Want to find out what\nThe Washington Post publishing a spinal column from ... in it he warns that the Arab world is facing its own iron curtain in costs were free expression writing quote the Arab world needs a modern version of the old transnational media\nSo citizens can be informed about global events that poses they held off and publishing column and hopes to show he would return posted or county or writing she had hoped to become together with him but adds quote now I have to accept that it's not going to happen this is the last piece of his I Would edit for the post\nFox's Sean ... the former presidents of USA Gymnastics has been arrested after a grand jury in Texas indicted Steve petty charges of tampering with evidence in the case of Dr Larry Nassar the former team doctor convicted of sexual assault involving scores of young athletes in baseball the games they've been catching the American league championship series\n[noise]\n\nFly at Andersen with a call on CBS as the Boston Red Sox beat the Houston Astros eight to six the Sox tickets three games to one lead and the American league championship series earlier the Dodgers beat the brewers five to two they take a three games to two lead in the national league championship series [noise]\nThis is Fox News [noise]\nThis is news talk went on for now I'd be American astronaut who suffered through a white ... space capsule failed to reach orbit last week speaking out about the ordeal\nNASA astronaut Nick hang his it was the closest call at his career he went into a light on board of Washington so here's rocket and one of the boosters to separate for triggering an automatic aboard and\nThen I saw the booster failure light inside the capsule and at that point you know I realize hey we're not going to make it to where I'm at today\nAt that point he says his training kicked in he knew he had to stay calm and ...\nAnd after two years of training in Russia in ... he was missing control\nSneeze commander has not Alexi ... in Washington plunging back towards earth that you were suggesting the forces seven times the strength of our gravity before the parachutes popped open and their Soyuz capsule came to rest in a remote part of Kazakhstan\nFox is Christian Fisher it's setting a sentencing day on Thursday\nFor former FBI agent who admits he leaked documents to a reporter Teri ... will be sentenced in federal court in Saint Paul Minnesota or an authorized disclosure of national defense information prosecutors are asking that he get a minimum of four years in prison a Florida Man is going to prison for targeting target\nThis goes way beyond short selling fifty year old mark Barnett a prosecutor say wanted to bomb target stores to drive the company's stock price down has been sentenced to forty years behind bars turns out that are purchased options on target stock that would pay out when the share price drop\nYou off at a confidential source ten thousand dollars to place homemade explosive devices disguised as food packaging store shelves from Florida to New York\nBest to get a spouse bomb making materials at Barnett house devices were turned over to law enforcement by the informant Barnett arrested\n...

thank you and I'm hoping to hear more of it before Halloween that point though I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a my loans and all or a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off on my credit report and lo and behold the same way this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nAnd hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information is a hundred percent correct the principal was\nSixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listed a breakdown of all of the uh uh costs that I've heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you give me do I try to negotiate directly with the the oh he tried to negotiate with these people I mean there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a fee\nSounds like another scam Alan what do you think\nRight I mean first of all I Would I Would never\nDeal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is non to give other than\nHelping us fight for H. are twenty three sixty six and getting out of bankruptcy right back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with their third party collection companies\nI'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education [noise] so\nI mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent of the lake it alone he'll take it all the you know that's something you can do but certainly dealing with a very close to me like like what you describe it and they get\nThe information Ellen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find this republic clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good um but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the new rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to add cost onto the process\nBy a friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt you've\nNever heard from them again well\nYou have to be very careful these are some be loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead and in\nMy leaders down the line at least expect it\nThat's right yeah they they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having statute of limitations these things can follow you literally to the grave\nWell what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent typically order loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original shy and\nPromise [laughter] not at all Allen once again thank you for the information truly enjoyed

real ... has been working as a consultant or spokesperson on numerous illegal in the movies TV shows video games as well and tonight we're going to be talking about aliens at the Pentagon and Nick welcome back it's always great\nIt's great to be back on the shirt and how you doing these days yeah good thing [noise]\nWhere do we last see each other contacted the desert we were there when you\nAnd I'm now was that before off to your life event in Salt Lake City which we did\nA that was right around that same period yeah yeah that was fun you did a great job there thank you\nGreat job aliens at the Pentagon I Love this title tell me more\nOkay it's a essentially it is my new documentary that I put out to tell the story all off certainly the Pentagon's\nUFO program a tip but she can text you alliance that story and and really to\nTo try in one don't humane tree to tell as as best as I can the entire story of the U.S government for any relationship with this phenomenon of ah watch seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of that\nThey are absolutely staggering there's no doubt that this has been the biggest single revelation in in the UFO community for I I think decades I the only story that I think comes\nClose and I would say this wouldn't die if the classification and release of the British Government files but the the revelation that off to decades have to know how the U.S government did have a new effort program off to roll and it was run by the ... super secretive defense intelligence\nAgency I'm I'm from an agency of the day and and you know like you say for years they said no no since project to close down we haven't been doing this this knowing traffic or no investigations and of course\nThey were and that's what I really focus on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try to train on tangle the numerous threats to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk of\nOf mistreatment polls there all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this the robot big yellow a Senator Harry Reid told the long I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up in honey you track all this stuff is coming from all different directions\nI think the answer that one is is very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely in meticulous detail because I think the problem with this story in one sense for years\nPeople have said the problem is that particularly with the gal them we have two little information about what's going on with the aid kit story with with these revelations um we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's it's just about okay for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just that confusing mess if you if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen they are they a landmark story on this on\nDecember sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out to first than a than a third one\nBut now the public have been absolutely bombarded there thinking yeah well this the videos and then this this walk strong guy and then this this ... million at businessmen\nAnd and struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's that's what I've tried to do to take a step back\nAnd and give people an overview of this from my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nDo me a little bit more about the film we're getting a lot in the course tonight Pentagon but tell us specifically about\nWell I took a long on on on this one and it was quite a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seats and and you've done this of course civilian time yourself you know you sit in the hot seat a direct to kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and also the question is this I when you see the final product sometimes you think well well you know I've got edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd\nPut that but in and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon what I did cite teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would ... this thing so I scripted the entire movie that the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and unfold in that way I have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a recording studio you know you had it all ... headphones on and I knew right did the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a direct to who's done a brilliant job of putting it all a together I'm Mike along I but I was very much in the driving seat having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can while I Can't say gosh this this somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure from me it's a completely\nNew role to me I mean there are people of course who are used to this sort of thing or people like Jeremy ... just made a ... a great movie but um you know I I it was a departure for me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish with the Pentagon\n[noise] firstly\nI as I say really to try to\nTalk through some of the the confusion about what's been going on and just tell the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this\nI think we probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field has is it we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand\nWe go ahead on to all the platforms that the young people\nYou watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days\nSo it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food to and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take this subject no not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd\nBut but to young people and and another thing is you know it's been a year since termed along had his press conference where he\nTogether with the ... people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times ran than story I I did ... uh you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon I wanted to reignite\nYes and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization now like you said I I'm beginning to feel is the momentum is waning what do you\n... when when you say the organization um he\nRight yes um well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this the U.S government has had voted always says\nThese sorts of situations only as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know where the eight tip is still an ongoing project\nI I think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and\nStill has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going\nFox is rich and sort of the state department Turkey's government claims to have graphic audio recordings which they say prove cause

[laughter]\nWell I'm not sure about that but um I guess there are there are a handful of physicists working on that Ronald Merrill it comes to mind yep\nBut I think there are some some others or you know I had a job in the ministry defense where I was paid to think the unsinkable so I I don't really things out\nDid you get involved in remote viewing or anything like that psychic work with the ministry you did\nI I mean we had you can't run a UFO program without finding you know the the focal point for anything\nYou saw that any any one kind of comes to the government about and of course we had we had people who said that they psychics and they wanted to volunteer their services to the intelligence community to help us well you know locate\nSoviet ballistic missile submarines a mosque by some trade has that sort of thing\nSo we looked at this as a classic low probability high impact and Ari I probably wouldn't work but if it does the payoff is so big wine on\nSo we actually did have a

classified I think the ... it's now classified\nAnd only ministry defense website actually or on the national archives website I'm not sure where but it said that it it wasn't a very good study I have to say it didn't live in the last of the U.

when\nI'm I suspect now it'll be next year because of of course we've we've just had the bruising judge Kavanaugh um ...\nWe coming up to the midterms but as I say we know the Senate Armed Services Committee and the house armed services committee have been looking for is the ... ha it\nHave been doing and secondly I think that interest has said wait until the white a question of you ate pays\nMore generally we actually know in parallel that that a representative Amy Farrah I think it was a has had some discussions with the chair of the uh science technology and space committee\nAnd the space subcommittee that could actually be a little bit of a don't fight about that I mean that's another\nPoint if this congressional interest which we know Israel\nEvolves into formal congressional hearings the question arises well where should those hearings the as I say should they should they sit in the armed Services Committee or in the the space sub committee or the the science technology and space\nMain committee I think I think he will be difficult to get it away from the military frankly hit with a a military and intelligence program and I just don't see how you would get it out of of the armed Services Committee and indeed\nOne of the subcommittee is is is the emerging threats and capabilities\nSubcommittee which specifically talks and it terms of reference\nAbout unconventional threats will if ever there was like a forum to to discuss the UAE pay a mystery it's it's a lot so so you you know I I think it ... we know as an absolute indisputable fact\nThat there is congressional in traffic we know that there is lobbying going on for formal hearings I've actually I Can't say too much about this but I I supplied some briefing myself and I've certainly set that I'd be I'm happy to to testify if my own experience of having done this for the British Government\nWould be useful um but but watch this space one of the other things which I think it is bizarre and fascinating is I think so far there have only been for\nA national daily newspaper reports that have actually gone into the fight but yes there is this congressional interest in UFOs and you know what all four of those articles or in British newspapers\nNo among us one us no not yet\nNo no thank God we do what we do and we have so many good podcaster is also doing what they do to get the word out there\nI Am so lately but but this is going to transition into the mainstream and and just this week fortunately I got the chance one one of the things is I Know do some work as a freelance journalist myself\nAh it it's kind of like like we said with a million of penned again you know if you don't like the way that you you are portrayed on TV sometimes running your own documentary well I I take the same view with newspaper articles and this this week I had an article published\nIn the guardian newspaper which is is one of the most respected national daily nearing\nAgreed on line or two\nYeah I absolutely as they will have to be these days and and my my article in the guardian basically um I expose this the Senate Armed Services Committee and House Armed services\nCommittee interest and I I think that things will be going on behind the scenes as a result of that article but it it's it's staggering but have before articles I've seen about this all four of them a great ... one US\nI'd love to see a survey by the way you just mentioned the Internet on line or I'd love to see a survey of twenty five to thirty [noise] in that category who read a newspaper every day as opposed to going online and I bet it's like Ninety eight percent on line\nI'm sure you're right I mean I'm of course off off the age where I like a hard copy newspaper in my

you too I'm trying to get time to do a live show in Indianapolis perhaps the next year if we can pull that off I think he was also talking about Nick the Condon Report [noise]\nYes um that that was um of course widely regarded now as a bit of a ... job and I think quite rightly the U.S air force made it quite clear that they wanted just to get out of the UFO\nBusiness or at least they want it to the public out and that's another point that we make in in the documentary aliens Pentagon really the one thing of project Blue Book\nUm which was kind of just like the program went dark\nAnd of course this is the famous\nUh Poland a memo\nWhich which says the UFO reports which could affect national security are all made a in accordance with I think it's a chain up one for six\nAnd ... part of the blue book system so so in other words the clue with there all along that that you ate he reports that had national security implications we're never going to be in the public program of Blue
