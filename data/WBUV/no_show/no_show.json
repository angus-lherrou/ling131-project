Would normally asked a group of managers all in one of our classes um what what do you get an organization when you get low morale\nName off a few things that you can think of\nFluff poor decision making a antagonism back biting lack of enthusiasm for pleasing the customer achieving the goal I mean the list goes on and on\nCapitol it in fact you've gotten several of the big ones right there you there's a my favorite Stephen Covey quotes um she says you can pay for my back in my hands but I volunteer my heart's in my brain and that is so true and the the way it works is is if if I don't have\nModerate to high morale as an employee or if it's a if it's a low morale work environment which is a real thing um it is really hard to volunteer heart and brain\nOr you're going to get the basic stuff but\nYou're not going to get the extra you're not going to get the stuff that you can't pay for and you can't punish for um that means you not any ... creativity you're not going to get
