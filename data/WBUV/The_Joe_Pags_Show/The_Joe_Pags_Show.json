talk about things that were happening on the field and off that you didn't like\nMhm I don't see any of that any more what I don't either when I hear antics of yes yep week I think what we're talking about somebody who's very demonstrative\nI think somebody who celebrates somebody who uh has a lot of movement after every hit snaps bats over his knee when he strikes out\nIn the world or baseball that's seen as being um attention seeking but if you put yourself weaken the NBA he would be in the middle of the road draft soccer nothing middle of the road\nPut them on a football field nothing nothing\nYou know and so you're talking about also if you really want to make baseball um you want to improve it you want to change the way that it is perceived you had to make it about the culture so I'll say this um\nYou know if you will young people young demographic they pay attention you won't people of color to really pay attention to baseball you have to make it hip and cool and fun part of the reason the NBA has been able to benefit is they embraced\nThe young people they've embrace the urban ... the urban coach you if you want to call it that\nAnd so if baseball refuses to do that they're always going to lag behind football and basketball and that you have seen\nFootball which everyone probably doesn't necessarily things but football is really a conservative ... you think about all of the out military stuff and how they basically sell the team over the individual but even they had to relent and allow players to celebrate and be more demonstrative on the field and kind of let their personalities\nAre floors and what has happened\nRatings are up ratings are a great ratings are good people are talking about it despite all the stuff people talked about what the anthem the TV ratings reflect something differently and part of that is because going up and they let letting people have fun okay if I Want to be entertained I Want to feel like the people that are entertaining me or having fun\nWhat if I turn the tables on us though for one second because I've been a pick pick pick in were picnic picnic baseball you need to change this need to change that what if I turn the tables on us for one second\nAnd I ask is part of this simply didn't twenty Eighteen we don't have the attention span\nFor baseball anymore not just as a sport but the length of the season you know you get a caller earlier talking about cost um there are one\nHundred sixty two games it does not create urgency when they're that many games\nOr to be a quote unquote season ticket holder is not only a cost issue like it is in every sport but it's quite frankly a time issue\nLike how am I going to make that worthwhile to be a season ticket holder when the team comes for a two week homestead I've got to go to the ballpark six nights a week [laughter] are you kidding me who got time for this so baseball it's why won't play fantasy baseball\nI've played than I only play fantasy football I don't do basketball either because it's a smaller version of the same thing I played fantasy baseball one time I'm like I don't I Can't do this every day\nShe can go on the website every day like let me set a lineup for one week short\nBut it's just too much do we have the attention span for these that\nYou know I think that has something to do it it is lifted you had to have a lot of stamina to be able to endure\nA baseball season hundred sixty two games close to postseason a it's a lot to keep up with I've always told my friends look I tune into baseball when it when we get to August I Am I'm

Fox News authorities in Pittsburgh say eleven people were killed when a man entered a synagogue and the city's squirrel hill neighborhood and open fire six other people were wounded including for police officers\nThe ah ridiculous legacy disgusting media reporting that it's the Naga bomber the make America great again bomber which is disgusting\nReporting that the bomber was going after Trump targets no not the case will you have is a bad guy who did something very bad\nAnd calling him demographer bomber is not only inappropriate it shows that you shouldn't be in the journalism business at all those of us on the political opposite side we're not calling the\nShooter advocating rational baseball game there seemed to shoot her\nEven though he was a vehement Bernie Sanders supporter that's not what we do\nThat's also not being honest and it's not reporting the news\nAs as it is in reality\nSo we've got more violence today we don't know why other than this person allegedly shouts some sort of hatred and I'm\nAn incredible hatred and loading of of people have the Jewish faith we don't have any motive other than that we don't know his name although it's been reporter to use a white guy with a beard\nAnd ... also was reported that the bombing suspect it was a white guy to that guy list themselves as Native American this first name as Caesar or says are so he could be Hispanic as well and also a report that he's a child even fill up you know\nThe media always though quick to say it's a white I remembered George Zimmerman the guy who killed Trayvon\nAnd because Martin went back and was beating the hell out of 'em in in self defense he shot and killed him they reported him as a white guy for a long time until they had to wants his picture was out there admitted that he was this panic so then they started calling him a white Hispanic\nSo dumb that is so the media always is looking for a spin I'm always going to give it to you straight as I can\nAnd that's what we have a Pittsburgh I'll give you updates as we go I definitely want your thoughts on this uh this bombing suspect that is a ... that's under arrest and even more than that I mean it looks like it's some nut job who had some crazy delusion about\nWhat his role should be in politics in this country I mean just the pictures the van itself if you're looking at a going what there was a guy riding down the street with a van that looked like that and nobody suspected and even here's a guy with a ... a substantial criminal record\nYears and years and years of convictions who by the way was a registered Democrat I've seen reports that he switched to Republican and twenty sixteen\nAnd suddenly Trump made them do it according to the media\nSends out a bunch of alleged bombs I'm not even convinced they were really bombs but he sends out a bunch of alleged bombs to people we return addresses on these fake addresses on the actual said into an area they were supposed to show up at all these prominent Democrats houses and their officers they never made it there\nBut it's for the media it's not about are the bad guys off the street thank God nobody was hurt it's more about\nTrump did this I guess there was some letter signed by hundreds of journalists about how Trump is somehow inciting violence against journalists that's not true he's done nothing like that in fact that sounds really stupid and an journalistic to even say something like that\nIn fact I can make a good argument that the media is inciting violence against those who support President Trump\nYou have you were a make America great again hat you're a target and that's okay\nIf you go to a Trump rally or you have a Trump bumper sticker you're a racist in his ... and that's OK the media school with that\nYou're late night talk shows calling the president's mouth a blank holster for for ... that's okay that's perfectly fine\nFake news incessantly that's just the way it is well correct it later\nAnd there are there is an example of for example to resemble a vet with the media again playing the victim in fact Jim Acosta from CNN the other day tweeted out this\nAppointment or ... over the fact that when President Trump was talking about the bombs that were they were going he didn't mention CNN specifically give that in mind this is a guy whose job is supposed to be to go there to report the news and he's not ever supposed to be the story is mad that he wasn't the story\nAnd when the president does call CNN out than a cost in in in his ilk say he shouldn't be doing that he's putting his endangering denigrating what we do for a living so make you make your mind up either you want to be mentioned by the president or you don't want to be under the president you don't get to tell the president what mentioned he has to make\nFor you so I mean we're living in bizarro world here really are\nThose who perpetrate violence on the left should be arrested and or or killed in the act like the guy with the shooter was in that congressional baseball practice\nThey should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sent away for as long as we possibly can those who committed violence in there on the right same thing should apply\nBut the selective reporting and there's the desire by the media to pretend like one side is inciting violence and the other side is and it's just a crazy person that was an aged vats irresponsible\nThat's responsible or by the way that the bombing suspect very odd the whole thing's odd claims he's a seminal Indian is\nFamily or a family friend or a lawyer somebody claimed that he wasn't at all that he isn't one by one name that he went by different name one name sounded Native American or American indian and the other one sounded Italian first they've certainly sounds Hispanic\nWho knows what he is when we do know is he was some promoter for chipping nails and some bouncer at at a bar even the night before he was arrested\nSo whatever the the left is trying to glean from him and put it on Trump easier responsible and stupid\nAnd the media needs to learn it's job again the job is to go there observing and tell us what you saw\nIs not drug or observe and then tell us why Trump caused it that makes no sense so I'll keep you updated on what's happening in Pittsburgh certainly got a bunch of interviews coming your way a bunch of interviews\nI might take some

are you\nI'm good thanks for having me on what what an incredible time we're living in right now want to get into the incredible succession\nThe positivity that came out about that rally on Monday but I'd be remiss to not today I'm first asked you about the arrest of is this person but police say the FBI shows was this idiot but since I got a bunch of bombs but what are your thoughts when you see that I personally as a family man is a community member really relieved that we got um what what are you from yeah\nThat was my first time relieved a cop that that is good police law enforcement work obviously this guys had a history\nOf uh of problems you have a ... and then sending in in threatening to blow up folks and so we don't know the intent behind all this but we do know this is a person that ah frankly um and I don't know what to greet how much damage would have been done but can you imagine you know\nHad like a lot and right let me pick the lord they didn't they didn't know what I mean forget about it I had to get it didn't get into the hands of the targets but people at these postal facilities and people at the mail rooms of these different buildings would have been you know really in dire straits here\nYeah I I I took a A R e fighters advice early on and said you know so much stopped talking about by politicians and pundits let's do the investigative work and find out who this is that's exactly what happened I think that's the right way to go after\nI think so too it's a Kevin Brady of House Ways and Means Committee chair what one last thing on that\nUm is there any changing how the media is doing is they're calling you bowed demographer bomber the ... the people did not call the guy who shut up the baseball practice and almost killed these college they didn't call him a senior shooter or some ... why is there a double standard here and\nThere is a Joe I play baseball I played second base with Steve and I had missed the shooting by only\nA few minutes no in fact the coach after batting practice or after I took a swing so do you want to take some ground is the second I looked out the was take them I Know I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just well about foreign minister ahead of the shooting so uh this is a ... yeah\nMedia um there is a double standard here in in in I guess my frustration is all be blamed president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric they often um are filing when you hear\nHillary Clinton you know urge instability or Maxine Waters Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence and\nThen rock Obama and Eric Holder and began to list we've got soundbites from all of them\nThat are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well of violence happens they made it happen I mean we we'd like to see them down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up of baseball practice or a bad guy since uh bombs I I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm going to lead the guy who did it\nYeah it's the guy yeah that's exactly right and and that's the way it ought to be handled so you know it is the the year where frankly President Trump can't even breathe right for some people you write criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for security it's just unbelievable\nI had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the region a librarian and he's the executive director there and we were comparing and contrasting what this president has accomplished to what Ronald Reagan accomplished and the fact that thirty five forty years later\nThe media looks back in ... you know lovingly and and they didn't love and back then um and and they're treating Trump horribly and basically they've got about the same record in fact the Heritage Foundation finds this president is even more conservative than President Reagan was yeah I mean it it it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point but thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan perhaps of grace president in modern times yeah probably is in my view you know has two legacies\nTax cuts that the ... the economy for decades in in the United prosperity and rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half really and then you put on top of that this amazing\nA record in the courts of a constitutional judges from\nThe Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt it's a remarkable success yet the media\nAgain is never going to give them a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair\nIt'd be the success that we're seeing\nWas fueled by what you came up with ... you worked on this night and day I remember you\nYour jaw I Want to come on but I only been two minutes and you're like you're you're breaking pencils him going crazy with a with 'em all sorts of what how do we make this happen and you did somehow\nAnd all of us every American who pays taxes got a break every American the pays taxes as a bigger paycheck many Americans three four five six million either got bonuses or they got raises companies are are no manufacturing stuff here again or promising to start doing it\nSo the other side Kevin seem all that success as\nWe got we got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations again and drive them out of the country how is it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so appealing and tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code where every month we saw another us company moving overseas or manufacturing overseas or jobs overseas and in in in a period where President Obama\nYou know that was the weakest economic recovery um since World War two right and he never had a year never\nShocking President Trump for Nissan for nine years Iraqi

going to have John Hi Bush shown to use going to be the bottom up next our use the executive director of the regular Institute out in California great conversation to bury the media and how we treated Reagan and how we acted back to them with how\nThe current president President Trump is acting towards the media also ... you'll be off the top of the hour\nYup the former communications director for president Donald Trump what the hell out but they're easily on the job for eleven days or bad for you to write none of the phone line so let me see a little walk and chew on line one is Lisa in California Lisa\nI'm living the dream which I but\nI like the last caller talking about I'm\nSure for gold are on that story ... ... ... how would you\nStart out the bad guys again I'll tell you I'm a great guy but you know I when I go to church I go to church and I don't like that\nAnybody that might that might come under attack against the bad guy with a guy you know\nWell I first and foremost would allow concealed carry a church is a ... that's for sure I terrier done everywhere I'm allowed to ah I live in Texas still allowed to in many places but at the same time they're also signs up that prohibited from carrying my gun I think at that point if you're going to\nIf you're a church or any facility that can be deemed a soft target\nThe simple answer is that if you're not going to allow me to carry my garden\nAnd you should but if you're not gonna allow me to you better have protection there for my family\nAnd for me and that goes for any facility whether it's a movie theater or school or church or whatever I mean I'm so sick and tired of seeing signs up and say that that prevent you from carrying concealed handgun you want to to get a license for and you've gone through the classes for a and then there's no protection whatsoever I mean we can look at the Aurora shooting a gun in Colorado\nThat guy quite literally avoided six other theaters in the area because they all allowed people to carry guns but once the interview tack did not allow good guys like you and me to carry guns in their twelve people died\nSo I think that you have to work in conjunction synagogue should either allow people to conceal carry and they'll be do or don't I'm guessing they don't or they should they should have protections to make sure nobody gets in there with a gun I Would also close it down to one entrance annex it\nThis way anybody getting ... getting out or anybody get a good move there can be an emergency exit on the other side to get out but anybody getting into that facility and they want to cause harm you're gonna you're gonna identify them before they could pull the trigger one gun\nSure I mean I guess if they can do it at the land they can certainly do it at a church\nWill they will be doing it moved in the halls of Congress they do it at the White House\nSo show the people that we pay to be our legislators are representatives or a president they are protected one hundred percent I've been to the White House you can't get anywhere near that place until you have a full body scan so why can't they do something to protect the good guys when they're out there a church synagogue school whatever they happened to be doing\nYeah as much as I don't think it's a bad idea there there are other things I think that come into play in like obviously the economic a\nFull body scan for example or even a metal on you know those are those are those items that it's not just that have an accent the people around them and then at church probably qualified people that are going to be there any way that I\nEnded up in their training and then right no I just feel like\nIt like I said it's not just I don't agree with you I I certainly think that it would be a great idea I also almost more ... think that it's not a realistic I yeah\nI I I think that you allow concealed carry them almost at a time if they do allow concealed carry by guys like you and me\nCongregation members that people know and that we know have have gone through the steps to get the license to be able to carry like that also you you just have a bus system where you have to be ... to ... to ...

six other people were injured including for police officers the suspect other us\nWell yeah what was there for a wedding date it was a\n... amazing days come on let's\nAppreciate I had a great time you know unfortunately I made a mistake and got blown out of my seat could uh you know there were political reasons for that as well which I described in the book with a you know what I was there to help the president on their loyalty to the president\nYou know I did some a media this morning I was on CNN and trust and what I said that I called the president a liar not what I said the\nPresident is telling it like that and he's covering the truth\nIs doing it to set your hair on fire right into a finger your eyeball 'cause he knows it's going to distract you cause you to be like a school monitor all rock\nAnd it works every single time when you go to a CNN or MSNBC when you're walking into stores and look I've been working CNN headline news on fifty over there I mean I did that when you walk it still feels good it's a nice organization but then you realize that there was a definitive spin\nWhen you walk into that ... did you know you really get you know some some lip poked from them and it's hard to get you to spend the president a certain way\nPretty much on message I think they were really hitting these or this morning and I'm trying to sell it\nBecause they could kill me with the base but that's fine people that know me they don't support loyal to the president to say listen I get fired Fifteen months ago if I wasn't loyal to the President Joe you would have figured it out by now or I wrote a very colorful very funny book [noise]\nAbout my relationship with him you know what he's like it like it as a guy what he's like behind the scenes and by the way that a lot of research on him and his father when they were a lot younger\nYou know his father's deceased but I'm going to get back into the seventies when his dad was working with him and mentoring in what they were like so this was a real fun book to write a rocket called me yesterday uh she said that she she went through the book she read it a hundred percent for Bush said\nIt was great each couldn't wait to show it to her father Kurt ... one of his best friend said the same thing you know could listen I I I Love the president I said that from the press box you know I got criticized for saying that I Love the president two or three times when I was given my press briefing\nLast too bad I'm a New Yorker I have to be an Italian I like to use the word love Joe and Joe ... guy we want me to do\nIt and again I'm from New York I'm an Italian ... of course short for Pagliaro\nSo why are we we we we enjoy I get where you where you're coming from just like Anthony I gotta tell ya my mother's from Jamaica, Queens so as the president of these people are fighters who come from Jamaica, Queens and I don't know that that the rest of America and certainly not the elite media in America they don't understand that do they\nKnow they don't understand it they get sent it there's micro aggressions credit president is that your doubt that the left wants your brain disconnected from your mouth you know you get up and emotion\nFeeling you could ever politically incorrect thing to say you are and they want that totally sanitizing edited and God Forbid you should say something that they're offended by right\nThere was a tiny bit of a micro aggressions they started sending bottle rockets off the president place than like a Stradivarius does\nA ... and that's how people from queens or from my area in your area talk and I don't mean anything by it I'm Sasha my personality\nI agree it's embodied Sarah moved to the blue collar President Bill blue collar president it's out now going up his great book\nLet's go back to the media stop because again you were there when he did The Apprentice he may tens of millions of dollars for NBC now NBC turned itself on him him almost immediately when he says he's running for president were you surprised I've talked to him seven different times he he was actually not surprised they turned on him when he was surprised by how dirty and how nasty ... were you\nYeah I think he's been blown away I mean I I there was a scene in my book where I'm Talking about us in the oval office and he looks at me so she you know I had a forty five you're great relationship with the media will do and what happened I said there's a combination of things they don't they don't like your some of your policies\nAnd you know we we let Steve Bannon declare war on the media and that they're trying to take it out on you\nThat I and and it took them a second but he realized what was going on so he kept on going out and I think you're right he purposely looks for a cost them out and tries to tell me your fake news oh I don't understand it and then he turned and Acosta eats it up he does it every time you make a fool of themselves when you were dealing with the media and again give him a job for eleven days but uh but again if I thought it was really really good pick\nUp a time I understand what happened but\nUm when you were in that job did you think that the media wouldn't work with you\nDid you think that they wanted to actually get good information from the White House run the price of\nA I thought I thought we were going to have a ... month I thought there would be some kind of a peace offering me Jonah what\nAdam ... and the press I turn the lights and cameras back on that first day Joe you announced era as press secretary I did the first press conference and I saw Sarah that would be my last one I was going to focus on strategy and building the communications team and also wanted to put us in a service position if you go you can find it on the net Mike ... plan\nBut listen you know I'm accountable for the mistake I made I trusted a reporter I was having off the cuff conversation with ... everybody forgets the context to\nEat was being very of secrets and flattering to me any begging me effectively did do a profile story with him yeah ... trail me around and I'm like well I'm not the ban and I'm not their self promoting myself when I\nUse of expletives which I obviously regret she loved that guy changed ran over to CNN with it right he waited he wrote this ridiculously\n... you know exaggerated article and then you really should take you know four or five days later people looking I'm like Jesus ... sounds like to normal guys from queens talking to each other right\nWhy would you do that to the guy and the answer is well we want to the ambush in to see if we can get him out of the White House ... and you know some people thought I Would have been very effective in helping to present so what's\nThe other one I thought it looked if you went back to the right but\nIf you went and checked up a pod cast after you were named I thought it was a good pick because I felt like you were a guy who wasn't ... who's going to be very direct you to be very strict with the information and and you would say look if you want a relationship with a retired minister Asian here's a way it's going to work but you're right I think that you got suckered into a little bit and it doesn't feel good I've had that happened to me\nBut you got you got pulled in because you're actually trust somebody something that guys like do you want to do we want to trust people\nHe ate Joe I made a mistake it's a vicious by first place down there I didn't anticipate how bad it was a I told my Wall Street present Thirty years on Wall street now let me tell you something the worst person on Wall street is literally the best person down there so while\nI Know how bad it is down there and it is what it is and so for me\nUh a lot of my book is also about that ... that you know where I got up\nDust that myself off I was sort of like mayhem and they all say commercial coming through the car crash right and I told my kids watch what I Do with this thing now because you never want to do is be on your back for too long or you don't want that left wing media to build a shame box for you to stand inside of\nYou want to be you and so I'm I'm fully expressing myself a lot of fun writing this book I Hope that people who go out and buy that book at ten percent as much fun reading it as it writing it because it was really an enjoyable thing for me to do a lot of research do\nIt's a Anthony Scaramucci the name of the book is the blue collar prison and I urge you to go get to go get five copies give it to your friends and family it's the blue collar president a last question and I think people are dying to know the same but what's the relationship now with the president\nYou know I Would say it's good I mean we we we don't talk or a super ... is the price of the United states I don't feel the need to bother him yeah\nI had a very good conversation with him last July recording trade I put in an op ed in the F G we had a rigorous intellectual discussion about that um and I get along I mean we I think we see the world are pretty similarly I'm and I'm not sword him I Hope he's not a short me for what happened\nHe seems to be a that kind of guy I right at the end of the book guys like ... I see myself a day wasn't fired because he was fired I was fired I call this S P else were fired but loyal [laughter] so you know I I feel very good about the president\nIs that the one of the toughest jobs in the world you I certainly didn't want to make it harder for him I was there to try and make it easier and by the way I'm here to help until I Do a lot of media surrogacy for the campaign a and I'm writing a lot of op eds warm state by state\nEverybody going to get this book the blue collar president is Anthony Scaramucci you know some of that you said earlier in the interview really stuck out and it's a you know here just Fifteen months later and you're still world for the president or a summer ocean was out for Fifteen seconds and had a new book\nSo uh I really think that that you showed your loyalty and the fact that the fact that you can look at me look at my listeners and look at look at my viewers and say I made a mistake I should have thought the ... better and I really think I could have been an effective guy I agree with everything but you just said I think that's also\nGot on the mistakes you make in life you're going to tell my kids that be accountable I'm not blaming anybody I'm not playing the victim and one last thing which I think you would appreciate growing up the way you did and I hope your listeners that you know whining and sports or politics Joe [laughter]\nEver tried as facts are going to win five on a story to tell you like the machine\nWhile I don't know I'm a big Yankee fan obviously but but if it's going to be the ... anybody should be the red Sox was maybe the edges\nOf just like you know do like a machine that were like last night so to me no whining and spores and ... days I got slammed around uh but I'm having a great improbable\nLife I'm very blessed to be able to put my life back together with my wife uh and I like I said like I said do a bunker yesterday everything's good I think your dad made me as famous as you in Milan yet and they have to sleep\nThey were being stored or something on that like you thought it was great\nThere you go is a ... he was really a great time hanging out with the guy is just really he's he's uh about as honest as you're going to find somebody to interview about exactly what went on\nAt about exactly how it went down admits the mistake and and I it I said it at the time I really felt that he could have been ineffective guy for President Trump but if you let his guard down why nobody was George W just admitted to it uh it is the job of it is the weekend with Joe pack your\nThis morning several church services had just gotten underway including a baby's naming ceremony and it was just trying to nine fifty five AM after those services had gotten underway that a gunman walked in with an assault rifle in three handguns\nAnd opened fire on the congregation officers arrived just as he was starting to walk out and that is when one officer was shot another one was raised before the gunman went hype from swat officers which we're starting to move in he continued to exchanged gunfire with police\n... President Trump reacting to the shooting\nThis evil anti Semitic attacks\nIs an assault on all of us it's an assault\nOn humanity [noise] it will require all of us working together to extract their hateful\nPoison of anti Semitism from our world and the\nPresident's speaking tonight at a make America great rally and Murfreesboro Illinois a vigil now underway for the victim\nIs a heavy and emotional scene here right now with Allison is that people have come together to stand outside in the cold rain in the\nMain street court or the squirrel hill neighborhood and there are so many people that they have basically now filled\nOut an entire intersection for just around the block from the synagogue where the travesty took place earlier today and organizers of this digital said that they

government\nThan migrants continuing their march north and of course they're aware somewhat President Trump trying to make it harder for them to get across that border but the big news here the president\n... only has about a month left an office putting off on the table to the migrants saying if you stay here register with officials are in this in the southern states have ... and walk up we'll give you a temporary employment healthcare and even some schooling but most of the migrants here according to the Bible is in front of scrape it's really leading this march saying no\nWe're rejecting that we want a better deal and they're going to ultimately take care of an to Mexico City which is really a first you've ever seen to protest\nTheir treatment and also asked for a better deal\nThanks a script Jenkins game for the world series gets underway and just over an hour in LA and to the Dodgers took game three last night\nWas a beautiful day for a ball game and they play

mornings with Kelly minutes one who saw one of four nine WB is the\n\nRent radio stations across the land Joe ... dot com basically would arrange to ramp email all of them were right there is a joke it's the ... you know also\nThe blaze radio network a lot of you listening to appreciate you every single time it is your boy Joe ... a note about ... before I go to John ...\nA couple of things are important number one when you go to a radio show or you can both be heard at the same time so do you make an allegation that I Want to comment on it you gotta stop for a second and then I'll let you can to you but the fact that she wouldn't have stopped talking she felt that she would whether she kept talking unfortunately for you I have the microphone and I have control\nOf of what's being hurt at any given time I know I have a decision to make\nEither both of us speak the same time and my listeners and viewers don't get to your either of us or turn you down or just hang up on you know just keep talking um it's not going to be both ways though I Am a fair a guy that I'll stop and let you continue\nBut if you ... allegation about how great CNN is and not let me respond it's not going to work when it comes to ... because there were there were a few big lives out there about Donald Trump he was trying to ban all Muslims from coming here that's not true in fact the Muslim ban or it'd be the travel ban yes\nYes predominantly Muslim countries were involved but Ninety One percent of all Muslims around the world are allowed to come here so that's a ... it was one of my focus just not true of the second allegation is that in Charlottesville he said that white supremacists are good people\nAre very funny people he didn't say that what he said was it's a it's a a very loud debate debate an emotional debate there are very are there are bad people on both sides there are very fine people on both sides\nThe debate we're talking about is whether white supremacy is good or bad the debate is about monuments and statues of Confederate a war heroes or soldiers\nOr leaders that's what it was about 'cause they're tearing down people turned up monuments because they feel like they can and they really can't produce law first of all and secondly it's a debate that we should have are there are good people on the side of of course the monuments should stay there it's our history of course there are\nOther bad people on that side yeah\nOr they're good people on the side of terror tear it down shore or they're bad people and I absolutely so he's ... he's not a racist because of what he said about Charlottesville but those of you who have listen to CNN and MSNBC and\nAnd the other left wing media outlets saying it over and over and drawing on and on and on and you actually believe\nThat if you use a pro white supremacist guy he's not he's never said anything that would that would suggest that he is and this whole thing about how we mocked disabled reporter is also ally yes the reporter does have some affliction where his hands are are are are in a position on his on his arms were I guess I don't know what to do with the ... it's called\nBut I'm showing people on the Web cam I mean his hands are sort of like this and when he talks as have stay like that the ... he doesn't have the full mobility of his hands in his in his forums as as most people do\nAnd the president what I guess the guy wrote something bad or report something bad about or negative about the president and he said look at me any sort of did his hands at a similar fashion and made you know just spoken to in a certain kind of way well the guy doesn't speak that way so he wasn't in mimicking him that way\nAnd be very good just go to you to use your brain and actually see the other side of the story there are are a ... several examples example after example of president Donald Trump before he was the president before even considering running when he's on Larry King live and other places where he's making fun of himself doing the same hand motion exactly\nSo ... mocking the disabled reporter\nUh beforehand was the president was the clear boy and once he making fun of the reporter in Nineteen Ninety when a reporter didn't do the reporting till two veteran sixteen or maybe just maybe and whether you like the fact that he does this or not\nSometimes he acts like a door that way the president and he does have that way and he speaks that way do look at me with Donald Trump um stupid so you have to make a decision\nEither you're really you're going to believe what these these fake news outlets are saying and doing or you're going to do your own research it independently decide what is it that he said and what is it that he meant what is it that he wrote what is it that he meant wouldn't the hand motion to do and if you ever done that before and one not talking about this reporter\nAnd then you make the decision but if you buy hook line and sinker with the fake news media is giving you you're the person who's in the wrong\nAnd don't ever give me your four year degree crap as if I'm some lowly radio guy or TV guided know squat an angel in New York and I know more than you you may in fact to intimidate the more than I Do but you failed any debate when you walk in picking your superior\nI'm telling you that right now I'm going to have a debate on any level of anybody at any time\nBut I'm not willing to walk into where you think you're better than I Am and you'll win the debate by reminding me of the paper that you that you got from some journalism school\nThat's not going to help you I've got Thirty years in this business\nFifteen of which were I was just a journalist I was not a commentator wasn't somebody who gave an editorial is outlook I didn't write opinion pieces I gave you a straight news to the point to my viewers and listeners had no clue what what my politics work so bring it next time I get a little but you better bring it better than that\nAll right let me get to John Hi bushy who's the guy that runs the or the Reagan facility the Reagan Institute I'm ... and it's a really interesting conversation\nAbout how that President dealt with the media and how this president deals with the media John appreciate you are you\nOn this great great to be with\nYou I really glad to have you back I got to tell you something you'll with wonderful but that thing behind just got my attention or it appears to be a plaintiff some short in some beautiful flags waving the breeze John what is that\nYeah well we're right here at the Reagan Library that's a A R at fourteen at that jet is one of the famous jet setting foot off the carrier that a President Reagan ordered to shoot down the Libyan fighter pilots are when they came after our fleet at one point to Nineteen eighty six\nI Do remember that and I also remember that President Reagan said watch this and went back in and launched an attack on on Gadhafi himself and that really got him under

B. U. V.\nFrom the men do view it GMC studios his talk going on for nine points and I urge radio station [noise]\nThis is a Fox\nNews alert on Rogers stir and its official Brett Kavanaugh will be the next justice on the Supreme Court the Senate confirming him just one hour go by boat slim as the margins\nHer her very good friend late somebody a girl said I have absolutely no recollection of that ever happening and I don't think I've ever met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnybody and everybody else but she said was that the party has refuted the quite well Christie lousy Ford testified in front of this panel the Judiciary Committee\nAnd leaving bear left and right middle everybody charge credible credible witness credible which is actually true she's not credible she might be believable that she really is\nWe're surely does believe that she's a victim and something really did happen to her but it is incredible that it was Brett Kavanaugh and it's simple to to go down logically as to why\nShe doesn't know when it happened not even a year doesn't know where it happened not even the neighborhood doesn't know whose house would was doesn't know how she got to the party doesn't know how she left the party she's been incorrect about everybody she says was that the party and she's actually give it a couple of different numbers as to how many people were at the party\nBrett Kavanaugh on the other hand has\nEverybody corroborating his story and he's got a calendar that shows what he was doing every weekend and every weekday basically in Nineteen eighty two or whatever it was\nSo as much as\nShe might have been believable that something happened to her and I hope she gets to help she needs some help the person who did it is brought to justice but it was not credible her allegations against this guy specifically\nAnd that's a appointed delineation that the the legacy media didn't want to have\nLegacy media didn't want to say well she's credible as somebody who probably had something happened to her but it is not credible what she's saying about Brett Kavanaugh the legacy media didn't do its job and then a report that correctly the second accusation which I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez\nWho says that at a party\nThere were playing some game\nThat I don't know you do to spin the bottle or it was the quarter is if they were playing something to where if you lost you had to drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk you're going to remember anything and then she's told Brett Kavanaugh put her but whose member are pulled pulled it out\nAnd put it in near her face now she admittedly doesn't remember it\nAnd when Democrats staffers from the Democrats senators that are on the panel calls are contacting her she spent six days calling old friends asking headed something\nHappened to me you remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers anything\nBut after six day she decided yeah I I guess it did happen I wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now he did it I don't remember him doing it but I remember people telling me that he did it so which Kavanaugh said you know there was anything like that what are you talking about\nThe third one is from slime ball lawyer I have an oddity is truly sweat Nick who\nSays that for three years Brett Kavanaugh on mark judge worthy organizers\nOf parties where there would be trains are boys are taking a gang rape Kavanaugh and judge she said which spike the punch with grain alcohol\nAnd quail moods\nShe knew this was going on but she was smart enough to not drink the punch then one day and this happened between Nineteen eighty one Nineteen eighty three she said but one day a one party she went to ten of them in Nineteen eighty two she somehow was the victim and was gang raped\nWill continue to go into the parties for another full year\nAnd instead of calling the police what she said was just don't drink the punch she changed her story to NBC News at least once NBC\nNews instead of saying we can't run this because she's not viable not credible not believable they ran it anyway and then said it's important to note that the stories you're saying today is different or there are differences from the story she originally told us her story has changed a bunch of times in her history comes out especially somebody that makes you got about allegations all the time\nSo completely not credible\nBut that didn't matter to grow because Booker and that didn't matter to lay heat that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to Coons they didn't didn't matter to Kamala Harris it didn't matter to any of these people\n\nHe was he's guilty Cory Booker robots called Spartacus but he's admitted Grover when he was Fifteen he groped a girl he admits that\nHe's a senator somehow he actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he's guilty or innocent Cory Booker said that and he meant it\nIt doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh's guilty or innocent at this point well that I Believe galvanized us as a people we said that's not fair due process of this in this country is guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold than it is\nThen he's innocent nothing any of these women\nHas said or the the the slimy lawyer has said or the far left wing resist who's a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is Deborah Ramirez completely uncorroborated in fact refuted by people Julie sweating it just seems to be a ... from outer space story she's giving\nAnd of course the Ford\nOnly vase say something happened everybody else named and the FBI spent five days six days interviewing many more people in ... didn't come to the Bush has offered up evidence that there is no corroboration there is nothing more here\n\nYet the left is still today go on Twitter read your favorite website they still today\nHave these paid protesters showing up in the Senate halls\nTheir dock sing people which means are putting out their information their their phone number is their addresses\nIt say a violent crew of idiots that are still just completely disconnected from the rest of us I mean listen the lotto is your spokesperson Amy Schumer is your spokesperson\nAnd their argument against Kavanaugh\nThey're still it's tempting they're still exempting these days are rapists serial rapists rapist on the court\nIt's it's a disgusting display their trying their best to change the best although flawed system judicial system on earth to to being Saudi Arabia or something or China oh man\nSo Brett Kavanaugh and again as I Do a show it's not happened yet but I assume that he will be confirmed later today there are a couple of things that could happen\nBetween now and then and and yes we've got to talk about Lisa Murkowski who is a an alleged Republican from Alaska who is going to vote against Brett Kavanaugh today\nAnd she the reason she gave was he's a good man just not the right guy for the job right now with but\nCome on man so I Need your thoughts on this\nI I'm guaranteeing that you have never been this engaged in a Supreme Court nominee every in your life I guarantee that is true but let's break it down and where are you on this even if you're on the left even a political you're a Democrat or a liberal and somebody who generally speaking doesn't agree with me or doesn't agree

I mean I only saved nine hundred kitten last year from you know a sex trafficking but they're terrible we should get rid of them I mean these people are insane\nAnd so we have to get out we have to stay motivated we have to bring our friends and you can't buy into the media stuff just look at what's going on in your businesses look at what's going on your place of work what can your paycheck\nI mean you're winning with these policies these policies are moving the needle these policies are making a difference in America's getting respect again because we're not going to let little third world countries push us around and slap us around\nYou know they change and\nWe have to remember that because they can all go away in November\nAnd people need to realize that it's Donald Trump junior and I appreciate the access let's talk about Texas as you know I'm based in San Antonio Fifteen stations in Texas we've got a hundred and twelve around the country but we focus now on Texas because there's been a real challenge Robert Francis awoke is what I call these somehow cold really appropriating Hispanic and he's\nNot he's not at all and spending on he'll pretend he is for the roads but that's a democratic ... you can get away by the way if Ted Cruz did something like that now he happens to actually be Hispanic something but if it's something like that they would destroy absolutely you you you were going to get out of every day for ... or it's\nNot a problem when he said something about what was the voluptuous breast or whatever that that's not a problem that only one day story of Ted Cruz did that it it would be you know he should be disbarred he should be you know write it killed ...\nWe're not fighting a fair fight and there's down ticket races that are dependent on this thing has been great for taxes he's done he's fought for those values I look at the ... platform and like I said I mean this is in New York City mayoral candidate\nRunning for senator in Texas well he's getting big support for Mellon so you know that's a good idea it's Donald Trump junior so you're in Texas you got Ted Cruz who I've known for ... wait longer than he's been a senator and he's always made promises that he's always done exactly what he said he would do was the first thing is you're dead and then went out in the primaries but\nThey're very very similar politically in that they're not doing it politically based say I'm going to do this this this this is the most and you're dead and had actually believe I should do those things I promise beat her it was just given as you know a ... puppy dogs it's weird well of\nCourse I listen I I really respect that I mean it looks like it was a brutal primary\nAnd a little story I don't know if I'd actually even said this publicly but ... you know a couple of weeks after that and it was a brutal primary there was a big ... a a dinner in DC you know the usual you know this stuff\nI I went and you know I was all my friends are from Texas I'm there all the time hunting fishing raised a lot of money there and campaign down in Texas I'm sitting there at the Texas table and a couple of friends ... at the table and we actually have a great dinner good conversation at the end of the dinner and say hey\nYou know we're going back to the Trump Hotel right in the middle of the AC on Pennsylvania Avenue we're gonna have a couple of drinks hanging out whatever you want to come along it came with us and that and the Trump Hotel we had a great time for three hours nice that's a lot yeah but you know when I showed me beyond the guts is he understood\nDumps I was going to be president and he was going to help support policies that he believed in that we're going to be good for America and they were going to be good for tax and he was able to put all of that aside and now they have a great relationship\nBecause they're doing what's right for their constituencies that was impressive to me that was a great\nA testament to his character and everything and I don't think I've ever told that story before but I think it's actually relevant huh because you're doing what's right for your constituency and I don't see that everywhere else I mean again look at where bagel rocks money is probably coming from\nThat probably doesn't represent the average guy in Texas right now that probably represents the average guy in Hollywood studio somewhere else you know that's\nThe difference and I don't want Texas to become California\nAt Texas a I mean just look at the economic success if it had to look at all this debt but you want to become California give me a\n... and the people from California bringing their politics but that doesn't make any sense to me it's a it's Donald Trump junior or\nYou have an opinion as to why anybody would listen to I'm going to take away your tax cut ...

here catch your mind over the world and think of where there are dictators autocrats or something like that it may have been white authoritarian rulers\nWell I I think I'd start with the entire continent of Africa I wouldn't move my way up to the middle east we would get lots of autocrats an authoritarian rulers in in in the far east\nUm I guess she's talking about who and who was the only white autocrats I can think of he's not exactly style one\nHe's even Khrushchev right but she throws\nAnd that's one thing people like me started to notice oh my gosh white is just it's the way Hannity uses the word literally it's an intense a fire and has no actual meaning other than um it's really bad\nThat's why\nIt's so bad because of his white noose in colder no more Mr White guy ... you cite a bunch of these quotes from from the idiots on the left the media you've got to understand they have all these white men will be questioning this woman the next one is women across the nation should be outraged that white men senators are doing this to them and there's been\nSome discussion but you'll be centers will happen to be all white men I mean I\nI don't I don't understand that there's so much anger\nAgainst white men and so much guilty in white men themselves that this crap works in\nA it doesn't work on may nor me and I as I Am I'm slowly dude\nI um it's very strange and I also take issue I mean at least understand the logic of saying it should be women women understand massage any and that should be a panel of women questioning and alleged sexual assault um accuser\nUm but the last time that I can remember where I'm somebody one big for don't worry women understand massage any and end violence against women with him and they pick the OJ jury\nRight or a member that was Marsha Clark big idea\nI'm black white I don't care as long as they're women they will bond with with um what's her name I'm Nick Nicole Brown Simpson didn't work out for oh ... oh I guess the jury didn't see the point so I think it's idiotic to say that only women should they should be\nQuestioning actually don't you have all these\nRape laws as Janine bureau said right bless her soul she said you know for years I've been prosecuting sex crimes cases and I was prosecuting them under laws written by white men I mean I just don't feel\nWhen he wrote about America he wrote about how the ... the crime of rape\nIn ... in contrast to even you know other European countries which was what he was familiar with the crime rate is so much more serious in America than anyplace else it is just barely seconds to murder this is what the respect for women in this new country is a lot of\n'em and it has always been ... wow American women don't know what they're asking for if they want to throw over the white male patriarchy because the white male patriarchy has been pretty terrific for women\nKnow it really has been in culture the name of the book is resistance as you do have it from hitting left lost its collective mind she's written this article no more Mr White guy you're just back to the OJ trial for a second you have to give the the the jurors of pass and you see the blood evidence always show that I knew that the kids are being him were seven billion to one\nSo there's a chance it wasn't him go through one\nOf the the the the bottom line is and I'm going to ask you about this before we run out of time to ask you about Jeff Flake or if you're in charge of this committee wires used do better when he says I'm not running for reelection when he says that I'm Out of your what do you make so much noise about how Trump is horrible and the director of the country is bad why is that guy that we\nStill want to be a limit on the Judiciary Committee do you have any clue\nThat's a really great point Republicans do not think seeing these things out strategically Republicans are used to being over just going to be gentleman we're not going to say\nI'm strategize um and and and look I Love 'em this week but don't get too high on Lindsey Graham run he's the sort of Republican and takes the position well if I keep voting for Democrat nominees just even though I Know they're going to be total disasters on the court maybe maybe Democrats will reward my good\nNever happened never\nReturned my next to ... you know you got to start thinking about this and advance guys\nRuth Bader Ginsburg Ninety six to three she was confirmed think about that how radically left you use and you write these people like Lindsey Graham and in the late John McCain's vote that they were going to\nGet paid back the pay back to screw you were not going to allow you to do it and it happens every single time it's colder get the book resistance as you tell how the Trump hitting left lost its collective mind last question does he get confirmed or not because there was that about him being a rapist any more about him being an angry drunks\nAnd beer a hotline\nFor exactly right and he's drawing ...\nHall if they would go with anything that is so obvious that this is unfair I mean I Can't think about anything else I I I'm outside I get splashed with a puzzle and I think I was just going to affect cabinet\nI wake up and it must be how um you know Hillary\nSupporters felt the day after the election right our side is not going to let Republicans given this time I tend to say yes um I think he will be confirmed and I would like to add Joe pacts um I think he should invite Julie sweat next to his swearing in ceremony on the ground set without her this might not have been possible\nAnd listen when NBC News has to admit that there are inaccuracies are differences in her two stories you know it's wildly just made up has to be right\nYes how ... how many ex boyfriend that she threatened to kill and and killed her unborn children how many lawsuits against her for false allegations of sexual misconduct and our own sexual misconduct\nAnd you remind you most believing the victim slash survivor which matter where you want to meet with him so\nI Want her on TV twenty four hours a day\nIn golden we always appreciate the time and the access she's awesome and uh\nAnd very

I'm guessing the family got at first I'm going to actually do this what was your knee jerk reaction because as you said he didn't need for anything he could be you know playing golf every day in Scotland right now and not worry about all this political stuff but\nHis love for country said this is my calling was my duty what was your what was your thought process when it looked like your mother in law was really going to take this stuff\nAnd he actually that all of them down and said I Want to do that and then two days before the famous athlete or a\nDay during dinner and that you guys need to know that they're going to come after me they're going to come after you they're going to come after all of us they will attack us they'll tell lies about it obviously it would have been hard to predict it will get to this level right\nBut but I said I was a hundred percent on board and because I knew that my father in law to do this job he's a businessman the is so smart when it comes to negotiating you see when he's been able to do in in so many different respect what hair of the trade um\nHe's really great at that than I knew back then that he would be great at it um so for me it was a hundred percent and\nAgain I don't think anything prepare you for for all of this\nUm it it it's so much bigger than any of us but that's why I think although we all get attacked on the time although the president and get the tax every second of every day none of us for a second one change any of that because we know that it is about the bigger picture and the future and the country and\nIf we have to take a couple of planes and arrows here and there and the president or you know take that every single day more than any of that it's totally worth it because\nI really think this country is headed in the right direction they get an I always tell him he's going to go down in history as one of the greatest president the country's ever had\nA job as a group that is Laura Trump or husband his or her father in law is the president of a I asked him back in twenty sixteen or because you just said it was nowhere near I mean you expect to the the media would come after the electric come after you guys but not like this\nAnd I understood it was just completely unexpected he said no I knew that they would want to go hard on me probably go dirty on me but I had a lot of friends in the media you told me I made millions and millions of dollars for NBC on The Apprentice for thirty or forty years the media\nActually treated me very well and wanted me in the newspaper on their television or radio show so he didn't know that it would get to this extreme you've been in the media for a long time I've been in newsrooms for a long time as well yesterday le left but I didn't know was going to be like this show when it was when was the realization for you in the family that this was way worse than we thought it was going to be\nWell I was actually still for a portion of the campaign working at my former job in television and\nI ... it became very frustrating for me to to work there because\nI Would be all different nations but sometimes ours including um the way that they would find things in and say hey that's not what he said you know when he said um that that was it was very clear wind to me that I don't didn't think that I was going to be able to work there for for\nForever if you know he became president ...\nBut um but certainly after they started attacking all of us personally and you know when I was pregnant and they they attacked my unborn child\nI mean it's the talk about it is a it is\nSo crazy but again I think it's because they knew before the term became president that if he got in there there was no turning back and he was all business and he was really going to be looking out for the American people and their old way of life is going to come to an end do\nUm I have to say that it is just another sign that you do in a great jobs\nI Would agree with you you guys were you have the ... of any family you've ever seen in my wife is Lara Trump irritates her husband and father in law of course is the president of the United states we've got we've got senatorial races now that are starting to lean writes the midterms are starting to look better in the Senate for Republicans although I can say that it doesn't mean anything unless people don't vote\nIn Texas where I should you've got Ted Cruz the incumbent who's doing an incredible job in working with your debt with your father in law of very well know although it was rough on the campaign trail who's being challenged from a guy by a guy who's basically Obama\nAre saying you know we can work together yeah one one undivided Texas but under the surface as you know he's a former left wing social justice Scalia ward you look at places like Michigan were Debbie Stabenow was been there for three decades and it's time for her to go now you've got a guy named John James who might actually be able to get\nThat show the ... seat this really use gonna come down to whether we can motivate people who believe in what they see happening now in the country to get off the reruns and go vote for him is really what it is isn't it\nOh absolutely well as I think you right now I'm In Minnesota\nNot traveling estate campaigning I Will be in your neck of the woods in Texas on Monday youthful\nI Will be on Tuesday ironically in Michigan um ... it's so so important we we know that\nThe president has done incredible things already and that's with a lot of people against and even people on his own party sometimes money and get them to\nThink about what could happen if he had a cohesive unit of people behind him that voted along side president and and really pushes agenda forward we can see so much more progress in the country and by the way I Know we talk about socialism\nIf anybody has any question about what socialism look like the look in Venezuela right now that could become the United states of America\nIf we let people like or or take over and and put his agenda forward it's really very frightening socialism has never worked in fact that the Democrats are embracing people like that\nSince shock everybody to a degree that you knew not only are going to get out and do it in the midterms but you're going to take everyone in your neighborhood and everyone in your family to go vote\nUm it it's very area and I I Know that it felt like a fight and twenty things seem to get Donald Trump elected in certainly certainly was the fight isn't over you you can't come back we can't relax we can't be complacent we have to get out\nAnd got to vote and put people in Congress or we're going to vote with the president\nIs only run if anybody ever wants to know about socialism talk to their shoes are delicious whose whose wife was from Venezuela who tells the stories of how disgusting 'cause there are people waiting in line for food and the government officials show up beat them up maybe even kill them in the streets to take care of their families first it has made him in the country could as horrific\nAnd you really do have people in this country or tells you a ... you got people who are actually showing the sky Gillum in Florida we are going to go the way of socialism because that's the best way to go\nTo Florida last question I really appreciate your time and by the way of luxury Minnesota we reached Asians or we were very highly rated in Minneapolis sleep on TV okay there during you right now\nUm when you look at the fact that people on the left are saying volition will impeach the president will open the border will abolish ice we will roll back the tax cuts and take more of your money away it will drive jobs out of the country\nThat's what they're running on and the fact is there almost fifty fifty right now and it was the ripple you see what is it that we're doing wrong you and I ... I done junior the president's the Fox news Hannity what are we doing wrong but it's still so close that is crazy to me\nWell I don't know do that it's really that close I mean we thought how accurate the polls weren't sure and a great point I don't really think that if that is out there I think there are people that are afraid\nTo tell a pollster that calls them or coaches them on the street said they want to vote Republican because the media and Hollywood has done such a a number on on people\nWhenever they come out and support him to president or as a Republican I'm so I think it does make people a little hesitant to voice their support sometimes but when they get in the voting booth\nWhenever no one else is looking when they think about the ... rarely come in this country in almost in less than two years under President Donald Trump through\nAnd not only the five and it took so long for them to come up with the Seventeen Days around the widows or because they don't have got the number of key issues who sends a theme to uh to stumble where is the body or can they do an autopsy a lot of questions really still and all that\nI found the investigation they just announced last night they television is an Eighteen individuals have now being arrested who all they can hold him responsible for that all those Eighteen Fifteen of them are the same individuals who have painted on the TV footage entering Istanbul by private jet\nFox's Benjamin hall President Trump says he'll pull the United states from the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty with Russia because he says Moscow's violating the agreement\nYou made the statement and ... where he held a campaign rally in support of incumbent senator Dean Heller president took an opportunity to attack former BP Joe Biden was also at a rally in Nevada\n\nBoy Joe Biden we want ... percent Joe because he ran at least twice I think three times twice I think he ran three times\nAnd you never had more than one percent\nJoe Biden was at that rally were talk to about what makes a great candidate that character\nThey would they say they say what they mean and I do what they say they're going to do\nAnd that's the single most significant thing that's missing\nIn Washington DC now\nEarly voting began today in the veteran this was Fox News\nThis is talk went on for nine [noise] bought 'em all\nUs as two thousand Honduran migrants who were part of a larger caravan trying to make its way to the U.S turned around and headed back to Honduras the remaining migrants are in Guatemala at a border crossing with Mexico or authority or letting some through who want to apply for refugee status\nAt least three people were dead in Afghanistan after an explosion at a polling station during the parliament election\nThe Taliban had always threatened to disrupt this election it won't people not to that but that was the last time that despite those re fat and not have chaos now voting with late in several locations because of a technical glitch with a new biometric voting equipment\nWas designed to stop fraud and many people were waiting in long lines to vote there will also reports of polling stations no taping a tool\nAnd election failing to show up\nNow these all the fest parliamentary elections in Afghanistan in eight years almost two and a half thousand candidates they're competing for two hundred and fifty seat in Afghanistan's\nParliament getting Logan European and Japanese space agency says spacecraft with two probes is on its way to a joint mission to study the closest planet to the sun not\nPlanet is mercury the European space agency and the Japanese aerospace exploration agency\nSaid the unmanned that'd be Colombo spacecraft successfully separated\nAnd there were sent into orbit to begin a seven year journey to mercury the spacecraft is named after Italian scientist Joe's that'd be that'd be Colombo\nThe European space agency says the one and a half billion dollar mission is one of the most challenging and its history Mercury's extreme temperatures the intense gravity pull the sun and blistering solar radiation make for hellish conditions\nHandling Fox News ... this is Fox News [noise]\nThis is Kelly ban it from this morning's with uncle Henry on these ... before nine W.

the ... the Democrat nominee for governor who's a far left wing socialist a run I appreciate Joe how are you I'm doing good how are you doing\nI'm living the dream it really glad to have your own it would be a it would be bad for me to not start we're the most important story of foreigners happening and that's Panama City in that area I Know that you've been there a lot you've been you've been monitoring what's going on you been talking to the people throw my listeners and viewers in on on what you see there and how things are going\nWell they really got what I mean we thought I'm born and raised in Florida and we've seen a lot of stormed out of the young one end to\nYour homes better Ninety to buy the worst damage I mean in terms of Panama City in terms of Mexico beach in some of those areas so I'm a I'm a self servants rising was totally out I'm starting to get power back off\n\nOn a structural damage um because you had basically about category by\nIt um I talked to some of the Arabs they're um they're actually progressing scheduling which is good I think uh\nYou know one of the threat neighboring counties golf county are going to have their power on by the end the debate supposed to be back on which I thought was going to take another week or two but you know there's just certain amount of damage that we're going to have a you know\nEach secondary obviously we're talking around us is former congressman he's a Republican running for governor ... bill um um this is secondary of course but I've heard reports that I've seen reports I've read reports that\nVoting might be an issue it might be not as easy to vote because a lot of the places that are traditional polling places in that region of the Gulf Coast um or going to be out ... and taking care of who's working on that\nIt is so there's a the governor's working on that some of the local folks I think what you're going to see is\nThey'll probably be extraordinary accommodations or the people that were displaced or ... or stay on the county but I think you're looking at having additional polling location and then I think there's going to be\nA consideration or if you are displayed or you can vote and other counties or your vocal silk out so I think they're working on that\nAnd by that\nThat's something that's doable and I think that they will look I mean you know a lot of these folks um uh you know are not necessarily thinking about voting on the first thing on their mind but at the same time these are resilient people I mean you know the people in Bay county I mean they're so they're very stiff minded so I think a lot of them are even though they got a lot of\nThis debt to deal with I think they will appreciate it\nOr to cast a vote\nIt is a Republican Ron deceived is running for governor the great state of Florida wrong you may or may not notice I've got several stations in Florida very highly rated in South Florida which is where I grew up I'm I'm I grew up in South Florida who's there for Twenty one years and I love the way to go back all the time my mom was there and my sisters are there and I suddenly understood the politics of the area\nI clearly don't there is there is a sea change that happened since I moved away that I didn't see coming in and the southern tier of Florida that is very heavily populated is is having a fight whether it's center right or center left but a lot of like the school districts and school boards and and a lot of the the sheriff's officers do lean left\nOr how much of a challenge is it for you to get any any movement in the southern part of the state which is so populated or to understand that your your your conservative guy that believes in traditional American values that and that's a good thing for Florida\nWell look we're getting we're getting good tracks and I mean I think if you look at South Florida and for the Miami Dade County\nHuge energy with Cuban Americans um other Hispanics like Venezuelans and the Nicaraguan to understand the dangers of socialism\nThey don't want to see socialism in Florida they know it didn't work in their home country or we also have a very significant contrast which usually doesn't work this way and Florida politics but you know I'm One of the leading a pro Israel leaders in the country had been in the Congress\nThe elements hostile to Israel I mean he uh is endorsed by a group that dream defenders which is prominent into bbs movement against Israel they say Israel to genocidal apartheid state I led the effort to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem I think that was a great\nThat you get one of those it Gillum opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's\nA total of indivisible capitals so when you look at some of the voters who that is something that they are concerned about uh we have an opportunity to make some headway and areas that may be a Republican wouldn't cause a Democrat\nEven though their party has drifted more and more in Israel in Florida they usually nominate somebody who's pro Israel but they didn't this time they nominated Andrew Gillum who's really align with the radical left a which is really\nA very hostile to Israel now\nHe's ... he's like he's really he's also into our freedom and liberty he's also pro taxation and and big government is also pro abortion me the guy's a socialist he wants Medicare for all we can get into all the problems with him but I think that it's\nIt's even more beneficial to talk about the positives that you bring to the table you know it's interesting to me run in in I live in southern Texas now so I grew up around Hispanics I now live in a place where it's a predominantly Hispanic\nOr I've never met a Hispanic person who generally speaking is Catholic\nOr Christian who is some far left is loon why is it that the Democrats have always been able to count on that Hispanic vote\nAnd would have guys like you and me how to do to let them know that we are on their side\nWhy I don't know that day that they have always been able to I think that the Hispanic vote is not monolithic I mean in Florida\nYou know we have a lot of conservative Hispanics and in South Florida um and it's just different than I think what you would see in Texas or California", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Joe Pags Show", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "20", "locations":

to pick a ... ... who did\nWhat did I pick up around and around how's that going to pick a receiver in a world I don't I just want to be a concern I like that I have some of those moment I don't I just didn't feel like picking the garden variety quarterback yeah yeah now these rules all the way they are I don't think they ever will be anything but a quarterback ever again would have to be\nA Randy Moss season yeah you're right yeah but the paycheck I\nThought the Steelers all I mean it's just I thought they were going to be even\nMore bananas then they usually are my reasoning was Mason Rudolf ... they're rafting of him ticked off Ben Roethlisberger and they were just going to come out and lay lights out was that was what the thought was was going into the year and they they've been as an off and said okay they have\nBeen ... been a bit it's been overstated profits of while I'm there\nYes and then their defense isn't any good which is another reason why sometimes it often has to be right like more homes the numbers are crazy sometimes good to have\nTo score thirty five or forty to wear a very good point except last week of all the pictures I pick twelve yup I'm aren't so so with that being said what else you know I Am a little\nWorried about this when I did pick the the Steelers to win the super or the represent\nThe AFC I'm Sorry I thought it to you both picks the Steelers go all the way to do oh why oh shoot I mean they don't say they'll say that [laughter] I'm I'm cherry picking the ones I talk about okay so out of\nIt but I still like who I pick to represent the NFC and the super bowl was that\nThat would be the Carolina Panthers the Carolina so that's why you asked that like I was kind of random ... just like I was talking about math but won't be now I don't want no it's not really the same markets and disrespect and nobody talks about\nCam Newton and the Panthers enough now it's not sexy he's not going to\nThrow over seven hundred yards and all these crazy amounts he's not going to Patrick homes you but he is going to do for a buck eighty you're going to run for eighty you'll get your three total touchdown maybe throw a pig but in the team keeps winning and now they get his favorite target back in ... do you watch out\nFor the panther you want to know what's wild though it's funny you talk about it a quarterback kind of doing this thing and the team keeps winning have you noticed more and more each year that that kind of thing matters last\nIt what pops in the mind of the majority of NFL fans is fantasy football oh yeah\nI ... you

they are fighting for his readers\nShe's made that decision and the left media the legacy media in this country listening to what she has to say and is like now giving her ... ... ... years the odds\nThen and the whole thing is odd but what was the models involved at all but here's the really odd thing\nWhen you turn on a television network whether it be CNN MSNBC or Fox News or were you see me during the week on Newsmax when you turn it on\nAnd somebody has presented as an expert on something\nLike I'll have an author on are all have a geologist on are all have a\nAn actor honor and I'll say this is an actor that you might remember from is this is a geologist who's an expert on this topic that we're talking about this is somebody who is a senator former senator um the IRS the president's son you'll normally present the person and say here's why you want to hear from this person\nOn some of the networks will say that the person who's a contributor well that means is the person who's getting paid for your parents or an analyst\nGenerally speaking never as good as they do\nBut they keep on presenting a listen a lotto and they never say why are we supposed to listen to her and address illicit mulatto says really equal rights amendment and then they do a whole story on at USA Today I'm confused why are we doing a story and listen to the lotto\nI don't get it I'm confused but not as confused as she is\nFor some reason she thinks if there's an equal rights amendment which is unnecessary because we have guaranteed equal rights in equal opportunity\nThe country for some reason she thinks that we had an equal rights amendment then Christie lousy forward would have stopped the Kavanaugh nomination an appointment\nAnd she's never really said why and again I don't really care white illicit model thinks why she's not an expert\n\nI talked about this by talking about this for a while now but we just we sometimes see our top athletes that people that we really like or actors or actresses people that we see you on the tube or or the big screen for a long time\nAnd we share interests sells well we were you for some reason project intelligence on\nThem a list of a lotto is not intelligent she's somebody who clearly was easily indoctrinated and she has no idea what she's talking about none she has no clue\nShe has yet to make a point that makes sense yet the the legacy media keeps putting her up on high because a she's attractive and be they think\nThat she has some political sway that will help to get their viewers and general Americans I guess where the dumb people out here like ... like me\nTo buy use it as far left wing garbage listen to the lotto actually doesn't help at all not not doesn't help their side they think she does but she doesn't when was the lotto actually does is she hurt the cause\n\nMe she actually makes intelligent people arguing may\nSay well I'm definitely not going to vote that way lookout dumb the the thing is that she's saying or look at and taking selfies or taking videos while sitting in a very serious hearing\nOr look at her blindly saying you must believe every woman 'cause every woman who's telling the truth when we've got documented case after case after case where sadly women have lied\n\nThat don't misunderstand me I'm actually at this from the beginning you should take every allegation of sexual misconduct seriously\nBut you should not just simply because it said believe it you should believe in once it's proven\n\nBut there you go you turn on the job or or you read you know some of these current events websites there's Alyssa Milano and they never ever ever never say why we should believer you should believe a list of all I Do because filling the blunt just doesn't happen oh another trendy thing that's happening today which\nWill boggle your mind is Robert ... robbery robbery we of course the Confederate general who\nLost and had to surrender to sue us rent\nAllegedly if you believe NBC News of the Washington Post President Trump last night went to Ohio and praised Robert ... period and their story and of course that's the only period\nAnd the story of your legacy media about large to your viewers and your readers and and those who follow you on social media of course the president did praise Robert de leite on his lead up to talking about how Ohio in Ulysses Grant kicked his ass\n\nHe talked about what a great general Lee was and how great still kicked his ass\nNow the media knows that but they also know you don't know that you don't know that the\nPresident said it that way so if they say the president praised Ulysses S grade are they telling the truth or praised Roberts Lee are they telling the truth yes\n\nBut it's also a set of omission or reliable mission\nThey didn't tell the whole truth\nCan I take out to a section of that and make it sound like the president went to Ohio and praised Robert he leave and left and waved to the crowd than they are fantastic it's worth it's the best thing I'm going to go to my my plane back to Washington yeah I guess you could say that if you're a liar\nA better thing to say it might be what he really said\nUlysses Grant was so freaking good that he kicked this guy's Ashley this guy was really good\n\nThat was the context but why tell the truth when you can lie and then corrected later and

having me\nA vigil for not be mad at me for that whole for Black Friday just people no I was actually and this was unfolding on me or love you are listening but I was telling them what was going on\nAnd and I got a random Facebook message from somebody not named Jew who said Hi Sarah Palin and pick up the kids up and dropping kids often and I'm listening is what is a good point they should maybe you've got a famous name it cracked me up when you reach your was do you remember what you said you stood each really me I promise [laughter]\nTo\nGo back and forth and I needed it oh\nMy

and it's a good as we got to get a fake you so much for reaching out by the way\nAnd then one other thing about that is yeah so I'm grabbing Todd Stone\nBy that time out of the vehicle and we're all in all the button to try to figure out how to say that\nIt worked out because you press the button you took my first time in ... her that's her that's ...\n... and not know you got a hold of me because you are seeing what was unfolding or in in Washington DC I still to this day sir I have no idea how Lisa Murkowski ... became the senator as a write in relief so that's the starting point for me and then she says as a Republican\nIQ support Brett Kavanaugh and the reason she says she couldn't support him was that he's not the right guy at the right time\nDo the people of Alaska except that excuse\nNo and go back even further\nWriting campaign out after he lost the primary up here remember what's her Senator Frank Murkowski after having served twenty two years in the U.S that he gave her daughter that job\nWhen he was elected governor up here right there on German and I ran against him into heated yep that's how we got and that's how we stayed in essentially 'cause man once you're in and you have special interests from\nAround the country right up funding you you know you shouldn't have to have to hold them accountable and say okay enough is enough time to go but no\nRational reason that she provided regarding that that\nThat vote again cabinet because as you point out she daddy good man it's not about qualifications and I'm like wait\nIt was about calls like of course it is and whether he's a good madam yes I'm so no it didn't make sense and then her speech on the Senate floor which is kind of talking in circles are very very very disappointed because Joe as even suggested it outright set on friday\nThe things that she's putting in jeopardy not just for the state of Alaska but for this country I mean it come down to the Supreme\nHaving so much with in its graph having to do with our solvency our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nWell she was willing to play games and the point that I made that I really appreciate that you know you are you why was it up in our circuit court of appeals at all over the ... of course the former vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party back in two thousand eight and of course the former governor of Alaska\nAnd just a great all wrong person or you know this but I wasn't a vote for John McCain is going right in my mother's name until you got on the ticket and then I voted for you\nShow and I think a lot of people actually did that the point I made friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court to the United states the Ninth Circuit court of appeals the the um\nThe more issues of Alaska and everybody in the west coast in other words if the Supreme Court is eight members and it's tied for the foreign almost everyone would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will decide the first amendment Chuck amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment Pence Amendment for Alaska what does that make you think\nThat's exactly right and Joe I was so impressed because nobody else was talking about that share what her\nAction was was essentially bolstering the Ninth Circuit had she had her her way and that's the Ninth Circuit out of\nSan Francisco right you know talking about injustice and justice being delayed for Alaskans because that court a million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nUm the second largest the eleventh and they are only serving thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan very liberal core\nYou is just a practical reasons why we don't want to give them any more power anymore say over Alaska so for me to be

update done it before and not just Clarence Thomas they did it back in Nineteen forty eight with this great American hero Whittaker Chambers\nThat is the unknown mistake voice of Dr Sebastian Gorka why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies that's an unbelievable story because I ... and again I'm you when I talk about it all the time and you know they're not as smart as you um but but I Know a little less reactor\nAct [laughter] I I it's a\nI Know a little bit about history I pay attention I I Do a little dog and pony show every day I Would never ever have thought in my wildest dreams that the Democrats have been doing this\nFor Seventy years you're telling me Seventy years ago how they do the exact rice said em oh this is a modus operandi as we just saw a bunch of indoctrinated idiots scratching and clawing or on the ... of the Supreme Court so you're saying this is what they've done for the ages for generations now\nAbsolutely but this is what happens when you make a deal with the devil when when the left decided\nThat the ends that they're ... getting power\nJustifies the means this is what you end up doing your will destroy innocent man\nYou will try and you'll use every dirty trick in the book because as far as that can set\nIt doesn't matter what I Do it to another human being because I have to have the power and that was so important I I couldn't put this in my book you know why we fight happened off they came out but when the president stood out\nIn the White House two days ago in front of the world and pulled out the Democrats for the evil things they did the justice Kavanaugh and thin pronounced him innocent that was a historic moment because just as what it could chambers within it said Seventy years ago so\nIs justice Kavanaugh eight year old man who the Democrats tried to destroy\nThe name of the book is why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies going get five copies giving to your friends and family doctors Sebastian Gorka that yeah I\nI read the audio book this time so the whole book in order for me with my funny acts that\nIt's not funny at all ... that's going to sell a billion copies everybody wants to hear you read the book so go and get that as well get the audio book as well so so let me ask you about this ... this whole idea from the left\nThat that you so well said and actually talk to my my friend who had been ... about this as well he goes back even further even before World War one and World War two where this sort of fascism has been known to be on the left we just have pretended through history that didn't happen that way but but let me let me ask you about why we're so successful and I have an idea as to why\nBut but I'll ask you more more specifically was it so successful because the right always cow town gave in and again you just have outlined it incredibly this president said I'm not giving in this justice cabinet decided I'm not going to give it I'm not going to allow them to do this to me but is that why it's lasted for probably the better part of a century because the right\nAlways gives in and pull the nominee or or bend over backwards for the left\nI'll tell you what I saw when I was in the White House so I I I had very quickly I developed the reputation the White House a lot of people especially the press department said I I'm ... and the strange one why\nBecause I refused I just refuse flat out from day one to talk to the the fake news I I ... I didn't care whether it was washed the post ... ... and it I said no why would I tool to people who wish to destroy this president I'm ready to talk on record or off wreck all the trouble is\nThe majority of the establishment until the Kavanaugh hearing the majority of the establishment the geo peace than it is that the the the bureaucrats in the in the White House they want the show they won the approval\nOf the New York times why they want the approval of CNN this is the problem and you know why that is so ridiculous number one they wish to destroy us look at what they've done for the last two years and secondly who cares\nAbout CNN yeah the you know I I Know just because of the White House book as you know how many people watched the most quote unquote import show on CNN every night and listen to\nPlus I have no you know how many people know OK so Sean Hannity crush it like he is the ... while they get all yes he\nIs the king millions and millions and millions of us every show Anderson Cooper the star of the Clinton used that work Monday Night his show gets six hundred thousand view is\nAnd that somehow this you don't want to record Dr Gorka how how is it that people and you're right people on the establishment right people in the swamp on the right or afraid of what Anderson Cooper will say about them\nRight we have three hundred and twenty five million people in this country on less than half a percent what's what's Anderson Cooper if they were paying thanks to ... and we now they we now do they pay if they were paying the CNN to be broadcast in America's airports that'd be three people including\nSome who are watching this show is is what we have to break the ... the approval of these people but I Know what last friday did you watch the press conference by the Republican senators\nWho ... who was actually in power and yeah\nThey were angry I have never seen them so angry at the Democrat so that is costing behavior so you know what I think something's changed but everybody\nBe deadly serious the midterms are the most important election of our lives don't take it for granted go to vote take your friends to vote if you like the last two years and you want six more we have to win the mid ...\nHe is Dr Sebastian Gorka the name of the book is why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies one last quick question I always appreciate the access in the friendship thank you and social and I said oh we're friends as well\nI'm a welder when it comes to left versus right politics I just saw an article by the hill\nThat says that millennials overwhelmingly\nAre liberal leaning left will vote left I also saw another recent polling I forget who the pollster was but it's a real one that says that suddenly the G O P s even things up for the race in the\nFor the house of representatives how do you balance that zero fear in your mind as there is a little bit of mine that these young people will go and vote like drones for the left they don't know why they're doing they lean left\nUm and that will somehow counterbalance those of us who actually have studied these things that are more middle age or a little older that will go to them not to go to the polls to how do you counter balance that you have a fear of what's going to happen in the house\nLook I I'm a happy warrior like Reagan I Am an optimist I think we can we can we can take ... we can keep the house keep the Senate the millennials are problem if you look at the victims of communism foundation they did a poll that said forty two percent of millennials want this to live in a social\nNot us they didn't know what what is\nBut but but you know there's two reasons not for a number one ... a lot of millennials just don't vote ... this is amazing gun you

Rick Perry he's the energy secretary for the United states of America no and you might wonder well with the actors that person do\nA lot clearly and a lot of travel is well we talked to about ... we're talking about liquefied natural gas we go to an war as well ... how are you\nJoe I'm good thank you very much we're I'm up in Washington DC for a few days here so you know Texas but it's a it's what are called temporary duty\nAnd you're fighting the fight very well it's interesting as you know I'm connected\nWith several people on your staff and I I can see their travel on Facebook and on Twitter and so on you or your or a globe Trotter now is it did you know that was going to be part of the job to be over in Africa there'd be over in Europe and be over in Asia back home base it on your back over Indonesia we did you know that that was gonna tell all of us\nAre not necessarily but what's happened is is the energy revolution runners off that occurred in the United states it makes sense in hindsight that would be an all those markets because it's\nYou know we're now selling American a liquefied natural gas into thirty different countries on five caught in the next group\nAnd uh there there's more to be done so I'm being there uh I I consider one of my jobs of it obviously being a regulator making sure that we're a you know were regulated at the permit process is smooth and as\nA as as transparent as it can be but it's also to be the you know a salesman for American energy whether it's a a liquefied natural gas for the rich are crude whether it's our fossil fuels whether its nuclear energy whether it's a A R renewable technologies all of that is desired around the world\nAnd the secretary of energy that ought to be their job\nIt's the United states secretary of energy Rick Perry so I'm watching the the the terror of talk of the trade talk and delivers that are that the president has and and he's putting it on the ... you and everybody in the left in this country ... they're all completely you know good he's putting terrorist is going to ruin trade and in no time flat\nYou use stepped up and said we're making a deal we don't want the terrorists we want to have\nFair trade that in a big part of the deal was liquefied natural gas\nNow are you are you consulted as the president's doing that as you liked Rick can we do this Ellen gee thing can we make this happen can we make a part of the bill how does it go down\nYeah he he obviously talks of you know [noise] extensively with his cabinet or the as the secretary of treasury my notion and secretary of commerce\nWilbur Ross day all have a role to\nPlay in that and and uh so absolutely there's a there's a good a correspondent back and forth a and a ... everybody's on the same team and I want to get back to you know this is what people should expect I mean I Know the left\nIn for a lot of reasons that I you know ... and that is what it is a but they're not being realistic they're just they're just they don't like him because he's not Hillary\n[laughter] that's true\nBut it's true and and and the point is that what you would expect to see out of a negotiator a person who goes in what they really hard line I mean he he plans on winning I mean his his theory here is that listen\nIf I trade you and you agree to it you know that's your fault not mine uh and and that's exactly\nWhat he's doing with these trade deals he comes with some really hard stuff I\nMean do you think about with you and then a young and came back in here\nUh after they laid out some really tough or a sanction or not sanctions but tariffs at retro\nA trade deals with the Europeans and they said you know what we decided we want to buy your allergy and let's let's find a way so to the Chinese ... again you know hedge blew up when they announced the terrorists originally with China and then the Chinese came back a few days later\nThe Chinese know that they will lose a they know that we will lose a a trade war or or the Chinese or they'll lose a trade war with us so if\nI were the biggest customers they don't want to screw with us that would be dumb [laughter]\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be right an equitable we want you to be transparent oh and we don't want your stealing our IP either our international uh our our intellectual property\nRights of any good neighbor yeah that that's another big part of it it's a energy secretary Rick\nPerry you were in the state of Texas so efficiently and our economy here still booming under the great guidance of a great guy but now when you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape and there's so much garbage so you've got to go through before you can actually get to the source of the issue when you finally got to see what these trade deals worth especially energy wise with these other countries\nWere you surprised at how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange yeah\nIt it was really pretty fascinating and here's the other side of it as these things were outdated you know think about the north American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety two as one side\nThat was twenty five years ago and and think about we're America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean completely a hundred and eighty degree uh we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who are uh are developing a the energy sources that we were buying\nAnd now I'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada both very different positions than we were twenty five years ago so it makes a button that good sense that the president will say you know what it's time to renegotiate this thing\nWe got an email now the uh uh I think it's a ah what do we call it the ah ah you\nNot only are there homes more affordable but they also take less time to build an are completely customize

really representing her interest as far as as far as she said what are rich resource you want to remain anonymous she didn't want her life publicly exposed to sway but that's what her attorneys did to her\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson resolutely right last question on Kavanaugh known them onto the on affordable healthcare act and and what you guys are doing a very positive way for the American people are but one last question he's now on the court and the left the screaming and yelling give us back the house will impeach him\nMe again it's ridiculous and I'm not really sure why any voter even somebody who lean left would say well yeah I'm going to vote for impeachment for no reason um what do you make of that sort of their Montreal we're not going to kick him off the court because we're so unhappy that he's on the court\nWell was there an angry mob and they they've been they've had this primal screams cents a day after you\nAnd when the wrong person according to them one I've never seen his like this Joey known in my lifetime there's always some measure of honey room there's some\nYou know best wishes to any president who's taking out an enormous task right hoping they succeeding keep this nation safe and prosperous and secure that never happened there's been an effort to sabotage just administration from day one in the media and certainly in the Democratic party\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson Republican race did Wisconsin let's talk about the an Affordable Care act you supported the president as it all Republicans and I was that all Americans because our paychecks are bigger and and do this this individual mandate went away you supported the tax change and the individual mandate change that actually help people of the major\nAmount of people that were paying that find that taxing the an Affordable Care act were middle class people that were harmed horribly you guys did a great job of lowering taxes for all Americans for corporations\nAnd getting rid of the individual mandate nobody but nobody that I Know of on either side wants to get rid of preexisting conditions although the leftist pretending to you Ron Johnson and the president on down all want to get rid of preexisting conditions that's not the case but you were a big supporter of of the individual choice and health care\nAnd the the idea that the left somehow is making it a of a political thing is strange to me why wouldn't we want individuals to have choices and competition to lower the prices fill me in on how this is unfolding and how they think this is a win for them\nWell first of all this is just another big lie remember president bomb if you'd like health care plan and keep it ya families who have their previous reduce probably five hundred dollars per year me was politifact two thousand Thirteen lived here right beside to be the two thousand Eighteen live a year\nOr they're they're pushing a congressional Review Act to reverse a rule\nWhere President Trump is just reinstating the short term limited duration plans right in the form they were under Obama right\nAnd they're saying that we're gonna take away preexisting conditions nothing could be further from the truth the Urban Institute which is a left leaning think tank said if we reinstate these things to three sixty four days which is they weren't or Obama yeah and then in addition to that allow companies to offer renew ability okay so so you give people greater assurances\nFour point three million Americans will avail themselves of these plants because they're far more affordable one point seven that four point three or previously uninsured because they can't afford Obamacare\nAnd Joe the premium estimates and get their just estimates and in Wisconsin for example he health\nEstimated that a family of three that the lowest cost her by Medicare plan costs sixteen thousand dollars a year they can get an insurance plan getting out the same kind of coverage but something that they would choose for about twelve hundred dollars a year that's an enormous difference other estimates say premiums will be cut in half or two a quarter\nOf the current level so in other words you're paying four thousand bucks a year you may be only pay a thousand so I don't know where the premiums land a complete depends on the insurance product you choose right but it's your choice you putting patients back and nothing can be further from the truth preexisting condition guaranteed remains in place those protections you can always go back\nTo the Obamacare exchanges if you can afford them and of course eighty seven percent of Americans are on those are subsidized with the the vast premium tax credits so they don't care what premiums cross because American taxpayers foot that bill\nI Want to go back to somebody you set a second ago and you said a kind of quickly but I think it's probably the most important thing in the entire conversation\nPreexisting conditions aren't touched nobody is saying of those with preexisting conditions can no longer get healthcare they're going to die in the streets lepers or something but just really reiterate that for me center if you can is there anything in this that the president or the Senate or the house are doing that will get rid of coverage for those who have pre existing conditions\nNo absolutely not we we can't change the law we'd have to change the law we can't do through regulation right so the ... the protection in terms of pre existing conditions you can always go on the Obamacare exchanges were just giving those individuals particularly the forgotten men and women that don't\nGet the subsidies that can't afford they'd been priced out of the bond care exchanges we're giving them an option to be out to be able to afford health insurance for once\nOkay that no this is a this is a big lie it's a totally false what the Democrats are are peddling here in terms of of the short term when when ...\nYou have an opinion as to why they're doing it as a ... is the only because they want single payer period we want socialize healthcare period we will argue against anything that's competitive or capitalistic or or free enterprise base does that really wouldn't be argument is\nWell first of all they want to win this election they they realize if the if the American people actually believe Republicans want to take away that protects our pre existing condition which no Republican wants to do right okay the American people spoke on that\nUh they think they can win the election but no I mean there are long term goal obviously is Bernie Sanders your Medicare for all which is which gets rid of Medicare takes the Dallas dedicated to Medicare and puts a tour his single payer\nGovernment run bureaucratic system that will ration care\nWill reduce the number of doctors because who's going to want to be reimbursed at Medicaid rates right and that's the only reason only costs only costs thirty two trillion dollars if we reimburse providers at current rates it costs thirty eight trillion dollars everybody's individual income tax for at least have to double business\nTaxes at least double and it's still wouldn't pay for it\nI urge anybody who's listening you're watching the right down the number thirty two trillion then realized how much money but as a Senator Ron Johnson one last question I run a rose reshaped the access of the time and You're welcome anytime my friend um when it comes to the mid term you just mentioned it briefly\nI feel strongly that knowing Google the

Joe ... lab\nYou long for the ride so talking about a ride the stock market as we took a bumpy ride some say a roller coaster some say just went straight down I'm the president calling the fed logo\nI guess I guess that's the issue I'm not even sure what that means but whenever it's a financial markets thing or potential question I always go to my friend Doug Adler use the manager director and senior vice president of investments ruby dreams that associates a Doug I always appreciate it how's it going brother\nJohn great thank you so uh all the president has to say that the fed is logo and that when we get eleven hundred points it due to the negative on the stock market people obviously you're freaking out some of them are do you know be\nI think the stock market as a slot machine anyway so I don't really worry about it my four oh one K. still looks great today um but people are freaking out about can you point to one thing\nThat made this happened ... conglomeration of things\nYeah I think it's a conglomeration of thanks Joey what's always interesting about the market is\nThings that we know that are potential headwinds the market looks at it stares at it shrug it off drugs that often and so it it it matters I think what's kinda manifested here is we know that the Federal Reserve is on this trajectory of raising interest rates so\nWhat does that really at the end of the day designed to do cool off the economy so that brings into question next year twenty Nineteen what earnings look like\nTrade or China looks like a tough a a photo if you will and in this regard so that's problematic we've had a few companies a pre announce their earnings which don't didn't look necessarily great\nOil has gone up the you know that's I'm up to Seventy five now it's pulled back the last couple of days like everything towards Seventy but still it's much higher than it was Eighteen months ago I had went on the economy should have some of these things that no those have all been there but suddenly that mattered and people that sell but\nDo you have a pretty large dug out all the managing director senior vice president over it originated associates you have an opinion as to why the fed would want to cool off the economy\n[noise] well they have this in a state inflation target of two percent going here and then when you start to she mentioned oil as an example there's other places we can point to that are that are showing some inflationary pressure which is part and parcel of course to a stronger economy in this economy is much stronger than it was\nWhen President Trump took office you're getting some of those pressures\nFed tries to stay in front of that because you you it's kind of like a you know the old porridge three little bears story they don't want it too hot or too cold yeah\nThey want to just right and so they're trying to do that meaning a slow things down into that sweet spot where we have reasonable growth but maybe that's three percent with reasonable ... which they were there do you mean to be two percent so that's that's why they're doing it\nIs it rational or reasonable ...\n... I heard today somebody may mentioned that there's a rumor that the left is trying to do this before the midterm election if the if the Trump ... the tank and he's ... the the tax cuts and all that stuff is it reasonable rational to think that politically people can make this happen\nUm that that's a stretch that's a pretty big stretch um think about it if you're on that side of the political ledger you're kind of hurting yourself right if you're right ... thanks go down I don't see that yeah\nOkay a gambler he's managing director of the vice president of a investments are emerging that associates so as\nWe watch this you know Obama when he was an officer and talk to you about this before we started so he doesn't pay attention to the daily dry rations of the stock market or when it wasn't doing so great in in what he was doing great he said look how great I Am I'm this of course the left politically is saying well see the bubbles burst thing\nFor you know sixteen months Eighteen months almost two years now they've been sending the bubbles going to burst this can't continue like this do you think this is something temporary and it will correct itself again or are we seeing that maybe you do get too big for his bridges\nYeah no I I think are so investing the one thing that gets lost a lot of times is people you think it's a bull market or bear market and they have an opinion based on how they feel about things\nBut really what it it's a probability business and so if one were to answer that question by looking at the probabilities I think you say this fats in the regulatory reform that's positive we've had tax reform massively positive we have an economy that had been held back because the consumer\nAnd then very low in terms of their confidence in the outlook All right now and this is actually right we're at twenty year high something like that in consumer confidence I think last week we hit an all time high since Nineteen sixty nine for small business confidence so when you feel good about the prospects what do you do you open up your wallet\nAnd in that regard I have to tell you this is really for found two things first one is\nThat service so that's just simply what comes in and income a into a household and then what goes out for obligations like student loans car payments mortgages credit card debt okay read at the lowest level the percentage of income and go into debt services the lowest level since the mid seventies\nAnd household net worth in this country such assets minus liabilities\nIt's a hundred trillion dollars a hundred trillion although I'm Hi yeah\nSo if my debt obligations are low if my wallet or purses is full of cash as it's ever been and I feel good about things what's the odds that I'm going to suddenly just stop spending money because the Dow drops eleven hundred points\nWell it's not affecting my spending that's a great question and it's interesting but you bring it up that way because I think it was two months ago maybe a month ago we were hearing that big box stores are reporting better salesman they've ever seen ever restaurants we're seeing more people go out to eat than they've ever seen the big scene in two generations so clearly people do have more expendable cash", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Joe Pags Show", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "13", "locations": [["Haiti",
