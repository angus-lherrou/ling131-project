mean it is heartbreaking to see the faces of those slain for their faith was the cover of the New York post today and as you read about the the lives of these people it is one heartbreaking story after another\nAre sadly too we watched the media do what they always do and that's rushed to blame and pulling out all the stops to blame Donald Trump for the Pittsburgh massacre when in fact the prime minister of Israel Ron dorm or the ambassador of all said that the president's comments were welcomed unappreciated\nOn every front um we'll get into all this as we continue rose ten and I'm the host of Clinton rows and rows um plugged in Pittsburgh, PA ugh long friend of the program and David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney thank you both for being here\nUh you know how much I loved by friends in Pittsburgh rose a very very sorry your thoughts and prayers go to everybody uh the fact that it's been so viciously politicized within minutes makes me my stomach turn and those trying to cast blame against the president make this a campaign issue is just nauseating\nIt is shining you or so left in Pittsburgh as well as soon as I heard the story that news Saturday morning\nI mean my heart went out and I was almost afraid to hear the list of victims their names because\nThis community it's such a lovely place it's a very popular ...\nI go there to shop and to dying and done in fact my son told me just about a month ago that's one of the the ... is considering moving too so we we love that community it's a tight knit community they are very involved though in so many aspects and not just their community but the out if the surrounding communities\nAnd as it turned out you know of course I grew up with a girl who's cuts and with the two brothers\nThat perished on Saturday but there were so many people that have done so many great things in this community and the Pittsburgh area and it's just it's heartbreaking it really is to see that this happened but as soon as I thought those things\nAnd immediately I got sick thinking that this is going to become political and\nIt says you can count the seconds ... there's an interesting side note that there is no throw this to David I'm how democratic candidates increasingly turned against Israel\nAnd our mutual friend Alan Dershowitz you know I had a pretty powerful column that he put out\nLinking the the mass of good at the Democratic party's tolerance for anti Semitism most recently we saw Bill Clinton two seats down from Louis Farrakhan I'd never ever get in a room with the dishes racist anti Semite like Louis Farrakhan or picture that emerged to with Farrakhan and\nObama that was hidden from the public for eight years while he was president that existed that they had had a relationship\nUm and if you look at some of the most pro Israeli president I think we've had since the the forty eight partition plan un partition plan is a is Donald Trump\nMore recently making Jerusalem the capital of Israel which so many other presidents have promised that never had the courage to do\nAny person who would suggest for a moment Donald Trump as an anti Semitic bone in his body is that of their mind look at his family et cetera but you're absolutely right and what you pointed out ... ... if you believe that words matter then it goes much further than just a President Clinton sitting in a room\nWith Mr fabric on their pictures of President Clinton President Obama Cory Booker shaking hands and smiling with Farrah Khan members of Congress doing the same Linda source or another hater\nOr get an honorary degree at City College an honorary doctorate is that a bomb a nation what climate is he a way to sort of press releases about some of these kinds of things and listen this is Linda ... praises\nResume or day uh terrorists to Palestinian terrorists who killed two American college students she's been praised by Christ in dealing with a brand she's it praised unfortunately by Stacey Abrams is running for Congress here in Georgia now um it's words matter those things that are a great deal\nAs it should be expected when you normalize Israel bashing and the hatred of Jews it should be expecting\nAll the way that I Would have or she would put it I thought it was pretty powerful you said they can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism and I agree\nWe we have to have a zero tolerance policy President Obama meets with Farrakhan shame on him President Clinton sits on a platform with Farrakhan shame on him he tell us and joins Farrakhan was one of the greatest purveyor of anti Semitic hate he's right\nI'm just because he's black doesn't give him in the past four is anti Semitism and any liberal\nWas any positive association with Farrakhan as is part of the problem not the solution and you know just last week Farrakhan was making anti Semitic statements and it was only two months ago that Al Sharpton Jesse Jackson of Bill Clinton were all sitting next to each other with Farrakhan at a wreath of Franklin's funeral\nI Would not go to any funeral that he was ... I'm Sorry I just you draw the line\nAnd trying to find may here too and there's something I like your listeners to know because\nI I noticed a couple of headlines today on Sunday there was a letter that was published in written by eleven members of a group called bend the ark and they have a Pittsburgh affiliate right here and they sent a letter to the president is blaming hat and they said that you yourself called the\nMurder evil that yesterday's violence is that direct combination of you were influence\nAnd they said you're in the past three eerie ear work and your policies have\nInviting that's involved in this\nAnd that you know what was interesting is I had so many messages and phone calls\nFrom listeners today they they pretty much agree first of all of that than they are just that your listeners now it's not representative of the Pittsburgh Jewish community they did not speak for that and that is what many of my listeners said these people are are there and obscure left wing group\nI'm a very progressive cheese and and they don't speak to the Jewish community here in Pittsburgh I've been told by many this morning\nYou don't have everything with David go Harry important\nVery important point by the way I Wish they were obscured Peter Beinart as a matter of that group that's in Israel faster and Haider from start to finish\nRecorded then George Soros his grandson is a member of the group that report to speak to this one for this wonderful Pittsburgh community I been to the tree of life shall I was a guest of the rabbi there for about ... it's a wonderful place they're not haters they're not people that want to politicize anything and the president by the way can't win for losing\nThe guy who sent those pipe bombs around\nUh people claim he was a follower of President Trump this guy the shooter the killer in Pittsburgh have President Trump he called them a global list there's no longer insulting work world\nConservatives by and large mainstream conservatives David are the biggest supporters of Israel in this country I've been friends with prime minister Netanyahu for twenty five years friends with a who Brock and and Shimon Peres a and others\nThat frog you broadcast from Israel you've been a great friend of Israel but ... percent right and on for a look there been articles lately there's an entire stream of the Democratic party now\nThat is a it frankly Israel haters and not give a past this Alexandria Ocasio Cortez these new people on the scene Palestinians and the ... it's just not true they're peddling wise about Israel and that's very very dangerous if you believe words matter\nWhat words matter but this was the deadliest anti Semitic attacking us history the president also saying we will see their destruction which I agree with\nI got to take a break but we'll come back more with rose tenant and David shown on the other side I saw a friend said show many have done it again right if you look in the mirror what do you see maybe a little bit of sag along your jaw line um remember ... when he gets rid of bags and\nService being held just a few hours after the accused gunman Robert powers made his first court appearance in a wheelchair released from the hospital earlier today ours\nWas in court in hospital issue garb you seem to work at a clear mind answering yes or no when asked questions why the judge Bowers acknowledge that he received a copy of the criminal complaint filed against him by an FBI agent in that criminal complaint reveals disturbing details about the synagogue

attacks like criticism of the president for the attack success John decker my that the White House\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders pushing back it claims by some Democrats at the president has blamed the media for the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue\nVery first thing that the president didn't was condemned the attack sloth in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs the very first thing the media did was blamed the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous acts\nEarlier the president tweeting the fake news media the true enemy of the people must stop the open an

governor and the great state of Georgia although I think that's moving back towards camping back towards the Republican\nIn Tennessee it if you want to keep the Senate it's a must win seats in Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn against bill Brett is and we have British students team on tape saying that he was lying about cabin all and that is going to govern as a liberal\nAnd I think that really is taking people back also on tape staffers per brightest in calling the people Tennessee ignorant I don't think that's helpful so I think Marshall hold but people have got to get out the

Nineteen states we knocked on a million nine hundred and seven thousand three hundred and twenty eight doors a through this weekend Sean not that we're counting and\nAs of this weekend five point eight million of the voters that we've contacted have already voted we expect that number to exceed ten million by election day\nWe think we're going to have the biggest turnout of Christian voters we've ever had in mid term elections\nWell I Hope so I'm I'm a little worried about the house uh I looked at ras muses number the president has not had a higher approval rating than he does now which is perfect timing\nThe president literally has been going state by state and out doing everything within his power to make people aware that this is really hard mid term election history is going against the tide here\nIf we are to hold the house and hold the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think will definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house real clear politics average has the Democrats and two oh five Republicans at two hundred and you know basically you've got these dirty toss up seats or or thereabouts that are in play and that's going to make all the difference\nYeah that's right and and ... are it by the people right now certainly the thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education literature

have spoken at all about the caravan their silence has been definite then they'll say is well Republicans talking about it means that they're they're racist and Xena phobic it no it just means we believe in the rule of law\nAnd we're not going to wait the four weeks so you\nKnow seven fourteen thousand people make it here\nSo I think that's playing a part I think all the incidence of the mob on the Democratic party side we have some real bullets used over the weekend shooting up\nA Republican headquarters in Florida or we saw the terrible shooting in the Pittsburgh synagogue this weekend you have a Florida Man arrested for threatening to kill a Republican Congress but\nYeah I have an angry leftist mob disrupting Marsha Blackburn campaign rally would Lindsey Graham um we've seen two Republicans punched in Minnesota uh there's a lot of anger and a lot of violence out there on the left you see Republicans being run out of restaurants\nUh Pam Bondi run out of a movie theater secretary Nielsen oh Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz and his wife Mitch McConnell Kevin McCarthy's office it with a Boulder busting his office window so there's a lot of left wing violence out there and it's a pretty dangerous time\nYeah and I think anytime you're dealing with uh this kind of pervasive dark the most important thing that you can do is light a candle and I think what people have got to do is they've got to resist that hate with a love for their country a love for their fellow man\nAnd hope for better future for all of our citizens stay positive stay prayer full and work hard you know I

and if you want to be a part of the programs amazing the criticism that has been out there or what should be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border\nOr a significant display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should\nWe saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that\nLet people got to the border knock down the fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland secure\nEarly have made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen that we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special consideration to work in southern Mexico a but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend\nYou know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them\nAnd who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed the the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nAnd Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries are from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this\nThat's the only bit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis he's a senior partner a and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen has extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program so glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having been a pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column and night but I haven't read the whole column both my read of it is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question on the Mark I'm in the ... actually good actually a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this are folks somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of the president who basically tried to overthrow the constitution and making ... president for life there and that with the Venezuelan\nAnd lay out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet that our world and organizing a posted videos and pictures from the marks\nSo again no great great mystery this is the work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and it is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American\nGovernment look bad and our allies look that\nWell I may look America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and\nI'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with ... with anti immigrant sentiment or is he in a phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a\nBorder wall with a big door and that people should respect our laws are constitutional republic\nAmerican sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas and that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process of maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that's called the legal wet\nIt without question this doesn't have anything to do with a Smith ethnicity does not seem to do with race this is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws humbling according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply to walk across the border I have always wondered\nBy the way those folks that are actively don't want to control the border why is it that only people who can walk here should be allowed to getting the status if that's the principal\nWell what I'm about ready to lose I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he ... and if people rush across our border beat at a port of entry or along the border that is not fence and that our military is on the border\nThe military is going to be given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here\nUh coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess\nBut nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nI agree with you on a present shall we don't want to hurt and also it is undoubtedly true that most of these people are simply on being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S stuff probably been lied to get them\nI'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross\nOn so they are being caught in the in the middle of this I'm simply used as human shields on on a harder on the behalf of folks hostile to the United states that is a horrible tragedy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nNow look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I've taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country\nAnd I've been down to the border Thirteen times and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built um I I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall and fencing and I can look across the fence\nAnd on the other side of Mexico

now an estimated seven thousand heading for the U.S border where they are willing to take their chances despite us efforts to stem the flow\nAnd then you've got a case an allegation made about Cory Booker now over the weekend on top of statements in his own words that he had made some years ago when he was Fifteen\nOr apparently some people are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's husband being accused of some type of me to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere\nI'm here's what is anecdotally something that I think should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you this if you want to predict it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida is a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida's important Florida I think he won his races by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe not the best politician with the best gift of gab rush loser but boy when it comes\nGetting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with ah we've got it for whatever reason the media is falling in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd you know run the center of the great debate last night and he's now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax that Gillum would support the only Muslim use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views\nHe's trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected by being honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe in what they really want to fight for\nWe saw that with Brett us that and the project ... tape and the great state of Tennessee anyway you know run the Santa sees in a fight for his life down in Florida\nWe got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but you know for whatever reason bread I said is out there trying to convince the people of Tennessee that is something that he's not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water\nAs they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and saying that his public position on Brett Kavanaugh is just for show and we saw the same thing in the tapes in Missouri with Claire McCaskill\nYou know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony\nShe goes on a an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets looks so Harvey tour\nWith with wings unbelievable but some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it is in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice cause\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not going to not take care of you we pay the healthcare costs\nWe pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody's against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process\nThat we have sovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected\nAnd what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront of the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry\nI mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texas alone victims of crimes some very serious including murder\nAnd then it gets downright scary now we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the weekend confronted some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing throwing those out the the door of the restaurant\nNow it's almost happening on a daily weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you but I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to what we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare their fundamental promises which was keep your doctor keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for in theory of coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and healthy to buy plans they never want needed or desired and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled uh Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year or and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer and heart attack\nBut the anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or a evaporating before his eyes\nEven his Democratic colleagues don't think it's going to happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate have faded in the final weeks of the twenty eight to an election with a party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber it's a far cry from pretty much the last year and a half oh we're gonna we're gonna take control of the house and the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away looks like it's going to be a Republican pickup Martha ... going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean there's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support it skipped Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo now we have ... Democrats are urging caution on the blue wave to temper expectations new Fox\nA poll has come out top Democrats now they're spending their time managing expectations about ... the blue wave\nAnd sweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill urging caution about those predictions amid fresh signs at the midterms are much closer than anticipated Democratic National committee chair Tom Perez was still hasn't condemn Keith Ellison\nSaid today that he doesn't use the term blue wave to talk about a possible victory for the party even though house minority leader Nancy Pelosi who has her eyes on the speaker's gavel said just days earlier that we're looking at a democratic tsunami\nLook I Can't look I don't have a crystal ball I all I Know is winning everything is possible\nI can see a scenario where Rick Scott wins in Florida Ron dissenters becomes the governor Marsha Blackburn wins in Tennessee Martha Black um ...

yeah\nSame here but I Will tell you want on Saturday I had a a person from Honduras\nWho came here legally and when that lady comment is that a Republican event Saturday morning in our home town in

goals and dreams in this great nation that's the part that upsets me the most when you see this kind of thing happened and the and the possible political implications\nAnd and motivations behind these things that's what bothers me the most and I think it is\nCommon sense Americans say look this is not how it's supposed to work you want to come to this country and you're a legitimate asylum seeker that's one thing but when eighty percent of the people who show up at our border claiming assign um aren't legitimate or asylum seekers that's a problem and we know that's probably what this this group is is mostly about as well\nWe also have this issue of the mob that no Democrat seems willing to come from either I mean you know we saw what we watched Ted Cruz and his wife get out of a restaurant by an angry left wing mob we watch that happen a Pam Bondi at a movie theater we watch that happen a secretary Nielsen we watch that happen to Sarah Sanders\nA we saw Mitch McConnell go through those are the airport and then this weekend that happened a again a let me play a little of the McConnell confrontation and then you have the liberal media you know literally and then we have

a lovely guy\nHe's a wonderful guy he's a friend and he would never act that he will debate the ideas you'll show up and have a robust debate like we're supposed to win this great nation but he would never this is the new left this is a new cars finishes the way ... liberal and and and people who believe in their positions and their ideas and their their policy\nThat's the way it's supposed to be but what is happening now is so dangerous for this country and so so wrong and just\nNot going to let me ask you this when this great nation off or how\nDoes the president and this would be my goal the president obviously is is gonna pull back aid to some of these countries that are allowing this this caravan to move forward\nUm nobody wants to anyone to get hurt at the at the border these you know I Would assume the vast majority are innocent people but you know getting where we don't know anybody I mean you could have people that are mixed in with the crowd that want to bring harm to our country but I Would assume most people come here because they want a better life\n... if they are hell bent on disobeying our laws and our sovereignty and the president then has to protect our borders how do we do it in the way that is safe is for the people that are there because I don't want to see people getting hurt at the border you don't see people the president doesn't want to see that\nBut on the other hand I Can't you can't allow them to come in either\nI write and this is why we've had legislation that's been introduced to Democrats once a quarter 'cause I think deep down they want

Americans so you know by every measure and more jobs out of\nThe bottom ... percent of the society shot the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies\nBut also the fact that he cut the slack at the border and so it made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot now have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us all through the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get it and he called them the blue collar billionaire yeah and they said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President because it's the other day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you

passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents that our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies of because what we both know is that you cannot system ties or through a political system created equal outcomes never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she's do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and\nHave something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction is that it seems like there's no limits here\nBut there's no moderation left either ... the Democratic party it used to be I I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nYou're losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society uh even though it sounds great on paper all of your ideas when they meet contact with reality or disaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people it's happened to me it's happened to me on a\nCollege campuses it's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling\nI'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it are both the you know what you know what's great about the people just want you to think about Ninety five percent\nOf east professor Sean or liberal but about forty five fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the Malone\nAll right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is one of those Trump the blue collar president\nUh you know it's interesting you look at the jobs created who's benefitting when we create manufacturing jobs in factory jobs are and we bring an industry back to America and we incentivize businesses to invest here well\nThat's the forgotten men and women the Thirteen million under Obama\nThe additional Thirteen million that were on food stamps and after eight years of his presidency and the eight million more Americans that were in poverty after eight years of his presidency well now we have for a million new jobs in eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps and so dramatic turn around and they're back happily working\nAnd some are getting career jobs and opportunities that we were told was never coming back\nAnd listen we're all big

I mean I've talked to people on the left they you drive them nuts I mean you give them fit so fury that I thought only I could do\nIs try to see things just order is Scott and I think one of the things that they're ceding most about that what they're most\nHating right now is the fact that both Claire McCaskill and Phil Bredesen neither Senate candidates one of them is the United states senator had been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage I mean it's it's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri they're they're they're the local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journalists do not want to talk about this in fact I just got to have like all the Washington Post he's tweeting at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about her some of these position I said what about other things she's saying here but she hasn't been public about so they they very much have shown for good reason\nWell listen I when you expose fraud what this is now exposed as something that I've been pointing out for a while we have Maxine Waters on tape saying they keep telling me not to say it and every time they tell me I'm going to say it anyway impeach forty five impeach forty five\nThen we see the center for American Progress warning every single Democrat running for office told talk about immigration we know we know we won't open borders and eliminate ice but don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna do don't tell them what you have is a massive\nFraud propaganda lie campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about the ... that is a really scary\nScenario for the country and for people that ... that's the only way they can win is to lie to hide who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show no ah this is the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in Missouri\nOne of the staffers agrees McCaskill quote essentially has to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these\nAre staffers throughout her office hiding hiding in masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's acting beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us to take the money through ... indirect means\nIn order to I guess appeal to moderate to the front page New York times story today about how these\nPro life pro gun Democrats are shrinking\nConstituency in Missouri the Democratic party have voted these people out McCaskill still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it is a truism that in order to get elected in a state of Missouri or Tennessee you basically have to mislead voters to get elected as a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we ... the American people had it when the Democratic party abandon any sense of\nDue process under the law equal application under our laws you know immediately I Believe her but they also said the minute Kavanaugh was announced we are going to oppose them any way by any means necessary\nAnd then when all the the the allegations are getting more severe more severe and everyone's saying well I Believe her not even want to hear from judge Kavanaugh presumption of innocence at all\nAnd when corroborating so-called corroborating stories fell apart they still didn't care\nAnd I think the American people are watching that we have a story out today where you got these ... middle class of benders attacking to Minnesota GOP candidates are assaulted one is a woman\nA name as state representative Sarah Anderson punched by an anarchist EPA trying to stop him from kicking her campaigns on\nI mean this this is now the Democratic party and you're exposing it and the ... and yeah you're going to be hated but I think ... shining a light on truth I thought this was this stuff that's sixty minutes used to do\nWell undercover McCaskill statement McCaskill Claire McCaskill issued a videotape state which is unbelievable I Know you play a little bit on your show last night and she said the number of quoted she says well starting with Josh Hawley us to her opponent would be part of ... billion betting someone in my campaign first of all I categorically unequivocally deny\nThat he does not work for me he does not work with me I've never spoken to any of these candidates I stay away from candidates I investigate candidates but she just went on TV Sean Claire McCaskill just falsely stated that Josh was involved in is the attorney general Missouri was involved in this and then she says three times I committed fraud\nWill will walk by what were courting the people being honest that's brought\nIn their own were their own their own or something\nMy words I'm not the one who said quote get over it this is a direct quote for staffers next a roast about how she's going to impeach Trump and she didn't tell the moderates to get over it after she gets elected that's very words and she's calling me a fraud stir for telling the truth to the American people it's the job of investigative reporting\nTo expose the truth and and I think she didn't have to respond to her response because it's filled with lies and then you wouldn't do an accusation\nI'm just glad that you were able to get all of this out and before the election um why do I suspect that there's probably going to be more tape other candidates I have known you now what for a decade or more\nThat's right yeah I mean ... you know am I Am oh a pun intended Missouri now you know my ... next to release the candidate of the time we have to United States senators and their candidates\nOpposing them responding to our investigative work we're lying in their responses were sort of using the Olympic ... tactics against the landscapes the Lenski was to get the reaction and use the reaction in the reaction to the reaction\nWe have two reactions now and we're going to the next state will be releasing another video early next week and it's very very a battleground state same theme Sean ... they have to lie and then once they get elected to the old bait and switch through\nAnd do what they actually intend to do and it's it's just on videotapes not my words stopped my claims are not giving you unsubstantiated\nNot a lot of people watch it to themselves and they can decide people pretty smart hum a James O'Keefe is with us founder and the c._e._o. project very tossed dot com and\nThe videos are up there and you can check 'em out yourself a boat Claire McCaskill and her staff and they'll reticent and his staff and he's telling us there's more to come we'll come back we'll take a quick break we'll come back and continue eight hundred nine four one showing a toll free telephone number will make a quick stop\nA there is an opponent for Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren Jeffs deal and or does that that that race now need re evaluation by the people of Massachusetts will get to that\nAnd your calls a eight hundred nine four one shown as a number will continue\n[noise]\nPartying and investigating the stories that matter to you\nKnow [noise]\nIn during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school she was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage he was featured in a Native American cookbook that isn't titled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a justice week well it turns out he is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American let me interpret it another way that's less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American in her professional career her political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this\nThey and tries to prove to her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics the worse than I mean you know ... it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nNow the question is I I Know that Massachusetts plans solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but you really want to elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell Geoff Diehl is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld and\nMitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible ... that uh the people in Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nAnd showing great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm

borders eliminate ice sanctuary cities now we have a sanctuary state California\nThey want ... why do they want to open borders to they calculated that is going to benefit them at the ballot box helping them retain power notice every decision and every agenda item is about them wanting to hold on to power period\nIt doesn't matter the output uh the the what the end result is doesn't matter Obama wrecked the economy I won't give you the statistics again if you listen to this program regularly I Know you can recite them by rote as well\nThe only reason I say it so often is that so everybody nobody can't say they didn't know\nBut that's what they want to take us back to that but they want their crumbs back they want they want to destroy Trump they're driven by a borderline psychotic hatred of this president\nThey want to go back to what back to Obamacare they weren't open borders so that they think that their their party will remain in power for ever if they get enough people crossing the border caravans of people\nAre going to talk about what the president's planning and ... that's what they stand for\nThis is what the Democratic Party take back the crumbs he pulled bomb a care open borders impeach Trump endless investigation what name one thing they're that they're doing to make your life better\nBut goes after losing Thirteen million Americans and and having them have to go through food stamps to survive and sustain themselves in eight years of a failed do Tommy of Obama the only president never to reach three percent GDP Growth in American history\nYou know they want to what we don't want to add more people why 'cause they're dependent on them the crumbs they're handing out\nThe irony of that they're ... what what did the leftovers they have\nYou know when they're done building their gyms their Senate gyms or house Kim's there you know house barber shops there Senate barber shops the Senate dining rooms their house dining rooms or they treat themselves well they're not they're not on Obamacare they got a separate health system just for them very different\n[noise] so that's what's at stake you're not going to tell you something about this border as I watch this care of it\nYou got to understand this is the about national security this is personal security\nI think I'm the only person in the media that actually took the time over the years and I've been down reporting from the border Thirteen times site antidote you've told us that before\nYeah I've been on horseback yeah Ben and helicopters yeah been out on boats yeah I've been on foot Yemen all terrain vehicles I've been on the border all the way from the Rio Grande straight on through San Diego and many stops in between\nI've seen gang members arrested drug warehouse the biggest warehouse I've ever seen in my life floor to ceiling drugs confiscated guess where they were headed\nTo Yorktown your city to your kids that they ingest them and now it's worse than ever\nBut there's now a lot of the heroin that we have we have an opioid crisis in this country\nIs is one the one issue is oh kids go into grandma grandpa was medicine cabinet\nThey try a bike and then a Percocet anoxic ... and then they go back they got another one next thing you know they're addicted next thing you know they're buying them on the streets God Knows what those pills really aren't the drug dealers don't give a rip that these kids die\nThen when they find out they can't afford eighty bucks a pill well then some genius idiot friend or dealer friend quote of there's just want you to try heroin does much better high and the only ten dollars a bag\nAnd they'll start snorting heroin or chasing the dragon as they call it and they light up in smoke it and then eventually you're going to remain lining it and then guess what they're on a trajectory straight into the grave\nAnd a life of a living hell\nAnd that's the opioid crisis and wears a lot of those drugs coming from right over the border where it's human trafficking happening right over the border what's happening all across the border there's a new thing it's called fat and all\nYou don't talk to my buddy Eric Bowley his Nineteen year old son ... bought an than that which is you know to relieve anxiety\nAnd and and it was laced if you have three grains of fat and all the size of three grain of salt\nIt will kill you and we have nearly a hundred thousand kids dying every single day one death every seven point five minutes\nYou know almost a hundred thousand deaths a year and we keep talking about opioid crisis left and right opioid we can stop it if we secure the border\nCaravans now so I think it's right I think Kavanaugh what do we see what's happening all\nThe total total elimination of anything that we recognize as the U.S constitution the rule of law equal justice under the law equal application of our laws or the presumption of innocence what presumption of innocence I Believe her never heard from a bribe believer\nYou know that no corroborating evidence I don't believe her\nYou know but then ... no no no but but they were lined up almost on a weekend basis they wind up in the hall first they spike the punch bowl and after they fight the punch bowl the boys would wind up in the hall every weekend\nAnd then they rape the girls in the room they take turns and it happened almost every weekend and then the story evolved into well I didn't see him spike the punch bowl but I saw a mirror punch bowl\nAnd I see I saw him give out a red solo cup\nThat's what that became\nSo

and the suspected killing of a journalist and constantly in Turkey Fox's Jared ... live at the White House\nPresident Trump says it certainly looks as a journalist ... dead and if Saudi Arabian leaders are bound to be responsible the president says there will be consequences will have\nWhat was the media elite strategy well that was the lead the contents of Hillary bought and paid for dirty Russian dot CA just like the same information\nWas used to obtain the size of warrants against Carter Page you can't make any of this up for people now say Rod Rosenstein yeah he wanted to wear a wire on the president I'm James Baker is back on the hill today remember he was one of the poor people\nThat was very clear about Rod Rosenstein and we're still awaiting the de classification of let's see three oh two gang of eight information buys a warrants\nA we're also awaiting you know whether or not we're going to get an redacted Pfizer applications pages ten through twelve seventeenth ... thirty four remember the bulk of information for the size of warrants\nWas the pony never verified never corroborated Russian dot CA that Hillary paid for there's so much it stinks to high heaven or John

the sent for Merrill executives to jail for a year and that got turned over by the fifth\nCircuit court of appeals it sounds complicated it really is it is the single biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in the history of the country\nAnd I haven't even mentioned the abuse\nSome of the powerful tools of intelligence\nThat we give these people supposedly to protect us I joining us now a civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney David shown and Carter Page was banned at the center of all of this for the last year and a quarter I Know that you're moving forward with investigations lawsuits and I don't blame you one bit I mean\nFrom everything you've told me is that our FBI our CIA our intelligence community knew you well because as your work took you to foreign lands when you come back from places like Russia\nOr you would willingly sit B.D briefed ... and and tell them everything you know to help the country out so uh I guess if you were really the bad guy that needed to be surveilled than they needed Hillary Clinton's on verified phony Russian ... doing it\nAs the presentation to commit fraud on the ... I Would think you'd be indicted right now you were as bad as they say\nShot it just it it just kept getting crazier and crazier every day I uh I think it just uh just this week we have the Saudis that are um owning up to various things that may have happened there and you know starting investigation\nAbout things that may have happened a couple of days or or he was within the last few weeks\nI mean this is something that is you know people have been covering up here in the United states for over two years so I think as a a you know a symbol of democracy a symbol of\nGood government it's hopefully uh hopefully the uh the cards are starting to fall here and people will start phoning up to all the uh all the wrong doing that was done and that I think we're getting into that as you've been a\nA all over in terms of your reporting so\nSo I bring David and David as an attorney in a in a really good attorney you know Congress has a constitutional roads called oversight their job they check we have a system of separation of powers and checks and balances part of their oversight is when they are investigating the investigators\nThey been obstructed every step of the way\nRequest document requests we have found instance after instance where they cite national security is a reason for not turning something over only to be turned out to be having nothing to do with national security only an embarrassment to them now\nWe see in in just the last two weeks oh Rod Rosenstein who gives an extensive interview to the wall Street Journal here's enough time to testify under oath\nLens Simpson has pleading the fifth Nelly or doesn't want to appear and testify under oath James Baker is testifying today and James Baker and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe and one other person all saying Rod Rosenstein wanted to wear a wire\nTo go after the president of the United states\nOr if you are representing our friend Carter Page here I mean I Would think you'd have a multitude of lawsuits in the Carter page ought to be a pretty rich man by the end of all of us\nYeah quarter page has a strong basis for sticking not only information but also damages and relief and he is now by the way of course\nConducting some litigation going after that doesn't Carter Page is very important to St example of how very wrong things have gone with the ... the court and otherwise and governments you hit the probably the most important point going on here Congress's\nRole in providing oversight um you know God willing congressmen Munoz is going to return after this election his work and good let's work as the vital Congress can no longer bluff though anymore they've got to compel the testimony of these folks\nI think there's a real argument for a Fifth Amendment waiver from the public statements\nThat these folks make the American public demands transparency\nAnd they deserve nothing less than transparency and by the way these aren't simple in the states that have gone on you know we talk about this Ninety nine page report on fire\nThe court a abuses that uh and it said director Rogers was talking about um these aren't just mistakes these are conscious efforts and engender by law enforcement officers to invade the law they there is by the way one author or as in you that no one really has exploited yet\nAnd that's a fight the quarter review there is a court that just above the five to ... it will also under their rule for\nConsidered procedural motions there are three judges to chief justice of when you are right now the judges ... telling talent for different circuits maybe maybe that court should be the subject of the uh the plate in the form for a motion to review what's going on in the\nFight the court also just remembering you have in the ... the court efforts\nBy the ... where are these buys a court judges a fraud was committed on every one of them they were ... that run verified uncorroborated information\nTo spy on the guy you're also talking to on this on this line quarter page why haven't we heard from them yet\nYou're right they should do outreach Collyer though because I think judge and the court and these judges other quarter review it violates their own rules rules Thirteen and\nIt violates the Constitution's and as you pointed out anytime the most sensitive area of our government probably because if it's part they application for the most intrusive kind of eavesdropping that there is in the world\nNo you know there was an article by John Solomon I Want to just read a little bit of it to both of you and carnival start with you to get your reaction considering you as of now you appear to be the victim and all of this unless something changes ...

"WBUV", "content": "From Trump Trump didn't attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it\nWas all about do you think that maybe the president shouldn't have done it marking her like that because it gets Collins and Murkowski it'd be the way they vote or what do you think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was dating the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was stating facts that were given during Dr ... testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been picked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits an outrageous\nExactly right ya can't challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have to go ... to do it Trump did it\nIn yeah he's providing the little shade for some of these people hide under [noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish you hadn't done such outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately\nSomebody has to say it it's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old ever among glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again\nA right to have your back\nYet to be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into normal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them were coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know you had to draw on CNN while the other like a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number [noise]\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this hold me to\nGet a white ... ever hang on credit anyway at that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe\nShe thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant Catherine McKenna and this was back in the nineties\nShe was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class at all sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up\nAnd women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time after him that the cause of what she's been taught\nAnd heard on the news and talking to her she made all literally believe that men don't have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believe it\nWill rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr have you\nEver um [noise] um you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nThey claimed that all men are predators but then they run to run hook up and then they want to\nAbortions for free whether it's their idea then everything's fine\nIf not better right by the way here's this ... you're\nAlso random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it the me too movement supposedly include women women on across\nAmerica who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will\nIt's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media or making I think every major young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to be real careful about it

I'm sure they were it was easy to find people because they already had been interviewed\nBy the Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalpost are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to ... to believe that any of these people\nUm it it can take themselves seriously they said it's going to be here for days for just me a week and now they're going to hire an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial\nThere you know she said that every Democrat that that now they're going up but Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI they're actually gonna be it's horrible part is an organization\nYou know it it it it is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's\nLife long reputation here on the line\n[noise] take your mind that are doing two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever he'll you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think Brett Kavanaugh ever gets back in many many ways\nI mean Clarence Thomas will forever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some um it you know someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there's certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse is counted but they would have this kind of them because they disagree with them anyway [noise]\nUm and he is someone who does can ... incredible amount of perspective on the bench judge\nKavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as a lower court judge the Supreme Court\nSaid it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they walked to fourteen different times they found out they vindicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think um they are not going to\nBe watching this with the same knee jerk or part is in response as I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people a\nHat but but it\nUp you know the parents to do on a reputation now\nIf you read James ... New York times piece that he came out with the ... to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because well the FBI's pack in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was writing an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her\nUm but then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are and interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized I could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not um once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your habits very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them but there is what he says refusal to do so is its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because\nMy FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm\nSomebody who loves the FBI I don't love the upper brass under Khomeini and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is the FBI people I Know the soul to the people and I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was willing to them and you just it's dumb to ever talked to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say because it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said\nSomething in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that says if you look at his company's coming MO right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and this is just another another section in that play book but the irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime\nTo lie to the Senate as their with their investigators it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending they're ... that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nOf what the FBI guys to say that this is somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people the Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to\nThey're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same state 'cause the FBI can't as it is\nHow much they kept force them to talk to them especially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they they could be dealing with taking the same\nExact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because of the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new here that there there's my protection\nUnder democratic IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate her story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cabinet was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here if she's asking other if she's telling other people she doesn't know what do they investigated\nThe more shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer telling people she's not even sure it was him she said well how did he was in the room\n[laughter] I'm positive he adjusted his hands whatever that means that so but I but I Can't say for certain get hit it and so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York or because they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I I I mean ... or even count as a credible allegation but you know what go for the FBI could talk to her\nUm they'll they'll get their statement and I think if you look at the people if they're\nOnly going to be holding wins and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very handover the information\nThat's it the the three ... and and maybe we'll get those thrilled to have been winning for thrilled to forever as it relates to Bruce or and and Christopher Steele and and what was said in those conversations\nAre Terry submariners with those chief counsel policy director Judicial Crisis network thank you for being with us carry we appreciate your time we're in Washington DC it's

I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here was the agreement with our colleagues and Chris Coons was never part of this agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware a light Chris but he was never part of this agreement what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no\nHe's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about it as drinking habits so Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and Mr ... and the fall and incredibly incredible lead within a week I think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and faith has changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Geoff oh did you sing committee\nWith the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited and the scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii who wants to men by the way to sit down and shut up\nWhich was a pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator her own out now is saying she wants to nip FBI investigation into the quote I\nThrowing report yeah yeah that's where we're our so my dad owns a bar and so a throw in ice is like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is\nThat solve a bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to delay\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... that there are any\nA credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this\nI have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do a lot of your colleagues maybe you have some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe mansion and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but right close to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but\nIf you fall one vote short you came up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh legitimize\nThe way he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of these states and see if the people in those states agree with their senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kevin ... the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused on not given up on hand less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact most Democrats will know no matter who Donald Trump ...\nThey've already against score sick\nYeah All right so now what is going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question\nMartha ... is a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... Ford's claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning death the Atta checked the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short\nTrump won I Do not believe North Dakota once a highly had camp to vote no\nI don't agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate\nWe have to to the people of of the country and November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to these red state ... state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh [laughter] so you mean you're you're communicating Hannah I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers beyond that I\nDoubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well and then we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days\nThirty five we can I find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nOh it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for cabinet oh it's only an election year conversion and they're only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care is like you know I'm a Baptist I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh is highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point\nThis has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and as saying a lot it will change the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's not a complicated issue for me\nIf we follow vote short or less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong\nI Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves a ...

don't think people are Americans\nAre going to vote for the destroyers and I thought that was a pretty good way to capture what we're living through\nI've often said and then we've been friends going back since Nineteen Ninety maybe even a little before that and I've often said you can predict this what certainty every two and four years that identity politics\nYou know as rich versus poor old versus young\nBlack versus white whatever ... nature of politics they can bring up comes up every election year but they have now son to a new low you know I knew this was not going to be a difficult job for the FBI and the case a professor before there was no place there was no time there was no location there's no place for the FBI to visit\nIt took to look for anything for ... that might exist\nAnd the only for people that they could really talked to the poor people professor Ford mentioned\nThat she remembered being at this this so called party when the alleged event happened and she identified one person that was supposed to be a I Witness to the assault and the eye witness that that did not happen\nAnd the other people do not remember any such party is this and then the question is do we believe in the presumption of innocence or we just got a jump the gun and say guilt by association Cory Booker said something spectacular yesterday and he goes well there's enough allegations out there I mean you just you got to kind of believe it and they're not qualified based on allegations\nWell look I must be clear Cory Booker sadly somebody who I used to think that a real future as a reformer or it's just sort of the Cade I mean I don't know whether it's because he wants to run for president\nOr what but he's just kind of decay into almost making a mockery of himself me he talks about is Spartacus moment which is a sign of such stunning historical ignorance that has a history teacher I founded painful um he he makes comments like that\nI mean here people should know that if allegations destroy you a pin the whole process\nOf the rule of law collapses over totally and it's sad to watch something like that you know I think could have been a positive constructive force and who's now frankly are becoming almost a caricature of himself\nIs certainly a lot at stake and then the next\nThirty three days and you know there's other good economic those that have come out today I mean on top of record low unemployment and fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nA youth unemployment fifty some odd year low a we have consumer confidence all time high for a million new jobs created for a million fewer people on on food stamps\nOr you see what the president's accomplish with NAFTA the new NAFTA the\nThe new trade agreement with Mexico and and with Canada you see that he is eliminated burdensome regulation we can now drilling and war and the forty eight states uh he is literally singlehandedly save coal mining in America and of course natural gas production will now be at an all time high\nAnd we have a Wall Street journal piece today showing more Americans getting pay raises than ever before\nAnd that's the forgotten men and women that mattered in twenty sixteen the question is will they all go out and vote to protect the progress that has been made in the last two years even maybe if they don't particularly like their individual Republican congressmen or maybe think they're weak or maybe don't even know their name is\nWell he has put your finger on the key question of this election I have as you know I've been involved in many many campaigns are actually going all the way back to Nineteen sixty and\n[noise] one of the ... one of the lessons I learned was I I don't care about the polls show me the three sinks I Want to see the first real votes\nI Want to see who cares enough to show up and vote\nThat changes everything is you know we just won a a sixty three percent Hispanic district in a special election for the state Senate in Texas right down along the border and this we had a candidate who got lost by twenty points four years ago came back in the special in one um\nAnd is the first Hispanic Republican state senator uh in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience who this is going to come down to isn't holding\nIt isn't conversation at the coffee shop who cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up and vote and if our side does show up in both I think this could be\nOne of the most historic elections that you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections I have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would throw us\nBehind the scenes I got to give you a lot of credit because I remember speaking with you you probably forget it the day before\nYou became speaker of the houses in Nineteen Ninety four and I remember talking to you that day and the day of the election and and you are surrounded by a group of people in Joe Gaylord and you actually shared with me the information you had and you said it was absolutely true that for the first time in forty years Republicans would take over the house\nI think you and I were two of the few people willing to go out on a limb and said yeah Donald Trump as a real shot of winning this election and\nAnd people laughed at us at the time and I I Believe that then and and we proved out to be right we also the ... both of us predicted Obama would be an abysmal failure as president based on a very rigid ideology that he seemed to be indoctrinated into\nAnd I I agree with you I think there is an opportunity here to shock the world again\nAnd it the for the people listening to this audience they're going to tune in thirty three nights from now watch election results come in and they are either going to see ... happy liberal newscasters announcing Nancy Pelosi as speaker and\nChuck Schumer is the Senate majority leader and Maxine Waters will be the chairman of this committee or that committee and that the impeachment of Trump will go forward taxes will go up open borders will remain\nAn Obamacare stays all this or are they going to shock the world and all these people are going to do what they did in twenty sixteen and being the shock of their life\nWell that's right and I look I mean I think what would I Would say to everybody who's listening to us everybody cares what's countries richer make sure you vote makes sure your friends vote make sure everybody you know who favors\nA solid productive work oriented results oriented system make sure they go out and vote if that happens my I'm I'm not quite ready yet to predict what am I going to tell you that\nBecause of the intensity of anger about the way the liberals smear Kavanaugh the characterization the dishonesty I Believe we have seen and I've been looking at data for three days I Believe that we've seen a substantial shift\nTowards Republicans now I think that the ... were almost certainly now going to keep the Senate and probably going to increase our ah or the total number of senators by significant margins\nHeidi Heitkamp of North Dakota who's down eleven is no on Kavanaugh to me what a fork in that race it's over\nAgain I think Kramer and it was a great great guy and I've known for twenty four years and he's got to get out there and keep campaigning I mean one one of the lessons you know I I had very close races including a couple of recounts and I had very big raise my experiences\nAnd I say this every candidate do not quit 'til the polls closed and do not relax until the recount has over a this is a business where big things can happen\n... victims were

... why I saw him giving rent solo cups quite a few girls during that time frame I saw him around the punch I won't say malls or the punch containers [laughter]\nI don't know why he did but I saw him by them or their friends who remember these parties to remember how I think everybody in the county remembers parties and we have we haven't heard from those friends so I'm asking you know are there

... so they could gang rape them\nWell I'm Me gave out red solo cups and I saw him at a party you don't know if he did anything to the punch this is so reckless irresponsible NBC how they would ever dare run this is beyond any comprehension I have now if they had come from a nation\nIf they had witnesses\nIf there wasn't a changing shifting\nStory if there wasn't traumatic backtracking they might then have some legitimate reason to air this but because\nThey want what the Democrats want which is the smearing of judge Kavanaugh to continue well they had to air it but even they airing of it made them look really really pathetic\nIt's not fair there are at the un and I'll tell you the other thing there are victims people I Know in my life\nOf sexual abuse I Know there's evil in the world I wrote a whole book about evil people that would ever drug rape or girl are evil\nThese people are\nPredators they need to get off our streets but you gotta have some cooperation to these things\nAnd it just comes out of Seventeen Days ago just on the eve of the confirmation vote for judge Kavanaugh and if you go issue by issue case by case you know it it comes down to do we believe in the
