things like you know talk to yourself at night before you sleep and tell yourself you're going to remember your dream from but I think some people would say there are ways to prepare yourself but done done system is pretty simple just keep a journal under your pillow or on your night stand and right when you wake up\nWhenever it is right down on as many details you can about the dream and he feels that by doing that um as a daily practice\nYou'll get better and better actually at remembering Adrienne Adrienne sort of evaporate pretty quickly after we wake up right we remember them right away

that can be accompanied by\nSeeing things and and hearing things and so on so [noise]\nYou know uh get the question is you know is is merely a a physiological biological um\nIssue or a problem um or is it somehow opening the spiritual world I guess my answer is I don't know I think that if you if you do look on line or consult the doctor they will they will tell you what I said which is yeah these kinds of things happen and sometimes when people are awake there in a kind of an in between state of consciousness\nI'm you know and that they'll talk in terms of psychology and neurology but um it it could also be um an opening to\nOther realities of spiritual reality or\nMaybe I don't know you know in some cultures um in some cultures you know people have visions um [noise]\nUh that that

S. P. S. all the mail that they handle so we're talking with tens of millions of packages\nGoing through these facilities everyday that's just the volume that you know you can't think about you know how long it takes to put a human being through a scanner or at the airport I mean if he talking about tens of millions of packages [noise] um you know that this is a an order of magnitude that\nWe simply can't handle when ah you know every single package going through a screener but what they can do and they are doing is training disorders and handlers to identify certain characteristics\nThat a package that might flag packages potentially suspicious\nThat thinking about is is that they're just a dropping this and some public mailbox so they don't have to walk into a a post office in and get whatever there is there's shipping weighed right 'cause they wind up on some sort of security camera is that what's happening\nRight essentially that's what's happening and I think that sort of the\nThe the way that the terrorists often to tend to do things according to the experts and so you know for the handlers at the shipping companies what they need to look for are the you know basically a package that has so many stamps that you know no one would ever do this you know without\nA some sort of specific reason I'm obviously you know I'm sort of suspicious address labels or you know handwriting that sort of thing\nUm but you know the good news is any package that put on a plane is screened but the problem is a package that put on the truck is typically not screened that's awesome and ... times to the last line of defense is the handlers at the actual facilities themselves and luckily and all the cases so far they've been able to catch these packages\nFor speaking with USA Today business reporter Nathan booming you get a piece titled why suspected explosive devices are tough for us PS FedEx and UPS to detect um do we anticipate that ah this screening for truck delivery was going to get any better or is that seem like an impossibility at this point\nWell I Do think that that technology is improving and they are capable of doing spot checks random checks so to speak [noise]\nUm and that's a good thing uh you know I I imagine that security protocols are likely tightening up in these facilities as we speak but UPS and FedEx wouldn't reveal their plans right now they consider to be a security matter and so they don't really talk about it but I think\nUm I got to imagine that they're taking a look at their political here now my understanding is that all the packages that have been fighting so far were sent to the the mail to the post postal service and so\nUm you know the postal service has investigators who they've deployed to try to ascertain exactly how these packages go through 'em but the problem is ultimately you know tracking these can be very difficult and especially if they ever went to a screener to begin with um then you know there's just the volume is just so significant\nThat it's tough to to stop it and that's why all to mainly um you know the less than the last line of defense or those you know the people in the mail

packages\nGiven the uh I guess technology developments that have occurred since then what about comparisons to a Ted Kaczynski the Unabomber\nYeah I mean I Know that you know a Ted Kaczynski took

Google are rigged to favor the political left and now he's building a twenty twenty campaign infrastructure that can circumvent them Alex Thompson national political reporter at political got the scoop Alex what's up here\nI think the twenty sixteen campaign that's been praised for some of their innovative look at how they use Facebook in particular\nAnd I was surprised to find after talking with people involved the reelect that actually they are planning on using Facebook in the same way and that's a lot of people felt that reliance on Facebook and twice exchange with a little bit of a weak ass on that part\nThat they thought as something they had to do because they were being outspent by Hillary Clinton and because you know there was one of the ... the campaign was put together but now they declared for reelection they ought to be the paperwork\nOn inauguration day and twenty Seventeen they now have several years of the time and they use that in order to um you know or to figure out a way to not ... have put nearly as much the next time around\nAnd you know among the post Facebook strategy and that is going to be a lot of mobile first and it's going to be a lot of direct and Schumer\nWhich means a lot of ... a lot of emails and a lot of other channels that we still probably don't even know about yet Mm\nSo mobile versus not exactly a breakthrough technologies these days what are they going to do something different\n[noise] um well the main thing that they're doing which is a little bit different it is corn that they're using Chang but the way that you're you're going to be able to do it is new but the growth of peer to peer tech messaging which basically allows\nHuge attack message people with out them ever having to opt ten and you've seen this off election cycle that surge worked at the at least a hundred million Texans just being sent and just this year's election I imagine it's going to be several several times that\nI'm for the ... election and one of the ah one of the main people involved in the ... election they actually had the cofounder of the biggest kick protecting company on the bite\nAnd how uh have they indicated how they might use Facebook differently this time because he said they're still spending money there right\nYeah actually there were among the biggest spenders even though they are up for reelection for two more years there among the biggest political centers in the country right now while but um we had a we had a group of a data scientist at NYU\nBut have been studying this issue they went through and analyze the

contact people off wind so\nIn a way to orbit the spending all this money now so they can contact them off the popcorn later you know people still are as as long as people still use Facebook\nThey are probably going to stop spending money on it\nBut there's also a deep distrust of the plot for among conservatives some people said the ... the you know the concerns raised a little bit of a equal crying wolf they don't really believe it but I can tell you from people that I talk to him but the Trump reelect there is a really deep suspicion that\nFacebook will not be nearly as powerful tool for them in twenty twenty because of it are largely left leaning workforce\nYeah we're speaking with Alex Thompson national political reporter at Politico piece was called this is how Donald Trump stays president for four more years or revisit something you said earlier about the lead time and announcing for reelection on inauguration day what what has that done for them\nOr in the past presidents don't usually declare for one or declare for reelection right away because it was seen as\nA as a little ... shameful that you would look like your program political interests add up the country but

answer\nUSA today's Supreme Court correspondent Richard Wolffe says cases challenging the timing ... funding and providers of abortion or headed toward the high court at a time when chief justice John Roberts and his colleagues are seeking a lower profile rich explain\nBasically what happened to the portion is a mostly Republican and conservative state legislatures passed restrictions in any number of different ways it can be restrictions on the timing or the method or the funding that cetera\nThen mostly lower court some state courts more often federal courts\nUm strike down those restrictions not always sometimes they I'm I'm allowed them but in more cases than not they strike them down\nBased on what they understand to be Supreme Court precedent to those cases you know move along through the pipeline and they take you know years and what the Supreme Court does frequently and what they're likely to do as much as they possibly can and these cases has swat them down and say we're not going to take them or whatever that lower court case decision was\nAt the federal circuit court federal appeals court we are going to let that stand [noise] so that's going to apply with one would think in a lot of cases including several that are now pending before the Supreme Court\nAre still the court has the ability to just say no to taking these cases but at any point can say now it seems like a good time\nAnd it's like well yeah another which the court gets um what's the number the court gets like eight thousand ten thousand uh petitions a year to hear cases and it takes about one percent of those and the cases it takes a rider important national issues that it feels it has to weigh in on or very frequently it that they are cases where\nCircuit courts those are the federal appeals court for the love of right below the Supreme Court [noise]\nAnd they they're sort of regional there are regional circuit porch and those are often split I'm two or three circuit courts May of ...\nIn one way on an issue and one or two or three circuit courts have ruled another way I'm the same issue and and the Supreme Court says well we're going to have to resolve this show a lot of these cases come into court on abortion now not reflect those kinds of circuit split the court can easily say\nI'm for instance here's an example of court and there's a couple of cases that are pending now these are cases that are not directly on the subject of abortion but they are directly on the subject of states that are trying to restrict funding to Planned Parenthood and the court could simply say\nUh the the way those courts have ruled stands report just wants to avoid controversial topics for now they've just been through this ... confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh it was very tough on all sides and the chief justice John Roberts who would normally side with Kevin on the conservatives on the court\nAnd might be anxious to eager to take some of these cases in another year simply doesn't want to do anything it might be seen as partisan\nWe're speaking with USA Today's Supreme Court correspondent ritual so to that point just clarify the Supreme Court can\nSay we need more time to warm up or we want things to cool down and we'll take an abortion case when we for lack of a better phrase damn well pleased\nYeah they they wouldn't they wouldn't signal what they're going to do in the future they would simply you know a case goes through federal district court comes out one way or another dog goes to the federal appeals court comes out one way or another\nLet's say because it's often the case that anti abortion plaintiffs those bringing the case\nOr want to go to the Supreme Court and say hey you know we want to ... uh but uh twenty week limit on abortions or we want to outlaw\nA certain type of abortion and the second trimester or we want to outlaw abortions that are undertaken cuts of particular reasons like the ... or the disability if the fetus\nThe court the Supreme Court only gets involved and says All right we're going to hear that case not because it's interesting because it basically has two because lower courts are ... of course ledge because legislatures in court you don't know what to do because there's a conflict between appeals courts and\nThat doesn't happen very often I mean the last major abortion case that the court took\nA on the subject of the actual medical abortion as opposed to things having to do with like you know harassing\nPeople outside clinics or something like that was back in two thousand and chef and it had to do with partial birth abortion and then in two thousand and six team just a couple of years ago it had to do with the Texas law that was restricting clinics restricting providers\nThanks rich USA today's

to do this and\nThere's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're gonna traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural\nFlow were to find the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice and I was not nice do Mother Nature\nOf on yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the commercial was margarine night it was very mired in for a merger and right now and we all know margarine is not so great for us but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits and suppressing dominant trait were flying in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price\nAnd he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against\nYou know a ... billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution right where we do that if we take it on or who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah I you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and\nI'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly your elephant you know and but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name as a Anthony ... is a former Google engineer a log in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the sun but [noise]\nHe recently applied to the area and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing is he's he's basically saying this look\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on it\nIt it is inevitable that one day a artificial intelligence robots\nHoward by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because God I did that this technology we're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy\nThis guy but you know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around\nGo yeah yeah I play in every once in a while you write an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off her her you\nKnow the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall E N I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we both are we once spoke about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... button it up I think they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's for the day and all and ... when they will have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so yeah and\nI think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is let's use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's to say that that that average you know I using it a drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine\nNo I like that the ... the ... yeah I'm right because you know what the old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that that you know it may very well be that we are in the process of creating our own\nConquers yes raising with that the right now I fully believe that completely and I do and let's pick this up coming up

good things for ourselves visionary coach Laurie Dixon is here to discuss turning big lotto dreams into everyday wins Laurie what are you recommend\nThat is thinking that that's real and starting to believe and possibility and so what it does it allows us to start can dream and drain in a big way we know the the jak pots are so high right now that it allows us to stretch\nReally far so that's part of the process\nAnd with everything going on right now in the news and the economics and the political fun we start to look at\nOur lives sometimes and how it affects us negatively and there's a lot of fear going on around communities and even national way and so people me things that give them hope\nAnd when we dream and when we wonder and we think it I go by that ticket given that it opens up the door to allow us to accept abundance in a great way\nMm So to that point then how do you say okay I didn't win it's however I see a new door to walk through like what do you have an a ha moment for example\nShorter and so you think about getting out and not letting that go and so it's not a self defeating moment when you look at that ticket and the numbers aren't ears and you have to go back

thing as too much dreaming or dreaming too big or to water I don't know I\nSure I mean if we dream did that then we don't follow it up with any then I mean that creates us to go into things like

considered the favorite to win back control of the house many of the races now tightening or in districts where President Trump won modestly in twenty six teams still Republicans say they are becoming more confident that they could have a shot\nAt a pair of Nevada raises it's a story by Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson Christina explain this\nTo what I was looking at in particular were races that were kind of ignored at the beginning of the cycle and people didn't think would become competitive but in the last sort of final stretch here has become closer than than people expect that they would\nAnd we've seen that in particular in a handful of districts where the president won\nBut not by a huge in that [laughter]\nSo maybe at forty nine percent victory fifty fifty three percent for districts you know that he comfortably carried but where there is more room for a Democrat to pick up votes if people have come to satisfied with the president\nStarts a one of them was like in a in Washington state explain that one\nYet so it's very interesting because a political analysts have had their eyes on two races in Washington state all year and they're the third race that is sort of sneaking up on a lot of people and becoming very competitive and that's the district currently held by congresswoman Jamie Herrera butler [noise]\nUm she has been in office she was elected in two thousand ten and that sort of cruise to victory in recent years but this year has a significant challenge or has been out raising her and um came in pretty close to her in the primary in fact the top two Democrats and garnered more votes than congressman\nButler in Washington state is one of those states where they have a top two primary so [noise]\nUm [noise] the incumbent advanced as to the highest performing Democrat who is a woman named ... she's a political science professor\nSo it's an unusual waste there in that um this hasn't been considered you know one of the sweetest districts but Carolyn lungs campaign just released a poll that had her up by two points um so it looks like you know it's getting to be a pretty tight race well\nAll right how about the Long Island New York with the the incumbent Republican Congressman Peter king\nYet probably a little bit more of a long shot but he has a younger democratic female opponent and this is the year when those candidates are attracting a lot of energy and enthusiasm for voters especially female voters um our pool and other polls have shown a gender gap\nAnd and it reveals that women\nAre show more of a preference for\nA democratic controlled house and are often more energized vote this year so you know it's a truly them of terms that it comes down to turn out but\nIf that is indeed the case it looks like women are more poised to turn out and that could help some of these female challengers and in Long Island Trump wine and but I think he had around fifty three percent of the votes and not a huge blowout for hitting their\nGod it speak with Christine Peterson Wall Street journal congressional reporter or pieces called house race has tightened as mid term elections near to down south in the suburbs of Atlanta with a congressman rub what'll\nYes said this is an interesting race I'm kind of going with all its definitely being outraged by Carolyn ... do who is also a professor she's at Georgia State university and I'm In the suburbs of Atlanta so this could have been one of them are like classics suburban battlegrounds that we're seeing\nA but it just wasn't really on people's radar for a while one of the factors that could be at play here is that Stacey Abrams at the top of the ticket is trying to become the first black woman elected governor in Georgia and Democrats hope that that could give a boost for their down on the ticket and that\nUm but go could benefit from that\nAnd so and as as part of that you looked at the two seats in Nevada as well\nSo this is where Republicans are a little bit more optimistic um there are two open seats that have been held by Democrat that are currently held by Democrats and ah so does you know they can see the Republican feel they have a better shot rather than an seating a democratic incumbent\nI'm One of them is actually a rematch that we've seen before between Democrat Steven Horsford and Republican crescent hardy [noise]\nUh and then the second to the to Republicans are optimistic about is currently held by congresswoman Jackie rose and has a Democrat but she is running for Senate in Nevada [laughter] um this is a little bit [laughter]\nProbably a little bit more of a long shot for Republicans because of their candidate Danny Tarkanian has run many times before and not shown that he can win a congressional

their twenties and thirties running for office this year one fifth\nOf the female Democratic House candidates are under forty a sort of them are women of color hundreds more are running for state legislature Wall Street journal national political reporter Janet Hook says the diverse crop of young candidates marks a departure from an older generation of women with ambition\nWho tend to to postpone political careers until their families were established Janet what's up here\nYou know there's been a lot of attention paid during this election cycle to the record number of women overall they're running for office but within that um there's this really interesting trend of there being more\nYounger women running I'm sort of under forty women in their twenties and thirties um and it's interesting to me because there's been a kind of a career pattern for women in politics I'm In the past\nIt's much like like the clear pattern in in in other line of work where women would tend to wait until their children are grown before they take the plunge into politics and the classic case of this with Nancy Pelosi had five kids\nDidn't run for office until the I'm the youngest one was sixteen\nI'm and she was forty seven by then by the time she started her political career\nUm and I think what we've seen in twenty Eighteen wave of women running signs that women are also are a little bit less willing to wait that there's a sense of urgency ugly among democratic women who are running there's a sense of urgency\nAbout running you know we need to be part of the movement to also part of a broader idea that women can start their careers and their families at the same time\nYeah so what ... what happens if a um I don't know ... what we might consider a significant number of them when I look at what kind of message I guess get sent\n[noise] well I mean it's been broadly among Democrats a real clamoring for ... a generational change I mean there have been a lot of complaints that the leadership in Congress being all baby boomers and older\nUh so I think that it would kind of contribute to a sense of\nOf a movement powered um they also I think women in general and young women in particular bring\nMore focus and attention to a women's issues you know the treatment of women family issues um and you know I talked to a political scientist who is actually kind of studied the style of leadership that women have brought\nTo Congress and they she concluded that with more women in Congress\nAnd more with younger women\nThat there might actually be more collaborative approach to decision making\nYou know I thought was interesting too is the one line in your story about how some of these young women are already making a difference to federal election commission ruled the campaign funds can be used to pay childcare expenses\nRight my story actually features a woman who's running for the house in New York on Long Island\nHer name is Lou been Gretchen Shirley and she's thirty seven years old and she was thinking about running for the house and kind of reluctant at first because she had a one year old and a three year old she went ahead and\nUm started running and was kind of relying on her mom for for childcare help and just when the pace of the campaign got too much she really felt like she needed to hire outside help didn't have a lotta money she petitioned the FCC to see if she could use campaign tons to pay for childcare\nAnd lo and behold they issued this ruling that said you could and it was kind of a landmark\nThat says I'm basically kind of recognizing the reality of when parents run for office that if they have children I'm part of the campaign has to be finding a way to take care of the kids\nSpeak with Janet Hook national political reporter at the wall Street Journal she's got a piece entitled young women aren't waiting to seek political power I used it to their mobilizing not just as candidates but also as voters I guess that probably goes hand in hand but explain some of the numbers [noise]\nWell um the there's a democratic um data analytics firm called target smart that analyzes voter rolls and it looked at um twenty five states that had held primaries to look at the turnout\nOf voters in and they broke it down by different categories and one of the categories that they looked at was the difference between a younger voters voters and older voters by you know kind of looking at turnout by age group\nAnd what they found was has always been the case younger voters um their turnout rate is lower than older voters as we know you know old older voters really turn out in large numbers\nThings done at the wall Street Journal national political reporter Janet Hook\nWas more of the program

researching this made them what's going on\nYeah this is really interesting story I I was surprised to see that are susceptible Arabic that this is a sign that is\nExisted for many years but it's really a spike in recent years with the late model Honda vehicles typically the accord and civic although some of their hot as as well our I'm being targeted by the two are\nRealizing that beat everybody can be worth more than a thousand dollars in some cases they break into the vehicle the they basically ... out of the steering wheel and then they sell it on the black market\nAnd it's in connection with what just anybody who happens to be in an accident and blows ear beggars is tied to the to Cato recall\nWhat happens when you need to get your bag replaced you have a couple of different options course most people are going to go to the dealership going to go to the repair shop get to replace their um some people ever gonna get it done this either going to have a friend or they'll go to maybe more disreputable type of repair shop and that's where\nA lot of these types airbags end up being sold if you actually go on ... for example in the search for this you will see their airbags being sold on line so it's definitely happening um and it's it's a big concern you know if you go to a reputable dealerships something you're not going to end up actually buying a user airbag or something but there is a market for these things\nShe saw it and the reason that it's Honda's because they're popular vehicles and just happen to be more of them perhaps on in ...\nI definitely think that's a factor I mean there's no doubt that Honda's long way to target\nBut that's what that's in part because of the fact they're popular but it doesn't make much sense to me is what only odd because in talking to the police and various markets um\nYou know almost every incentive looked at it was exclusively on the show you know it does you know it doesn't make much sense why would only be honest I'm not sure if it has to do with the actual specific Arabic actors or something being exactly what it is I'm\nProbably the the only ones you know at this point I'm as we know they if there's money to be made though don't make it\nYeah so at the the ... ah what uses a nice ... kinda strips away the covering of the center part of the steering wheel and just pulled it out I was at work\nExactly they somehow gain access to the ethical and then they basically a user knife and then they rip it out and it only takes a few minutes [laughter] I I went to some incidents where\nEither they hit dozens of vehicles in the same parking lot on the same night so you know it's it's definitely um\nThere's not a difficult thing to think about it this is like you know\nDoing a laptop out for the seat in the car I mean if the left towards a thousand dollars [laughter] that's about ... worth so there's a big incentive for the season you know with all the recalls that have happened on airbags in recent years including the one that you mentioned Arabic prices have gone up so me and said that there's also gone up well\nWe're seeing with Nathan booming business reporter at USA Today he's written a piece in Seattle police the flurry of Honda airbags deaths as criminals aimed to resell on black market how do you protect yourself or is there is there a best practice here\nA few different to ... you probably consider here number one is please say you know it could be a cool you're a street light or near\nA parking lot late that can help because these aren't going to choose a vehicle that threaten or the late that could make them easy to spot and secondly I hadn't thought of this you can try not to park near a big vehicles that are maybe a structure\nOf the the view so that when the the kind of hide behind that big SUV or big truck that the one thing to consider and unless the in some kind of old fashioned but you can always join the club if you think

divisions again you know because the way the mid term is shaping up and and by the way you know they're still three weeks ago and that's an eternity and I'm an American politics today so [laughter]\nPredictions are very dangerous but if you were to take a snapshot today you say it looks as if the picture's improving somewhat for Republicans\nBut Democrats probably still have the or in a good position to take back control of the house because a lot of those house races are playing out the swing races are playing out in suburban\nDistricts where there are Democrats are stronger and where's the college educated suburban women I become a very strong democratic constituency so they seem to be the good position to take back control the house but at the same time\nRepublicans look as if they're in better shape to keep control the Senate\nOr in some measure because the Republican base was very unhappy with the way Brett Kavanaugh was treated as a Supreme Court nominee and that has kind of energize the Republican base and reminded them that they like having Republicans pick and confirmed judges and show\nA balance in the Senate will be determined in a bunch of red states where there's a lot of pro Trump support and so\nYou're going to have a you could very well end up with a picture of a divided Congress and Democrats thinking that they uh have one they are a national vote in a ash it's the same way they did when Emory Clinton won the popular vote [laughter]\nYou're twenty sixteen but don't have a very big hold on political power if we have one half of Congress and so\nThat's a that's a recipe that is probably going to produce um job equally divided government\nIt was a hard time getting things done and it's a continuing democratic anger at their opposition within the political system\nArts so there's no for example uh [noise] I'm no lessening of the divide because the Democrats let's say when the house and Republicans maintain control the Senate because there's more balance I mean\nWell ... ... you know that's possible and in a couple of issues interestingly trade maybe one they're actually may be some common ground you know there are a lot of Democrats who are\nCloser to President Trump on trade and his use of tariffs and um basically challenging allies on trade issues of some Republicans are Republicans have tended to be more free traders so you may actually have a slightly bigger\nBalance of support for the president on trade in a in a divided Congress but on most issues and particularly on health care it's going to be very hard to get something done 'em and I think you're going to have\nA an if he if Democrats do in fact take back control of the house there's going to be inevitably pressure from the Democratic base to begin investigations of various um activities in Trump world including potentially\nA re revisiting the confirmation of justice Kavanaugh but also having a look at some financial dealings of the president and the aftermath of a mall or in investigation and so you definitely going to have a more confrontational atmosphere in Congress or if there's democratic control of one house\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal executive Washington editor jury side\nHe's written a piece about how the election is unlikely to end the political divide that we're seeing you're up to that a ... and I wanted to ask the forty incumbent House Republicans\nWho are vacating their seats with this feeling about a democratic wave be different if the ... the majority of those forty we're sticking around\nI think it would be I mean I think it's a big deal a you know some of that it's actually more than forty depending on how you count so it's a big number and you know some of those Republican incumbents were going to be in trouble in this environment anyway so they you know got out while the getting was good\nSome of them probably could have better defended their seats than a newcomer can answer that opens the door all the wider for Democrats is actually I think one of the unappreciated factors in in this campaign is the amount of open space Republican\nRetirements left for Democrats to move in and one of the interesting things that happened in one of the reasons Democrats feel good about house races is that the Democratic challengers in swing districts where there's an open seat Republican is left\nBut by and large well funded this time they've managed to raise a lot of money um there's a very active democratic financial support network now a lot of small donors a lot of it's on line\nAnd so you have not only democratic challengers who are facing an open seat that they have a chance to win in a swing district as well financed democratic challengers a China will open seats by and large and and that again is a different situation than you would see in a more normal a midterm election year", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city": "Moss Point",

Idaho Nebraska in Utah\n[noise] ... the main thing that the Affordable CARE Act allowed expansion of Medicaid up to for people who earn enough to hundred and thirty eight percent of\nPoverty I'm the one difference there is the ah the funding element in Utah that goes along with that um this is an issue one week and it's still I'm practically and as an issue and said that there's a lot of\nPressure from hospitals particularly real hospitals and other medical medical providers in the states that have not expanded Medicaid saying look there's all the federal money available that would help us\nAnd we're not tapping into it even though ... dollars from our state are going to find these things and you know across the country [laughter] one argument for why that had happened by mail initiative is there\nNeither conservative states where it's not politically feasible for the public official Republican public officials to look like they're supporting the political CARE Act but if they are voters say we want this and there's a way that they they can do it without having to take direct responsibility for it\nWe're speaking with Maureen grabbing Washington correspondent at USA Today she's written a piece entitled midterms healthcare is a key national issue but the real action may happen at the state level\nOr could this be a trend where state legislatures are addressing this\nPotentially Seventeen states that have not expanded Medicaid and I'm a Republican\nWho worked on health care issues for a number of years on on the hill and he said a form with health care reporters that he thinks these initiatives he's found that shit is in these states passed that it it could start a trend for the rest of the state that many of the other states that have not expanded Medicaid but the other thing that's going on\nIs some states that had an expanded Medicaid but conservative states have been asking Trump Administration for permission to do so but they do so in a different way in a way that\nAdvocates for the Fort will care I don't like such as imposing work requirements and that's another issue that tip play some states might be willing to extend medicate if they can do so in their own way but some of the things the way they want to do that\nThat are being challenged in court and we're seeing that truck sample in um Kentucky okay\nYeah you've written to that point you mentioned a couple of states where governors races or to have an effect on this right\nRight that's a little bit of a it's not quite as an immediate impact is about an issue because the governor's aren't the only ones in their states that have the say in it there's in state legislatures do too but it's come up as an issue in several governors' races Florida Kansas Tennessee in Georgia where the Democrat candidate for governor saying this is something that we should do\n[noise] boy that due to a lot like tying it to I guess that the federal government money would there be a guarantee that there would be there at\nThe way the law is written by one of the arguments that are opponents of expanding Medicaid 'em when they get the argument that they're making is that you can't guarantee can't guaranteed the states that funding will be there forever\nOn Saturday in their their argument is that states get depended on his federal money and then if the federal government can't live up to bargain of funding Ninety percent or more out of the expansion ten states you're going to be on their own\n...

county were Mexico beach is located\nWhile the city of about twelve hundred people is unrecognizable now because of the destruction locals are assessing damage in considering the options for rebuilding homes and businesses what they don't want\nPie rises and the spring break party atmosphere of places like Panama City beach Wall Street journal reporter John camp paid a visit John what'd you witness\nBut I was down in Mexico Beach Florida which was pretty much ground zero for hurricane Michael and that hurricane came ashore or we can go as one of the most powerful hurricanes ever to hit the U.S\nAnd the kind of our this storm was packing or you could really see the results of bad at Mexico beach um it's it's almost hard to imagine what it once was\nIf you had never seen it before the storm because it's just wreckage everywhere uh you know there's really no building that was it affected in some way\nAnd plenty of buildings that were just completely destroyed there are a you know small cottages and houses that were just wiped clean and there's nothing left but a slab and maybe the tile floor and then the rest of the house is just the pieces all over the place\nBoy I think you said in your story too is the older homes right ones that are decades old fifty years plus maybe that took the worst of the beating\nThat's what the locals were telling us is that you know the city had a bunch of smaller cottages\nOh there were quite lovely but we're older and probably created some of the modern codes and they did not handle the weather well and um\nYou know it was I was a ... we're talking about a storm that came to show a hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds and also a devastating search a water pushed in quite far and the combination of water and when and bring these houses was just too much of\nOne of her some folks saying that they are determined to rebuild or some saying I Can't take this anymore I'm going inland where this is not as much of a threat what are you hearing\nWell first of all um there's a few people there\nBecause the uh um it it's really almost habitable right now there's no electricity power lines draped over the place for water doesn't work there aren't really sure whether they're going to get basic services back and there are security checkpoints the wedding people in that have very limited so don't care\nBut certainly there are some people in town\nBut allowed in to go to their homes and businesses and what I heard from them as they really do want her to be\nVery eager to talk about what Mexico beach was like before the storm hit\nAnd the fact that they are really really interested in getting it back to that and what they describe is really a kind of small town feel um you know a quaint clay a place that um you know through a zoning rules tried to keep away the high rise those successfully kept away high rises\nAnd we really didn't have the kind of a you know spring break beach party atmosphere but uh you know some other cities and towns are now I'm sure you know and they're very eager to try and reclaim that Ken\nSpeaking with Wall Street journal reporter John camp [noise] he's written a piece titled after hurricane Michael residence determined to rebuild shattered city he paid a visit to Mexico beach which took the brunt of hurricane Michael that came ashore on October ten anybody saying boldly I guess that it's not worth rebuilding a small town like this\nI did not hear that from the local um ... we spoke with a credit to former I'm Sheena administrator and you know he did he do bench met 'em as he sat on the back row level that makes sense\nUm but uh when you get down to the community level it's very hard to say let's just abandon a place because it's been destroyed and just\nYou know I think time will tell in terms of whether it will take to actually get this place up and running and utilities restored showing that you can actually make the place where the ball game will go a long way okay and you know it\nWas bad was it was there are people there right now\nIn terms of first responders and do you know government officials are picking up debris starting to clean up individuals are they're carrying things out of harms of business but they're trying but they want to salvage by the arm load people put the stuff into trash tells me that\nThe cleanup workers under way it's just going to take a really long time\nYou get the sense that any a large developers are circling like vultures thinking that this would be the time to build that high rise that Mexico beach has tried to avoid because they can create a building that can stand a hundred and Seventy five mile an hour winds for example\nThat's a great question and I don't know if any developers are actually circling yet I suspect it would be hard for them to make it through the security checkpoint\nAt this point I think John's Wall Street journal reporter John camp paid a visit to Mexico beach

are cutting back each month is there need to save more money but for what purpose analysis from Greg McBride chief financial analyst at bank ... ... what are some findings\nAbout two thirds of Americans are limiting their spending job for buried reasons but the fact that two thirds are holding back in what is otherwise a pretty good economy is notable this is the highest it's been in four years um you know in the middle of the range that we've seen over the years\nUm but we did to reverse the trend we at the where\nThe economy got better and better each successive here we saw that people are a little bit looser with the purse strings and that changed the share it jumped from sixty percent now to sixty six percent that say that they are actively limiting how much they spend every month reversing that downward trend that we'd seen uh several years prior to that\nYou represented in the ... remarks there but this was a solid economy right to wages are creeping up the tax cut pour more money in Americans paychecks with why this trend now\nYou know it's interesting you mentioned the growth of household income and I did that is one thing that we have seen consistently show up of the last few years that was initially when we started looking at this show five or five years or so ago\nThat was the top ... and people limited they're spending it was the cause their incomes weren't going up we noticed over the past several years though is that as\nA income growth became more broad based\nThat became less and less the case where that was the reason people voting back and instead people were saying quoting back in order to save more money that continues to be the predominant reason and buy a pretty wide margin a couple of other things that that bear watching um the percentage of Americans\nTo point to too much debt as to why they're holding back\nThat's been creeping higher each of the past few years down the highest that it's been at any any point that we've looked at this in the last five years and I think that's consistent with a rising interest rate environment\nThat better economy we are seeing debt burdens come up but that the higher debt burdens coupled with rising interest rates are they get shows that there are some people are they're starting to feel the squeeze on interest rates and then we\nThe even an assault economy there there there are still those that are\nYou know those ever present worries about the economy there are still ... percent of people say that the reason they're holding back a ... you know worried about the economy began not a whole lot different from what we've been seeing last year a lower than in years past but not a whole lot different than last year but again I think even shows that even on a sunny day somebody's worried about right\nNow and we're speaking with Greg McBride chief financial analyst at bank great dot com and got a new survey that indicates sixty six percent of Americans are limiting spending about my generation what's that break down\nYou know it's interesting guy the tendency to both back on spending an inclination to shave more as the reason falling back\nSkew younger so millennials in particular lead the way they are the most likely of all the generations to really be limiting how much they spend hand are also the most likely to say I need to save more money and that's why I'm holding back on spending Gen x is not far behind um similar trend there\nMost inclined to be limiting their spending because they want more money\nBut that's where it changes the baby boomers those on the sandwich generation a couple of things one they're not as likely to be holding back\nOn their spending as their younger counterparts [laughter] but when they do their reasons are different and it but the predominant reason is stagnant income so even though we're seeing broad based income growth and the economy's doing well I think that's another indicator that you're particularly for baby boomers that are in the workforce stagnant income is still very much an issue\nAnd much of this is a recession hang over that may have been passed on from parents who went through it to say oh what a generation Z or the millennials or whatever some of these young adults just picking this up on their own\nCertainly with millennials I we've seen this this is no fluke I mean we've seen this in a number of different surveys that we've done over the years you know some of the things that you and I talked about in the past ... millennials have a greater inclination\nToward saving they have a little less of a consumption focus and they're more averse to debt than what we have seen from preceding generations and I think a lot of that stems from having had a front row seat for the financial crisis either experiencing it first hand in the case of voter millennials or\nSeen the impact that it had on family members friends older siblings I'm just as you were sort of in those financially formative years has undoubtedly had an effect and we see that manifesting itself in a number of different ways you know in this case it that that focus on saving
