P. protection and on a state owned enterprises a lot of the things that we claim we want to see from China\nOr the president was true from TPP and at that threaten to withdraw from NAFTA and so here we are today\nSo we have this new NAFTA new trade agreement and there was a perception at least that the old now\nWas unfair to the United states of course the president made this a big part of his campaign and twenty sixteen\nSo bottom line here ... years this an improvement on the old NAFTA\nThey're small improvement for sure I mean this was a deal that was over twenty year old\nSo it it happened before the rise of e commerce and things like that that needed modernization some of a deal some of the still ... says\nAnd that's a good thing I mean there are some as I said the uh the slide opening up the dairy market for Canada is a good faith also it what it does is that it increases the threshold for selling stuff through the Internet for individuals for it to be a duty free it used to be very very low and so that's that's a good thing but the\nBalance like that that negative side as is probably worse than the good things are getting better get our base find was not\nThe old laptop pre President Trump\nYou may find that we have to look at now realistically as we were in a world where there was a potential in the west a phone lines drawn from NAFTA was a potential of the difficulty finding a resolution extreme chaos and uncertainty and that on the uncertainties that left ... dead yeah we can't meant\nThat fact that they're making things on their own worst fat and they and their reality when they go ship all different than it was going to rock the boat for better or worse and now we can hope for\nAt least a more peaceful environment\nWhile at the very least another items checked off of the to do list that we have been talking with ... who is a senior research fellow with the Mercator center that at George Mason university and burning tell us a little bit about the Mercator center also where folks and go to read your writings on this and other subjects\nThe center for market research that are based at George Mason university and non partisan and redo economic stuff we started with rank and I had a long time ago and we are at ... or you can read all my stuff\nThere but I I doubt creators colon I'm syndicated and its creators I I'd like to corner and I also write a con for a reason magazine and sometimes I write for the New York times\n... there were the other Mercator center Veronique thanks as always for being here thank you for having me\nAt the offices of the club for growth in Washington DC Andrew Roth is keeping an eye on US Senate races and congressional races all across the country and we're going to take an update one month before election as to where things stand\nAndy good to have you here thanks for having me lemon\nLet's talk first about the U.S Senate it's been it's been an interesting couple of weeks for the Senate Republicans have a little bit of an advantage by virtue of the map you might want to just give us a bit of an overview on that and then we can talk about how things are going in the individual states\nYou're right Republicans do have an advantage right off the bat thoroughly defending eight seats or nine seats rather and the Democrats are defending twenty six so just right off the bat or they're in good shape plus at least ten Democrat ... seats that are up for reelection\nTrump won and some of them Trump won big time like West Virginia\nAnd North Dakota so the Republicans are definitely in the driver's seat now there's a lot of money involved and there's a lot of spending involved and there's a lot of good candidates that were recruited involved so it is making this situation a little bit more difficult for Republicans\nThey have a fifty one forty nine advantage in the Senate which is very slim the best guess right now is that perhaps they'll pick up one or two seats\nBut I could easily see them picking up more than that or\nHaving the election be a complete washer nobody wins or loses net seats and I could even see Democrats picking up a net one or two seats so it's getting married\nSo a month out nothing is settled in the situation is going to remain voluntary right up until election day let's talk first of all in the in terms of all these democratic seats that are up\nWhich states are finding that their incumbent democratic US Senators are the most vulnerable and perhaps subject losing to a Republican challenger\nYeah I think first and foremost a you have to look at North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp is the Democrat there she's trying to portray herself as a moderate", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Gulf Coast Issues", "city": "Moss Point",

from the city of Alexi they focused on the status at the singer theater and some repairs and other city issues so we're going to start out by sharing that with the\n\n[noise]\nCity desk news and views from city hall Biloxi and now the host of our program city desk\nPublic affairs manager for the city of Biloxi Mr Vincent ... good morning was to grill the morning William\n... we are recording this program on Thursday October twenty fifth and it's ten thirty six in the morning here for the city hall and joining me after a week long\nSabbatical is Cecelia dogs' fault and public affairs specialist for the city of on the\nMorning you jump right into yesterday and I'm going to say that again what's going on with the sangre theater\nAnd the thing is a theater um they are continuing to work on repairs for this thing and theater and then kind of a long process but there is a process to go to in the city wants to make sure that everything is done to correct\nWhat they have done is they have reviewed the outside of what we're parents that are needed in addition to that they had to go in and find out what\nThe structure was made up a\nIt was not a lot of good detailed information that was on bombing them in the building was like Nineteen twenty nine we've had storms and hurricanes and stuff like that so they had to go and be fine detailed information and then they also had to actually go in and find out what destruction was night so that has taken a while\nAnd that research that they find anything like historical old switches papers documents Markey's old letters I mean that places now\nLetters but they did find some old they were talking about an old information like that\nBut but what I'm told that they don't allow that to now where they're at right now is they are the engineers architects are working with the history and our guys to find out what materials they can\nUse to repaint make these repairs they also see the need for repairs to their\nFlight power which is the back part the kind of tell her back part not going to\nDo and what was the ... whenever you go see a production and they're changing the SATs when they raised two sets high up in the air that's where they go into the\nTower and they see that that part needs the most immediate attention\nSo they're going to work on repairing that question I think at the ... material sees hopefully the ads will go out into the here and work with out in the\nBeginning of next year and be complete sometime next year\nAn abstract question but related that used to be a world class ... sangre brothers motion picture house [noise] and they're still holes in the wall in the back et cetera are they thinking about restoring that you can actually show movies\nActually what they did is do their research and they found a lot of old newspaper articles in photographs of what the outside in the inside look like back then in the Nineteen twenties in Nineteen thirty\nAre they going to do their best to restore what they can do that too that air but then one thing\nWe we've had that fly tower and they're going to go out for the ads to repair the outside work which we've talked about that before that's just seal and the bread and and we pairing that and the reason\nThat I'm aging the AC on the race or we pay that and how well hopefully God did they sometime next year and of course once they complete that then they've got to work on the inside but they got to go through the process of evaluating what needs to be done and going out for bed and then working on that\nPart so it is a long process\nAnd they see the engineers architects knows that it is but we want to make sure that it is done right and that it will be able to be used for for years to come\nAnd we want to make sure people know that it's not just sitting over there there is work going on just because you can see it that is because they have to do the specifications\nAssociate you brought the specifications for construction and go out for beer and everything along every step of the way as you noted has to be approved by the Mississippi department of our cats in history and since that ... is on the national registry of historic places one interesting thing that came up\nIn the wake of Katrina whenever the city wants to make repairs to the inside of\nWhat the White House the bullets the White House as a cast iron structure but inside the\nThe the tunnel but to ... is a it's one with bricks and the issue was they couldn't just go by bricks off the shelf and the reason they couldn't use today's style bricks is because they are heavier\nThey are bigger so if you were to replace parts of the wall inside the White House with bricks made today they would crush the other ... because of the weight so they had to be careful in in what materials they're huge which\nIs another part of this anger process so it it's time consuming and it and it is a it it's something that's frustrating for people because the Gulf Coast symphony orchestras a great example they were supposed to start their season in September in the sangre\nThey started their season in September but they were not in the sangre John McFarland our good friend who is executive director of the Gulf Coast symphony said it's like a football\nTeam play every game as an away again much would appreciate everyone's patience\nAnd I said the city deck and other facilities such as the black sea visitor's center the down it's not as the ... center that day I have open for other groups that usually use the saying or where they can still have their events in Biloxi and went that spaces as well\nAnd remember folks when this is done with the amount of the city is detail you're going to have\nA benchmark you have a slice of Americana as a show place no one else will have goes back to the ball bill or a\nThink Nineteen twenty nine years or so\nThe one of the ways that we are going to pay for this is the mayor's been looking for our times in history money he's been looking for grant money are we thought we had some federal money tied up for it but to federal money was ruled as ineligible for that even though federal money had been used before\nThere's been a change in that determination but right now America which is proposing to the members of the city council people judge Judy going with the borrowing fourteen million dollars to keep major projects moving that we have been underway right now\nWe're talking about bricks and mortar stuff and we're talking about design and engineering [noise] a a large portion of the fourteen million or in that figures like five\nMillion would be spending more marketing on water Seward drainage sidewalks et cetera this goes along with the promises that the city made so long ago to upgrade all\nOf of the community to city level services that they expect and deserved a\nAlso in the fourteen million dollar bond is repairs to the cedar lake bridge the cedar\nLake bridge it it can handle fire trucks right now it can't\nHandle the waiting vehicles that may need to go across that seat or like bridge there seem to like bridges at the c._e._o. like exit go north probably about two or three miles it's what is known as a swing ... you know it's kind of candle even on a on a huge structure and the bridge swings open when boats come\nIt's a well while I'm rich fortunately it does not have to move to open a lot for marine traffic\nThe mayor is also looking at using some of the fourteen million dollars for upgrades of the main street braille crossing one important thing to know about the fourteen million is that a share of that fourteen million dollars\nIs the city's twenty percent match to get eighty percent in federal money so some of it is tied up in that their main street crossing is a great example of that market sidewalks as it is another great example\nOr two million dollars of the fourteen million dollars is allotted to the sangre theater to keep that were going on in the past we've talked about the new pope's very bridge we would like to see in one day we've talked about\nThe pending pending I say because it is going to be happening the extension of pops ferry road all the way down the highway Ninety\nWe've got design engineers who are looking at the right away we need to buy they are all making steps on these big projects even though they're years away even though we don't have the funding for the overall project\nYou still have to keep it moving and get it bid ready it's called to where it's ready to go out for beds when we do secure that money we want to be ready to go\nSo last year at the state of the city we made a big deal about happening now\nWell as my cornered said we want to be able to say happening tomorrow as well\nAre good reasons that the mayor's looking to move forward with this or fourteen million dollar bond borrowing fourteen million would require no tax increase the the money to pay it back\nIs already in the budget the money for the debt service it's called can handle or fourteen million dollar bond that is also well below our capacity football that\n[noise] so what they're looking to do is just keep projects moving so the mayor unveiled the solar noun stood to the city Council on Tuesday and Michael entered had also giving them a memo about here's what we're looking to do it seemed like it was

of reason magazine talks with Brian ... of the Manhattan Institute\nAnd Democrats are approaching the mid term elections with very different strategies in urban and rural districts Dr ... from the center for vision and values that grow City College has an American radio journal commentary [noise]\nMy looming Henry and welcome to American radio journal\nThe constitution of the United states can be changed by amendment or via a convention of states since Congress will probably not reform itself the convention route is more likely to yield results\nMark Meckler is president and founder of convention of the states and convention of states action is here to explain how a convention would work and why it is needed mark welcome to American radio journal mark when we talk about a convention of states it's probably a process\nThat most Americans are not familiar with so tell us what is a convention of states\nYeah you're right it's something we've never done before in our history it's found in article five of the United States Constitution it was literally put there two days before the end of the convention in Seventeen eight seven and it's put their this idea of the state's getting together and convention put there\nFor the very purpose of pushing back against federal overreach and what it is is a process whereby two thirds of the states now thirty four states can get together colic convention get together and convention and discuss ideas\nFor restraining federal overreach and specifically the application we're pursuing right now which has already been passed in twelve states calls for physical restraints on the federal government term limits on the federal government that would include Congress the courts and the bureaucracy and ultimately I think the most important scope and jurisdiction restraints\nAre you finding that the current system the way that it is structured mark particularly with Congress with a lack of term limits and no real limits on power are we finding of this isn't working as well as it did in the early days of the republic\nThe real reason is is needed is then you referred to structurally broken the structure of government in the United states of America so the structure was set up correctly I think it worked beautifully for the first hundred years and then we started to break that structure\nSo we now need structural reforms and the only way to get structural reforms is by calling a convention and imposing a structural reforms one great example is terminal and it's simply used to be imposed by people people rotated in office they didn't serve for\nThirty thirty five years in Congress or in the Senate and so we didn't need term limits now we do need term us when the founders created the Supreme Court for example the Supreme Court\nThe justices average age of appointment was forty seven average life expectancy was fifty four they didn't expect jurors to serve Thirty years on the United States Supreme court so we've broken the system in some pretty fundamental ways that need to be repaired structurally\nThose things aren't going to be repaired by elections\nWhat about the process by which we have amended their constitutions numerous times throughout the centuries starting with the bill of rights where are you going minute by minute is that just to laborious process to try to get this type of systemic change that you're talking about well\nI don't think it's that it's so much more laborious the issue is what we're looking at is controlling the federal government if you look at the process but the other process for proposing amendments amendments have to be proposed by Congress so we're talking about is\nCongress needs its wings clipped Congress needs balanced budget imposed on at Congress needs term limits imposed on it they will never propose those sorts of him and so it would take two thirds of both houses to propose it\nTry to imagine a time when two thirds of both houses of Congress propose a balanced budget amendment term limits that's just not going to happen\nOr they haven't even been able to balance the budget and the lifestyle of decades let alone propose it so we need this convention of states in order to bring about this type of change that is necessary at this point in our history mark one concern that has raised the as we do have as I mentioned earlier that bill of rights and there is a concern that a convention of\nStates could go rogue and maybe erodes some of the God given rights that are protected by our constitution how would you protect against that well\nFirst of all the convention is called according to resolutions passed by the states all states have to pass the same resolutions those resolutions preclude any discussion frankly of anything in the bill of rights they literally cannot even be discussed\nWhen you get in convention all the delegations are controlled by the states the sent them the states limit what they can and can't talk about\nToday we need to remember there are thirty three states with both houses controlled by Republicans every delegate that comes is controlled by their legislature so if they even started to try to get out of bounds that could be stopped by their states and ultimately the founders provided the protection which was it takes three quarters of all states are thirty eight states to ratify anything\nYou can do the math that run the math on every single women ever been proposed to me you can't find it amendment that would limit our liberties that could be ratified an even close to thirty eight states\nLet's talk a little bit more about process you touched upon it earlier and the number of states that is needed and tell us how many we have you've mentioned how many we need and where do we stand in the process of getting to\nThe critical mass that would allow this convention of states to occur\nAre so it takes thirty four states are two thirds of the states to call a convention so far twelve states have done that so we're just over one third of the way they are which is extraordinary people said it was impossible to get that far we've gotten that far already\nAnd so it takes thirty four to get into convention in convention it takes twenty six days to pass a proposed amendment out of convention important to remember when you're in a convention the only thing I can mention can do is proposed amendment so people get all scared about getting into convention it's\nMerely a place where people can really make suggestions and then it takes thirty eight states to ratify anything that comes out of convention I think we're well on her way I think that one third mark is a pretty extraordinary landmark\nWe have passed and another Nineteen states in one house or the other you have to get both houses in a concurrent session so I think we're well on her way and I think we should expect to see some pretty extraordinary progress in twenty Nineteen\nMark if you go back in history and I realized and unfortunately it's not being taught at least to the degree it showed in many schools these days but tell us a little bit about the founding of the republic didn't the state's create the federal government and the other way around\nYeah look I think that's the history that's really important in the power pyramid was the state's created the federal government the state's essentially were to retain sovereignty they ... they were to have brought on ... powers the federal government was had to have limited any new worried it powers is now being reverse\nBecause of the rulings of the Supreme Court and really importantly in regard to the commerce clause the federal government can pretty much do anything it wants to do constitution\nAnd this is a big problem and and so we need to reverse that power pyramid take the power away from DC make it so DC is it so important I Would add one more thing there's so much conflict in strikes in this country right now politically I don't like it I don't think anybody likes it\nThe way you reduce that strife is quit making centralized decisions you take the power away from the federal government give it\nBack to the people in the states let them make the decisions at home we won't see these huge national fights anymore\nWe have been talking with mark Meckler who is the president and founder of convention of states and conventional states action so marked house just a little bit about convention stage organization where can folks also go on the Web if they want to learn more and get involved in the fight\nSure the project was founded just about five years ago\nAnd it was founded to take power away from DC give it back to the people people can read about it get involved at convention estates dot com it's supported by literally virtually every major conservative figure in the United states that's commented on out Sean Hannity\nMarco then Senator Tom Coburn Senator Jim demand lots of senators are fast and Rubio they understand that Washington DC isn't working in the way to fix it is take the power away from DC and get back to the people\nIf folks want to be involved in that they can do that a convention estates dot com\nMark Meckler from convention of states mark thank you for being here\nGood to be with you thanks for having me\nAnd the route that the club for growth are keeping an eye on all these congressional races we have going on around the country as well as US Senate races Andy\nGood to have you here I think family alum\nAndy as we've talked about many times Republicans currently control both the U.S Senate and the U.S house of representatives the Senate seems\nTo be headed more in the Republican direction but let's talk today about the house right now can you give us an overview as to how many seats Democrats would have to gain and where do they stand in achieving that goal\nThe Republicans are in charge of the house it appears that they are going to lose seats President Trump claims that there will be a red wave that will counteract that and to to be honest with you we are kind of seen some something of a red wave but the damn wave was so big\nLeading into the Kavanaugh hearings for the Supreme Court\nThat if a red wave does crop up it'll only reduce the demo have just to confuse the the analogy so right now Republicans are in the majority Democrats have to pick up twenty three seats\nI think that right now you can count about fourteen seats that will likely go down so that means the Democrats only have to pick up nine more and when you look at the population of seats from which says nine could come from you're looking at about twenty nine or thirty seats\nSo basically nine out of twenty nine nine out of thirty you're looking at about a

unemployment statistics which found the nation's unemployment rate at its lowest level since the Nineteen sixties here do sort through the numbers is John Tammany John ... is director of the center for economic freedom at freedomworks\nJohn welcome back to American radio journal John the unemployment numbers are out for the month of September and once again it would appear that the economy has yielded a low number of unemployed the lowest perhaps in decades so tell us a little bit about that\nIt's got to be remembered that economies are just people and people naturally grows they're naturally trying to better their situation\nThe only way they can is if a natural barriers are putting their place usually have the tax regulatory trade tariffs and an unstable money variety and so I think it's a fairly strong signal that while President Trump isn't perfect in terms of economic policy\nIn particular on the trade front overall his policies have been rather benign in some degree pro growth and would that people\nIn the economy just naturally migrated to better and better jobs and more and more people have come off the sidelines to get to work and so it's very positive sign\nIn terms of the growing economy and job opportunities are we seeing this just in certain groups of people or is this extending across all economic classes and all demographics classes\nEverything that I've read has so far indicated that this is a very deep\nEconomic rally as Senate hitting people of at all levels of the economic spectrum from from the high end of earnings to low low you're hearing about a smaller businesses and or a service businesses that are really struggling to find\nGood workers right now just given given the high demand for them so it's it sounds like it's always the case a growing economy generally lifts all boats and we're seeing that happen right here\nIn terms of these job openings and what appears to be a growing lack of qualified employees is this a factor that could possibly hold this economic expansion down going forward to fact there aren't enough qualified workers out there now for the jobs available\nI don't think so and my example is myself I come from I guess you'd call generation X. people who graduated in the late eighties throughout the nineties most of us\nDidn't grow up with Internet or anything related to the Internet but\nMy generation adapted to work this Internet based very quickly and that same generation had a lot to do with the Internet boom and so my take is that as it is it's always the case people can learn they learn quickly what they need to learn in order to be employed and and what brings them into employment is that\nCompanies looking to add quality workers raise the amount that they're willing to pay and that serves as a fairly potent lower so I never\nWorry about that skills people can develop skills very quickly\nYou mentioned one of the areas where the president maybe is not as free market as other places is when it comes to trade we have a new NAFTA agreement and uh although I understand you don't have a crystal ball what effect do you think having an agreement actually in place now will have on trade\nWell it's good in the sense that it removes some uncertainty certainly the markets like that probably what they would have liked a lot more is if President Trump hadn't done anything investors probably like NAFTA and so\nThe fact that the good news here is that it didn't bring it back Trump largely brought back what we had before there was a bit more central planning to it and that's unfortunate there's lots of things like certain cars if they're going to be made and sold in North America tear free they have to have\nA certain amount of labor that constantly sixteen dollars per hour the inputs in the car have to add a percentage of I think Seventy five percent be made in North America all that's unfortunate that the Republican Party has historically been one about free markets and freedom for producers to do is they wished without\nA meddling there's a little bit of central planning in the new NAFTA but largely at the same as the one before and investors broadly\nLike that but let's talk for a minute or two now about the Federal Reserve and John many Americans of course of her to the Federal Reserve a lot of folks maybe don't quite understand how it operates in what impact that has a just very briefly what impact does the Federal Reserve actually have on our economy and how does it tried to manage it\nI'm One of these people and I'm somewhat of an outlier here I've\nLong believed and I wrote a book about it called who needs the fed I think the feds impact on the economy is vastly overstated the fed exist as a lender of last resort to solvent banks but can't really do that you know solve the bank would ever go to the fed for a loan it'd be an admission of bankruptcy\nThe fat also regulates banks but it can't really do that very effectively as two thousand eight reminds us and then of course it aims to\nSet the overnight rate which banks lend one another button interest rates price like any other you don't need the fed for that and so I think the feds impact has vastly over and people say well you know they're going to reduce interest rates and that's going to ease up credit\nThat's the equivalent of married ablaze you said in New York how apartment rents are too high I'm going to reduce how much landlords couldn't charge for apartments all he would do is just cause scarcity and the same way of markets actually responded the fed\nThe fed to the best cause scarcity by trying to artificially lower rates below what they normally it in the marketplace so my point is is is we in the real economy we largely act as the fed doesn't exist that that sort\nAnd that sort of an outlier position but I Believe it will be increasingly common place in the coming years\nThe fed has been on a rate increase I won't say binge because they've been doing it in smaller increments this past week it did seem to skin or the markets a little bit will the fed raising the the rates will that cause the economy to cool off or given your previous comment cereal really don't think it's going to have much impact in the long run\nNow I don't think it will have much of an impact in all let's remember the fact kept rates low about Syria or the rate at any set for years and years for basically two thousand nine until what about twenty Fifteen or twenty sixteen\nThere is no major economic boom during that time the fed can change reality when when we're when we go to the market to borrow money we're borrowing access to real resources the trucks tractors computers desks chairs most of all\nHuman labor that that can expand the amount of that available I Can't make these resources cheap and so I think the answer is is to always remind ourselves with\nThe fat as just another entity trying to influence things not very well\nWe have been talking with John Tammy who is the director of the center for economic freedom at freedomworks John tell us about freedomworks also working folks go on the Web to get more information from your\nFreedomworks is a wonderful organization based in Washington DC that makes the essential point that Washington is not going to change in less politicians realize that they're the voters are changing them that they basically see what they're dealing\nAnd your website is\nW. W. W. freedomworks dot org John\nTammany freedomworks John thank you for being here thanks for having me and the route that the club for growth keeping an eye on what's been a fascinating last few weeks in the nation's capital to say the least dandy good to have you here\nHi thanks for having lemon Brett\nKavanaugh's now and associate justice of the Supreme Court in the United states but the political ramifications likely are going to be felt for weeks as we head into the general election Andy is the Kavanaugh confirmation process is this going to be an overall plus for Republicans\nWell it is so far I mean obviously we get a a conservative justice that will help make the court of conservative majority\nThat could last very long time and who knows ... may even get another pick before the end of his first term but with regards to politics there's evidence that Republican voter enthusiasm has picked up you saw some recent polls that showed\nThat the percentage of voters who think this election is very important use to be de plus ten meaning the Democrats are ten percent more enthusiastic to vote the Republicans and that has shrunk to D plus too since the ... in a fight so if a Republican show up at the polls\nWas just as much enthusiasm as Democrats\nThan the Republicans will keep the house and they will likely add to the Senate majority so the Kevin a thing as a big deal and let me point out that the Democrats want to politicize it to the Jerry ...
