I felt a little caught off guard that it was that it was directed at the Jewish community even though I Know there's a long history\nOf anti Semitism in the world and we know the horrible things that have happened I just didn't think that we had something like that in this country\n[noise] [noise] yeah well there has been an increase over the last couple of years in twenty six team the FBI reported a a thirty five percent increase in anti Semitic crimes are twenty Seventeen there was a fifty seven percent increase in incidents\nSo uh it really is something that has been on the uptick and when you look at the over the past several weeks we've had that shooting up and Louisville, Kentucky that has now been declared a hate crime\nOr the the packages last week that could be considered political hate\nUh then you get this abhorrent incident over the weekend it really brings to the forefront once again that there are many different issues that bring out the hate and different people and different organizations across the country a and there's one estimate that there's many a thousand hate groups out there a\nCoast to coast ranging from anti immigrant anti gay to black nationalist to white supremacist to all across the board or so there is an awful lot of hate out there and I really think that and it played a part in the Pittsburgh shooting as well\nSocial media not the reason for these things but they certainly is a factor and all of these things because number one this social media platform gab dot com that this uh uh Bowers guy was on I had never even heard of before\nAnd a number one you can get your views out there anonymously number two you can find like minded individuals and uh you can encourage each other and and that could become an inflammatory situation and the third part of it is these are all hot button issues\nThat foreign entities have trolls are social media with a Russian meddling having to do with race issues in this country and racial bias religious bias immigrant issues they ... they poke at all of these things to try to inflame us here in this country and you know what I'll go Henry it's working\nWell the ... and you mentioned social media so are you speaking from the standpoint that these groups or people that have had these opinions have always been out there but it's now so much easier for them to find each other\nAbsolutely a number one to get your views out there whereas before al yeah you could get a Yankee grab a bullhorn and go to a street corner or a ... but now I mean all you have to do is go on and apparently this gab dot com\nOr was a website that while they their uh their approach was freedom of speech at a at a denigrate it into a hate site\nA that a track to people who wanted to get their messages have hate out there so you can get your message out there very easily and find other people who feel the same way\nSo are there any effort underway to maybe put an end to this particular side have you heard anything in that regard\nIt's down now or whether it will come back\nRemains to be saying that it would be hard to believe that uh that they could justify coming back on especially if it generates the same type of talk that it that it has and again\nI I for one I'd never even heard of it before this uh so it's down now I Would imagine it probably will not come up unless they they might bring it back up under a different name or something just to uh just to do that but if if this was one we don't know about that's out there how many others are there\nWell we'll build super you you mentioned um these estimates of how many hate groups that are out there and I'm sure the definition is going to vary from from person to person and also from who's doing the counting what about what about the government do does the government keep track of what they consider hate groups\nWell what the yes they do a and homeland security uh watches this as well as the ... the intelligence agencies and the FBI and in fact the FBI and it's interesting to me that they have only been tracking hate related crimes since Nineteen Ninety two\nAre and what they show as well as we hit an all time low and twenty fourteen since then since twenty fourteen the last four years uh we've been on the increase\nAnd die as so there has been a trend going up word\nNot only in this country but worldwide I mean when you look at Europe when you look at South America and when you look at the middle east you look a lot of different areas where this is also on the increase maybe for some of the same reasons is that it's happening here\nUh but uh but this was not a trend just it's just exclusive to the United states and and really when you look at it are these type of issues in this country have been around for a long time I mean when people were\nEmigrating in the in the early Nineteen hundreds and\nYou know certain ethnic groups whether it be the Italians are the Irish or the Germans ... weren't allowed to live in certain areas of cities and things like that it's been around for a long time\nOr it will bills for um [noise] it it's it's yeah it's been around for a long time and it seems like something very hard to combat\nYeah almost impossible uh other than a a a dramatic change in social attitudes and uh that is something that may never happen I you know it really is very difficult\nWhere we're at a time bill super thank you for your time today You're welcome uncle Henry [noise] their egos bills in for NBC News radio national correspondent\n[noise]\nWherever

M. and Ninety nine five ... the jak mobiles\nWeb news headlines coming up in ten minutes before we get to the news headlines we want to welcome back to Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent bills ever built good morning\nAnd go Henry mourning mourning Kelly marshal the migrant caravan how much is it grown\nWell there are some estimates now that goes highest ten thousand a year remember this started off as about a hundred fifty people\nIn Honduras and\nHas steadily grown and with other people joining in and all the publicity that this has gotten is helping this uh but now you know the estimates are as high as ten thousand people are involved in this caravan which is in southern Mexico the big bulk of it anyway after we all saw the\nImages over the weekend of people gathered on that bridge between Guatemala and Mexico or they were waiting there to be processed and got impatient some ended up swimming across the river being drafted across the river others just pushed down the fence and streamed through so we do have this group in southern Mexico now\nSo what's the latest in could they actually make it to the U.S border\n[noise]\nStill a long way to go there a Kelly over a thousand miles remain to be covered by this group so still a long way to go and Mexico continues to try to tell these people are look I come to the processing center we will grant you asylum\nAnd and we'll go from there in fact they have started placing buses now along this route because we're also seeing other suffering among the people we've seen children suffering effects of the heat or that they have encountered and the elderly with that might have some health issues or others are are are beginning to feel the pressure here\nPhysically up this track so what Mexico has done has started placing buses along the route\nAnd telling the people look anytime you're ready to jump on the bus will take you over the to the processing center you will be granted asylum in Mexico a dust bar a lot of people have been unwilling to do that fearing that it will only result in them being sent back to their home country so\nUh we'll make it to the United states they got a long way to go\nSit in the meantime you talk about how many thousands of people this has now become and you know they're being offered asylum and ... but I'm kind of curious as to the conditions that they're under yeah what kind of a relief efforts are underway or their groups and they're kind of helping them out making sure that they're bad\nOr they have water\nHow's that situation being worked out\nWell you know we don't have any reports of organized effort by humanitarian groups but what we do a report solve is a tremendous gestures by the locals are along the route here who have gone out to meet\nThis caravan or in some cases giving them everything from a from a water to a shoes\nTo money in a you know there are some cases of people handing out their own money to some of these people to give them a little bit of cash on the way through so are there have been a lot of gestures whether they're organized humanitarian effort so we haven't heard of groups that are involved in that but I'm sure they will be a just because of all the publicity that as\nGenerated by this caravan uh so uh but uh the conditions continue to be bad\nSo what are we going to do if they get here\nAnd that's a that's the magic questionnaire uncle Henry the president has talked about uh putting our military down at the border\nOr if they do make it to the United states okay even if we have our military there what do you do I mean you can't have a violent response to what these people are doing you could we have an arrangement with Mexico now where we can just turn them away we don't have to\nPut them into the process at their request asylum we can just turn them away but then what happens do they set up migrant camps along the border\nHoping to get across any way they can even if it's the illegally uh so that that remains the big question here but in the past\nThese groups that have started off in Central America and have to have the trek through Mexico have really dwindled as they are the farther north they get ah so I Would imagine that we're going to see a smaller much smaller number that has gathered now if and when they get to the United states and truthfully now\nA what a Honduras Guatemala Mexico I've been unable to do Mother Nature may be able to do because we've got a hurricane that is ready to hit western Mexico could be a category five hurricane\nIt is north of where this caravan is but still a what effects they will encounter a as they move north remains to be seen and and could cause problems for them\nWhich so is so bills for the ... you may not know the answer to this question but I'm going to ask it any way no how this number of of up to ten thousand how does that compare to what normally we have crossing the border because I keep hearing reports that some spots have four thousand apprehensions a week\nYeah uh well the numbers from a September alone were pretty impressive ah for the month of September there were forty thousand people are detained at the border as illegal immigrants\nUh so uh I mean that that the numbers are pretty big uh so you know even though this ten thousand people is really a drop in the bucket when you look at all the picture altogether but just the fact that these guys are coming from all the way from Central America\nIs what is really drawing attention ... thank you for your time today You're welcome\nThank you for

M.\nOr the average age is four years old\nAnd Ninety percent of the cases I have been found and those Eighteen years old and younger the other part of it is that right now they have no idea what is causing this and it has shown up basically nationwide while I said they're not a huge number of cases right now or they're looking at a hundred twenty seven cases across the country\nIt goes from New Jersey to\nUh California to Alabama where they have some cases that are under investigation there they suspect are related to this so uh it it really is a cause for concern because right now they say it could be a virus could be an environmental toxin\nCould be mosquito borne could be something that has a genetic component to it so they are investigating and in the meantime there are some children\nWho are suffering through this which includes a weakness a muscle weakness and the impossible paralysis in some children\nWell it's a any anything that affects a four year old really of course huge scare for parents\nYeah ... and that's what's really leading to this warning from the CDC they are now saying that uh if you see your child develop a southern weakness in the arms and legs or maybe a grouping of the facial features of seek immediate medical care\nOr even though there is no treatment for this at the time being they can start a physical therapy protocols that might be able to minimize some of the effects which range or some children recover rather quickly from this others' experience continued paralysis and require ongoing physical therapy\nSo when did this when did this pop up is this relatively new or is this been developing over the last few months\nWell actually it hasn't been on the radar for some years now the first cases were\nDetected back in two thousand twelve the CDC's started tracking it in Tony fourteen uh and it's interesting because it seems to focus on late summer and fall that's when it's found and every two years it seems to spike I mean twenty fourteen\nYet arrives in cases twenty sixteen you had a rise in cases and here we are twenty Eighteen or the right now they say since twenty fourteen\nThey have been documented about four hundred cases like I said it's not\nThe numbers are huge a but just the fact that it it targets children and can be debilitating is very concerning\nBecause we don't know what is causing it there's no advice on any preventative measures right you're just supposed to you're just supposed to monitor your kids and and see if they show symptoms\nYeah all they can say right now all go Henry is that you should treat this like you would treat colds and the flu a first of all get all your vaccinations this is not connected to any type of vaccination\nA number to frequent hand washing and if you're in an area where there are mosquitoes you should have mosquito protection either repellent or a be covered up in those situations because at this point they're not sure whether it is\nMosquito borne or not\nA bill for any other country dealing with is\nYeah there there it has been reported in some countries in Asia and also in Australia uh so it's not exclusive to the United states and again this is uh something\nThat leads to more of a mystery I it right now they're just really not sure exactly what causes this and and uh there are a number of theories about it but still they're continuing to work on it and and you know the these cases continue to pop up\nWell All right well a bill ... a thank you for your time You're welcome\nTheir egos bills are for ABC News radio national correspondent Kelly been a just a a what a frightening thing if you're a parent and your kid develops something like this that no one even knows what it is\nYeah and in these cases where the diseases so rare it's not something a doctor would typically look for so I Would imagine it's even harder to diagnose\nIf it does happen and that\nWow I Hope they come up with that has some answers soon on what's causing absolutely\nAnd or we're almost out of time in this segment or want to mention that if you want to see\nWhat goes on behind the scenes and hear the conversations we have during our commercial breaks

and also elections in Alabama and Mississippi\nOr a little bit of controversy in both states because some of the big candidates don't want to debate right I Know that in Mississippi Kelly been at your Senate candidates a Cindy Hyde Smith ... the Republican who was appointed to that post she will not debate right\nRight she opposes that I I'm kind of disappointed about that but here's what she told ... she said that debating Chris McDaniel her fellow GOP here would be like handing him a two hundred thousand dollar campaign donation\nWouldn't see be getting the same exposure I don't know that that makes sense to me that okay\nWell if if she thinks that more people know about her because she is the senator and the less people know about him Mm uh maybe I can understand what she's saying but still I'm I'm sure a lot of people would like to see that debate\nI Know why but especially with our candidates in that race\nSo no debate there in that Mississippi race in Alabama our governor Kay Ivey mhm who took over for governor Bentley the love go with his scandals she will not debate her democratic opponent Walt Maddox and there have been some people upset about that\nNow a weird instant yesterday where\nGovernor Kay Ivey produced a new note from her doctor\nWhat a\nYes talking about her health because there was an interview\nWith the former secretary of the Alabama law enforcement agencies Spencer call your he gave an interview to a website called Alabama political reporter and he told that website that Kay Ivey staff misled the public after she suffered what he says was a series of mini strokes\nWhile on a state trip to Colorado I think it was in twenty Fifteen\nNow when she went to Colorado she had some health problems and they said it was an altitude sickness okay and Spencer Collier says no it was not out it was not altitude sickness was it was mini strokes\nSo once again the governor Kay Ivey went to her doctor Dr Bryan el rod and hit him producing note\nAnd that was provided to AOL dot com in the note dust\nEl Raj says quote she was discharged from the hospital April Nineteen twenty Fifteen I saw were in my office the next day during my examination I saw no evidence of a transient ischemic attacks and learned that the extensive work up done at the Denver hospital\nThat was all negative I cannot comment on what condition may have led to her hospitalization but her health since then has been remained good\nWith no indication of increase cardiovascular risk in quote so she got this is I think the second doctors' notes she's gotten to show that she is allegedly healthy enough to be governor\n[noise]\nSo doctors' notes from candidate but there's nothing in the doctor's note excusing her from debating [laughter]\nYou didn't get a doctor is not a good point but no no no debate there in the Mississippi Senate race no debate in the Alabama governor's race strapped again whether together every ten minutes on the knowledge and then right back with more Gulf Coast more than [noise]\nYou know for nine time saver traffic or looking very good right now on the Mississippi Gulf goes that this ... looking pretty good I didn't ... it was

coming up here in about ten minutes before we get to the news headlines we want to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent Michael Bauer Michael good morning\nWanting a call and good morning Kelly Abby Thursday guys\nHappy Thursday to you too so what is the latest on the investigation into the missing Saudi journalist\nWell if you saw the footage yesterday the hazmat suits that were from the Turkish investigators are those those Turkish investigate it and the suit searching the Saudi council general's residence and is\nTumble yesterday and made the world news every\nA country that I could possibly see what's out there with cameras they were all filming it it looked like a giant press it was like it was like an Olympics of the press sitting right out in front of the Saudi council general's residence now the reason they were doing that and this was made very clear by Turkish\nOfficials as they released transcripts of this audio tape that they had a in their in their possession um\nIt was eleven minutes long in that audiotape or not only does it details the death of what they believe was Mr ... not only dead within minutes beheaded dismembered a according to reports he was tortured immediately as he walked through the door they began cutting off fingers and then within a two hour time frame that from the time you walk into the door\nUntil two hours later they were completely the killers were gone\nEverything was done and taking care of an out of the the consulate there\nBut one of the voices that they heard on the tape during that entire process was that of the council general who was saying to the people who had been conducting the torture and what they believe is the eventual death of ... are saying to them do this outside you're going to put me in trouble\nToo which are those individuals set back to the council if you want to live when you come back to rape you you'll shut up so that kind of lead the Turks to believe all the council gentle on some levels involved in this let's go check his residence and car and\nThey wanted to do that two weeks ago guys but they were not allowed by Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia would not allow them to go search that and frankly the Turks didn't have any access until forty eight hours ago when that council general\nFled the country of turkey to go back to Saudi Arabia\nSo where where does this go now is it going to be is there going to be an effort to find out who knew what in the Saudi Government about this\n[noise] yeah that's going to be one of the big calls\nRight now that seems to be kind of ... where the investigation is going for the Turkish justice minister says that the the the investigation's ongoing but it's expected to be concluded soon but they're also saying that they're growing indication that possible video evidence that the men allegedly responsible for the death of ...\nHad close ties to the highest level of the Saudi Government uh we do know that when Mike Pompeo went to visit with the Saudi or the Saudi crown prince the other day and no uncertain terms according to sources he told the crowd print that he was going to have to own\nThis situation and that every fact whatever those backs were every fact would eventually come out so Mike Pompeo kind of highlighting or for the crown prince that even if we're not going to talk about facts right now just know that\nEverything's going to come out at some point in time so if there's anything you want to get off your chest now or anything you want to get off your chest relatively soon would probably be best to do that\nSo there has been a talk in the beginning as we were looking into the\nThe what we now know as the debt that this journalist and you know President Trump was promising severe punishment he's kinda backtracked on the statements so what do you think that means I'm In in regard to our relationship with Saudi Arabia\nI Would say that right now the relationship with Saudi Arabia is good in Saudi Arabia has to understand that you know the U.S under the pressure to to have to ask the call as more and more this information comes out I mean you know you've got President Trump yesterday saying that he's not giving cover to Saudi Arabia he wants to find out what happened\nWho's at fault and then he believes it by the end of the week you'll have that information so in the meantime he's trying to deny that he's covering on any level but\nAs this goes on as more and more the details and some forensics are going to start to come out\nIt's going to be harder to do anything but point the finger at Saudi Arabia on some level here and the possibility of the higher up the\nFood chain within the Saudi Government that goes so there's going to be those kinds of of curious parts to this and then questions that need to be answered and with that Kelly go Henry this is on the heels of Tuesday a U.S receiving a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia right at the same date my palm pale arrived there\nNow this was something that was pledged to the U.S back in August in regards to stabilizing efforts in Syria but the imagery the optics\nOf getting a payment right in the middle of this investigation right\nAs President Trump has kind of been saying the Saudis one of our uh our our our our greatest allies and then the payment of a hundred million dollars comes through the optics of that look weird and that's where people are starting to question when you couple that with some senators saying that the Trump Administration\nHas a canceled intelligence meetings that we're supposed to be\nIn regards to the ... disappearance and that according to Bob Corker\nWhen Trump Administration says they are refusing to share any information with the senators going forward at this point so there are more questions that are coming up into what the president knows and isn't sharing and making transparent with not only the world but with our own government\nMichael about where we're at a time for this morning but thank you for your time today\nYou got to have a great rest of your morning\nTheir egos Michael

M. and Ninety nine five FM the drag immobile [noise]\nNews headlines coming up for you and about ten minutes [noise] and we're hoping to talk to Michael power here\nIn a moment about the ah situation with more uh caravans right now are Michael power not yet joining us but we do have some info for you on that issue on that story\nYeah President Trump defending suggestions that the migrant caravan contain some suspected terrorists from the Mid East smart Mayfield has that report\nAt the White House on Tuesday he said he had some very good information but when he was pressed for details you\nSeemed less sure there's no proof of anything there's no proof of anything but they could very well be\nVice president my parents said the president of Honduras told him this was organized by a leftist groups in Honduras and financed by Venezuela a caravan of several thousand migrants continues a slow walk through Mexico headed to the U.S border President Trump said\nThey're not coming in you said he will deploy the military if he needs to mark Mayfield NBC News radio\nOkay so so we're hearing that um what we just heard was that Honduras is claiming that Venezuela is paying for this or was was providing some money for this\nYes and you know there was a situation where I was hearing there was more than one caravan now\nAnd so how many people there were seven thousand and the first one and it was said to be growing and the one time I talked about it and I think you know\nThe concern is secure the border it's very possible that some people with some very bad intentions have worked their way into these caravans and they want to do harm to the United states [noise]\nWell ... yes I'm there there's really no way to know who might be in the Caribbean one way or the other uh also um\nI've heard some reports that said that that we used to see just single males trying to make their way in and that has changed in the last year where you see lots of young men accompanied by a young women\nAnd they're all these claims that it may be a part of human trafficking or it may be a scheme or as an easier way to get in if you if you bring a youngster with you\nTo get across the border um but it's hard to sort through all this right I mean 'cause uh\nThere's it's difficult to know from where we are all the people might be in the Caribbean\nWell and not only that but I think if you interview them all individually you still necessarily wouldn't be able to pull bad guys from the good guys or because they've got their stories to tell right so right security wise it's got to be a nightmare to think about all these people and\nIt it's just a a situation that it looks like it continues to get 'em bigger you know it's a bigger situation for folks to try to handle as\nWe are talking I was trying to look and see if I see something new on this story that I could share with everybody but I'm really not I'm just [noise]\nYou know and Michael about yes\nJust you want to open your arms and help people out that her in a bad situation you have a lot of compassion for people and that really want to come to this country for the right reasons but there's there's a way to do it and there are people that are making their way here\nYou're legally\nAnd you don't ... you know there's there's a line forming I think there's a process\nRight\nOr as you pointed out work country that a lot of us especially in modern times\nUh ... like the story of the immigrants that come here legally and and um is here to work for a better life it's it's something that a lot of us are descended from mhm um but\nThe ... this looks more like chaos right\nYes and it's something that that we we've got to be careful with no doubt it's certainly a mess it looks like it's going to be an even bigger one is we go forward and it looks like no we will have no update today from Michael ... our ... like because we have not heard from him on the story\nBut we'll keep you up to date on it it's something
