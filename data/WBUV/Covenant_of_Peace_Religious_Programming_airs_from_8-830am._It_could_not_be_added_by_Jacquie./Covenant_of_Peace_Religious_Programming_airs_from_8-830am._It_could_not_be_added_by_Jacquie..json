Bradley this program is dedicated to bringing you the glorious truth of God's word one verse at a time\nAnd then the holy Bible says this and John one one three five and then first fourteen in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God\nHe was in the beginning with God all things came into being through Hamad apart from him nothing came into being that has come into being in him was why for the life was the light of men the light shines in the darkness and the darkness did not comprehend it and the word became flash\nAnd wealth among us and we saw his glory glory as are the only gotten from the father full of grace and truth and he wrote again John\nRoad again in first John ... won three for what was from the beginning what we have heard what we have seen with our eyes would have looked at and touched with our hands concerning the word of life\nIn the life was manifested in we have seen and testify and proclaimed to give the eternal life which was with the father and was manifested to us what we have seen and heard we proclaim to you also so that you two may have fellowship with us\nAnd indeed our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ\nThese things we right so that our joy maybe made complete\nSo the only question that really matters is who is Jesus an answering that question correctly is critical to one's eternal destiny heaven is the result of getting the the right answer and the right response to that question\nAnd eternity and the devils hell as a result of not answering that question correctly\nSo this is not simply an issue that affects your belief in this life is not simply an issue that affects your lifestyle here on earth no who Jesus is is the preeminent issue of olive life and it will affect your eternal destiny\nMust understand that all humans who live on this planet are accountable to God for the answer to this one question even if they don't know the answer they are accountable to God for the answer\nBut the wrong answer or no answer at all dams them forever and the right answer opens the door to eternal life enjoy so this is the question of all questions\nAnd all through the centuries of man's existence philosophers have offered answers to this questions and theologians have offered answers and false profits and false religions have given their answers and secularists have given their answers and atheists have given their answers and human is given their answers and sadly\nTheir answers are all wrong all of them are wrong every single one of them are wrong about the single most important question of all\nWho is Jesus\nAnd you would think that right off the bat that question a serious and as important as this one\nWould be very complex and very complicated and very detailed and involve many aspects and much analysis and much research in much study you would think that it would be very difficult to answer a question like this since there are endless books and endless articles and\nEndless discussions and treatments on the question of the identity of Jesus Christ\nLibraries are full literally of tens of thousands if not millions of books that have been focused on addressing this one question in one way or another articles appearing journals magazines and newspapers discussions are held symposiums are assembled every here\nThe level of assault on the issue of the identity of Jesus Christ might convince us that this is a very complex and difficult question that cannot be answered easily\nIn fact the consensus might indicate to us that it really doesn't have an answer that it's just something you sort of work on with no hope of resolution millions and millions of pages exist giving testimony to what some would conclude is the author and possibility of coming to the right conclusion about this issue\nBut the fact of the matter is their friends that this was a very easy question to answer it only becomes hard if you reject the Bible so all of these people who bring their hands over who Jesus is are only doing that because they refuse to believe the Bible to be the word of the living God\nWhat is absolutely astounding just to see the arrogance and self righteousness of these people is it will very quickly and very easily favor their own rational thinking and their own intellect and their own very limited personal experiences over the clear an unmistakable testimony of sacred scripture\nOthers will stay there eternity on the confusing and contradictory in historically inaccurate testimony of discredited false profits and teachers who fabricated spurious information that can be very easily put down\nThe bottom line is that if you do not accept what the Bible says about who Jesus is that your hopelessly lost in your search for the real Jesus\nIn fact are for gospel records Matthew mark Luke and John answered the question of who Jesus is over and over and over again\nIn fact John wrote in John twenty versus thirty and thirty one the very purpose for why he wrote\nThe gospel record when he said there for many other signs Jesus also performed in the presence of the disciples which are not written this book but these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ the son of God and then be leaving you may have life and his name\nSo Jesus Christ the son of God and back in the first century when somebody said that somebody was a son of\nThen that was that ... that he had the very same nature substance or essence as his father and the Jesus has the very same nature or substance or essence as God then Jesus is God in human flesh dislike the Bible says that he is\nAnd so if you put your trust in Jesus and in his finished work you will be forgiven for all of your sins and you will spend eternity in heaven\nAnd if you do not then you keep your ... and you will have to pay for all of them yourself in hell\nSo that's the Jesus is and that's what comes by believing in him and that's not ambiguous than it is an hidden or obscure it does it take some kind of academic degree to sort out it is very clear it is very simple it is very precise very straightforward and it is very very important\nNow we're in a journey through the gospel account of Dr Lu who wrote this book and the book with the axe to a Roman dignitaries name the awful is to convince him of the veracity of Jesus being the along the way the Jewish Messiah and the savior of the world at some point around a de sixty\nWhich was approximately thirty one years after the resurrection about four years after Paul wrote the book of Romans and about ten years before the Roman army destroyed the temple in Jerusalem and with it a little bit nickel priesthood and all of Judaism\nAs we've already discussed ... was a medical professional in a very detailed historian and theologian who probably under the apple stock authority of the apostle Paul wrote this to volume work Luke engaged in very lengthy interviews with the people and the witnesses involved in all of this including marry the mother of the lord\nAnd so front and center and looks account of the birth of life and ministry and death resurrection\nOf Jesus Christ there's absolutely no way that any honest reader can avoid the repeated identification of Jesus as being God Almighty inhuman flash fully divine and fully human in the very same body at the very same time without any conflict are contradiction\nIn chapter one you have the testimony of an angel as to the coming of the messiah who was the Lord Jesus Christ you also have the testimony of an Old Testament praised\nBy the name of Zacharias to the fact that he will be the father of a child John the Baptist that would be the Fort runner of the messiah who would come to fulfill all the promises of the old covenant and ... you have to collect the testimony of angels that the cars child has been born and then he was born in Bethlehem and that his name is Jesus\nAnd then in the same chapter to you have the testimonials too Old Testament Jewish saints\nBy the name of sent me an Anna who testified that the baby Jesus is indeed the promise messiah who was come to fulfill Old Testament prophecy and be the savior centers\nAlso in chapter two at the end of the chapter you of the testimony of Jesus himself who at the age of twelve is engaged in deep profound theological discussions in the temple confesses that he needs to be about his heavily father's business since this earthly father was a builder and a carpenter\nChapter three we have the testimony of John the Baptist the fiery\nForeigner of the messiah who identifies Jesus as being the lamb of God he was come to take away the sins of the world\nChapter three again Jesus was baptized by John and that his baptism you have the testimony of the Holy Spirit the third person at the trinity the dissent zone Jesus as baptism and the very same way that a dove descends from his flight to the earth\nAnd you have John testified that he saw the spirit of God come upon Jesus and remain which had never happened to anyone before this time and not all gave divine affirmation to him and then you have the very audible and verbal testimony of the father himself\nOf who speaks out of heaven and says this is my beloved son in whom I Am well pleased\nAnd that map of course that Jesus was sent lists that he was perfect and that he plays the father in every way thought word indeed twenty four hours every day and seven days every week and then you have in chapter for the testimony of Satan who comes to tempt Jesus and says to him since you are the son of God\nDoesn't even in the midst of this amazing temptation state never doubted who Jesus was\nAlso in chapter for further down the testimony of other fallen angels who we know now or demons who identified Jesus as the holy wanna guard or the son of God and then you have the testimony of Peter ... who says depart from me oh lord", "station": "WBUV",

Iowa radiolab just open the up and have fun\nFrom the mantle Buick GMC studios [noise] this is talk going on for nine so many points and I urge radio station\nWelcome to the killing of the peace radio broadcast the teaching ministry of pastor ... Bradley this program is dedicated to bringing you the glorious truth of God's word one versed at a time\nAnd then communion in the low end and baptism God gave us these things so that by of failing ourselves of them on a regular basis we would be strong in the lord and the power of his mind and that makes us able to see ourselves correctly to see ourselves as God sees us so that we will not be deceived about ourselves\nAnd here's why this is what ... says if we say we have fellowship with him and you walk in the darkness we lie and do not practiced the truth\nAnd that tells us the truth genuine salvation is not about simply praying a prayer or walking down in Iowa are raising our hands are being bad ties are joining the church are adopting some kind of moral code to live by\nTrue salvation as a supernatural miracle whereby God the Holy Spirit literally comes to us while we're yet in our sins\nWhile we're still lost while we're doing as much as we can to serve Satan into rebel against God and to run and hide from God and while we are not wanting this are carrying anything about it at all while we are wishing that God would just leave us alone\nGod the Holy Spirit comes to us before we ask him to before we desire him too before we initiate anything at all\nDot the Holy Spirit soccer league violates our will he interrupts our lives he inserts himself in us he imposes himself on to us he forcefully opens are blind dies he an stops are deaf ears he takes out of the stony heart and puts in us a hard a flash\nThat is able and willing to believe\nIn God the Holy Spirit all by himself without any cooperation from us at all gives us new spiritual life which is ... birthing us he regenerate sauce and that means he destroys forever the domination that sand had over us he kills and takes out of this for\nFor that falling and sinful and rebellious nature that we inherited from from Adam\nIn God the Holy Spirit all by himself gives us a new nature nature that is to find a nature that normally a naturally loves God\nAnd the things I've got a new nature that craves the presence of God in nature that hunger and thirst after righteousness a new nature that six to God's will a new nature that enjoys following after God\nA nature that relishes the ways of God that hunger for truth that desire to understand God's word in the very same way that a baby desires to milk\nIt's a new nature that thrives on the straight and narrow path that hates seeing that naturally normally loves commandments of God\nGod sovereign Lee and super naturally miraculously and forcefully takes out of us the darkness of seeing and brings us into the marvelous light of God himself\nAnd we are changed we're transformed we are a new creation and that means we are not a better or an improved version of the same old man no no\nWe have been made we have made a those who have made a conscious decision to follow Jesus or a brand new creation that possesses a brand new nature and that's the nature that we did not possess before we were saved\nAnd we are now forever set free from the ... and the dictatorial and the dominating power that sentence they can head over our lives before we were saved\nBecause that is true for every single safe person who has ever are who will ever be truly say John says here\nThat we do not and we cannot and we will not continue to walk in the darkness we will not continue on in the sand that we had been saved from we will not continue to live our lives the same way we did before we were safe precisely because we don't want to precisely because we can't\nThe new nature will not allow it we no longer enjoy it we don't crave that we no longer have anything in common with darkness we no longer have any linkage our connection to that darkness we no longer have any fellowship with the darkest because we had been brought out of the darkness and into gods marvel the flight\nAnd we see the light of God being so infinitely better so much more infinitely enjoyable so much more glorious than the darkness\nThat there is no value at all in us remaining in the darkness or having anything at all to do with it and because that is true John says here that those who\nContinue to fellowship with the darkness in other words those who do not change those who continue to see value in the end and those who continue to fellowship with sand and those who are still enamored with CNN who take pleasure in St john's says those people are deceived about their salvation\nNoticed that he says they say their site and yet they continue to walk in the darkness they say they're said but it's not been truly born again they do not possess the new nature and so even though they afraid that even though they've gone through the motions there aren't any different than they were before they prayed\nAnd the proof of this is that they continue to love they're seeing and they remain under the terrible\nBondage in power sin and they enjoy it so John says here that the conversion is alive they're conversion is not real they're conversion is false these people lie to themselves and the proof of that if they do not practiced the truth\nAnd what that and that means that what that is the normal way that they live their daily lives is no longer holy\nUC salvation is about Jesus saving our souls it is our immortal souls which are said all of our sins have been forgiven in the wrath of guard against our sense has been forever averted from us and we spend the turn of tea in heaven with God when we die but God saved our souls and not our bodies\nAnd so even after we're said we still live in a body of fallen sinful flash that has not been converted and that has not been redeemed\nSense that the sand that dominated our souls now dominates our bodies and the divine curse it was against our souls is still on our bodies and no matter how old you might be you are in the process of dying\nAnd one hundred percent of those who are alive right now will die because salvation did not change anything at all about our flash\nAnd salvation did not alter the way or the fall and world and the system by which the world operates and salvation also did not rescue the devil\nAnd so even though our souls had been forever said we're still face with a free fold danger of the world and the flesh and the devil which continues right on in their fallen and sinful ways and that means that are safe souls living a central body\nWhich dwells in sinful world which is still dominated by falling arcane journal named ... named ... suffer Satan or the devil\nIs our new divine nature compels us to serve the lord among great temptation and great obstacles and great hindrance isn't great opposition\nAnd that is why we struggle we struggle against our flash we struggle against the world and we struggle against the walls of the enemy but we do not struggle alone and we should not struggle alone ever to struggle alone is to fail and so as we struggle we must struggle together which is why God gave the church\nAnd as we avail ourselves of God's word in prayer and fellowship and communion and all the other things that I talked about we will be far better off than if we do not avail ourselves of those things it's a John calls our daily walk with God in the fall of the world and with our fallen flesh was Satan a practice\nThat is the term that he uses which tells us that we must consciously do certain things and consciously not do other things if we are to be found faithful busy can fruitful\nFor the normal and natural walk of a truly born again believer does not lend itself to send even those seeing is ever present\nThe normal daily walk up a genuine believer does not lend itself to darkness even the darkness is all around us the normal daily walk of a truly regenerate sold does not lend itself to the world of the flash or the devil even though I truly regenerate solace constantly plague by all three of these\nSo like truly saved person will send yes but\nHe will quickly repent and follow Jesus I truly safe person will find himself captured in darkness but he will see that darkness and he will repaired and returned to the light\nA truly safe person will find themselves caught up in the world but he will be convicted of that\nAnd he will repaired and returned to the straight and narrow path so while sin periodically

not his practice\nBut at the same person is known by these things these things are his daily life these things are his practice because he's not said in the power seeing has never been broken from him

in humbly follow Jesus\nAs lord in mastering savior and king and father by doing what Jesus Says and by obeying what Jesus commands and by loving what Jesus loves and by hating what Jesus hey

profound than walking down in our filling out a card\nThis is not about the symbolism of a ritual ceremony is a call to a radical life of self less love\nAnd an eternal transformation from being

on justice Hank winds them Fox News\nFrom the men do Buick GMC studios [noise] this is talk going on for nine point and I urge radio station\nWelcome to the company piece radio broadcast the teaching ministry of pastor ... Bradley this program is dedicated to bringing you the glorious truth of God's word one verse at a time\nAnd John makes the amazing claim here that what Jesus told them the apostles wrote down\nAnd they wrote it all down so that they could proclaimed to us so that we would be safe than half true fellowship with the father and with the other apostles\nBecause John says here inverse strings that the apostles absolutely do have a correct fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ and the amazing statement that John makes here in verse three is if any of us ever plan on having a true incorrect fellowship with God if\nAny of us plans on being say that we must have a true incorrect fellowship with the apostles because John says here that the fellowship that the apostles have with the lord is true and correct\nAnd what that means to us it that there is no such thing as anybody having a true incorrect fellowship with Jesus Christ without also having a true incorrect fellowship with the apostles and what the apostles wrote in the Bible\nIn other words there is no such thing as anybody being outside of fellowship with the apostles and what they taught in the New Testament and yet having a true incorrect fellowship with Jesus Christ\nAnother way of saying this is that if we're walking in contradiction to what the apostle John and the other apostles taught in the twenty seven books of the new covering it than we must know that we do not have a true or correct fellowship with Jesus Christ\nAnd get another way of saying this is it one of the ways we know that we are said is to walk or live our lives in such a way as the apostle John rights here in this a pistol that if we are living contracts\nTo the way that John rights here or elsewhere in the sixty six books the holy Bible then we should be very concerned about whether we are saved and not simply deceived\nAnd looking at first John chapter one first for John said these things we ride so that our joy may be made complete\nJohn says that he writes the things contained in this episode for one reason one purpose that are joy may be may complete and that means that everything in this episode is designed to do one thing to produce in us the fullness of joy\nAnother way of saying this is it the overriding response to us being truly saved is joy\nJohn wants us to actually enjoy our salvation and thrive at being said and relish the new birth and the straight and narrow path\nAnd delight ourselves in the lord and the way that John intends for us to enjoy our salvation is to give us these ten test that you find in the ... so that we will not be deceived and simply think where said\nSo we can enter into this amazing joy so that the power of sand may be broken over our lives and we may be set free from our sinful natures and be born again and live our lives with abandon in this radical uh that Jesus gave to us all to the glory of God\nAnd look again at first John one first fine this is the message we have heard from him and announced to you that God is light and in him there is no darkness at all\nThis is the powerful radical life changing message that we have heard from Jesus personally and then we apostles John said wrote down in the pages of the New Testament that God is white and in God there is no dark and said oh\nGod it's like God is pure goddess endless God is pristine God is holy God is righteous\nGod is perfect God is the highest form of morality God is the highest expression\nObscurity got is the highest degree of love God is the highest form of living there is no world system no morality no way to live that even remotely measures up to the level of God's own personal character in nature\nThe perfect standard is not anything that man has developed but the perfect standard against which all of their standards are measured is God's own personal character in nature\nAnd God will judge and hold accountable all men against that standard which is against himself not other people\nJohn says there is no darkness of any sort in God none and that is very important statement because John then goes into five chapters to tell us exactly what that means\nJohn then explains it because God is why it has no darkness inhibit all their for every soul that it's in Jesus every soldier who was truly save every soldier who has truly been born again\nHas that very same nature inside of him as well\nLook what John first John one sick says if we say that we have fellowship with him Jesus Christ and yet walk in the darkness\nWe lie and do not practiced the truth\nThe apostle John and the other apostles understood something that we all need to try to grasp in our day because we're flash because we live in this world because our feelings are as follows are flash because our hearts or deceptively wicked because we are limited in our understanding and our knowledge is finite because we're human\nBecause we are not God we have an enormous capacity to be deceived about ourselves it is possible for humans to be very happy and very content\nAnd yet living Raul CNN and not be convicted are concerned about it in the least it is possible for people to be in blatant rebellion to God and not be worried about it it is possible for people to be standing on the very edge of eternal damnation and not even be moved\nAnd that means that no one is the best judge about himself no one is able to see himself as clearly as he needs to no one has the capacity to understand his own heart or his own motives\nSo since that is true God in his great mercy has given us several things that will help us to see ourselves fully incorrectly\nAnd the correct way to see ourselves as to see ourselves as God sees us and that is to see the truth about ourselves\nFor God has given to every single saved person these means these gifts\nTo help us to see ourselves he's given us the word of God\nThe holy Bible the scriptures he's given us the enrolling Holy Spirit who authored it responds and agrees with the Bible he's given us the church made up of imperfect people all striving to love Jesus through obedience and helping one another by holding each other accountable to the word of God in provoking one another to love and the good works\nBy proclaiming and teaching the word through the power the Holy Spirit he's given us prayer\nWhich brings us into God's presence in resets are bearings from being caught away by the world in the flesh and the devil he's given this times of godly fellowship with other believers and he's given us gifts slight communion and baptism which reminds us of what it took for us to be said and reminds us of our capacity to see an\nEnd of the great price that set us free\nGod gave us all these things so that by a failing our sales of them we would be strong in the lord and in the power of his mind and we would see ourselves as God sees us so that we will not be deceived about ourselves and actually be truly saved\nAnd here's why reverse six again if we say that we have fellowship with him and you walk in the dark as we lie and do not practiced the truth\nTrue salvation is not about simply praying a prayer and walking down in our raising your hand or being baptize are joining the church are adopting some moral code to live by no\nTrue salvation as a supernatural miracle were by God the Holy Spirit actually and literally comes to us while we are yet in our sins and while we are yet last and while we are doing as much as we can to serve Satan\nAnd to rebel against God and to run and hide from God and while we are not wanting this while we don't care anything at all about God while we're wishing that God would just leave us alone God the Holy Spirit comes at that moment\nTo us before we ask him to before we desire him too before we initiate anything at all towards him\nGod the Holy Spirit sovereign leave violates our will\nHe sovereign Lee interrupts our lives he's sovereign Lee inserts themselves\nInside of us he's sovereign Lee imposes himself on to us he forcefully opens are blind dies he gives us new eyes that see he forcefully an stops are deaf ears and allows us to hear\nHe forcefully goes inside of us and takes out of us as stony heart and he puts in place of that stony heart heart a flash that is able and willing to believe\nIn God the Holy Spirit all by himself without any cooperation from us at all gives us new spiritual life he read births us he regenerate sauce he destroys forever the domination that sand had over us\nAnd he kills and take out of us forever that fall and sinful and rebellious nature that we inherited from from Adam\nAnd God the Holy Spirit all by himself gives us a new nature\nA nature that is divine nature that naturally normally loves God and the things of God a nature that craves the presence of God a nature of the hunger and thirst after righteousness anew nature that six to God's will\nAnd nature that enjoys following after God a new nature there relishes the way of God a new nature that hunger for truth anew nature that desire to understand God's word\nIn the very same way that a baby desires to suck milk anew nature that thrives on the straight and narrow path\nA new nature that hates seeing in a new nature that naturally and normally loves the commandments of God\nGod sovereign Lee super naturally miraculously and forcefully takes us out of the kingdom of darkness and brings us into the marvelous kingdom of God in his lovely Christ and we changed we are now transformed we are now a

Bradley this program is dedicated to bringing you the glorious truth of God's word one verse at a time\nWhich we saw last time and versus ten three Seventeen this emits miracle of feeding the crowd is quantitative laid the largest miracle Jesus ever did\nIn the same time on the same day he's teaching and he's healing people and we also know that he was casting out demons as part of this so all of this explosion of miracles is going on on this particular day in addition to the singular miracle of this massive creating a food for Fifteen to twenty five thousand people\nAnd this is the culmination of Jesus his entire Galloway in ministry and it is that that combination that Luke transitions into this powerful and vital confession of faith\nSo this is a perfect time for a loop to say all of the evidence all of the proof all of the testimony is all the confirming signs and wanders then examined and there's nothing more that is needed to be proven about Jesus he is God Almighty and human flesh\nAnd based on all of this Jesus confronts the apostles with this amazing question who do people say\nAm and they gave him all the answers that unbelievers had developed about Jesus but then changed this gets very personal and he asked the apostles but who do you say that I Am\nAnd God the father sovereign look reveals to the apostles with Peter is the spokesman the one and only correct answer inverse twenty the Christ of God\nAnd so with this divine revelation the apostles have completed their theological education this is the final exam and they all made a perfect score they got this one right and this is still true for us today you might think you know the Bible and you might know history and you might have a lot of common sense\nBut if you don't know this one single answer he will never see haven't\nOnly those who know who Jesus is will enter into having now\nI Need to tell you though however that this that that that do in the flow of looks gospel this goes from the feeding the crowd directly to this question to the disciple these advanced don't follow each other chronologically\nThis moment with this question actually occurred later in time because there's an intervening period here in which Jesus went to the area of tire inside and and when she came back across the northern part of ... down into the eastern section known as the capital is\nWhich is a gentle area of about ten cities and he performed several miracles there and that means there were other things going on in between these events of the feeding of the twenty five thousand people and asking this question of who he was\nBut this was the culmination of his ministry in galley because tire inside and they're gentile territories into capitalist was outside galley\nAnd Jesus moves down towards ... where he is captured in tried and finally executed where he can be raised from the dead so\nThis moment here in ... nine is the culmination of his gallery and ministry and so evidently it seemed appropriate place for Dr Luke to bring in this divine confession by the apostles even though it actually occurred at a later time\nNow again to study this divinely revealed confession about who Jesus is much deeper I Would point to you that Sunday evening Bible as Matthew sixteen where I did a very in depth exit Jesus of this entire moment that I Believe I have copies of on the table in the back of the church\nAnd people always ask me why did ... did this why did he put advance out of their chronological order in his gospel record does this mean that something is wrong with the Bible\nWill no there's nothing wrong with the Bible Jesus actually did say these words but we have to understand that has got the Holy Spirit was moving upon Dr Luke to write this large gospel record the Holy Spirit inspired him to do it in this particular order\nSo this was not a mistake or an error or even a type of graphical mistake Dr Luke is writing at the moving of the spirit of God's who is superintendent this entire work of inspiration and an air and sea\nAnd all that was said at this moment is recorded elsewhere in great detail and so God the Holy Spirit chooses not to repeat every word in their fullest detail here and looks account he chooses the you moved\nTo the next event in the flow of looks emphasis and I think it is probably likely that one of the factors which caused Dr ... to do this is that he was already pressing the limits of a single scroll to contain everything that he wrote about the birth life ministry teaching death and resurrection and the ascension of Jesus\nRemembered that looks account is the longest gospel record it has the most words in it and it does press the capability of a single scroll to handle it all\nSo getting it all on one screw it would make it much more easily acceptable to the gym towel world which would not be helped by putting everything in this is why we have for gospel records we must know that look has events and statements in his record that the other three do not have\nSalute quote as he was moved along by God the Holy Spirit in while absolutely accurate his record is not the only one that we need to read\nAnd that is why at the end of his gospel record the apostle John makes this important comment there are many other things that Jesus did which if they were written in detail I supposed that even the world itself would not contained the books that were written\nThere were so many incredible stories so many incredible testimonies so many amazing miracles and all the stories that were surrounding those miracles than all the books of the world could not contain them all [noise]\nSo what you have all the gospel wreck records is a selection of all those true event say selection that each of the gospel riders material founded Matthew in mark was left out and some of the material that they left out ... put in\nSo it is important to know that the for gospel records do not in any way contradict one another they complement one another and between all four we get is full and as complete a picture is that is possible\nAnd just the same with the way the Holy Spirit is flowing I'm Dr look back and chapter eight versus twenty five ... begins moving toward\nThis compelling question of who Jesus is after Jesus it's still the storm on the sea of got only he asked where's your faith and Luke rights and they were fearful and amazed saying to one another who then is this that he commands even the winds and the water and they obey him\nAnd so here look introduces us to this question and we're being forced to answer the question who is this man\nWe've already heard the testimony of an angel and the whole host of haven't we've heard the testimony of Zacharias we've heard the testimony of ... in simian we've heard the testimony of Satan\nWe've heard the testimony of demons we've heard Jesus his own confession about himself we've already heard and read all of that along with all of the confirming signs and wanders in miracles and now comes the time to really nail this issue down\nSo we look eight verse twenty five he begins to surface the question who is this man in his chapter nine begins\nIt comes from wicked king Herod haired said inverse nine I myself had John beheaded but who is this man about who might hear such things\nSo we are being led to this question that has got to be answered and then inverse Eighteen we see that Jesus was praying alone and he comes to the disciples any questions them saying who did the multitude say that I Am\nAnd finally inverse twenty Jesus Says okay that is what others say about me but who do you say that I Am and now we get the only correct answer the Christ of God\nDr Luke wanting to come straight to the answer to this question because as far as salvation is concerned and where we're going to spend eternity this is the only question that mattered back then\nAnd this is the only question that matters today as far as salvation goes if you do not know who Jesus is correctly nothing else matters your last so the only question that really matters is who is Jesus\nNow all that I said so far is my introduction and even though I'm not going to finish this today I can now start to do my ex position of preaching about the passage that is before so let's look again at verse Eighteen\nLuke wrote and it happened while he was praying alone the disciples were with him and he questioned them saying who did the people say that I Am\nI noticed that look begins the section by saying and it happened or came about and both are grammatically correct from the original Greek\nAnd the way he says this indicates to us that there has been a transition from what just finished inverse Seventeen to what is about to happen now\nAnd we know from the other gospel riders than actuality there's been a very linked the trends that transition of several weeks if not months in which Jesus has gone to tire inside and then down to the capital is before this moment arrives so verse Eighteen occurs after that sequence of time\nAnd ... makes it a point to tell us that this severe about the divine confession occurs after Jesus was praying alone\nAnd even though many would just pass right by this this really matters because there are seven times that looks gospel that he mentions about Jesus praying alone seven times Luke emphasizes Jesus his own personal prayer time and his own personal communion and fellowship and dependence on the father\nAnd she flew through this gospel record starting a chapter six verse twelve you're going to see this again and again and again seven times and many of those times it was an all night prayer meeting others were early in the morning praying to the father was an absolutely critical event in the life of Jesus\nConsistent pro long times in the presence of God his father\nAnd remember that Jesus was not preying on his own behalf\nBut there was nothing in his life that needed to be brought before God to be altered our straightened out there was no Santa transgression that was needing to be forgiven\nJesus was and he is God he has no say in to be forgiven for he did not fail God ever you'd never even had a bad attitude not even for a millisecond", "city": "Moss Point", "locations": [["W.
