cable news never my for the highlights I get the clips but I don't I don't actually sit there and watch Fox\nNews or CNN heaven forbid and MSNBC or CNN can't watch it because I don't know who's doing

I'm just\nCNN I don't know who does 'cause that's\nOn watch all the people who hate Trump right yeah I guess the only reason I ever turn any of that stuff on a sort of the show you know because we're supposed to be aware of it right and do you do that occasionally but I certainly I\nIf I was not in this business I don't know why I Would bother with any of that oh I wouldn't I Would have been to

on this morning\nAnd Lieberman is like you know sort of hers but he's like you know\nHe didn't go there to help with today is the first question was ah you know what about the what's going on you know give us your opinion and he's like you know look I live in a country as a Jew where I was basically anti Semitism free my entire life I ran for president and senator\nI I was I was a winning center in a state with two percent Jewish population and uh I never felt them in anti Semitism my entire life\nHe he's like you know we have to make sure that we don't we don't have that blah blah blah this is a terrible tragedy then they're like well what\nWhat what part of of that you think is is the the climate of today and and and and Lieberman to his credit was like look first of all we need to make very clear that this shooter\nA outwardly hated Donald Trump\nYeah with a lot like Donald Trump he was not a fan of Donald Trump or has nothing to do that don't tie him to be a ... more broadly we do have this problem with with with discourse and I think that's true I mean I I think that's obviously true that the overall our discourse is pretty terrible at the moment\nBut again has nothing to do with this and all these cable news networks are ... that\nWere telling you that it does mhm they're obsessed with telling your wife well\nWe don't want us to blame it on a do Trump I'm just saying it's Donald Trump's fault\nRight [laughter] that's really is really that's what they're doing never said that about Bernie Sanders Bernie than ever that guy was working for Bernie Sanders' campaign and he went out and he shot\nAll of the geo ... and another guy and tried to try these trained to kill thirty Republican seat that's tenth of the republic and was working for Bernie Sanders yeah never said that was Bernie Sanders fault\nNo we never said that and neither did I say and either do today yes of course not but they didn't even talk about it because they had a very balanced view of that one\nFor a understood that individuals who are responsible for their own actions that time that's right he understood that then they just don't understand it now because now which is not benefit them in and they always complain about this course isn't that a great example of terrible discourse yes we can sit on both of these things right when if a Republican and now the python think thing thankfully didn't get anybody hurt\n'em but you know we did see that ah with with the Bernie Sanders situation\nBut both situations we said the individual is responsible the discourse is is is an interesting aside because overall it's not healthy for a country but it's got nothing to do with these individuals shootings and I'm going to do with it and you do not ... discourse does not commit murder doesn't happen\nSo the reason why Rob ... pad in this morning is because uh you know he he sees doing more on trivia and uh and pour a trivia is that is always a laugh and so we wanted to find out how it went on friday a pet uh\nNo I'm not going to apologize to you know you know me you know me well enough to know that when I'm never going to end on that one\nIn fact repeat it ah it consistently gets repeated and it was fabulous and again it was you know I wanted to call for so many times and that just made me just pick up the phone and say hallelujah\nWell thank you thank you so

I think it Sunday yeah it's going back to accomplish tour by the way for the ticket and the details on we're going to be ...\nIt's going to be fun there's a lot of elections stuff to talk about ... ah ah stuff you were given gift from the gods as far as serial goes the the nation's turned completely insane so it makes the comedy fairly easy\nYes that it does\nAnd a Pittsburgh we've got something special for you we're going to have lapse in in comedy but uh also uh I Am taking all of the uh proceeds from the I'm from the event\nAnd um we're giving them to\nI'm not sure if we're going to give them to the synagogue or to or to\nThe uh the refugee um oh yeah a group I'm not sure we are going to give him too yet but we're we're\nUh we're we're standing with uh Israel um and uh so the proceeds to your tickets or will be going um\nTo a a local Jewish\nUm center perhaps the the synagogue and I'm not sure but not stance from an anti Semite like why would you do that when you hate Jews so much um I notice you went back and forth to get a little issue with a reporter from GQ this weekend oh did I ah Julia something or other said\nThat she was a she's a little upset about this and basically blamed anyone who's ever ... uh criticized I think it was George Soros she meadow\nA and I remember and you came back after this is you know completely ridiculous like it's nothing to do with that like we you know and then she posted\nHere's an example of supporting the Jewish people\nAnd posted a clip of one of your criticism of one Jewish person George Soros\nOr as as an example of how much you hate the Jews now I did respond because I found an example of you are supporting the Jewish people as well when you want the defender of Israel aboard a that was I thought that's really national award one of the highest um ... most prestigious awards for someone defending the Jewish people cry but beyond that uh it was just\nIt was just presented by the the prime minister of Israel though\nWell that's it [laughter] okay that's not a big one that I got a big one so it's just amazing\nYou know 'cause this is not just a criticism of you and it's not just this one dopey reporters all over the place and this idea that if you criticized George Soros\nThat you are an anti Semite is completely insane if you are a ... a conservative and\nThe people in this audience I Would sleep all would fall into this category many of them would criticize drug stores but they criticize him because he's a liberal or progressive policies he supports a policy that we disagree with so we're criticizing him more rounded him to be dangerous all around the world around the world he has a very shady history\n... around the world that but anti Semite patriarch source to ... in some ways there are things in common there however they don't like him because he's a Jew or the way they don't\nLike been Shapiro because you have written weight Shapiro deporting the policies you know like I don't understand racism I mean you can get to know people in hate them for a valid reason [laughter] you know like Karl Marx I don't like Karl Marx he was Jewish I don't like him not because he was a Jew\nOh but because he came up with the idea of communism I\nI'm not a bad no not a fad and the ... like you're in these liberals have never criticized Bennett Shapiro before\nIs that because they're anti Semite which because they don't like what Ben Shapiro said they will love what ... they would love Ben Shapiro he was a liberal and they don't like him because he's a conservative is this distinction difficult for people can you really\nNot understand I mean we all know they cannot do it and I it's not they all under state it they're just trying to use this to make it look like conservatives are anti Semite\nWe you're telling me the way the uh you know Sheldon Adelson right\nHere's a guy who is one of the biggest financier the Republican Party have you ever seen a word of criticism for liberals about him of course you have does that make them anti Semitic what it does not it does not you can criticize just like when they criticize Clarence Thomas or they rape\nNo they don't like Clarence Thomas this legal opinion because they don't support what they believe it's about ... ... trying to make these into cartoon arguments which is such a a ...\nI Can't just be another sample of horrible discourse yes they complain about how bad Donald Trump has made the discourse you're calling everyone who's criticizing the main liberal or progressive funder in America\nYou're killing everyone who does that an anti Semite how that possibly in the realm of positive discourse it's completely a disingenuous and they know it is they know it's not true and they go on television and they say anyway in this time in the middle of a tragedy they\nSay it anyway because they don't care\nThat is that that is exactly what they they they claim to be again and they do it every day wow

suspicious package I'm Dave Anthony Fox News intercepted this morning in Atlanta addressed to CNN\nThis is the man accused in fourteen other pipe bomb mailings goes to court today in Miami where Fox's Evan brown is live\nForce them to go early to get all the activists out and they could have them go and you know go pass out you know go take down Ted Cruz signs or whatever the heck they're they're they're a volunteers are doing on that particular day but there's an interesting way of looking at this we talk a lot about a district that have changed\nFrom Obama to Trump people who voted for Obama and then change to Trump\nAnd there's the other side of that in people who voted for Romney and changed Clinton and there's an interesting ... a breakdown ... there were a let's see if the Thirteen districts that voted for Mitt Romney and two thousand twelve\nAnd then voted for Hillary Clinton in two thousand and six team so two thousand twelve on average squirting FiveThirtyEight had about an eight point advantage for Romney\nAnd two thousand sixteen it was a five point advantage for Democrats\nSo what what are we closer to I think it's interesting to see where we are when it comes to the polling as of right now\nUh we have about a to point advantage for Democrats in those states so if you look at it kind of ... to summarize those kind of lost three points are well well the three point Democrats have lost three points from two thousand six to ... less passionate didn't\nTwo dozen sixteen but a big big move from two thousand twelve got it so they're kind of in the middle but leaning towards the Democratic way they voted in two thousand correcting now they were Twenty one districts that voted for Iraq Obama and then voted for Donald Trump Twenty one\nOr so in two thousand twelve with Rocco bomb on they had about a six point advantage for Democrats for Obama\nOr in two thousand sixteen that swung from all the way back to seven points Republican for Donald Trump so it's a huge swing there\nIs that you would think of these real swing districts so far polling is showing that leaning to the Democratic side by five and a half points but it's big it's a big change so and that was that's almost equal to where they were voting and roam around ...\nSo if you look at that the people who were voted for a bomb and then switched to Trump are kind of back to the position where they were voting for Iraq Obama\nWhen Romney or the people who voted for Romney then went to Clinton they're in between those two positions but leaning towards Clinton [noise]\nThat's where these districts show up there is also five states where this is a where this occurred\nFive state of Florida Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin where they voted for all bronco Obama than change to Trump\nIn the Obama election that had about five pointed vantage for Obama and those states in the Trump election there was about to point advantage for Trump\nRight now those states are showing eight twelve point advantage for Democrats at least you know now that part of that it's it's a little bit different than what you would say in the house where they're broken up into little areas and there's so many candidates and their up all the time\nWhere this is some of these races are just they're so popular Democrats already Pennsylvania is a good example of that where they have been just a big lead\nOr not because I don't think it's necessarily solely because of some switch like soldiers ... tell me what all this means\nFrom last week or the Democrats making is is the momentum started just starting to swing back towards the Democrat\nI Would say doesn't tell you much about the Senate but it's I think it does tell you something about the house which is\nThere was that I Hope that there'll be some movement in the house towards Republicans these numbers aren't showing that I mean it right now it seems like the Democrats will take the house uh and the Republicans look pretty solid and the Senate right now when will\nWe see any movement at all are due to the shooting and the bombing\nWell the polling wouldn't even start probably if you want real polling reaction that at

it's not easy work this is a this is not there is heavy um and we move an awful lot of it and uh and it's hot as hell and mobile\nAlabama yeah and the beer sales and the heat have a lot to do with one another tell me about how whether you influences beer sales obviously are pretty day on the beach you're\nGoing to want to drink or perhaps one or two more than you normally would but if you have let's say I'm going to make this up a really really rainy July\nWiping tears from your eyes how are their numbers show that weather and beer consumption or in a route into brutally related\nAbsolutely we keep up with a heat or the you know the temperature in the in the rain and all that I've I've got a little Google dot sheet that goes back six years and we look at it day by day\nUh to say what was the weather over the last few years leading up to this holiday and why do we sell and uh God is the greatest or worst fear salesman and the history of the world\n[laughter] but somebody so you need to do is pay off the weatherman\n[laughter] if they would quit rolling up their sleeves the head of a little bit of a rainy weekend we would be doing much much better\nYeah no kidding well sort of the summer months are heavily influenced what about the winter months is there any correlation between whether in consumption in the wintertime\nYeah absolutely and you know if if if we can have some of those mild winter weekends that or you know sunshiny and\nUh um our markets an outdoor market people around here like to get out and do something so we sell a lot of cans and uh\nUm and we're really really um I'm dependent upon the whether we have a pretty weak and we're going to sell beer we have a bad week and it's not going to do as well\nSo our other markets across the nation similarly is depending if I were to go to Phoenix which is hot and dry a I Would suspect that their their beer cereals more flashes that way to say\nWhere all you know ... possibly I I tell ya\nBut then there's other places like up in Minnesota where they get ten feet of snow and and they sell more beer per capita than any other state are you there like number three in the country or something ridiculous like that yeah um so so that's a yes or no answer I Know but that's the best I Know how to get it\nI have talked to people who do this thing called ice fishing oh that is a drinking boondoggle was what that is we are going ice fishing yeah I think all in their ice rink downtown again [laughter] ... and a little hut on a lake\nWith a little tiny hole in the eyes in a line in it and seven hundred cases of beer and mayor for themselves man you Michael [laughter]\nFilms or uh some things about you grew up in the work that you do I'm interested in the evolution Z or you're going through as the president of the company as the market changes as the employee demands changes your needs to find employees change\nHow are you staying kind in motivated in doing what you do\nAn ad I I'm\nStaying current and I'm In a in a peer group there about a dozen other folks who did the same thing we do and uh and we get together twice a year and it's a an an idea sharing group and uh we we uh we play off of each other share some great ideas that's a really good operators in this thing and\nUm I've I've learned more from just being around people who do what I Do a than any other place\nAre you reading things that help\nYeah I mean you know always always trying to ah ah to pick up some ideas um I'm from a whole bunch of different places but um you know the the the motivation really probably comes from the life as as as much as anything bind Bonnie keeps me pretty well motivated well\nYou talked also about it being a family business you talked about you not wanting to be one that messes it\nI'm I'm sure there's motivation in there as well\nYeah you can believe that\nUh um yeah there there is you know and and and the family business aspect comes in I mean I have a Thirteen year old boy who are just had his first summer of work are here um the warehouse floor sweeping up and a re packaging damage beer and that kinda stuff so um you know that's that's that's pretty neat from\nMe answer this question for me or finish the sentence rather I couldn't do my job without mini naps\n[laughter] uh no I I\nI couldn't do this job without 'em down some of these folks that I work with um you know Katherine Bradley are controller\nAmazing Lisa Williams a chart just incredible Theresa my right hand\nI'm I'm ... I'm surrounded by people who are really really smart and good at what they do which allows me to be you know sort of\nThe ... which is okay but once you go out and make [laughter] that's right because they can fix it bosses made another ... and they know about this one one thing I'd change about my job is ... [noise]\nYou know being in this business this is the greatest business in the world um I I Can't I Can't even imagine doing anything else and in ... but they're the definite clear downside is is uh the abuse of the product um this is\nThis is not selling ground beef this is not selling you know I'm a rice and beans\nAre product is one that can bring great great joy and an enhanced life um you know in in in wonderful ways but there's also a downside when it when it's abused and and I I read the stories like everybody else and I have a family like everybody else and that hurts\n[noise] how do you celebrate with your team around here\nUm well a whole bunch of different ways small and in a small and\nBig we uh we we just celebrated a few months in a row and and ah you know did the barbeque thing in a few beers uh that's that's a pretty regular water around here and then we've done bigger stuff to like we uh we we took our management team to Costa Rica building a building homes for folks down there\nTell me more about that I mentioned that to me in the past and it's\nBeen a remarkable story well hooked up with a group by a code ... with a mission and homes of hoping they build homes um in in just these incredibly impoverished communities around the world\nAnd we ended up going down to Costa Rica to fifty of our managers and their spouses and um went down there spent I guess two days on the build and um you know changed the lives of two families down there and in this this very very poor community but\nChanged the lives of a lot of our people too and that was that was a part of a celebration and you know team building and that kinda thing and um it's it's one that sticks with you did you say fifty people yeah fifty people\nThat's right so you're a company of a hundred and fifty people twenty foreign managers ... found us exactly or at a big percentage of the workplace was going to go build homes in Costa Rican yesterday and we're still paying for it [laughter]\nIs that where you're going no one on one for is what a significant investment in a celebration as well as our certain there's some sort of\nI don't know if it would ever be referred to this team building component to that sure\nWell that's that's that's what it was really about celebrating and and um you know bringing people together working together outside of this business and in a way that was really meaningful it's exactly what it did\nBut you know up a part of that too comes from the family business aspect of this thing and the fact that because we are a family business we have a different we have a different arc uh\nWhen do we think of the timeline of our business you know we're sticking multigenerational we're not ... necessarily thinking quarter to quarter [noise] um so when you're doing that you get to think about things in your people a little bit differently\nYeah no kidding and um it's a remarkable story in a generous\nGenerous thing from you or you said you're still paying for it I don't know if that was true or not true but it's an incredible story nevertheless so the next time any one of the listeners walk down the beer oil what do you want them to see what I Would lie for them\nTo see as a bowl bud and Bud Light and ... and all of our products full and cold and ready for them to grab one and by yet\nSo just simply recognize the brands and take some of them home with that's exactly right and enjoy\nAnd enjoy it ought to be years yes places\nDon't abuse Chris are pretty sure your turn it's an interesting thing are driven by this warehouse or this this distribution sooner rather many times it's nice to know what's going on around here folks you're listening to what's working with about ... years the president of Budweiser Bush distributing company\nTalking about the challenges they face as well as the opportunities around the corner will have another show next week to gear up a good week [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] from ... studios here

you can do the exact price you pay for next car so it was a true car to enjoy more confident ... experience\nThis chiefs team kind of feels for real there's something different here and I would totally agree I mean listen last year they started five and then they cratered and lost six or seven before rebounding late to win four straight and\nJust wonder my only question I'm going to give the chiefs you know one of those spots that when the super bowl their team that can but\nWe've seen ... homes you know in baseball you go once it was the order and you mow down everybody in your feeling good okay the the hitters they're picking up some things maybe second time through the order you give up a couple of ... and then the third time you get lit up\nI Do wonder and it starts this weekend have we seen enough among homes can defenses adjust after seven weeks of getting killed by pat ... homes are they going to adjust well we'll see what Andy Reid will do\nI think the chiefs of one of the four teams that can win the super bowl now the other two the patriots dish don't argue with me folk we know in September\nThey use it as kind of a pre season to fine tune things go wrong is going to bat return and he's going to get back\nMonday Night against the bills Julian Edelman healthy\nI think they've scored over thirty points in each of the last like four games they're back so it's the patriots the chiefs the rams and the other team you know they didn't start out consistent\nBut man right now they are mowing down people and that's the New Orleans say uh I I thought last week's game if you guys watch that closely I thought Sean Payton coached the best game of the NFL season okay they didn't I don't think ... point until late in the second quarter\nOn the road against the best defense in the NFL he made adjustments made some tweaks and remember the region to not allow the fourth quarter I'm Sorry the second half touched down the season\nThe saints had two in the fourth quarter to on the road now I Know just in Tucker missed the extra point or we go to Jean overtime but what I saw from the states was a consistent effort they didn't start out consistently on the but now we've seen it the sample sizes bigger I think the same\nI think they can win the Superbowl I think they're right there with the ... the patriots and the rams now\nBefore I get to a and I want to I Want to play the walk off home run called here for a second uh for the Dodgers Red Sox game will play that on one second but I just want them I Know some people out there are going to be like well what does that Jason ... what about the chargers was LA Chargers ... well listen\nI haven't seen the consistency yet they beat up on a lot of bad deems\nWe saw an inconsistent effort last week in a London against Tennessee wait and see what the chargers still wait and see what the Houston Texans\nStill wait and see with Cam Newton and the Panthers and then the two teams that I think are closest to getting in that upper echelon or the Steelers who've been there before let me see them put it on the browns beat them convincingly not another five turnovers Big Bend\nAnd of course the Minnesota Vikings we we know they started slow\nStarting to rebound but if you look at the injury report the Vikings are beat up this week if they're able to come out\nAnd pull off his victory against they they'll get in that upper echelon so lot of interesting NFL stuff and just remember that you're not consistent until you're good now can we play the Dodgers walk off call from last night the Eighteen

Rondo when the starting lineup I don't really think it matters as much now the closing line up is what matters because the Lakers were in that game against the rockets with about\nFive minutes left seven minutes left as a one point game\nAh the Lakers were in that game against the spurs now Rondo was suspended for that one and uh they were in that game in Portland it was a one point game or like four or five minutes left so the closing line up at ... needs to focus on I think you guys have it wrong alright\nComing up next year on the big lead Fox Sports radio\nI got to say I know a lot of people out there are backing\nWhat Jerry Jones did bring in and I'm Ari Cooper dude I if folks just wait a minute I just think logically about this okay you know the phrase short term gain long story short term pain\nLong term gain well it goes both ways and that applies to the American portrayed we'll talk about that next but first\nHere's Isaac low impossible latest toward Jaycee said it was a mere seven hours in two minutes ago that the Dodgers in Red Sox were battling\nIt at the bottom of the Eighteenth ending in game three of the world series when max monthly the Dodgers came to the plate with Joe Buck at the microphone on Fox [laughter]\nGod\n\nEighteen innings seven hour twenty minutes ethic was the longest game in World Series history and Red Sox now lead the series two games to one game for tonight at eight o nine eastern there's report presented by true car hotline car shopping can be confusing none anymore\nWithdrew fresh drew car now you know the exact price you pay for your next car so it was a true car to enjoy more confident car buying experience [noise]\nNBA friday night Kevin Iran scored forty one and Madison Square garden in golden state's twenty eight point victory over the next\nTo ramp scored twenty five in the fourth quarter out scoring the Nixon the period by himself and Milwaukee may nineteenth threes thirty point where the Minnesota the bucks five ... for the first time since Nineteen Seventy two here the deer and a half the bacteria they you Isaac [noise] uh back\nYou're on the big lead Fox Sports radio I Am your host Jason mcentire coming to you live from the Geico Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on par insurance with guy go\nGo to guy go duck comical one eight hundred nine four seven auto the only our part figuring out which way is easier hey ah Isaac interesting thing ah talking about the Milwaukee Bucks there so I'm doing my first fantasy basketball yes I back in fantasy for the NBA first time in years huh\nAnd I miss the beginning of the draft because I was watching Ozark with my wife and and we weren't paying attention so I start getting ... where are you the draft started\nAnd for some reason I auto picked Younis as the first big overall I spent like Seventy seven dollars I was like oh my gosh there goes my team I got no chance\nYacht us has been dominant and I'm just rolling through the first week it's a pretty listen I I didn't realize this but John us he just does everything blocks steals we know he's a great player and the top ten guy in the league but for fantasy basketball is amazed\nOh he's a he's one of the best values overall in all of fantasy sports when you think about his versatility\nOoh that's all I Know that's a hot take all of fantasy sports so I don't play fantasy baseball\nUm and I will say this listen I don't know how much people talk fantasy sports on the radio but I got a guy at the big league covers media Ryan glass and he's great he does a great job by the way why yeah hopefully ... a lot of stories very inside yeah Europe ... hearing that nice how nice of you to say a Isaac\nBut he's been telling me that there should be more fantasy discussions on television and radio and here's why because women don't necessarily gamble\nBut they will play a lot of fantasy sports and if you could do a fantasy minute every day at such and such time we're a fantasy football segment Buddhist starred Hooters dude who to pick up on the waiver wire where are you guys again and I know this wasn't on our our list of topics but it just hit me like\nDo you do you do a lot of ... I Love it I I and when you brought up famously basketball it makes me happy 'cause you're a fellow degenerate like me I [laughter]\nI I enjoy all fantasy sports although I have I I might be doing with baseball for a little bit now because it's a little bit too long ago this season but um yes I Am absolutely all in on fantasy content and are interesting you know maybe we can do something here as\nWell um yeah that's possible fantasy a fantasy updates we'll see yeah look let's put it on the list of things to do um however I Want to give quickly to the uh Mari Cooper trade this week\nAnd I know people who are out on the cowboys like the America's Team stuff that seems to be over right they're they're not America's ... nobody really cares about the cowboys at this point they're just not as interesting as they used to be his IQ you'll Eliot his tone down his act a lot remember he was like\nMr up in the club all hanging out with the ladies will once\nHad that incident that he got suspended for and I should add that was such a terrible suspension by the NFL sorry it was just bad like when the NFL's lead investigator said yeah we shouldn't suspend them the evidence here is kind of flimsy and they suspend them anyway you know it's a bad suspension but I digress\nThe cowboys has gotten kind of boring good at home stink on the ... you're not good and the you're consistent\nOh they're not consistent so what was interesting was after the eagles last Sunday\nAnd then the cowboys also blew a game in Washington it was still like well they didn't lose any ground and I feel like Jerry Jones kinda sorta panicked because he pulled the trigger on a trade\nFor a Mari Cooper now in top off the top your edge like oh I'm Ari Cooper that's when it was the first round pick out Alabama great player pump the brakes\nThis is the guy who had a high dropout rate he's had dropped passes have been a major issue for a Mari Cooper he's very talented the highlight reel if you just go to YouTube and look up I'm Ari Cooper highlights that the raiders you're like wow this guy can play well there's no doubt\nHe can play he is just a drop machine and then the bigger picture emerges and I said\nThe cowboys made a short term gain and they're going to experience some long term pain here this is not in the big picture a good deal now the opposite is true\nFor the raiders and John good they're going to go through a lot of short term pain but in the long run trading a little Mac\nTrading Omari Cooper long term game now I Know you guys know about this in life you know I like to use just um analogy where you're getting an argument with your wife and you know you're right\nBut she's beginner hills in and there's a there's a point where you ... it just clicked you're like I I got to stop I got a letter had this round you win this round\nWin the battle but I Want to win the war so I'm just going to concede and pull that you've got to play the I'm not saying he played games with your wife but this is real life like sometimes you got to just pull back because of the bigger picture and I think John ... well our team stinks\nWe need to get rid of some players were not going anywhere marsh John Lynch is now in the eye are by the way thank you to my fantasy team march on lunch for nothing and if you look at the big picture they're not good now there probably won't be very good next year but ah they have three first round draft picks next year\nJohn doing as a ten year contract they're going to Las Vegas in two years this is clearly a tear down for\nJohn good and and I didn't love the ... trade\nBut I guarantee you in two years we'll be looking at this being like oh this is a good move for grown now on the flip side Jerry Jones\nI just think long term this is a disaster folks ... we talked about it all summer this is the year for jak Prescott if ... good he gets a big contract but\nIf he gets a big contract how are you going to pay the Marcus Lauren\nHow are you going to pay in a couple of years ... how are you going to pay a Mari Cooper he's done a rookie deal for now but he's going to want to get paid you can't franchise tag everybody\nAnd some of these bombs\nAnd at the beginning I didn't really notice it and then my wife's like yeah I'm\n... every woman is trying to do the sexy thing here\nAre some of the interesting outfits I saw someone who is Ruth Bader Ginsburg obviously she wasn't sexy Ruth Bader Ginsburg Supreme Court and her husband dressed up as Brett Kavanaugh [laughter] ah the guy who got I'm simply because [noise] um yeah I Know it was what he had like a hat with like beer\nAnd whatever it was it the other day I Will he did have a gamble yeah there was uh what else do we see Steve Nash would there the hall of fame or he was dressed up as one of the cobra chi\nOr from karate kid it was a pretty good outfit a there was a guy who dressed up as the new Jurassic Park here oh what's his name Chris oh ... ... yes and then his partner was uh the group to read from that movie\nUm who's very attractive and of course she was the sexy Jurassic Park girl uh what else did I see I saw an up pretty woman Julia Roberts the one the hooker Julia Roberts from early in that movie where she was wearing nothing\nThere was a there was well [laughter] the the sexy flight attendant was immensely popular um I think I felt like to want to be scarlet Joe Hansen's like where they got the wig\nAnd it was like the scarlet Johanson yoga teacher in that he's not that into you have you seen that movie did not know that one first of all it's

means you probably should have gone to Geico dot com Fifteen minutes ago right so quickly wanted to touch on this Jimmy Butler situation in Minnesota so all of a sudden this week I don't know if you guys noticed it out of the blue because it had kinda\nWeek or ten days rockets offering for first round pick\nAnd you're like well and that that can't be real the rockets are not that stupid\nYou know the last team to gave up that many picks was the net in that cagey or Paul Peirce steel and of course the nets are still paying the price for that and of course the Celtics potential dynasty that they have\nI mean it's being built on the back of one free so there's no I just don't buy that deal but I Do wonder\nIf one team floated it and the team I'm guessing is the timber wolves because they got to get Jimmy Butler out of town I think they've got to get him curled Anthony town who looked like he was on the verge of stardom last year\nIs a train wreck your now of course there were rumors I don't want to dive too deep into this 'cause it's unfounded that correlate the town's was dating a woman\nAnd then the woman allegedly broke up with them and then the woman was spotted like in Europe with Jimmy Butler so there there's something happened in the locker room because towns is a train wreck Wiggins is mysteriously hurting now and they got smoked last night by thirty\nThirty by the book they were not even competitive\nI actually wonder if the Houston Rockets act you know they really wanted that or are they seeing whoa wait a second or ... thirty three he's always hurt James ...

V.\n\nYour [noise]\nWe don't have either one asked that paper clip that you carry your money and how many do have the the paper clip money system go or they just have a money 'cause you don't actually have a wallet\nStarting to run into more and more of those people and they're starting to look like a better idea\nBut I digress you if you have a financial situation not quite sure what to do that is what this shows for that is what Gregory is for the guy across the table from me that they can do is to act back right now he's a hall of fame financial advisor\nAnd this is his jam he just loves

call or text via the winning it life at downloaded apps absolutely free and if you can get that question in that text and we'll we'll get you an answer before the end of the show so go download the winning it life at\n\nOkay a quick point to just do you want to jump in there before I Do this ... thing I Want of stateless ... date them on that\nA pharmaceutical cries so we we are unintentionally apolitical show sure we have our own opinions but we try and keep them off the show and keep politics off the show as much as possible however\nOne overlaps with things that directly affect your wallet when things that affect not just you've with other people in our audience that you might not be on prescriptions but a lot of people are\nAnd a lot of people will be\nA so Trump had a little announcements on the twenty fifth let's just say Thursday but\nI'm so he he wanted to covers three things he has a three pronged approach to lowering prescription drug prices and according to him he's already done two of them and then he's on his third now\nAnd it's great that he comes out and tells us because the news is always so infatuated with the the outrage of the week that a lot of this stuff is going on under the radar so the first thing he talked about is ah the approval rate of generics and that is one of the things\nThat brings drug prices down when a new drug gets invented the FDA gives the company that invented it basically a government mandated monopoly for a small period of time so they can make their money back in without that than there would be no profit so no money would go into developing new drugs and we wouldn't have any new drug so the profits very important\nThe problem that we have though is that monopoly keeps getting extended of they're like well we tweak the formula so we get a new extension where we treat the formulas will give us a new extension well that's obviously just some corporate ...\nWent on and and the drug companies are paying off their buddies into the political process to keep that gravy train going Well Donald Trump says that in his first year they\nAre so much soften the regulations on the requirements for generics that uh the approval process shot through the roof they approved a record number of generics last year there on pace to break that record this year and I can see why the drug prices would go down\nAnother thing he's done to address this the second prong is two bills but they both do the same thing it's sort of like a it's called the patient right to know act one of 'em deals with pharmacies one of them deals with Medicare Medicaid and and government\nInsurance and what happens is if these drug companies give a pharmacy a sweetheart deal on their medication\nThey they are putting gag orders and saying your pharmacist now that we're giving you this discount can't offer other cheaper alternatives\nWell that's illegal now\nAre there was to build it took care of that they've already been signed a past sign and they're about to be an act it soon enough so that's already done this week he announced the third prom and that is on the drug prices initiatives doing something about the disparity in costs between what the drug sales for here in in foreign countries\nWhere taking aim at the global free loading that forces American consumers to subsidize lower prices in foreign countries through higher prices in our country and I've seen that for years and I never understood\nSame company same box same pill made in the exact same location or you go to some countries and it would be twenty percent the cost of what we pay and in some cases much less than that and I say\nWhy is this I never knew that I Would be able to stand here before you and have a chance to fix it and that's why we're doing we're fixing it\nYeah well I'm I'm a little worried about this one because if they do this wrong this could screw things up the other two problems on the approach I wholeheartedly applaud I just need to see more details but how the Saturday you Gregory is that really a big deal of difference in cost between what we pay hearing in another country\n\nA lot of variables and that between what's here and uh and another country or the rules are different uh home quality of what you get elsewhere and that's even when it's manufactured overseas so\nIt's not quite that simple\nRight and and I I agree there's so many different variables that there is that the question is okay I I Would like to see the disparity come\nBe closed a little bit\nBut the big question is how are you going to do it if you're going to do it by deregulating the\nPharmacy industry here and are lowering barriers to get things to market and making the prices go down in America that way that's cool but if you're going to make a law that forces companies to charge the same thing here that they charge and a third world country well that's not going to work out good for us\nSend him saying does that make sense it at a ... and all I can say is it's very complicated you would want to speed up process uh", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "27", "locations":

N. T. M. and Ninety nine five FM the dragon mobiles these headlines coming up in ten minutes before we get to the news headlines when a welcome back to Gulf Coast mornings NBC fifteens Darwin singleton Darwin welcome back\nOn Monday morning to cooler out there this morning ... much appreciate it yes yes yes yes [noise]\nAre you guys have been chatting this morning already I Know we have a state this morning about the ah Murphy high school students in mobiles who was bullied on line for homecoming the way she looks\nYeah you all heard about this we absolutely\nHave in fact um I Know what I Know is that she went to the homecoming day it's Eddie Murphy her name was Laura that she left demands a after forty five minutes apparently people warming to her in the day and so they did they also bully her online Darwin\nApparently they did a there'd been some terrible things said about our main show for it you know how they'll post these things because they really\nHave no self confidence in themselves that so much easier to do it on line you know [noise] but apparently she did face some of it or where she got to ask the interesting thing is um I was we were looking at the video of her today and beauty first of all is\nJust bought your face and body look like it's much deeper than that and I'd say most of us realize that but what what Kelly and I look at the pictures of her I said she is a beautiful early it Kelly says that's probably why she got tormented [noise]\nAh it's now it's time to time out here helped me understand that because I had the same reaction I was telling Kelly minute about this this morning that when I saw I saw how could how could this have happened I mean she just is it's a beautiful person yeah well\nShe she ... she is wildly I don't know her personally but apparently this really got to hurt her deeply a but she I don't know I don't know Kelly said that and to me if it meant that some people are jealous I guess\nYes if price than I Am getting I think that clearly yes I think that's exactly what Kelly Matt and I think it's a main girl came out and people yeah it's unfortunate but I think that does happen and\nYou know what a shock to me now is that this kind of thing is happening when we have\nAll these anti bullying campaigns and use constantly seem to be spreading the message is\nYou know we need to treat it sat there with respect in you know you talked about how people your beauty is not just the way you see on the outside it this kind of story makes you feel like that message is just not getting through to anybody\nBut well first of all listen at how much it hurts identical here we have some sound from a from the mother\nOr your daughter and why and how it makes them feel right well here is the the Mumbai had to say\nMy daughter was beautiful she was she was afraid to say [noise] and he's the guy says something beautiful moment meaning for me in her a maid\nAnd she she mentioned that the that the girl or was talking about how she wanted to take her life she was crying all the way home and ... and that's how bad you know uh but the reason we're talking about this on the air with Darwin's is because people heard about it on the line at local business people jumped in to try and make her feel better\nAnd I'm thinking Kelly are saying uh ... what's happened to the compassion are we getting through with these messages you know I I think we are not maybe not every student but to\nThat community saying this is unacceptable because now belts step forward their salon owners to make people or nail technicians are offered to help her get ready for\nHer next day which is coming up the the Macintosh high school which is just north of ... county [noise] they they have invited her to their prom so she is going to get the royal treatment because people in the community of heard about her story there said this is not acceptable [noise] so\nYeah it is getting through some more and more people maybe we still have to work to do on campuses but as the community as a whole\nA if we're starting their and setting an example for children than we are making some progress there may be talking to ourselves but that trickles down hopefully and ah and we're really glad that the community saying this is not\nThe right way to go this is this girl deserves better than that and hopefully that will rub off on on well she's worked Russia's got more self confident cell that she can weather the next door\nYeah here she is she this is her sounding a lot better\nI had to have like a kind of feel comfortable\nAnd I think one of many people out there\n... planning no black and within the ...\n[noise]\nWell that's good that she has this thank them 'cause that's that's also very important to show your appreciation that she's doing that which means she's a classier act and some of the people that have been attacking our online\nThat's certainly been it I don't yeah Shelley been at when I was a teenager I don't know that I listen to any advice from an adult on anything\nThat's just I mean that was just me as a teenager you could have told me ten thousand times something and I I was type of person that that had to put my hand and the fire to find out that it would burn you even know people would do that and a lot of teenagers are that way\nWell and it's not just that it's the fact that a lot of us and I did it as an adult for many years before I finally worked at through\nYou hear the bad things people say about you and when people pay you a compliment it just goes in one ear and out

something President Trump says he'll do Fox's John decker is a lot of the White House\nA percentage of people who are really interesting election only forty nine percent of Democrats Democrats got smoked um you said the same thing two thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans\nFifty nine percent said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh\nYou had the same type of thing playing out\nAgain in this time in favor of the Democrats it started with a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the Senate and lose the house or at least makes it possible ... since ... that has changed\nDemocrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance\nOf very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight would be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six ... two thousand six midterms\nI'm and I'm which is which is crazy\nIt is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen [laughter] is this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before and ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nFor relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple seats and Republican law in the house where they would lose a couple of seats um there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's not it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if there would be able to sweep all of the races there favored in\n... and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happened the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place where there was a down by five in the polls don't want him winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that get them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that have been losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things could happen\nBut right now it looks like those are going to wind up getting split and then of course still hasn't even they're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on a train in the house you're still going to have investigative power gonna have subpoena power you're going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive while we're on a blue wave\nTo now almost laying the foundation of [noise] [noise] yeah well we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh facing a has backfired on them\nI mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had a bad a better chance that this uh two months ago I mean they had a legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up and some of them looked like they might be leading Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh thing now I mean I think it's a real ... going to come to the independents how are the independence feeling\n... they're in an interesting group because they are not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten were fifty percent\nNow independence are almost always going to be lower in a high interest in partisans because partisans engage more like generally um that type of course a blanket rule but it's typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and two thousand eight or Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because\nThey're overwhelmed with him and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from Palo\nYeah but I Wonder 'cause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls and so I'm Wondering you know would that four percent jump\nWas it a four percent yup or to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone insane\nRight and there's a lot of independence that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever being retired life like was that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so and the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line that these are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that\nWay it's a group that ... that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in and more\nOf this one could come down to the independents mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah ... ... ... and I mean\nI Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything or they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting Saturday here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever\n... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get it all the way up by the way who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah there's this burger yeah I Know you're in ... we talked about among them a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so uh in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... come Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal since ... in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen who was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen ...

caravan of seven thousand migrants headed to the U.S saying he's alerted the border patrol in the military because Mexico was unable to stop it and what a mama Honduras and El Salvador quote neither so the president wrote the U.S will now begin cutting off or substantially reducing foreign aid\nActually give people's lives meaning and happiness and so I think it's very important\nTo um as far right as they come on the right versus left continual but it's very important to remember that the purpose of politics is to maintain a framework for ordered liberty so that you can go live in communities of love where you're actually raising your kids and build\nA better mouse trap or app or where your worship bank because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics as a means to an end politics is in the end\nSo become completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left\nUm they are you know they're they are anti capitalist they are they're anti constitution\nSo you know you use on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about politics but at what point do you see good people say\nEnough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYet but then to what end what what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did a to Nancy Pelosi\nIn California that hundred centigrade weirdos\nDid to Mitch McConnell at a lunch hour in Kentucky exactly\nBecause there is no second or third just moved from there that doesn't just end up at violence and this is not saying by the way that people don't have a First Amendment right to protest they clearly do but screaming someone down taking mentioned Elaine's food off their table and throwing it on the floor\nAnd saying you don't belong in our country or to to leader McConnell or to Secretary Chao who served in President Trump's cabinet that kinda stuff doesn't actually have persuasion as any goal the the only thing there is just sort of symbolic politics as rent a witch heads to a pretty dark place I think\nSo I agree with you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book it's different than actually going out and leading 'em and standing you know Martin Luther king marching through Atlanta\nAnd taking the beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... a phenomenon is really built for short term media collapse that is what they're doing that I I'm In\nI'm In the middle of a little downtown to sort of restored downtown in Omaha right now and there's no end to hear and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with thinking about anti ... today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media ecology in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties\nSixty eight percent of Americans any given week we're watching I Love Lucy so that it was sixty percent of households that met at a basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it wasn't important content but it was\nShared content ... there was an American way when you fought with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with them about politics um you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now\nAnd they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two\nThey're still really only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world\nIs so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media as if the people like anti ... who are doing this to hope for viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do is ignoring them\n[noise]\nSo what he is [noise] are are we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the thing that I can I continually come back to every single time\nIs the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone yeah yeah is that our our ... or ...\nSo yes ... or ... them out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said\nThe first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion\nFreedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest all of those things flow from a fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is we believe a ... day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with the turtles souls and\nWith dignity that's way bigger than their policy preferences and so what is unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness\nAnd ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature if you will out there it's confirming stuffed up wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia which is that happiness\nIs actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forest and statistically the number one driver of happiness is do you have a meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers\nDo you think when you leave home on Monday morning\nWhen you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but\nIs there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do if those four things are true or even if three of the four true you're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe\nThat we can be ruthless we can be place less\nAnd so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of thick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work um ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and\nWhat you write about what's deep fakes um you seem to be one of the very few in Washington that really get to this ah and you're looking over the horizon and we want to talk about

Dave Anthony Fox News a caravan of seven thousand Central American migrants trying to get into the U.S I don't know if you're going to\nIf we can get there first of all but I my my dream and soon harder if we could\nThey get to know what's happening now isn't working that's why people listen to me when I should talk I talk about ways of making people\nBetter I I focus on something which will sound crazy I focus on happiness because our nation was built on life\nLiberty pursuit of happiness and no one talks about this I Do all the time\nEverything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness sorry so tell me about that let's start there sure um we talk I talk about for example there are there many controversies that I talk about uh education\nI I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making hemp\nAnd the candidates legal hang of it before I'm sure some stuff\nStarted with me I should go into education absolutely I'm the one talking about getting rid of all standardized testing prior to high school\nI Know in talking about doing that because they're nice testing is it unfair way of bringing teachers\nIt's an unfair way of rewarding schools and it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well and there's no indication of success and what are we finding the funding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across his entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons is family court how broken that is but another reason is there pressure to take tests or the feel stupid and to be some become successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy centralized testing is very good when you're in high school and joined way you should go well you have a clip of these are not a bad idea but ten years old why is to keep control of what's happening in the schools\nI'm not okay with that now you have a bit of gray hair as I Do know that means you are in the school prior to Nineteen eighty and it was I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really was the department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information ... ... they might do anything ... somehow everyone in in in the United states somehow learn how to read\nWrite survive in the world without at at a department of education somehow that work somehow local school district did a good job somehow that worked\nAt the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse and they give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some localized central and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting really sounded like testing you will lose about ... we will lose in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion\nSo losing four billion not into the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here\nWhen we lose that four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strings which means administrators go away and then it shows while riding granted but it shows you a check and boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive why\nRegulations rules checking boxes I'm the only one saying these things because I cross the entire state might say that's easy to counties across all if you get the full sharply by the way for you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more minutes raiders then teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average diminishing makes over a hundred and fifty ... you dump a couple of minutes raiders you've had more teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done\nWhy in the world we have K. through twelve many K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed and that's all they're doing how do we know this because the first year of college for most kids is thirty eighth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college\nWas terrible and I got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and we say and wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's been screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who were telling me literally Larry I Will hire anybody what the work ethic\nAnd one uh ... told me he said Laurie my interview process is a very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is will be able to show up at the clock in the morning it is so that so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what can I change the ... the the environment of course at sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey gotta has a plumber number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally\nAnd the lie is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind the desk and ... and the computer all day mhm that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that so it's sixteen let's make some decisions\nIf I think called you right for me I go to a two year prep school to prep schools is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go two years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready I graduate in three or four years and the advantage of internships are incubator life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves Dr tease him I talked to vent Laurie\nI'm a doctor who then it goes back to the gate not sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different\nStory now he'll get yes I Do I'm so that kid who's really smart that could take the SAT right away and goes off and get to a degree why should they be bored in school and they should be one school\nNext you don't want any of those things now worries go to a two year trade school\nGo to trace could become a plumber carp and do whatever you want to be a mechanic an H ... guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty ... that's the problem I Love my ... year old I'm fifty a ... year old my problem is that they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work\nThey should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough in New York City doing it's a problem\nSo do that we don't like that could get a job\nWhy not go learn to work work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen and lots of people imagine if they go work learn what it means to have a boss learned means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learned that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nA lot of these sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelve\nRight I'll pay for the last two years to I still pay for him here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here is six team you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use it good luck\nHere's what I'm his wife ... going to happen a bunch of cool prep schools will pop up\nA bunch of great trade schools will pop up yes how much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars he going to say well I don't know they'll pop up because it's guaranteed government money what banks love most guaranteed government money yes they do so they will actually give loans to many schools pop up it'll be amazing\nThere's the best part when these schools pop up now spending ten thousand dollars per kid per year for the last two years the ... state spends twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid so we're saving twelve thousand dollars each\nTwelve thousand times the four hundred thousand eleven twelfth graders is more than four billion dollars\nWe saved all of the federal funds we've removed tons of administrators we've given teachers or a ... a better chance to actually teach we've given teachers freedom to do what they feel it's appropriate we've got rid of Common Core ah we've made teenagers who are unhappy happier and this goes to the next level which is school safety\nIf you look at all the school shootings we've had while they are murders added at their core that public suicide they're unhappy kids ... ethnic or the unhappy kids now thinking about this lemon twelfth grade you're in eleventh twelfth grader you're in a class with everyone who wants to be there\nTo believe that isn't there the kids in something else the kids a bully because he doesn't want to be there that's why he's a bully but not he go someplace else your teacher lemons fourth grade this one problems almost go away why all the kids want to be there they taught\nWhat's killing our children isn't guns was getting our children is lack of community lack of purpose and loneliness that killing our kids put them in these worlds all that goes away\nI Can't go shoot my fellow friend the teachers have me you know build a rocket with my class I Can't go ... the former needs to fix a tractor I better things to do I've I've purpose I meaning I don't do things like that anymore\nWe're living in a world of massive change yes massive change and when's the last time you heard any politician sound or anything like this\nFor governor of New York his name is Larry ... we want to find out more go to Larry ... is a A R ... shorter none come back in just a second\nI tell you about lifelong\nFor more than three years a software vulnerability in the Google Plus social media network unwittingly gave\nWe haven't had a lot of stormy fall

call the embassy she calls his phone no answer nothing\nIs it turns out a Saudi Arabia first denied that any of this happened um but uh we now know that they are about to admit we don't know to what extent\nUm but it looks as though she was interrogated tortured and killed he was then hacked into pieces and thrown onto a Saudi plane in suitcases and what happened from there we don't know\nNow

just released that this was a U.S intelligence sources say\nThat was the first Nick then the Turks came out and said that they had audio and video tape of this man's interrogation or torture and killing\nI don't know if they do there is a possibility that they have microwave technology that could listen if\nThe Saudi embassy was not a prepared to deal with that kind of surveillance you can get to that kind of audio from inside of a building\nBut there's also another story that this actually audio arrived first with his fiance because he had an apple watch\nAnd when he went in he turned it on and it recorded and when it finished recording it just uploaded to the cloud\nAnd downloaded to her phone I Hope to God that's not true for her sake I Can't imagine especially since we now are getting the story that this audio that we don't know yet if as if it exists\nIncludes his interrogation\nAh and then uh the the execution ers come in and the a head of the embassy said you can't kill him you can't kill him in here or I'm going to get into trouble and the what's described as the path all adjust\nOr from Saudi Arabia the guy who was in charge of killing and disposing of the body apparently said to the head of the embassy or if you want to live you need to get outta here right now otherwise your next\nThey knocked ... on conscious and he was unconscious for a while then you hear them apparently starting to\nGet all of the tools and everything ready in the room ready to uh start to chop him up he is still alive when they are ... him and apparently it is a gruesome

how do you do that and not make things worse\nWell I Do a peacefully number one and I think that uh\nVarious ah people have to say you know let's get a little group together and um maybe we go out and and stand in the park with some signs saying whatever\nOr maybe we write a letter to the editor of our local newspaper a with five hundred signatures are attached to it\nSo the Oregonian for example a very left wing newspaper you know you say okay we'd like to have\nUm some space for not bad we have a community group and this is the way we feel about it there are things you can do to be visible in your local community it doesn't have to be a big national thing 'cause that's almost ... possible but I'm trying to get people to understand the evil it's growing in\nAmerica which is you know what

just pointed out solidly aligned with the most progressive\nThe most and our ... elements in our society the press sympathizes with all of them\nThey sympathize with open borders they sympathize would

and the activists press if you look at you know I'm the Nineteen sixties those some of them and we don't have it we did we've never had it like this but we we have had it in the in the past\nIf if somebody stood up let's say at the you know some group with standing in the community\nUh stood up and they did a non violent you know protest a non violent march ... for justice and non violence or whatever I um and they followed the king I'm a rules where you just never swing back\nAh that group most likely is going to be beaten up for doing it by anti ... but in the Nineteen sixties the press played that coverage I don't think the press plays that coverage this time you know somebody else\nWill take a cell phone video and throw it out there\nJust would have found is that an over the

the first thing you look let's let's segue into Saudi Arabia now because the press is actively trying to go you saw it on sixty minutes you solidly still try to do with Trump into basically\nDismissing Saudi Arabia alright well ... they want to not trade with them they want to crush that nation because of the nation is quote unquote bad okay I'm not going to stick up for Saudi Arabia is bad but Saudi Arabia is the bulwark against Iran\nAnd the middle east it's\nThe leader of Jordan and Egypt in that movement to blunt Iran's terrorism and destruction of Israel Saudi Arabia is leading the charge so why on earth is the American left wanna destroy that nation\nWhen in history we outlawed ourself with style and it was killing millions of people while we were allied with him

with the Saudi king and crown prince who promised\nBecause out of the news was tightening around the neck of ISIS\nYou know supplies and food and water are becoming more and more scarce and so ISIS was stealing all that from the civilians and so living behind the ISIS wall um in Mosul was absolute health for these people so they tried to break free and run away and so\nWhen these people ran away as as a large group ISIS massacred I think that there was more than a hundred and fifty people just slaughtered in the street because they went right by ISIS\nHounded I'm ...\nThe ISIS people I've heard that they've kind of gone back and they've they've just kind of morphed back into a lot of society\nIs that true [noise] we we\nDid it come across a lot of guys trying to blend in with society and and kind of get out of there\nUm and that has happened so ISIS is definitely having a bit of a resurgence in in Iraq right now so they went underground you know and and it's it was neighbors and just people who who've all live together right so these guys blend in there from the city of Mosul ISIS that's where these guys are from\nAnd so they were able to blend back into society a lot of them and so now we're seeing a bit of a resurgence however the guys that\nWe were seeing toward the end of the fight in Mosul a lot of these guys were actually white European guys a lot of a lot of Chechens and things like that ... and the reason for that is good they they have no choice but to fight and die\nThey can't assimilate back into society they can't run away because they you know they looked like me are white guys read beard and ... and they can't they can't get away so those guys\nHad to fight it out all the way to the end and they know they're going to die and they they just didn't care and so yeah\nSo you went from that um to say and I I've got to do\nI've got to keep doing this mhm um and that brought you to\nBurma mhm right yes and now you're working with an as rain fun yes in Burma yes and last week talk you were the only one in Burma and you started telling us about what was really happening ... and you have an update\nForth yes absolutely so\nAh also to clarify I'm not the only one working in Vermont I'm the only one from ... Oregon yeah they are you are telling me that you were trying to organize ... yes and you were going to bring them all together slowly and I just got I just got back from a trip about a week and a half ago\nAnd met with a lot of the tribal leaders and the um the guys who run a stuff across the border\nAnd they they are more than they they are beyond ecstatic to how the ... marine funds help okay now this is a group of Christians yes about fifty percent Christian about fifty percent a Buddhist looking out all the leaders of the it's called the ... tribe\n'em and they are all all of their leaders about Ninety percent of their leaders are Christian so every time every time I meet with them they we pray at the beginning and at the end and it's it's it's really really good thing um\n[noise] and so I met with these guys and I explained to them like what we can do and I had already been working in their ... or done several trips with the ... fund in there and they are beyond ... ecstatic to have us because\nWhen I was there literally while I was there the Burma Army just moved in three hundred and fifty more troops to attack their positions to attack the um civilians and current state so we just saw what happened last year with the ...\nAnd then the the Burma Army moved all those same troops up to the north to attack the kitchen but in another ethnic group and so now they're starting to bring troops down to attack the current and that's where we're there on the ground helping keep people alive so\nWhy why are they doing this why are they doing this these\nTribes [noise] it's it's it's a it's an ethnic thing it's a racist thing is is essentially what is it goes back a thousand years of the ethnic burns who control the Irrawaddy valley sort of in the center of Burma they want to control all the high lands they want to control the entire region and so if you're a different ethnicity\nYou can they'll they'll let you live there but you have to be sort of a subject a surf class you have to basically serve departments and also the for example like the ... they live in these they live in the hills and the current hills are full of natural resources so there's a lot of that going on plus\nThey don't like you 'cause you're Christian right that adds that just adds a whole whole nother level of hatred um because you know\nChristians don't put up with being with being oppressed they don't put up with it because where there's ... there's liberty right and these and so because of that the Burma Army attacks them even more tell me what you wrote me so I brought I brought with me several photos\nHave somebody I'm over his mercy just pass their apologize I think okay so I brought with me [noise] several photos\nOf of what I see all the time when I go to these places\n[noise]\nAnd these are ... I bought I brought with me photos [noise] sorry\n[noise] of of one particular um attack that happened um this is actually only from this is from two thousand ten writes it seems like a long time ago

all lose in the end and I do is the sad part of the sometimes do Democrats can be very positive for Republicans sometimes democratic candidates are big win for Republicans really and we're seeing a case of the here it appears in Texas where Beto O'Rourke\nOr Robert Francis or if you know as his parents wanted him to be known 'em\nGoing to get by it as he used to call them so called right\nIt was cool when it when it's beneficial to be called Bobby called himself Bob yeah now he calls himself that's all right so Beto is running here in Texas and if you don't have and you haven't seen this you haven't been watching\nA any national media as far as not just politics I'm playing outside of that Ellen and cold there and you have an hurry where that CNN town hall coming up tonight just him um again it's bizarre the reason why it's helpful for a Republican is\nBeto O'Rourke has drained the Democratic donor base out of thirty eight million dollars\nAnd going to have gone to close races ... you know it all seems like Cruz is a winning here and winning by significant margin though we don't we obviously we still have a few weeks ago we noticed could change\nBut well they could produce the pictures of his father actually pulling the trigger on JFK and that may need to be actually may need that yeah well they might have it and you never know they might\nUm they're talking now about a a fifty to forty three margin is the so seven point or sees me fifty two forty five is the\nIs the margin now with cruise leading by seven points to visit from by the way the same company that is hosting the town hall with better tonight CNN as their poll same thing to forty five\nI think he wins by twelve and maybe as high as a team\nI mean that would be a real surprise or no it would be but you know that's when I mean is what really what happened last time Ted Cruz ran I mean the polls are are hard in Texas I I don't necessarily believe believe the polls here in Texas you know it'd be great if he won he won by three\nBut I I just think that there is is something that ah you know when you get when you when you get right down to it Texans are going to say yeah I think Ted Ted Cruz\nI tend to think he's going to win as well I don't know about Eighteen I'm you know maybe I think they think tens possible though I mean nine or ten is definitely possible I'm interested in this poll first of all what you see is Greg Abbott who's running for governor here in life is\nIs winning by a much larger margin or ... I don't have the one and right in front of me but it's it's over twenty points every I don't even think I've seen a sign for him here does yeah I Know is you know when there's like a hundred by so much he's up to eight Eighteen points here so crews that by seven and St Paul were avid is up by Eighteen and what's interesting about comparing the results of the same poll\nIs it the same people the same people were asking the questions and so you kind of get a sense of where people are splitting up for example much more people are ... are voting for\nA great guy but that are voting for Ted Cruz out of the exact same base the other thing that's interesting about it is the um\n... you think of it is great red country right in Texas ... however are the poll shows that fifty percent of adult disapprove of Donald Trump's um job performance in forty one percent approve that gets closer among likely voters where it's a forty nine forty eight\nBut still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas\nAt it this way try this on for size\nAh a Donald Trump is\nEverywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right\nAnd it's dominating your life just like Iraq Obama was dominating everybody's life um and Donald Trump has a really good side and a really bad side and it depends on what day\nYou're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah other days you're like oh yeah that can we not talking about today and I don't want to talk about the ...\nYou know so she is such a big figure in everybody's life\nTed Cruz was a very big picture or a big big force in everybody's life two years ago but he's just kind of falling off the map and he's just doing a good job okay mhm I'm", "year":

NBC fifteens Darwin singleton Darwin good morning\nOr good morning to both of you on this Thursday or friday as we like to call it\nA couple of really interesting stories that you've got kind of out of the ordinary that we wanted to hear from you on now we've got the story of ... to ... there was a mobile couple that ran into a burning building to help people\nGet their own vacation a on a mission in mission beach in San Diego they were having coffee out by the beach a Tuesday Morning there's people screaming for help\nAnd lo and behold they look or one of the building there it's like a business was downstairs apartment upstairs and it was on fire and um and their names are they are Christine mackerel Haiti and her boyfriend Jared or beak\nAnd without hesitating they ran into that burning up carpet and got people up and out of there there were a couple of injuries but\nBut they say people's lives and they're being hailed as heroes and San Diego on TV and everywhere and uh we talk with folks in San Diego they let a share the story and so there you have is\nPretty impressive that these two ... or so ... and um and they said there was no time to be scared they had to get something done so very proud of them being for immobile in San Diego is now hearing that we've got some really pretty nice people down here on the\nYou know you ... we all have to wonder when we hear the story or how many of us would run into a burning building\n[noise] you know I guess it's just ... ... some people would call for help others are just prone to be more ... more proactive um\nBut they did what they had to do at the moment and I guess you calculate risk as you go a long ride but the important thing is that that ah these people there are a lot of elderly in that apartment complex apparently they may have not very possible\nPossible that they may have not gotten out alive so uh it was smoke inhalation not just flames thanks so we're very proud of them this morning yeah angel there are a couple of other stories that were real quickly touched on this one and and then we can end up behind a mom in mobile\nA is accused of taking her son to a ... plant fight\nOver lap people stadium I guess in the parking lot or something somewhere a and while they were there somebody pulled out a gun and shot mom and sons they're okay you're going to be All right\nBut she's in big trouble because she um she took her son to a to a fight I mean what's the fat that that I mean we've had stories like that before but it's always still hard to imagine that someone would do that her name Danielle Campbell she has a her ... she and her so we're both shot\nAnd now Campbell is charged with inciting riots that's why they\nPlop down on her as far as the charge this morning but it more up lifting story well even uplifting it's just unusual the woman in limestone county in North Alabama uh she walked into her kitchen and found a man making a sandwich\nOkay she didn't know him she did not know him [laughter] and he was in his underwear and she said why are you doing here and he says he's waiting for his close to\nDry grandma but she says it's not as grandson she didn't know who he was he taking a bath brushed his teeth clipped just told him\nOh they'll add up all he called the\nSheriff's department yeah I mean I don't ... their toenail clippers I prefer to have something about I don't know using 'em well cops came and got and they said he appear to be under the influence of some narcotic he was a pilot but they took him away and she says I'm laughing about it now but she says I was scared to death at the time\nOf course we date\nWhat would have happened if he had walked into your ... if you'd walk into your house and so I'm standing there what would happen\nYeah well that's that's the thing not all of us are going to react in a way that this lady did uh he's very he's very fortunate that he didn't pick the wrong house\nThat's what I'm thinking yeah cause Kelly I I don't know would you what would you object Kelly I'm sure I'm just curious\nI don't know what I Would have done and there was a time when I thought I knew how I Would react to these\nShe ... because I have had\nA break in a couple of times at my house and both times the police told me when they came out they think I interrupted a burglary our process and and so that really I was like I really don't tell me that\nSir I don't want to hear that and I I had so much anger over at that I thought I Would react to certain way but then I had a situation where this this gentleman just\nAnd I had taken my kids to to some fast food restaurant and he pushed on my son and just started acting crazy and was verbally abusing me away\nAnd all I wanted to do was get out of there so I really think that when that fight or flight response kicks in I think I have learned I Want to fight in my head but the truth as that flight response is the one I'm going to react to I'm going to get out of dodge\nYou want to live for another day your mom you've got to take your child and I think that's why I get out of the house called the cops with if they know what they're doing a ... I Know some people may say well I'll check that situation and I don't know what that could lead to especially if you have other family members of\nThe house so but apparently she calculated pretty quickly that he wasn't a ... edge apparently there's underwear so are you going to do\nThank goodness it took them get violent [noise]\n... thank you so much for your time that I have a have a great

all around and again\nAnd occasionally my ... is is isn't so soldier so many of them right right exactly yeah at least I'm I'm going through the right steps of the cutting of it a little pieces and put 'em in individual cases and I think that's your clean up after yourself that's all you can do is clean up the mess afterwards\nAnd it's interesting too that the media is making a big deal out of every single time they talk about this guy they talk about him as if he's an American because they always say Washington Post reporter right a ... ... I think he just\nHe contributed to the Washington Post was he actually is he actually a staff member of the Washington Post columnist with an e or he'd written it's relatively new yeah because he had left there was a lot of problems over there he realized he might be on the wrong side of whatever\nInternal craziness was going on in Saudi Arabia so that that's fairly new and you know\nCritics of Saudi Arabia I think have a have a ... a first of all places in the American media that is just right like porn that we are able to air those things are but also you know there's a lot of opposition to them\nAnd people don't I mean you know remember Saudi Arabia was like the main uh accusation made by Michael Moore in Fahrenheit ... was it Fahrenheit nine eleven it was a feeling he's made like he's tried to capitalize on with that so many times I Can't remember which one it is now but they're in it and I live in the first one the biggest a political documentary of all time\nUp in that was just a giant conspiracy theory about how the bushes knew this guy like fifty years ago all out there and they're working with this group is working with the Saudis and was all about defending the Saudis and that's why you you know you don't know the truth about nine eleven\nUm right so this is not a new accusation um when it comes to Republicans working with Saudi Arabia but you know every president has worked with him for a very long time and it's something that we've been critical about four they been\nOur allies as Nineteen thirty three I think uh so yeah a really long time and this goes back to\nThe FDR administration so it's not just Trump who's been a friendly I guess with Saudi Arabia certainly Bush was always always accused of that being too friendly with Saudi Arabia but Iraq Obama was plenty friendly with them\nTo exactly I mean they've been allies for a long time and there is no way that Brock Obama would have done anything a severe to Saudi Arabia by this point in there and it wouldn't have done anything about this to a great point and it shows the problem with Ninety percent of the media coverage today\nThe difference there is that they perceive\n... Obama as the intellectual deep thinker\nWho is tense of right and they were never good I'm bringing Fahrenheit nine eleven again\nThe big one of the other big criticisms of this was Bush was in school when he found out about nine eleven and he sat there and let the kids finished the book and then he he took the call and it took him like nine minutes before he ... he walked out of the\nRoom remember this accusation and they they showed a large chunk of it and it was a bill or at the time you know like\nWhat they saw Bush as the bad guy who who was who's incompetent\nBrock Obama wait what was it Seventy eight days when he knew were were Osama bin Laden was before he did anything\nAnd it was universally praised for this decision it was the most difficult decision and five hundred years since civil Arlen me there was a decision you made since Charlotte Charlotte me to go get the worst criminal on earth\nAh what is is a tough decision in in the minds of people who want to praise the decision\nBy the way we made a on about nine twelve two thousand and one\nTo kill the guy right you know tens of thousands of military members signed up just to do that yeah they all knew I mean yes of course there was risking the mission like that but these are this is ... ... talk to any military members especially people who are serving at that time and they'll tell you\nThat was basically the reason I got into it yeah I mean you know a lot of people got in just to hopefully get the opportunity to take that shot\nSo it was not a difficult decision um but Brock Obama was an intellectual thinker he was a deep thinker that was just considering all these options and and weighing all these impossible choices and he finally came to the conclusion to go and and act on this the opposite is what they feel about Trump\nYou know that the fact that Trump is going out there and saying wait a minute let's hold on a second let's get this evidence let's figure out exactly what's going on let's investigate this before we act irrationally ... Obama was\nDoing that it would be seen as he's a deep thinker he's not being reactionary with Trump is that he doesn't care it's all about money and it's all about Saudi Arabia because Jared Kushner like Saudi Arabia or something it's just that you know the the\nThe overwhelming problem is that everybody seems to see everything through the lens of this one individual on our planet\nThey just are completely obsessed with Donald Trump yeah and and I just don't I Can't connect to that I think as as a person who's a a small government guy I don't want the president to have that much of a role in our lives\nAre just fundamentally whether it's ... or Donald Trump but the CNN I think they've made a decision and MSNBC certainly on the sport in and pretty much every other media source is that this is this is our this is what we do\nAll we do is talk about every issue and how it relates to Donald Trump this is a man who was murdered\nOr potentially cut up into little pieces maybe by mistake of falling with your bones ... something happened there ... and all we can talk about is what ... why Donald Trump is acting the way he's acting well isn't fair and more of a story here maybe that's the story run in three weeks when you're looking back at this incident but like\nIsn't the story now much more about the details of the incidents\nAre and what happened there were still and I'd be age yeah should be\nUm breaking news now um Chicago Tribune is reporting the United states just received a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia\nAre actually we got it on Tuesday the same day secretary of state Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh to discuss the disappearance of ...\nUm Saudi Arabia publicly pledged the payment to support us stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria so I'm sure that this will be twisted into oh we're not doing anything to them because they just paid us a hundred million dollars\nOf course there are always paying a hundred\nMillion dollars [laughter] relationship with them it is they send us a lot of\nMoney and we send them stuff that is kinda I mean look at it it's not completely in significant to the relationship right I mean that there there are these considerations\nAnd that is why when you're making a decision of the president of the United states your decision is not solely based on you know what the media wants you to do right like it's about American interests and that should always be the primary choice if what the idea at the end of the day if of American interests are harmed long term I'm\nBy a decision you might make you have to take that into consideration it has to be your top priority\nTop priority is not a Jew ... murders in Turkey right like the\nYou know I don't know if anybody knows this but we ... we a lot of countries that we're dealing with are murdering people all the time\nOr you know how often do we hear that we should talk to North Korea before when now that Trump is doing it no one wants them to talk to some degree anymore so studying like that's off the table now but this guy's been doing much worse things\nAll over the world terrible terrible things are happening all the time the fact that this guy is a journalist or a columnist is a big part of the reason why are you know I think the media care so much about it\nAnd they're prioritizing over you know some\nSlaughter in Africa or some terrible thing that's happened in Russia right like it's this is you know this is a a journalist that they knew that was from a you know that wound up are working for an American newspaper\nSo it's a big story and the and the details rounded are so crazy like such a twenty four storyline that I can understand why it captures the interest but being patient and making sure you understand the actual facts of the situation before you act is not a negative\nAnd there's a lot at stake here a lot at stake I\nMean if you if you just start willy nilly throwing on sanctions on Saudi Arabia they're going to retaliate and if it's going to cost a not us as much but the rest of the world is going to suffer in the oil that that's what they've already threatened All right go ahead and punish us and we'll cut off your oil supply well\nI think we get scanned little from them but other people get a lot Europe gets a lot of oil from Saudi Arabia so yeah you want to make sure you got all your a cheese crossed in ... before you take any severe action I\nWould think now look as a global market anyway yeah so it it it all affects ah each part of it affects the other parts and you know it's something to consider though I mean I think making a principled moral decision outweighs that a lot of times but American interests are have to be facts annihilation we think we see that\nHappening too infrequently or over the past few decades and it and and that should start again\nA AAA seven twenty seven back as the phone number are sponsored this half hours dip recruiter or if you go to these

a Disney Princess is um we're being worn by a some Hollywood actresses\nThat there is some danger there Karen nightly is promoting a her upcoming movie which was produced by Disney by the way the nutcracker the four realms\nBut she told Ellen DeGeneres on Tuesday that she's not a fan of every movie the studios produce because Disney Princess is don't uphold her feminist values ... so she is

rescue yourself\nObviously and this is the one I'm ... mad because Cinderella waits to be rescued and they're not really as herself yes should and poor self out of that situation\nShe's also quite

doing that today the main ... or ... entire movie is to give up all of your rights to men and wait for them to rescue a especially a rash of rich guy that's\nThe message you should be taking from

kill someone if they're sleeping on though [laughter] I mean in my circumstance [noise] that's true however this is a notable circumstance which is why it's a movie in a book\nRight the reason why you know about it is because it's different than everyday life right ... you know there there's a magical apple\nThere's a a a print or with a magical spell right on the princess yeah\nAnd she's sleeping because she can't wake up right unless the prince kisses her that's kind of the premise that yeah so it's a it's a unique circumstance that pressure lessons don't apply to [laughter] so silly so weird

at the Saudi consulate Denise ... boxes Rachel Sutherland live in Washington\nThat that's that's a terrible direction to go and lead you don't awful roads where you're trying to judge things that you can't possibly judge correctly\nYeah and it's it's gonna be interesting to see how this progress as a in a year or two or five for now with Brett Kavanaugh because there was nothing to back up\nOr his accusers claims there was no corroboration there was no evidence at all of these allegations from thirty five plus years ago and yet\nUh I just saw an article today above from ... Democrats looking at other ways besides a impeachment\nOn how to remove a Supreme Court justice ... are just unbelievable I mean the ... so you're going to try to remove him from from the Supreme Court bench when there was no corrupt ration and no evidence\nYeah and you know wow first of all I think once we get past this election\nThe Brett Kavanaugh stuff has died down quite a bit because I mean you see what was the last time you see ... I Hope that's true Dr Ford or you know you don't you're occasionally you'll hear from Anita Hill Twenty years after right but it's more like a retrospective arts tongue into a new story you know they'll be still hate Clarence Thomas in the lowest hate Brett Kavanaugh but\nI mean it never was about these allegations there was never a moment in which that\nStory was about the allegations it was always about the the opportunity to stop Brett Kavanaugh from sitting on the court can they thought they had a chance of winning\nThe Senate and can block the block the next justice and maybe they wouldn't have to deal with another conservative on the court\nWould that was one hundred percent of it for every ... every single person involved with the possible exception of Dr Ford which you could at least say maybe she went through this and certainly she only brought it up now because of the Supreme Court so that it was certainly part of her calculus there [laughter] um but you know if she really did go through this you know that that's a different story we\nDon't know um but the other people in Cory Booker do not care a lot for one second about what happened to this one not at all not even for a second no he only cared about what happened to him so he could call themselves Spartacus a and eventually uh make himself into a twenty twenty candidate\nAnd the same thing with Kamala Harris and the same thing with all of this all of these people they didn't care at all um and he and his ... and look it's clear with things like Keith Ellison which is currently going on which actually had evidence behind it which is going on currently which actually gone to a the police and\nThen again if if if what we find out is that there is nothing to it you have to just like I Would with anybody else say that he you know is not guilty and should be able to do what he has to do but if you're judging by the standards that they're putting up it's totally different\nLook let me put this and I I thought this was fascinating after I think of how recent this Brett Kavanaugh saying was an ... story back in your mind for a moment about what we were trying to find\nThat Dr Ford comes up and and testifies and says I Know these people uh they were there none of those people say that they remember this this incident uh she didn't tell anybody for a very long period of time there\nWas no she couldn't remember where the house was she couldn't remember who's house it was you can remember how she got there she wouldn't be back with an avid mountain of it it happened right none of it right [noise] um\nAnd we were basically the insinuation from the media was if let's say one of the witnesses she named\nInstead came out and yeah I remember that party and I remember hearing really shook up and she left in ... and and I remember being very strange and she was weird for the next three weeks she was just like\nYou know very distant and I I didn't know it was going on and now I Know\nIf you would have had just that I think the media would have been in I mean they already were in full and conviction mode but I don't think Collins and flake would have held on or something like that just one person\nSaying one thing not with as a witnessing the incident but just she heard about it in the general time period just one we're looking for one who even knew that the party a Kurd none of the incident happened just that the party occurred\nListen to this this is from Nineteen Ninety nine from slate the hardcore right wing publication of slate talking about the accusation of rape\nNot sexual assault not sexual harassment but rape against Bill Clinton brought her ex initial denials indicate only that she shunned publicity\nThat's why she never reported the rape rebuffed advances from Clinton's political enemies who in Nineteen Ninety two urged her to go public so they had asked Broderick about this in Nineteen Ninety two when he was running for president the first time and he said she said no I'm not going to tell my story\nSo she had an opportunity to walk down this president did ... did not decide to do so she lied to Paula Jones lawyers about the incident to get out of talking about it\nShe eventually told the FBI the truth in Nineteen Ninety eight only because her son a lawyer advised her against lying to federal investigators so she didn't want to tell the stories you tear down the president she told the story because she thought she was getting like perjury charges or something against her\nFive people said ... five people say Broderick told them about the rape immediately after it occurred\nWow so not while for one person who was at the hotel or at the party and the cabinet case she had five people that she told about the rape immediately after\nIt occurred uh a friend and co worker named Norma Kelsey says Twenty one years ago she found a dazed Broderick where they bloody lip and torn pantyhose in their shared hotel room broader he explained that Clinton had just raped her\nClinton is supposed to have bitten or on the ... right before raping her her current husband that her lover says Broderick told him about Broderick told him about the rape is well within a few days of the event\nBroderick did not remember the date of the rape that's the one similarity here\nSo she did supply the name of the hotel\nThe Campbell and the reason she was visiting Little Rock a nursing home seminar she also says that Clinton pointed to a ramshackle prison outside the hotel room window before he raped her and said he planned to renovate it he's so Clinton in the middle of a bunch of cooked for rape is like a by the way I'm going to renovate the prison over there at work\nUm NBC News found a date and ... nursing home seminar was held at the Camelot hotel and record records show that Broderick attended\nNewspaper reports suggest that Clinton was in the area and had no official commitments in the early morning when the rape is supposed to have occurred there was a prison outside the hotel\nWindow wow that is ... times the amount of even alleged evidence yeah that occurred with ah with Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd yet that was ignored\nFor ... and ... until the very second the Clinton family became useless to the Democrats\nAnd now yeah you'll see occasional people saying yeah we should have handled that differently or I'm with you guys that that's a total me to moment that only happens now after they never want to hear a either one of their uh stories ever again\nTo them Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family is not guilty of this rape is not guilty of that they're guilty of blowing in election to Donald Trump\nAnd that's why they have no more used for them\nBut I mean Bill Clinton goes on is still makes a big level speeches oh yeah he's able to do all these things this isn't a ... a much more credible accusation and Paula Jones had a lot of evidence to including corroborating witnesses of what happened there\nIt's it's a situation with with a double standard that is so bizarre\nAnd the fact that they that that the media actually thinks we should take their ... current stance seriously on this stuff is insane the stance is and always has been\nYou should be taken seriously when you report a crime against somebody else that crime should be ... go go through the legal system with actual standards and if they're held responsible for this crime then we can all understand what happened\nI mean that is what that is the system we have is the best in the world\nAnd the idea that we're now supposed to go through these kangaroo courts and and even worse than that I mean even worse than the kangaroo court it's like oh well I don't know kind of seems like maybe he could have done it is now or standard\nThat's been sanity it's insanity\nAnd yet you have Hillary Clinton speaking out against Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd defending her husband and they they just asked her what the difference uh was between the two and she said well oh yeah they're completely different because um my husband's improprieties were looked into for a really long time this was looked into for a week\nWell there was some ... can show evidence as you just pointed out into all of the claims made by other women and Bill Clinton and the other differences she went after him try to destroy every single one of the accusers\nThat was that was a big difference nobody's trying to destroy Christine Blasey Ford nobody's trying to destroy even the others that are making outrageous allegations against him that are completely uncorroborated\nOr exception of Michael Evan ... which I think the Democrats are currently trying to destroy as they are so pissed off about that and they do not want I'm running for president and they do not want the circus there oh so they are they are they are very much trying to destroy him at this point\nBut what a clown he is he is yeah I mean it's it's embarrassing you thought Michael Cohen was a bad lawyer and then my club and out of yeah introduced himself to you\nBut it's so bad that even Trevor Noah who's the ... I mean I I thought John Stewart was on funny this guy is on funny too about the one million to power but\nI'm Trevor Noah on Comedy Central the other night took on Hillary Clinton and you know to his credit actually said some some accurate things are about her and and whether or not she's\nThey say they still believe that show during an October fifth game in Brookhaven which band members pretended to hold police officers at gunpoint was inappropriate becoming less than a week after two officers were shot to death in the city\nBut the resolution asked that the ban be fully reinstated so it could participate and all of its normal activities some local emergency management officials from Mississippi or in Florida now helping with the hurricane recovery Clark counties sci fi is leading it eight member team that's dealt with a lot of other disasters over the years hopefully\nWe're able to help the people with some of our experiences that we've been fortunately had the opportunity to be exposed to\nThe group is working in the hardest hit areas near Panama City dealing with logistics and helping to coordinate donations and volunteers\nOther team members include the emergency management directors from Hancock stone leak in Washington counties and the Mississippi Delta levee board also staff members from Lauderdale in Jackson county's the man who felt it was death that the Chevron refinery in Pascagoula Tuesday night was a contract worker\nAlbert lea bird the second was inside a processing unit when the accident happened Chevron says Byrd's death is being fully investigated yesterday the occupational safety and Health Administration was on the scene\nYou'll have a chance to see some golfers who one major tournaments in Jackson next week the field of a hundred and thirty two players for the Sanderson Farms championship will include two time U.S Open ...

[noise] uh there's this\nThere's an interesting thing for the New York times today and it is they do this little pod cast in the morning called the daily and today's was about Lucy K. and whether Lucy case should be allowed back on stage\nEver ever um well you did things in front of girls right after he asked them if you could yeah and that and they said yes\nAnd are part of this I'll go with him in particular is that there doesn't seem to be much of an alec ... much if any allegations of him and doing something that against him as well right like he would ask they say yes or or um there was one case where\nUm he [noise]\nAgain like this is the level of the accusation here he was accused of calling up someone and while he was on the phone with the woman the woman believed that he was pleasure and himself while on the phone with her\nBecause I guess he was breathing heavy or something and ... couldn't hang up because of the power dynamics our dynamic absolutely yeah power to make you do all sorts of gay because as a comedian he's in ... he wields incredible power right in this country now incredibly led to ever\nFired at any job in the nation and giving any job you're a sarcasm is just reality and the situation that they're kind of like well why is that what they were saying they're saying they ... some of them people were\nOther comedians and one at one point one of the accusations was he walked up to a another comedian er and they were talking and I guess he thought there was a vibe there is something invited her back to his trailer to do his thing in front of her which apparently was because this is his shtick ... and and she said actually uh you know you have a wife\nChild and you should think about that and he said uh I Know I I'm Sorry you're right I have issues\nAnd that's the center of the allegation that he didn't do it he didn't force her to do after that he didn't do it and then they had that conversation he learned to do this thing which is unbelievable obviously icky right yeah but I mean again he asked her to do this thing she said no reminded him of his wife and child and so he said oh you're right I have I have issues I'm Sorry\nSay that is is that sexual assault what I mean the accusation there are no data show was shown what she answered a diet and he did not pursue it after that it's unbelievably there's you know so I ...\nHe admitted to being a dirt bag right now and he admitted in such a general way that people kind of\nA make it if you will he admitted to these things and he did admit to I I've done a lot of things wrong I've tried to figure out a way to make the make them right and I think\nThat that would I just described you is obviously wrong yeah like I was a wrong thing for him to be doing how is it a crime is it a crime I think the idea that clearly is no and and they and the idea that you know Lucy K because he's a famous a comedian\nCan affect other people other comedians careers is theoretically possible\nBut that is that enough for a crime and the fact that he wants to have he wants to hook up with someone who is theoretically he could hurt their career if they say no but there's evidence\nThat he did this to anyone so it would even do it to anyone right I mean you know again making a weird assumption there yeah and we just assumed the crime like this isn't sort of stuff that Minority Report was the folks who scares away from right you're not supposed to just as the other and people will commit crimes in the future\nAnd listen to this this is the guy who runs the comedy cellar and the comedy cellar is famous New York comedy club like it's a tiny it's like a hundred people can watch comedy there and they're the if you go there you'll see a lineup of

[noise] from the men do Buick GMC studios [noise] this is talk going on for nine points and I urge radio station [noise]\nTrump has been briefed by a secretary of state I'm Dave Anthony Fox News\n... there are lots of stories out there about what has happened Mike\nPompeo moments ago talking about the presumed murder of a Saudi journalist in Turkey\nWhat are you lie about the idea is that we're all other because other people around and we're like well I think he'd jeep people did blackout how healthy you know you're not only he would know that right or maybe he did I I don't see how that's all that uh\nThere's no way to know that I Am too there's conversation but still there's no way to know what if the ridiculous thing to to complain about and I you know this is one of the most annoying parts about this\nIs the\nSubtle accusation that everyone who supported Brett Kavanaugh was a terrible person\nEven from people like you know there are people in the left that you know I'm sure as I say I certainly know them and they were against Kavanaugh because they believe ah you know Dr Ford mhm ... but the accusation there is similar to almost it's implicit essentially and everything that they're saying which is\nThey accuse us of believing\nForward\nIn a roundabout sort of way they're accusing us of saying we know she was assaulted and yet we still want them on the spring\nThe court right and like no right well no thing is if we thought he was a sexual assault or we wouldn't want them on the Supreme Court we just don't believe he is\n... you have not provided any evidence to bring us over that line right and just because you happen to believe it with no evidence by the way you happen to believe her is your prerogative but you don't accuse me of a bowl of sinking her story was credible I didn't\nI didn't think her story was credible I I think I don't think it happened\nYeah I don't either and they haven't even I think it happened with somebody else\nMaybe believing that and so is this is a I don't think it happened at all to be perfectly honest with you now of course I Can't prove that I wasn't there but the ... when when something like this happen and it's the same thing that happens\nWith any big public official or in this way if you have someone who doesn't report something it doesn't even tell their friends for multiple decades then talks about a party that they couldn't rent or where it was and then they tell you but the people who were there and they can't remember the party like\nWater we and the person who's making the accusation\nHas an overt uh dislike for the party\nOf the person or that they're accusing there is a person who has been an activist his march that women's march rallies as as an obvious Democrat like you have to take in that motivation forty years later into account\nI always started skepticism I had this idea that basically I think people almost it's like it's going to sound bizarre but I think if people almost like an innocent until proven guilty it's a weird way of seeing about it yeah I Know I Know I I don't jump right to the guilt you die and leave the survivors\nNo no well you don't believe survivor but if you're a survivor that indicates that the midst of as occurred\nCalling her a victim or a survivor indicate that you know the event occurred I Would ever called the victim I called them survivor but then I wouldn't they Levi\n... survived this assault by this man maybe if they've assault didn't happened they didn't survive it and [laughter] you know I guess we could all call ourselves survivors because we're all alive and we've technically survived everything that's happened to us so life yeah like I don't know what her motivation was I don't know it's possible\nOr a ... a million things are possible what you said it's possible it's possible really happened and were misjudging the evidence while she make\nIt up why would she lie about it\nThat's a good question because I Love this one mhm possibly could lose your motivation [laughter]\nWhen that accusation should like this I don't know when I taught at school we talk about uh yeah I Know\nWe talk about the the women's right to choose it is just fainted as if it is the life of a baby not the ending of one\nI wouldn't defend my children's lives about as strongly as they would they defend their right to kill their children hit is the most important thing in the universe to\nHow many millions of Americans\nThe idea that you wouldn't do something to take out a guy\nWho you think is going to overturn that right that you think is so vital is insane we seemed far crazier things happen we saw an accusation last week and we're five five accusers accused the high school student of sexual assault because they as they later admitted like him didn't like him\nYeah we have we have a hoax allegations that have come through all the time people paint swastikas on their own garage they write I don't like your lifestyle and receipts because they're trying to blame people for being against being anti gay\nThis happens all the time you know why people are horrible many of them are awful their women are awful men are awful they do terrible things that you can explain it happens all the time and the idea that they wouldn't do that with this on the line people are writing the swastikas on their door for nothing you can like say\nWell I was a victim of of of anti Semitism or I was a victim of white supremacist not one of the entire Supreme Court on the line\nOf course you can find someone who's going to falsely accused which they do we know\nFor a fact they fit the accuser recounted allegations after he made them we know the ... the fourth accuser didn't even bother right any information on their letter including their name or where they lived or what had happened we know that the third accuser went to Michael ...\nAnd no one including Democrats believe them we know that false accusations we're littered all over\nThe store and the only two they even seemed ... seem credible to even Democrats were the first to and and in the second one is is that there's a ... their right they wouldn't be the person who made the allegation said I was told by someone else so get was not a witness I was told by someone else that something like this happened I but I couldn't locate them\nAll right well I guess you could maybe take that seriously until the media didn't locate the person and that person said no it didn't happen and she had to spend six days with our attorney to remember it even happened exactly\nThe failed to act on sounding corroborating evidence on that one either and they're ... and look the Fort one was only ... I think taken more seriously than the others because there was an obvious\nPerson saying no it didn't happen right like there were and all the other ones they were there were those people if there was no evidence proving that had happened here I'm In and of course obviously people like have it on his uh his are witnesses were saying no um but\nThat one was serious because she went and just you know took the step of going in front of the of the hearing and and and doing it relatively credible job recounting what she believed the story was\nWho knows if it was true or if it was completely felt fall the idea that you can't pull one percent of the United states who opposes abortion so much that they're going to make a credible accusation against someone but it's just completely false\nIt's just an eight yeah of course you can do it I mean that as we heard with Hillary Clinton\nShe said there was a vast right wing conspiracy of people doing this like the media accent that is entirely foreign world where someone could lie about politics [laughter]\nI Know of course that could happen and I think likely did at least in for the five cases and probably and all of them\nAnd you brought up the high school situation in California where they called the mean girls um situation here where the five girls accused is one Seventeen year old boy of sexual assault and they they asked the first accuser\nUh why she would do this and she apparently told students that she would do anything to get this kid expelled from school now and they did accusing him of sexual assault or and then the second one said I just don't like to hear him talk\nI don't like to look at him I just don't like him that's why they accused him take credit didn't like him to really encourage\nOr how about the Ohio University student who ah got threatening notes about how they didn't want her in her L G peachy lifestyle to them to be in the students' Senate anymore at Ohio University\nUh she was a angry and frustrated and disappointed she said I'm a shoe you may find my me revolting and worthy of a threat of my life but in reality it's your beliefs that a repulsive you need to get this through your head you F ing a whole I Am proud to be who I Am and nothing could say or do or ever change that\nBy the way the ... of course admitted to sending the threats to herself a\nOr the woman and why would you do that yeah why it was clear motivation possibly be it's hard to do in this case it's not hard to detect with Brett Kavanaugh\nOr a the a woman in\nTexas who said a state trooper sexually assaulted her until of course the cam footage came out and her own attorney had to say we're sorry for bringing in this case we didn't know about this at the time\nOr the charges against the for dentist accused in Las Vegas of raping a ... a people and that was also found to be completely false\nAnd untrue or ah how about the racist receipt we don't tip of terrorists to an Arab a person at a restaurant um who again later on and had to admit that yes he actually wrote the stuff on the receipt\nWow or the former college student who claimed rape and then it had to admit in court that it was completely false on Long Island\nOr a Kansas men who said he\nRacist graffiti on his own car\nOr\nOr or the races note at Saint Olaf college if you remember this one uh that was one where the where they talked about uh once again the this terrible race racial note everyone apparently is racism is rampant all ...\nIs just to be here support them and and help them get things done it's a neat\nThough Eddie I use the emergency management director in Clark County he's leading an eight member team that's been deployed near Panama City this week\nIt with all the other bad things we have to worry about most Mississippians don't spend a lot of time preparing for earthquakes this morning though more than three hundred thousand people across the state many of them school kids in northwest Mississippi will take part in the annual earthquake drill called the great central us shakeout\nWell small quakes have occurred in different parts of Mississippi it's a bigger concern in the northwestern counties

soon be headed to federal prison out of weapons charge James have a van cleave had drugs and a loaded gun with him when he was arrested at a service station in as a convicted felon that's earned him

calling for the reinstatement of the Jackson banned which was on probation after a controversial halftime show in Brookhaven a couple of weeks ago\nThe resolution says the punishment from the
