serendipitous the Jews save the life of Robert Bowers and uh\nI was in charge I Would a deal with all the other ones first to deal with him last to know fully what a blood out but unfortunately he's alive now being cared for in a Pittsburgh hospital by Jewish doctor\nMy God and so I look about what happened in the hate this guy exhibited for many many months and I like to know where are the people\nHe communicated with well see an friend that was ... who else knew what he ... he was saying the things he was saying\nAnd and by the way he hated Donald Trump because Trump was a great friend of Israel and Bowers also had a Trump because Trump is the only American president in history they're Jewish grandchildren his daughter Ivanka\nHas become an observant Jew her husband Jared Kushner is a ah Orthodox Jew the children the president's children are Jews the president has attended many Jewish religious functions says I have and so this guy who\nAh hates Jews and wanted to kill Jews mentally ill no criminal past his neighbor said it was a great guy always very friendly\nAnd went after Trump for loving Jews is now Trump is being attacked by the mainstream media in Washington Post for somehow causing directly or indirectly the murder of Jews when Trump is the best friend Israel and the Jewish people I've ever had\nA few hours ago Sarah Sanders put out a tweet presidential press secretary quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post went out exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh\nWas committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel\nSo oh one headline Saturday yesterday in the Washington Post said bomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump\nTo put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans so that the president's being tried to assassination attempts and the murder of Jews\nNot by some far left wing website is filled with hate but by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post that are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they're not\nIn fact on the day that CNN received\nThe photo bomb in the mail from ...\nThe New York times ran a progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself assassinating President Trump with Russian help it's unbelievable on that day\nAnd in fact CNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know what's a co sponsor of the play in Washington park\nThat simulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare's Julius Caesar they had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and the performance\nAnd uh one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN\nNow can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent company of Fox News had a play in Central Park that simulated this stabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama\nI Want to know the media reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor see Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar that had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump being stabbed to death\nIn fact after James Hodgkinson attempt at the masses fascination of Republican members of Congress resulting in a motor wounds to Stephen ...\nThe Washington Post the next day ran a story about stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio even though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate\nOf a Bernie Sanders\nAnd also posted many complimentary things about Rachel Maddow so instead of focusing on the fact Hodgkinson actually traveled hundreds of miles to the Capitol take the leadership of the house of representatives and it was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter or frequent viewer of MSNBC\nThe Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by right wing talk radio\nOver the last several weeks much like the ah the photo bomb sent through about fourteen people\nThere have been at least twenty examples\nOf left wing or sending envelopes filled with white powder\nFor many many Republicans in fact all Republicans\nPeople like secretary defense James Mattis the president himself the vice president all the adult children of a President Trump have received in the mail envelopes containing white powder simulating rice and in fact the the the rice and like substance was sent to the home\nOf Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh so all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it\nBecause all the news that fits they print\nAnd if that doesn't fit and then they don't print it if there was a political violence\nCommitted by James Hodgkinson of Illinois they blame conservative right wing talk radio\nOf course we know about Ted Cruz and highly cruise chased out of restaurants\nAnd also when a Senator McConnell was having dinner in a ... restaurant a Democrat grabbed his food and threw it in the street other diners came to the assistance of Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio ... and his wife who's in the cabinet and the media\nDoesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one CNN anchor brick Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised Republicans for using the quote andme word\nOne other example whenever a white nationalist they got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street progressive activist cover the words they expressed as violence but win\nLargely violent leftist from in ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all and so this is a long history\nOf radical leftist and some on the right committing acts of violence that is covered it completely differently by the objective mainstream media the worst in my opinion\nIt's Time Warner the parent company of CNN providing money to sponsor a Shakespeare play Julius Caesar\nWhen the main actors dressed up as Trump stabbed to death and people apply\nIn fact when Louis ... Louis Farrakhan the left wing nation of Islam on big at the end I semi settled a large rally that Jews are termites in thousands in attendance applauded and shared calling Jews termites\nThat is the same person Louis Farrakhan\nWhere President Bill Clinton and broccoli saying Obama stood next to had pictures taken with\nAt the funeral of Aretha Franklin and in fact a Obama had the political sense to know when he ran for the presidency and overweight not to allow the public to know that it was a friend of Louis Farrakhan they ran around together in Chicago and ...\nThat's the classic anti Semite that the media completely ignored the relationship between Farrah Khan and Obama because it was bad politically so this whole thing disgust me\nI Hope soon very soon but a Bowers is killed either a by lethal injection ... heading electric chair shooting whatever it takes ... hours has got to go the way it Timothy McVeigh for violence and Bowers\nWas a Trump hater but the Washington Post has somehow implicitly tied Trump to the murder\nOf God's loving eleven Jews yesterday morning in Pittsburgh\nThe whole thing is disgusting when I get your reaction plus we're gonna have later on David Wray affair to talk about what's happening on the southern border is anyone thought about the public health crisis caused\nBy thousands of immigrants without vaccinations flooding in the southern border with type ... measles whooping cough aids ... diarrhea gonorrhea in the health crisis cause anyone think about that\nJerry was sixty six sixty six doesn't sound to me he had a lot of life in front of him you know he really did he had he he was only just beginning to think about retirement\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers also honoring the eleven lives lost before their game against the Cleveland Browns broadcast on CBS Sports\nBut this week in June and\n[noise]\nIn Paris the president of the union of Jewish students of France Sasha Gosling calls for solidarity\nShows go to the grieving something\nCool the French government and the older brother moved across Europe because of the U.S [noise]\nTo stay strong ties regions again try this or\nHigher learning institutions in Paris dealing with anti Semitic graffiti the alleged shooter forty six year old Robert Bowers reportedly shouted all Jews must die before opening fire he faces twenty nine counts of federal crimes including hate crimes\nThe Florida Man arrested for a national a nationwide bomb scare is expected in court Monday Fox is still Keating\nFifty six year old Caesar say odd remains locked up in a small cell tomorrow will be taken across Miami Avenue to the U.S court house where he'll have his first court appearance before a federal magistrate\nTheir faces five federal counts including illegal mailing of explosives and making threats against former president in this case that's Brock Obama and Bill Clinton\nHe suspected of mailing fourteen ... pipe bombs inside\nThose bonds Santa outspoken critics of President Trump FBI fishes\nNot disclosing a motive but seeing the devices were not a hoax this is Fox News this is talk one off or not\nThe nation's homeland security secretary says recent events such as the male bonds and the deadly synagogue shooting or threats an action not to be tolerated in this country for any reason\nThe deaths in the synagogue shooting coming on the heels a mail bomb investigation is something secretary ...

welcome to the bill Cunningham showing David how you doing\nDoing great my friend about you\nGo let me share with the American people something you of a put forth in the morning you're missing UBS\nAnd that is what's going on with all this stuff going on with the mailing bombs and all that stuff going on and the victims and\nThen the potential arrest all that stuff something else is happening I think much more important in the southern border the media is covering for obvious reasons\nAnd that is that this is something being used by the mainstream media to attack the Republicans and Donald Trump but you say among other things in this article\nThe caravan of an estimated seven thousand some say it's closer to Fifteen thousand at this point of Central American migrants who's now you know well into Mexico with the Claritin ten of reaching us border with the migrants intend to seek political asylum the impetus for this latest caravan is not\nA humanitarian crisis in Central America but rather as accurately described by the wall Street Journal in Oregon I don't buy political agitator is an activist\nWho are intent on using migration is a political weapon\nTo foment border chaos and I might add to the to hurt Donald J Trump I could not conceive on a particular day at a particular time\nAt a particular place all of a sudden seven to ten thousand on doing just showed up together in one place and said let's walk through America two thousand miles away no one believes that so what happened\nWith the political educators and the activists who got this together explained that the major media will do it\nWell you know Bill thanks for highlighting this and this is the other example of weaponized migration if you recall Nineteen eighty Mariel boatlift when Fidel Castro sent a hundred and twenty five thousand\nDisenfranchised in criminal and mentally ill ah Cuban immigrants to South Florida and the idea was to use population as a way to destabilize and disrupt a you know competing country and once again we have here\nWhere we have a leftist politician in Honduras for a member of Congress\nA who's a\nAccording to vice president Pence getting backing from the Venezuelan government no friend of the United states who has stirred up and created a caravan of some Thirteen thousand as many Thirteen thousand people\nSome of whom are our economic migrants and they say they're coming here just to work\nBut others are MS Thirteen a gang members deportees there's also\nA man of working age from Asia and from a a\nAsia or East Asia and South Asia coming this way what you have here is uh if you just watch on TV where they try to do this you know people are just are coming along and doing it on their meals are suddenly appearing pets are suddenly appearing medical care is certainly appealing this this is not\nSomething that just happened on its own nobody is coordinating this and paying for this you don't believe me why don't you take your wife and kids and try walk in Louisville, Kentucky and see where you end up tonight to who puts the tests\nA four year with the medical care and the free hot food I mean it just doesn't happen like that these things are coordinated\nAnd there are a government behind this that are trying to destabilize the United states and let's let's be honest here\nIs it a coincidence that this is happening just ten days away probably the most important mid term election and your in my lifetime I mean that is not a coincidence vibrant and on top of that there are now three caravans coming\nTo now because the media doesn't cover this because all the news that fits they print and this doesn't fit the narrative the megaphone at the Democratic party explain why here we are getting ready for a week from Tuesday is going to be a very important election all of a sudden\nTens of thousands of my door and show up at the same place at the same time with precision began marching together ... along with food and I'm an army marches on his belly along with water intensive medical care all these things just just came out of nowhere and now there's three events happening with the media will uncover what are they\nWell you know there there are three separate\nUh caravans that are formed the largest one that we're talking about now and then to to smaller ones in El Salvador one that hasn't even left yet\nBut I mean on the one hand the reporters are saying these are women pushing their baby strollers and then they you know they make the mistake of panning the crowd and showing the visual and I've seen a\nPictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen trays of hot meals being handed obscene medical supplies\nAnd so on they are you know trying to uh I think that you know how the Mariel boatlift\nAnd not only destabilized South Florida but it ended up leading probably two or Jimmy Carter's a election down fall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by leftist government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nIs embarrassing him because on balance because it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb

to say that he bangles a minute and change a hill half time there in Kansas City\nUm and it looks like the narrative of a old Andy Dalton and uh\nAnd Marvin Lewis on prime time radio look\nI I Know we don't like to take lazy tactics here on Fox Sports radio and and take do lazy takes but you know I mean they're not proven anybody wrong at this point\n[noise] [noise] right and uh I guess I'd ask you this yeah\nAre they supposed to win this year [noise] I I think you should go into every game believing that you should win okay if you are to blame that on this game called you bet on right now in the city\nI I just saw that's the hard thing to it when you look through the course of their primetime games\nI Would be interested to know how many of their favorite like how many they actually just legitimately dropping or how many of them are more the an underdog or heavy underdog and they had a chance to win but just didn't play their best like that's why they're underdog\nYeah um well I Know that there's been several playoff games where they were uh they they were hosting a no Pittsburgh was one I Believe they were hosting against the jets if I'm not mistaken so there's been some of those but this isn't just on Andy Dalton uh Marvin Lewis hasn't had a great track record but I actually think they're\nA pretty talented ... where do you stack is is the AFC North is it the best division and football\nThe AFC North I Know the honesty sounds pretty good um ... there's a lot of parity there see west with the exception of 'em will probably the raiders and I I don't think the Broncos are as bad as they've been\nAh even though they won Thursday night um yeah there's the north is probably the most competitive I think that ... says a lot of parity in it yeah I'm so ... year and you're out at that gives us three teams legitimately playing for ...\nI'm also a live that Jesus has sent out a tweet he should be making it a parent's your momentarily like look I look I I'm not\nI Can't wait for that ball ... this is ... and again or just the cheap shots at a guy who's really put in his time if you're new to the show here's how this works so alive but Jesus uh started appearing on our show a couple of years ago\nWe've never met him a piece of paper fell down onto the desk after all the lights went out I thought we had an earthquake or something here at in Southern California and on the piece of paper there was a bet abetting lying on a game that was going on and it said signed alive that Jesus and I thought it was a one time thing\nAnd as it turns out no it was not just a one time thing he's now showed up virtually every single week since then\nAnd um he has not been too consistent as of late ah he's ah he's lost a bunch she's won a couple and break when thinks it's a nice thing to do to pick on the guy or gal whatever he is or she is and I I Do not happen to agree I think it's kind of messed up to be honest with\nYou I mean here's the deal we don't have him on the show because consistently comes on 'cause he gets this stinks\nWe have them on the show because he's supposed to give our listeners some betting advice so they can win the cash and then they can do something fun with it or maybe have a few extra cocktails okay that's why we bring them on the show he's not winning that's my frustration\nHe needs to go on vacation for a few weeks that wouldn't be ... was it I think you should take it was\nBecause he didn't even let you finish you didn't even like even if you just grabbed his crotch and said I'm getting in and you ain't stopping you ain't stopping me you are not\n... sounds like something that's\nPretty dangerous ... yeah well you know what I mean a like a crotch child or they don't ... I don't know what are your dad I well not not off limits local I'm off\nLimits to cause all the lights went out in the studio so I Can't see a damn thing all I see is a floating piece of paper down onto the desk and that's either\nA an actual bet on a scripture shut down from ... Jesus or somebody is outside the studio littering and I got to believe it would probably be the ladder so here we go now onto the desk I Will open up this piece of paper on the air or just\nYou know on the up and up [noise]\nHis tonight on the twenty first date of October twenty eight teen I live that Jesus proclaimed me pick to be a [noise] bangles plus Nineteen and a half [noise] how 'bout that Brady getting a lot of points\nYeah we'll see for South\n\nHey it's been mother here everybody's got to do is drop off the dry cleaning pick up some milk here's an idea of what's that save hundreds of

migrants streamed through southern Mexico heading toward the United states after making an end run around Mexican agents who briefly ... bought them at the Guatemalan border Fox's William last year that\nIs made an end run this afternoon around Mexican agents who briefly stopped them the numbers have swelled to about ten thousand\nAnd every time you watch ABC or CNN interview one of them they talk about the gentleman by talking about what Trump wants you to do and the F. word all these things are shouted against our president\nThey're they're getting help from sympathetic Mexicans at every turn offer them food and water clothing transportation driving pickup trucks and vans and cargo truck stop the let them clamor board to go north\nAnd so over the next several weeks we're going to have tens of thousands of individuals from the most violent place\nOn Mother Earth make their way into Texas Nevada Arizona and basically the media is telling us we should encourage it and not let and let it occur like Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that she would welcome all the migrants from Central America all of them\nWell there's about thirty five million who live in Central America there's about a hundred and forty million in Mexico\nThere's another two hundred million in South America polling has indicated given a choice\nSouth American Central Americans and Mexicans suddenly like two hundred million would come to America to a hundred million what would that do to our government to our welfare spending ... hospitals do our presidents we wouldn't have a country anymore to hundred million want to come here and because the way the law is constituted\nThat are the Democrats were not allowed to change it takes ten Democrats and the Senate to do anything and they will permit it they will permit\nBecause if you're from other than Mexico to him the other words from Central America and you may go to America there's a magic card that you have to read seeking refugee status and that begins a legal process it will take years\nIn the meantime you're inside of America waiting for a hearing that cannot take place we're not scaled they have enough camps\nThey have enough judicial officers do you have enough lawyers are not scaled for any of this to allow tens of thousands or millions to arrive at our border so far this year until October first which is what about two and a half weeks ago we have a hundred and Seventy five thousand migrants have come to America this year\nFrom a central and South America hundred and Seventy five thousand we don't have the judges the lawyers the courtrooms to hold hearings hundred and seven hundred Seventy five thousand when you have five to ten year backlogs of millions who adopted her jet\nAnd so the game being played by the Democrats is extremely serious if you're from Mexico here legally you mean taken right back immediately if you're from central\nAmerica you have the right to hearing that goes on and on and on and never stops so ah I I'm interested to see when and if the media will change their coverage\nTo provide objective information the damages caused\nBy unbridled massive illegal migration from third world poverty driven criminals societies into America and what the impact that has in schools orphanages hospitals and the rest there's no media coverage of what's happening in Nevada Arizona California\nTexas through New Mexico through legal migration ... there's no coverage it doesn't exist the murders of rapes et cetera it does not exist\nRemember that nine of the ten most violent countries in the world or south of the U.S border\nSixteen of the ... most violent the other foreign Africa and they're invading our country they don't have uniforms on but they're coming here in mass incentivized by our media by the Democratic party\nI sat in twenty sixteen the reason Trump shocked the world was because of illegal immigration\nFederal judges and the economy right\nNow with Trump is our leader everything is coming up roses it's unbelievable\nTrump has everyone from North Korea\nTo Russia believing we're about to bust up every new treaty necessary to keep to get America back on the even track the trade imbalances are starting to flip he has an economy exceeding five percent GDP\nThe unemployment numbers so not just the ... the lowest they ever could be the or the other three point seven percent of us would not work can be put a gun to their head the terrorists are on the run\nISIS is destroyed Iran is on notice in marginalized and even the Saudis now are doing some soul searching about how they treat people opioid issues prison reform marijuana reform is all coming on the rise this guy is performing magnificently\nBut the media is going to use they think immigration the tank the twenty eight teams to favor the Democrats and the tank this president and twenty twenty now that's not the world that I live in maybe if you live in Connecticut a Las Vegas or Chicago\nOr California San Diego that's the world you live and you want more individuals here was a third grade education Eighteen to twenty eight years old with no marketable skills not able to speak at the English you want maybe a few thousand more in your community\nPlease bring them\nAccording to the Democratic party but that's not the word I live in Cincinnati, Ohio I don't think those who think about these issues\nIn Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego Tampa Denver Cincinnati I don't think we think about these issues in ways that the mainstream media can understand I must live in some alternative universe because according to CNN this is the issue\nOf unbridled migrants walking into America that will cause average Americans living in Wisconsin and Michigan the vote for the Democratic party if that's the case I live in some alternative universe that's not the world in which I live\nI'm Sorry and I wish there was some way through the magic wand that we go to help the two or three hundred million Mexicans Central Americans and south Americans not living a great life that don't have the opportunity to you and I have\nWe're only four percent of the world's population but every year legally through press as these we take in legally one point one million foreigners to come into America takes the oath of office and become American citizens which is more than the rest of the world put together we already do that one point one million\nBut I'll be damned if I'm going to sit here\nAnd watch hordes of young males from El Salvador Guatemala and Nicaragua Mexico Venezuela Colombia Peru Bolivia Paraguay why Europe why Brazil and Argentina it simply\nIllegally make their way somehow into America claim their quota refugee get in line for hearings five or ten years from now that will never happen\nThis is fundamentally changed our country that is far and it's going to be much worse\nIf in twenty Eighteen one and two weeks two weeks in two days the Democrats take the house and or the Senate\nIf that out if that happens the country we live and will cease to exist do we have the do we have the wherewithal to take in a hundred million people\nAre the schools coined in such a fashion other hospitals ready to go or other bridges the roads the expressway ready to accept a hundred million more people because the Democratic party says that's what's coming how is this possible\nThat's the most violent places on earth and sending us largely young males to come into America\nI got a Kevin Jackson coming up later an African American leader of great note there is no race or group of people more hurt by legal immigration than African American males especially young African American males they figured out\nThat this is not benefit them at all doesn't benefit American business does it benefit American public education does it benefit the hospital systems that we have the benefit of any part of our does it benefit our jobs economy absolutely\nNot we bring in legally one point one million and I'm proud to say that we are a nation of immigrants but there are legal immigrants you don't determine for yourself to join the country come in walk into a country which you don't belong to another citizen up men demand rights are you kidding me\n\nOh last year the question tonight is that the issue that's going to cause millions of Americans in two weeks and two days to vote for Democrats do you believe that\nOne eight six six six or seven seven three three seven we continue we have calls from a Chicago Los Vegas Connecticut California San Diego and every place in between coming up later will be Corey Lewandowski\nWho was the Trump campaign manager for a year and a half and twenty six team did a great job I'm going to have ... plus Kevin Jackson twenty

border and a week or so they're trying to get over a hundred thousand of hope that the poor you know by the time spring hits him\nBecause of the Trump has already said he's not used in the reserves you shouldn't use that real army and I think the plan is they want to be like another ... kinds of thousand troops on the border\nThe immigrants are being told oh don't worry store of it like storm the Mexican border a few days ago I Would put it in a token effort to hold them twenty four hours or ... the U.S and deal with Mexico because Trump has got a straight in Mexico are true at all these

financial difficulty\nI does this play well with residents of Connecticut because when I watch CNN or NBC News I'm thinking they're thinking this was playing horribly for Trump where I live in Ohio\nWe don't want ... will happily take one point one million every year more than the rest of the world put together as legal citizen to take the oath and go through the process we don't want hordes of illegals come and go most violent places on earth we don't want that is this playing well in Connecticut\nAnd Connecticut there's so many people fleeing the state because of the high taxes I

conned boys or that\nOr whatever they are called uh they can't have that capability and they should find out who's doing that also how Obama drone American citizens like this Ella we eat guy kill and blow 'em up\nYou know trial no ... no execution and then the media doesn't saying no doubt that they really do much later they killed as a sixteen year old son\nWell and and it's because you know ... ... ... it's in the view of CNN 'cause she'll get can be used as a club against Trump they'll do it but\n... out of wacky being killed by Obama is no big deal the Iowa college kid raped and killed by not a legal immigrant or not was quickly dropped she's gone a composite or killed on a regular basis no big deal in fact that ... that kind of behavior in that part of the world\nIs regular that's what goes on there and I don't like it much but I think CNN doesn't like the fact that Israel is become friendly with Saudi Arabia I mean when I heard Trump and somehow I hear Trump's comments about journalists\nAnd then I hear about ... show again is if Trump indirectly killed the guy that is what CNN get do and why why did why more valuable than a comfortable life\nNPR ... which is subsidized by the taxpayer says the same I end up look at the head of the past set of who's backed a stand against the oil as political opponents right both Porsche and Obama and Secretary Clinton looked at the

B. B. and I heart radio station [noise]\nCorey Lewandowski welcome again to the bill cutting ... Corey how are you I'm doing great how are you today\nDoing well you know about a week ago I spent some time with the president a privately it was wonderful you spent like\nHundreds or thousands of hours with the guy and I sit on the air the other day that uh\nThere there's a differential between what I see in the media sometimes with the president and how he truly is before we get on to so many issues going on especially the mobs versus jobs and all that guns do you give the American people a measure of the man himself\nWell you know I spent so much time with a then candidate Trump but now President Trump he's truly cares about other people he's extremely magnanimous and private he is funny he's gracious he's always asking about how my family is doing and what he can do to help me that just who he is and if you listen to the media\nIs the worst human being on the planet but the truth is he's exceptionally gracious I've seen so many times\nHelping people that never get the story told because he doesn't want the story told but he's always there to help whenever we can\n... why is that because the media ought to be calling balls and strikes you know they ought to be saying well this is what's going right this is what's going wrong media ... Research Center ... well ... all one of my buddies\nEvery few months as the media coverage is Ninety two percent negative Ninety five percent negative the media is protected by the U.S constitution only business in America that gets constitutional protection the media should call balls and strikes a lot of good stuff a lot of bad stuff why does the media only report the bad enough the good\nThey only report the bad and the ministry of the Obama administration you would think that our economy is growing at four percent and we had more American working than any other time in our nation's history conflated those to see the Trump agenda is not what the mainstream media wants to talk about here is a great example just last week I think it was\nA President Trump did an interview with least offer sixty minutes\nShe interrupted him the five times during that interview to put that in comparison when she missed during an interview with a bomb or a couple of years ago they interrupted him more times have their own agenda their agenda is to make the president look bad\nNot to give him credit they deserve the successes that he can because they no longer in\nAnd this of reporting the news they're now in the business of making the news and that the big change over the last two decades\nCorey Lewandowski the president or the other night Montana framed in his mobs\nVersus jobs the only difference is the Edmond J and I think that's brilliant on his part because one look at Brett Kavanaugh all along about a trucks\nThat ever trumps sticker on getting burned I look at congressman getting shot I look at the Republican congressman Republican operatives getting beat up and getting stuck in the side with pen\nI look at how you're confronted in airports in restaurants mobs versus jobs and do you think the average American I think forty percent of what the president forty percent oppose him there's twenty percent going back and forth do you think that the moniker of the president mobs versus jobs is going to stick\nI think it will stick because what the American people see and hear what people like Eric Holder had to say very recently when they're down we kick them and we kick them in the head you know the the cost of violence by the leaders of the Democratic party whether it's\nA Maxine Waters or other is saying if you see them in a gas station if you see them in a restaurant you go after them you don't give them a break you know that's not the way our country is supposed to be and I didn't support proper Obama but never ever ever did I ever remember\nRepublicans or conservatives for that matter going after members of the previous administration when they're eating dinner at a restaurant we've now seen it with\nSarah Huckabee Sanders we've seen with secretary Nielsen ... we've seen it with Senator Ted Cruz we've seen what happened to Congressman Steve ... where he almost lost his life\nBecause the mob violence say antifa is so out of control here and there you go on their desire is destruction it's not to make our country better this president has created\nI think over four million new jobs in the last Twenty one months and that's where we should be doing look even if you don't want this president if you didn't want him to succeed you want him to succeed because you want our country and succeed and that's what the differences\nThat Democrats I hate to say this and they hate this president more than they love their country\nOr the other issue the culturally is acceptable to me the fame and to make fun of an industry or the president and the first lady you may recall about a week ago TI who's a rapper that I Will watch nonetheless I saw him and TMZ\nAnd I did a video in which a look alike millennia Trump was stripping nude in the oval office performing sex acts in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure he might sell a lot of\nLot of his songs and records and that can you imagine three years ago if a country artist\nHad to pick the Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office and performing sex acts in the oval office what would the outcry from the media have been if it was Michelle Obama\nIt wouldn't be front page news for a week on end that wrap that the the country artist would have had his life\nProbably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back to just getting about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and they asked her\nNew you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was\nNo it was appropriate because she was an adult president of the United states leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's behavior can you imagine for one second that was the the Congress if Donald Trump\nThe last election from Bernie Sanders right we'll put those back

who told us that Juanita Broderick\nWhen Clinton raped her what what's a bloody lab told her a roommate what happened the roommate solved the blood on her lap saw her pantyhose was torn she actually had four or five corroborating witnesses as the event took place and then they also had the so called uh Arkansas state troopers confirming the fact\nThat the Juanita abroad ... was actually raped and then you have while he's in the White House is president sexually groping and molesting Kathleen Willie in the White House\nAnd that was well known and corroborated but the media completely ignored both of those events because it didn't fit did it but it did go to their bread Kevin Oh\nAbsolutely and so that that's the double standard and then the bigger double than it has to do more with men\n... me too movement and trying to to I Love how the left tries to migrate thing how they try to get us to take ownership so the ownership of me too is a bunch of left this letter it's Hollywood left these [laughter] okay it's the Harvey Weinstein of the world with all these young on the news and these\nOld school actresses and all these pop political feminists\nTaking pictures at Harvey going to his party's extending its virtues that awards dinners and so on while enabling him to do exactly what he's been doing for women for a decade\nDating back decades and and all the the the trail of women who did exactly what Harvey ask them to do getting their butts ...\nOut and then suddenly when their careers are waning they decide they want to turn states' evidence but then what's interesting me to\nA ends up being a bill ends up being part of a\nWoman being used against Kavanaugh being used against ah the high powered CEOs of companies this movement is born of the lectures activities of left us in Hollywood that and and and the entertainment industry where they marginalized objectify women like crazy\nAnd suddenly a guy like cabin all they want to make him the poster\nChild I mean it just it pours me\nAnd when it came time for Obama to put his daughters\nOn summer in terms of physicians would somebody a Brock Hussein Obama and Michelle Obama selected Harvey Weinstein to to take their daughters ended the Hollywood scene when they knew or should have known exactly what was going on from all their connections but they couldn't care less Harvey Weinstein was a star\nHarvey Weinstein had access Harvey Weinstein was are making millions of dollars and giving millions the Democratic party including the Obamas so they sent their own daughter's into the character has been in control of Harvey Weinstein and the media didn't cover that either did they\nKnow they didn't but here's what's interesting about that so they know Harvey their daughters are untouchable but you know whose daughter's aren't bill the daughters of ordinary people there the daughter that you know that you got to be concerned about because Harvey will take advantage of them but the ... the what the what rock Obama telling you is\nI have so much power I Know that this guy that electorate slap this who will take advantage of women and every time but I could put my daughters with them but don't you dare put yours\nThat's exactly how the left stacks up I can do it you can't because I'm covered but you're not\nAnd and look at it the less than it is a precautionary

look at what you did to me more if he's not even going to remember it he is not going to be insignificant to him and her but because something may be important in life she decide I'll take him down for what\nWell you know it's it was hanging by a thread two weeks ago and now he's on the court and I think the other issue I Want to get your perspective on this Kevin Jackson and the black sphere which is the what's happening now with the Honduran migrants\nComing through a Guatemala into Mexico right now is three to five thousand strong and they're heading toward the Texas border this is a terrible event for the Democrats over the next two weeks before the election they have the video and the pictures of thousands of migrants\nWhenever I watch MSNBC all I hear about is women and children then I see the video of these migrants coming to urban areas and in America and they're almost always young males and the young women tend to be raped or sexually molested the men are drug meals and I'm sure there's good family members among them\nAnd Kevin Jackson of you and your wife and your children were in a\nMore in Honduras in a bill Cunningham and my wife and kids were in\nAnd we're in Honduras living the horrors of socialistic left wing military hunter regime\nThe first thing I Would want to do would be to get to America I understand that completely but along the process it gives billions of dollars damage Thirteen other gang bangers to provide the passage every time you go through some other drug infested area Mexico you got to pay\nHomage you gotta pay either sex or money to even pass through and and live by the time you get to the northern part of Mexico according to sixty minutes about two months ago there was hundreds of dead bodies because some men did not want to participate and becoming drug meals to give drugs into America\nSome women were killed because they did not want to be ritual is typically raped on a regular basis this is a horrible journey I watch MSNBC this is about refugee status of desperate people I watch other news outlets and this is terrible Trump's going to send supposedly\nOur soldiers in the southern border to stop it and all of this is playing out during an election that the Democrats supposedly have in the bag because hundreds of millions of dollars up to a billion and it's been pumped into these campaign or buy a Tom's dire and by Bloomberg and others\nIn order to uh to me are Republicans all over the counter and get get get get me over the next two weeks you mean how's this going to play out I like to early on November the sect\nBut Democrats have missed every find they no longer have their finger on the pulse of the American electorate [noise] people want our border protected and so they and they also get that this is fake news it's contrived it started as a hundred and sixty people now it's up to four thousand how\nAnd so what prompted the right thing he said Honduras these people show up you're losing their aid Mexico I guarantee he made the same call to the new president of Mexico and say look\nIf these people get through you were going to renegotiate our trade agreements we are going to look at the age were able to send you\nSome Mexico the polling military on the southern border got just heard this literally today good so Mexico's going at it Honduras I bet you will send buses the say\nYou get it you're going to get back to our country or else and and ... what the lay out they're going to play out to Democrats again overplay their hand\nThey think that some issue that's going to be the ... the you know the ... the division point\nWith Americans in Americans overwhelmingly won our borders protect that we don't want these migrating horse to think that they can just come anytime they want so whether whether it's the kind of effect\nOr whether it's the Kavanaugh fact whether it's this farce of an investigation of the Russian they'll which we now see that that is completely been busted part because the judge Royce Lamberth\nWho just said I don't understand how Cheryl Mills isn't in prison and Clinton a bunch of others and then there's a conspiracy what the FBI so that's about to break that's going to be the big story this week\nAnd then you've got this yet again read a guarded Haitian of the whole border issue that Trump's going to send troops and say you're not going in no\nIn fact on doors you know Kevin Jackson it's bad for a hundred doors in Guatemala and Mexico\nThere's ten uh males generally males to America because it takes away the ability of Hondurans to reform their own government because the safety valve is there to send people to other countries and so what's left are those who\nThis is a border there's already overwhelmed just

simply continue\nThe other night on Fox on watching and uh the speaker made a comment the expert on the administrative agency slashing the Congress\nThat made the comment that every year in matter who's the president somebody like three thousand new rules are put into effect by the alphabet soup federal government agencies and uh they're simply a room making that becomes law making which is completely different than what the founding fathers and then at what the constitution did not invent\nThe consequences of not necessary rules and regulations the costs the American economy billions of dollars every year\nThe constitutional separation of powers been compromised in other words\nThe the the the the agencies that the federal government or the state government agencies were mainly the federal government agencies are accountable to no one other time lawsuits are filed might be years before their compromise and you can't even begin to stop three thousand new rules going into effect and that as a consequence we Americans\nAre going to question the legitimacy of their own government when it's completely on accountable or good men Peter Wallison is written a book judicial fortitude or subtitled but last chance draining the administrators state and uh Peter Wallison welcome for the first time the bill Cunningham show Peter how are you\nI'm fine thanks to go to have you here a couple of weeks ago of course we got a the fifth conservative vote on\nThe Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh which is a good thing and in his writings and the second circuit court of appeals where he was for twelve years Brett Kavanaugh often knocked down the administrative state ruled by rule which is a great thing now described as the American people what is the administrator state and how does an impact our lives\nAre the minister the aid is all of the federal agencies including everything from the Treasury Department [noise]\nAll the way down to the FCC and there are hundreds of them and the way that they impact their lives is that they make a lot of rules and regulations on staff\nIn many cases generations old and those rules and regulations are not only credit for all that is there are many of them\nBut they have a major effect on our lives and the purpose of the book that I had written is to explain that the we have to rein in in in some way\nAnd it was ... when the when you when you say we have to train them in who is we\n[noise] uh well the American people have to bring them in and the way to do it is so unfortunately the only way to do it is through the court system and that's why your point about a\n... a Brett Kavanaugh having been confirmed for the Supreme Court is very important because I think he is the road\nOf the five of the five member majority would be interested in raining in the administrator state by cutting back on the activities and the rules that they're able to make\nYou give me a concrete example and I think government agencies I think of the FCC I think the Irish but\nYou're telling me there's hundreds of government agencies bureaucrats about about one point two million strong new every day meeting offices mainly in Washington about our little all over the country and then they got to do something they just can't sit there and drink coffee all day so\nIt's ... in acting rules because they want because they have some generic piece of legislation giving them real making powers and then they issue these three thousand new rules a day now must be complied with how much farmers are causing us\nI think it's causing a lot of\nHarm in the sense of for a business is of course it it creates a lot of regulations that they have to comply with\nCompliance activities are very extensive for businesses one of the estimates that I have in the book is that each near it car who really in dollars to comply with government regulations\nThough that ... trillion dollars actually gets passed on to all other Americans who are consumers of the of the products that these businesses produce so\nThat an important factor and in fact a trillion dollars this more than the government actually tax rates are either from businesses or from individuals each year\nSo this is a very significant thing um but it can be turned back town they can be reduced give me hold on\nThe [laughter] the idea here and described in the book is that the courts can step in\nAnd began to review carefully the legislation under which all of these rules are made and very frequently\nUm the rules are based on laws that were ... years ago sometimes generations ago and they are in ... by the administrative agency to give them the authorities issue all these new rules and\nThe court can look at that legislation again and say wait a minute you've gone too far the Congress did not give you the authority to make this rule\nAnd there are a number of examples in the book where you can see that the that the agency has gotten well beyond what Congress actually authorize so if the court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude is necessary that's why the book is called the digital fortitude they have to have the strength\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations of um of administrative agencies then we can actually beginning to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington\nPeter Wallison let's go back in time did not hot summer in Philadelphia and Seventeen Ninety seven article one they said the founding fathers said and we believe that the Congress the house in the Senate or the most powerful instrument talent is a government because the best reflects the will of the people", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham",

was a unbelievable he's leaving for you\nAnd your data good enough then they'll fill ten minutes from now just stick around everybody or for whatever reason your local affiliate makes a mistake and switches over to something else find a Sunday I heart radio at Fox Sports Radio Nice site um so I got to ask you real quick before we hear from lie but Jesus or not that I control them or anything you just shows up when he pleases buttons yeah so the Houston Texans\n[laughter] so they're up tend to six on Sunday Night Football the first half was winding down and the Houston Texans have the ball the one yard line\nAt the Dallas Cowboy one yard line as they are approaching halftime so so they're getting in to position to try and scored a touchdown up ten to six already\nAnd for whatever reason below Bryan calls the play the Sean watching\nMisses a back out of the flat or who may have been covered the Sean watching then takes off with the football after they go forward on fourth down\nAnd gets obliterated by Jay Lynn Smith who made a fantastic played you met the guy from Notre Dame who suffered the unfortunate injury in the fiesta bowl a couple of years ago and so the Houston Texans turned the ball over on downs\nAnd the Dallas Cowboys get the football back on the one yard line\nUm what did you make it a play call and how much of this was below Brian getting crushed last week for taking the field goal and accepting a tie in his game against the Indianapolis Colts before Frank right given the when yeah\nI don't know if that had anything to do with that I just think he probably thought there was going to be a good chance they were gonna be able to get it in right um there there were I mean it was ... maybe a foot or so is all they needed um that the ... thought hell of a play by by Jones says\nUm who looks like he's you know back to his old self back to the point we saw before the tragic injury the fiesta bowl but um yeah\nI don't I don't think coaches in those moments\nHave that kind of thought process because just as a player you don't either you know it's not like you go over the last week this is what we did and you know worked out but we weren't as aggressive we need to know aggressive this week I I don't think it works like that\nAh I figure look at it as saying come on man is the first half or a a word home what's go for this thing well let's go for punching it before you go and a half side and the other thing is\nYou know there's no concern if you don't get it of them coming back at that moment 'cause there's not much time left the house and they might be getting the ball coming out of half who started off the football game to the Dallas or the football yes\nSo usually that's what we're talking about you say you want to double up so you're trying to get points there to end it and points coming out of half time and maybe they felt like it'd be more of a state of there if they got a touchdown and then a touchdown out of it now you're looking at a forty point swing in the game nobody\nAll my [noise] so so by the whitening Jesus good God brain\nThat was a big one [noise]\nEnlightening to unbelievable uh All right so the lights are completely pitch black in the studio um I Can't see anything all the TVs are out nothing we can see those to begin with\nI'm there though the the computer light is out of their their the

I read some way of a experts and independent women's forum Julie gun like coming up later on but Patrice lay on wood 'cause it's been on my show many times\nWrote a column a site this morning Sunday Morning\nAbout supporting survivors and standing with Kevin Oh she said those to promote the slogan set up a false dichotomy if you believe that survivors of sexual assault it it'd be should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you\nThat you then must believe the allegations of Christine afford therefore you must agree the judge Kevin O's line and you must opposes confirmation she said this is a false choice as a woman I can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse\nBut also care about the facts of each specific case if I was a member of a jury sitting at a rate matter my sympathy would be what the victim\nHowever I Want to hear the evidence or lack of corroboration and inconsistencies to make sure the correct parties identified and she goes on to point out the number of times the Innocence Project and others have exonerated through late DNA testing\nRape rapist to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory towns\nAnd Van Dyke Perry who spent a combined thirty seven years in prison on false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime and the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted that she lied or how about the Hofstra University case\nIn which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from Hofstra their lives ruined about a gang rape of an Eighteen year old fellow students and twenty nine\nThe accuser later admitted that are allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges but the damage to these young men and their families were already done plus innocent projects it go to innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men exonerated\nOf rape charges when later evidence came out why can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent of the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate\nBut ten percent or more are not accurate in other words there are uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock\nOf American Jurisprudence this writer goes on to say as a woman as a mother has a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness and the me too movement these fires are not in competition to treat men\nFairly all victims deserve justice but justice is not one sided due process in fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men\nSo when you look at the allegations of professor Christina forward\nThey completely fall apart they don't exist\nThere is no cooperation and so you can't say we support the me too movement\nAnd we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty those two principles are not in conflict except in the minds of Cory Booker\nKamala Harris and a senator Hirono of Hawaii when asked this morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist to chase down Republicans in restaurants in elevators and airports she could not say that his wrongful activity she couldn't say that\nIn fact they indirectly demand violence against Republicans and\nShow you where we are Steven ... of the Late Show has a terrible late

Stephen Colbert aerial Duma says it clearly quote whatever happens I'm just glad ruined Brett Kavanaugh as life\nThey want it to ruin am for the sake of ruining him because he didn't vote the way they wanted him to vote and he was nominated by Trump who they hate\nThat sums up the entire difficulties with Democrats they now try to dig out from their own rubble for coming midterms suddenly they were woken the Republican conservative majority and now we're more energized the vote than we've ever been because the Democratic party has shown us their backside and it's an ugly backside\nLet's continue

Fox News Simon character this is Fox News [noise]\nThis is from Gulf Coast mornings with Kelly met one of these talks before nine WB is the\nRadio station and the great American\nI'm not I'm not felt this good in so many years I Can't stand them to rely upon Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham\nTo be the key voices the United States Senate\nI didn't think I'd ever see this in my lifetime Susan Collins stood up like a tenfold beginning the night she was brilliant\nGoing over for forty five minutes why she was going to support and then I I tried to listen and Lisa Murkowski you made no sense at all it seems like slime ball tactics have good consequences as long as you make the slime ball tactics they seem to work Lisa Murkowski in Alaska I mean there was no reason she could not listen to what Susan Collins had to say\nAnd and maybe she hates Trump's so much you could not stand to put one of his nominees when the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I'm so proud of ah Brett Kavanaugh was wife his mom and dad is girls and what they had to put up with like he was crucified on the Democratic cross of political correctness in title nine that's what boys go through in college when charged with a girl\nUp some sexual assault the most likely did not happen to get into title nine court and presumption of innocence cross examination of witness confronting you're accused was all that kinda stuff doesn't apply\nSo in the minds of Democrats this was the title nine case in which the allegation was made\nAnd therefore you cannot investigate professor Ford\nOnce investigated mainly by the conservative media practically everything Ford said fell apart including the four eyeball witnesses\nIncluding her river version of the facts from her twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen therapists notes including the front door the fear of flying whatever it was I'm not sure she said anything that was truthful at all nothing\nAnd so Lisa Murkowski is stupid the woman from Alaska stupid Susan Collins took some serious flak\nFrom the radical left like my friend Bryan kill me did a Fox and friends and she stood up and did what was right I don't know if she's going to run for reelection and two years but she ought to\nBut now a clowns fools to come out of the woodwork like Valerie Jarrett open gossipy famed to run against or in Maine have asked\nLet's continue their calls is go to a Lewis in Chicago Lewis in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Lewis go ahead\nThanks bill appreciate you taking my call Yes sir I just wanted to comment on the relationship of the Democratic party to the pornography industry if you don't mind sure\nYeah do you know the Democrats claim to care about women but over the years I wanted her largest supporters has been the pornography in St I'm just wondering if they really cared about women why do they take money from these people who would like women that way\nAbout Michael ever noted the porn lawyer and I think he did a great job I mean he's got to be on Don Lemon put 'em on CNN or MSNBC a lot more times Michael Lebanon is such a loud mouth clown in such an embarrassment he defends porn stars and this guy says he's going to run against the president twenty twenty\nCould we be that lucky Michael having any run against ...\nI Hope he does bill but I tell you you know if you look back to the Clinton years they didn't have one criminal parts should against pornography and open the doors to all this I Believe I Believe it open the doors to all this bad stuff this pilot stuff you see out there\nThe porn star to porn industry has given millions of dollars in\nThe Democrats along with the abortion industry so killing babies in sub spaghetti women to lie for sexual assault is what the Democratic Party is all about if they if they cared about sexual assault or women\nThan their leader would not be the U.S Congressman Ellison and he would not be the candidate in Minnesota and they're really cared about women and sexual assault Bill Clinton will not serve out his term if they really care and the enabler Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton wouldn't have been the nominee and twenty sixteen if they really cared about sexual assault correct\nCorrect absolutely right and do you know but actually are doing a lot of harm to women these people because uh you know the old effect of the boy who cried wolf now nobody's going to believe women who are are telling the truth\nOr if a woman comes forward with the probably eight or nine times out of ten is correct but every now and then you have the Hofstra every now and then you have the Duke lacrosse team or UBA every now and then you have the Innocence Project that's listed hundreds of men cleared of rape charges\nFrom false allegations and so yeah I'm going to believe a woman a Ninety percent of the time but I Want to hear the story I'm sympathetic with professor Ford I Want to hear what happened how it happened\nHow'd you get to the party how'd you get home from the party Hoover the eyewitnesses tell me about the second door tell me about the fear of flying all these things\nLewis turned out to be a lie or misstatement or not true you know the truthful thing that happened is I think in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen when she wants to see her therapist she spoke the truth\nAnd she said and twenty ... twenty Thirteen before a Kevin always going to be a nominee she told the therapist\nThat she was a attempted rape by four boys\nIn her late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties and the reason it didn't fit Kevin Oh it's because he was one boy and by the mid Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not living in Maryland anymore he had moved to Connecticut so she had to\nTell the fib that it was Kevin all but the but the notes of the therapists clearly indicated it could not have been bred Kevin all you see if you go to a therapist or a doctor and you're seeking help psychiatric help or medical assistance\nYou are incentivized to tell the truth you're not going to go to a doctor and say my right arm hurts when it's really your left foot\nBecause you want treatment so when Dr Ford went to a therapist in twenty ... twenty Thirteen who made copious notes about what she said out of her own mouth she said and twenty twelve that four boys tried to rape me when I was in my late teens and made Nineteen eighties\nShe had flipped out on Kavanaugh and change the story completely suddenly there was one boy and not for\nHeaded to the seventh inning with the Dodgers leading the series two games to none in game three of the other LDS the

two weeks ago then I'm of course a man and you may be a woman but if you're a woman you're probably married to a man or was married to a man or want to be married to a man your father was a man what kind of feelings Deb George your husband and your dad\nYour brothers are male what kind of feelings damp tore them and you may have male children or grandchildren you want to live in a world\nWhere because of your gender your automatically just believed or believed in other words every now and then a woman lives and every now and then a man is not guilty of rape or sexual assault happens all the time\nSo you can't say because a woman speaks we must listen or because a man is charged he's got to shut up\nThere was a line to be murdered merged between the me too movement on one hand and went on a ... percent acceptance on the other\nThe fact you want to believe a victim of a crime which I naturally would do is a criminal defense attorney a take off my dad and I generally believe all of a person's as their car was stolen or a person says my house Roseburg colorized or victim of an arson or a victim of sexual assault naturally want to believe that person\nBut then if a person is charged I Want to live in a world that says\nThat person is due process rights because that is the rigorous reaction of substantive and procedural due process that pursues the truth and make sure that those are telling the truth or confirmed and those that are lying or reject\nAnd Democrats never wanted to put professor Ford through a any rigorous process that determined voice you were saying was accurate now here we are several days later\nAfter she testified what about ten days ago that practically everything she said was false including the number of people got attacked or what had happened how it happened ... how old she was the timeframe it happened in\nThe two front door was a kind of hard but fearing the fly was ridiculous and her boyfriend came out in fact she was a safe\nAnd some of these other facts come out and you're thinking now wait a minute maybe what I heard originally\nIs not accurate when Chris Wallace of Fox News\nAfter she testified said the Republicans are in trouble I thought to myself oh hold up on that car let's find out what Brett Kavanaugh has to say and now that she's testified there's going to be a several day process to check out what she says is if it's accurate\nThe two front doors was either a misrepresentation or ally\nBecause the front door went in and twenty oh eight not twenty twelve and a one and not because she needed an extra way out but because\nA small business owner a therapist want it to rent a part of her house and she wanted a separate entrance for her patients which was the second front door that had nothing to do with Koester phobia\nAnd the boyfriend follows the affidavit saying we've for little planes all over French Polynesia to Haiti and uh Hawaii\nWe also went on trips to Central America to South America and Europe she had no fear of flying it was a lie but there was nothing she said first later turned out to be accurate but see the Democratic party didn't care about\nFinding the truth they had a ball face mitigated allegation that could not stand the rigors of due process so they quickly ignored and said if you want to get into the veracity pursuit were not with you on that she said\nShe is mainly X chromosomes therefore we believer and the person with the Y chromosomes that's a lawyer\nBut then the truth came out and it's like well don't don't bother me with the facts that's what caused the writer for the Kobe or CBS late night show to say quote aerial doom is said quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruin Brett Kavanaugh as life unquote\nFat is reflective and indicative of what the

are you good really I think we need to learn from experience and you had an earlier caller I think it was Bryan maybe at it that was in its firing phone call because he like he was a traditional Democrat and he's now come over to our side\nHow are we going to get more people to come over our side I think there are three ways number three I think are people like Brian saw\nOn only dishonest they are downright evil they will do that nothing to get a power\nNumber two that Democrats socialists progress is incapable of analyzing back whether it be about climate change ... whether it be the lives that that Dr Ford presented in front of the Senate tradition\nProvable lies that we still are ignored by the mainstream media provable lie I Want to be ... say they're misconceptions but damn it they were alive because she lied about flying\nShe lied about that second front door she lied about the four boys became one she lied about her late teens now it's Fifteen she lied about the fact that was the mid Nineteen eighty nine Nineteen eighty two because Greg Kavanaugh in the mid eighties was in Connecticut she lied lied lied\nAnd she wasn't covered because she was a woman\nAnd and really let me tell you the most important thing that we learned and that is that we Republicans we didn't stand up to them before they took advantage of our moral character and we learned this time that the only way to like them is by route\nOn his political force hats off to McConnell yeah I talked to Collins hats off to Lindsey Graham about that route political forces the only way that we're going to

care what happened she is glad she room Brett Kavanaugh's like wonderful what the left and the Democrats\nHave indeed done to others they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh what they tried to do to break capital they will try and do to us if they can the second thing is is that\nOver mine this entirely destructive behavior of attacking institutions people the people of constructive in ten of these things about our society it really to me bill is nothing less than the continued some version of our nation beginning in the Nineteen twenties\nWith the communist and their attempt to undermine us from within and I don't think we see that but I think if we do a it will provide a great context for\nThe situation that we're in your Catholic as a mile or are you aware of this terrible a present

that have the Freedom Tower the church in this country a woman named ... died who was a member of the Communist Party starting in the Nineteen twenties the late twenties and for\nTwenty years I introduced into the seminary placed in the American Catholics seminaries one thousand one hundred men who were communists and\nOr no or low faith or morals and according to the plot many who were ...

McDonald what's happening to to Kanye West on the previous or Saturday Night live when he was he was blast fiend bought backstage you're wearing a magma a mega have make America great again hat\nAnd I guess the question is you and I've spoken out for years about the status of African Americans\nAnd uh and it concerns me greatly that things are getting better can you give me any advice and counsel\nWhether the urban activists committed to the Democratic party that's resulted in the failure of every institution in urban areas that they're going down in popularity and that your ideas I've taken hold can you give me any hope\n[laughter] walk I ... I can tell you that there are a younger black Americans who are starting to catch on\nAnd he actually now that President Trump is there\nAny ... speaking now started to take a look for themselves and their noticing that uh the Democrats have felt for the last Fifteen Years\nAny where Democrats in control is a cattle violence and crime in abortion and everything is out of control [noise]\nThere was an incident in Chicago as you know the habit of got caught by violent orange everyday right yeah that was a young feel like mail that the games have tried to recruit he refused to enjoy\nThey put them in a fifty five gallon barrel earmark fire alive they burned I'm Alive and that happened two years ago not doubt about that there is no outcry from their so called leadership or like creatures [laughter]\nThere's a a a ward off for the rest of the people who do that no one has been caught because the mayor of Chicago on during the Obama won't do it as well as a result of West and President Trump speaking out the blacks are starting to catch you thirty six percent\nFor now supported accredited and we're not at that number four Republican ... years\nJust Peter's you said quote when I was a Democrat I blame the white people for all my weaknesses and failures I suffered forward it wasn't until I\nReally began to look at myself to understand if I'm black and a Democrat racism is holding me back why is it that is not holding back black people who are telling me that it is racism married with kids going to good schools you say I realize I've been lied to by the Democrats\nIt wasn't about racism that why people are not holding me back and Democrats didn't care about me they were lying to me as long as you fear you only gets worse\nAnd so I I don't sense in the major ten or Fifteen urban areas in which you can't find a Republican with a search warrant\nThere there's any movement toward\nFree markets marriage a quarter boarding caught committing crime study get good grades a business is flourishing it looks to me objectively like in the forties fifties and sixties blocked business\n... and black areas there was a black doctor the black ... the black pharmacists there was a black lawyer there was a pharmaceutical stores there there were retail centers and after the riots in the sixties and seventies they're all burned down here in Cincinnati, Ohio we used to have a functioning\nAvondale in Evanston and and and rose lawn parts that had were black areas but they were black middle class families were moms and dads went to work and children were educated in control I look where you live in Los Angeles Chicago right now\nThe complete collapse of the black family has happened\nAnd that is light at the doorstep of the political decision of the modern Democratic Party that they simply walk away from the end of the party of the clan the party of lynchings the party of Jim Crow that's the Democrats that the now the party\nA ... on the Democratic party look at what they're doing in the urban areas whether it's education or crime or job formation you have any sense now I guess could we kind of began this my thing you've ever sent Jesse there in Los Angeles things are getting better\nKnow no matter of fact uh you know the waters the wicked witch of the west though I cue she is out there encouraging people to a cat\nA or five people in public that support the president why hurt districts are absolute ghettos bill messy war's been over forty years a cargo warmer over those areas\nAnd I have to pay their danger in danger zones and this woman would not do anything about it and she doesn't want anyone else to do it at the age to solve a problem\nAs a matter of fact ... be quiet because he doesn't understand how he's influenced by people he doesn't she doesn't want them to think for themselves and she was the ghettos\nShe made a promise to black people that the Republicans were trying to carry on a project\nIn the in the ghetto right but she said I'm not going to let the Republicans do that and not all that might not going to let them turn out to project is I'm going to be more for you\nAnd making that kind of promising to black voters in her district while she's living in a four point three million dollar homes suburbs to have to be concerned about the crime and violence that's happening in those areas", "year": "2018",

Democrats have promoted illegal immigration which has destroyed black working class jobs and champion Bill Clinton's pro NAFTA policies\nWhich have led to a massive levels of unemployment in black communities\nThey've also Democrats who cripple the black families by and bracing welfare writes the penalize married couples to get married\nIt goes on and on and on and this was all set in a sense to CNN's Don Lemon\nWho laughed with venomous ... at what these other African Americans were saying can you imagine if a white conservative Republican had called some black guy a house negro\nOr use other racial pejorative against them they would be kicked off said but not when their own get to do it and they do it with such ... and you know when you think back in history\nWith CNN did the Kanye West borrows from an ugly ugly and tragic history of slavery and the pre civil war you see white slave owners who wrote Democrats ruthlessly\nPunished any black man or woman who sought to educate themselves and think for themselves\nThe Democrat white slave owners in the south had their control blacks maintaining power over them and after the civil war ended conducted by Democrats\nSlave owners head to release their slaves but they formed the Ku Klux Klan Democrats formed the Ku Klux Klan as a terrorist arm of the Democratic party\nTo intimidate murder Lynch suppressed and destroy any political activities of the newly freed black population to keep them under control if they threaten the Democratic power structure believe me the Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan went after them hard\nLater on in the era of Jim Crow white Democrats codify into law the idea of literacy tests and other means and methods to dumb down and keep African Americans poorly educated and keep them all in line\nTo protect their power Ninety five percent of black people continually vote for Democrats because the sample shouldn't media like the CNN and ABC NBC and CBS control black Americans to keep them in line to keep them under control\nWay of what I watch free thinking African American men and women be personally destroyed by CNN and the mainstream media Democratic Party and so\nThen I look at the results of the Trump Administration black unemployment historically low criminal justice reform is coming\nHe's fighting against illegal immigration that hurts black workers he's trying to find a solution to the never ending slaughter of black men by other black men in Chicago dominated only by the Democratic party\nAnd he's going to try to make it possible for Democrats to sit down at the table of equal economic opportunity\nAnd so what happened and Kanye West is the same crap that's happened to Clarence Thomas to Jesse ...

they allow the racism on CNN dummy employed against a black man if he doesn't express the right political viewpoints\nThat's why CNN working with the Democratic party much destroy Kanye West and and they do their best but I don't think it's going to work I have trust and faith that African Americans maybe in three weeks\nWe'll discover and learn what the Democratic Party has done to them and not for them\nThe truth is just take a look at the education system and the crime in cities like Baltimore Chicago Detroit Memphis or Milwaukee the schools are completely dysfunctional the black family is completely broken\nThere's no job creation the average black student comes out of high school in Milwaukee or Detroit or Chicago reading about the eighth grade level unprepared for the world of the twenty first century and all those cities that Democrats have been in charge for the last fifty to eighty years with no discernible results\nYet when a black man like Kanye West steps out of line and begins to express support for a different political outlook he has called every dirty rotten filthy racial name and the book\nBecause it fits the idea of the Democratic party keeping blacks in law and they want to dissuade other African\nAmerican men from thinking an acting independently of the Democratic party that is cause such harm can you think a worst cities to live in\nOne control by crime and poverty single mothers academic failure racial inequality that is the result whether whatever black city it is controlled by Democrats what occurs\nWhen you think about how badly the Democratic

Bob ... running Disney\nUm uh the guys in Philadelphia and Comcast [noise] um the CBS people ah they're all foreigners\nAnd if they didn't told that line their social lives would change\nA there wouldn't be look if you're a Robert ... part of the thrill of running Disney is and you get invited to every party in Hollywood you're okay you're a big shot you walk in and they're all the movie stars [noise] um you know playing a oh Bob Irish\nHere well if you ran a a an organization a news organization that was actually there too conservative and traditional Americans those invitations would stop\nSo you know people say oh that can't be true it is true [laughter]\nBut then Don Lemon said it was a minstrel show that you know you're African Americans on CNN to the cold in the house negro every race to al ... you know with them and I can remember\nMy message of the day on Bill O'Reilly dot com we do a message of the day in the morning and then we do a thirty minute a newscast at night on Bill O'Reilly dot com I might mention it was kind of a west likes Donald Trump\nSo far Saudi Arabia has maintained a hard line on this issue deny deny deny without ever providing any substantiated evidence they took the opportunity to echo President Trump's reading about the global economy Saturday state TV reporting the kingdom affirms if it's targeted with any action it will respond with greater action\nAnd that the kingdom's economy has an influential and vital role in the global economy and that the kingdom's economy has affected only by the impact of the global economy over on Capitol Hill however condemnation of the Saudi regime has been swift and bipartisan\nFox's Jillian Turner Republican Senator Jeff flake of Arizona react to the White House mulling over a new family separation immigration policy during an appearance on ABC's This week\nWe should bring that policy back ah that that ah that simply as an America that I think everybody recognizes that the president seemed to a certain way the first lady at other so spoke directly against it so I Hope that uh we don't return to that policy\nIn June President Trump signed an executive order to end the family separation policy after public outrage and criticism also on this week independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont blasting White House economist Larry Kudlow moments after Kudlow said the latest climate change report by the United nations was over estimated\nWe are in crisis mode and you are but admitted ... that virtually the even recognize the reality of climate change and their policies working with the fossil fuel industry or make it a bad situation worse\nThe un says we need forty five percent decrease in emissions this is Fox News this is talk going on for nine President Trump painted defense secretary James Mattis could be the next to leave his administration the comet during a CBS sixty minutes interview Fox's Guerra Tenney\nIn this interview with sixty minutes President Trump was asked about the high rate of turnover in his administration and if more people were going to go he said yeah probably an added that while he thinks he has a great cabinet there are some people he's not thrilled with\nThat's when he was asked about General Mattis\nA less than a month ago Madison flatly dismissed reports that he was preparing to depart the administration is spokesman for the Pentagon responded to the president's remarks thing in a statement Secretary Mattis is laser focused on doing his job ensuring the U.S military remains the most lethal force on the planet\nUN ambassador Nikki Haley announcing last week she would be leading by the end of the year after touring damaging several towns along Florida's panhandle FEMA cheap Brock Long called the destruction left by hurricane Michael some of the worst he's ever seen\nPresident Trump plans to visit Florida and George on Monday and hurricane flattened Mexico beach cruise clear debris\nThe mayor holding out hope for the two hundred and fifty or so missing who may have tried to ride out this storm\nFor men are dead in South Texas after bullets fly at a baby's party\nThat happened in the backyard of a home Saturday afternoon and taps twelve miles north of Corpus Christi\nPolice saying altercation or rough to between two groups of men at the party and it escalated from there please describe them as distant relatives there's nowhere to what they're arguing about one suspect a twenty year old man is in custody but the man's thirty seven year old father is still at large\nThree of the four dead were in their early twenties fourth man killed was sixty to another man would do it in the shooting is expected to survive\n... Fox News\n[noise] [noise] I'm an Carrick and this is Fox News\n[noise]\nThis is Kelly ban it from ... mornings with uncle Henry on these tough one for nine W. B. B. and heart radio station\n[noise]\nFirst of all\nYou have a long distance relationship here or do I ... a hedge swift in with my father a long time ago and we uh we did a good job restricts it up we uh eleven hundred and sixty four year underserved remember the exact we fix it up I worked here for two summers sick of it and find a garden that's right right by since Saturday going over so there are no\nAnd knocked down about six months ago a really yellow is gone the whole thing including the garbage everything's on what's going to happen with the mega housing development oh okay\nGood but it was great for us we fixed it and sold it for more money and uh it was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen city\nLet's talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious leader and it was a dinner they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we got back I uh we got back many people actually if you look at it it's like just seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama said one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion\nAnd we got him back and he's going to be safer shortly he's in the air just he literally just took off\nAnd he'll be in the office he'll be in the oval office big welcome a big welcome yeah you know evangelical Christians everybody everybody wanted her back what happened to them was incredible and he was held hostage but now he's a he's going to be happy I'm sure he's very happy right now about\nYour wife is good your lawyer to Africa sure which is unbelievable what happened there talk about what was the goal in what was accomplished with Maloney in Africa well\nShe's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good stuff but some very tough stuff in a sense of the way people live and she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise]\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible the level of poverty a it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and other kids were beautiful\nThey loved her and she came back and she said I Hope you're going to\nContinue to give a lot of money because they needed is not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just touch on the human race as they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact on me and the other thing the mid west\nAnd looked at Canada Mexico in South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what'd you do that cause Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the trade deal\nAnd we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and\nWe made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know that better than it used to what happened over here with you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refuse to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good\nBut we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nUh we have now we just made a deal with South Korea which is fabulous much are much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton do you remember she made that deal and she said that's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea\nAre so many jobs and talking to my Everytime I Can't I'm actually I Will be talking about a million\nWell you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent of people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent the Arabs they make a big deal of if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they uh they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in during the Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "15", "locations": [["Dallas", 32.78306,

I don't mean to interrupt but I Know what\nThey were going to have more this\nTime of it I Know we can lay out the case for hours look they were stolen for two weeks for simple reason they had Meryl Streep give their acting lessons you know someone like Meryl Streep has been co chair and co chairing coach you are probably a team of five people\nCoach here for two weeks to make sure that she was so monotone and so calm it's like they had to run for dean and they act like a little girl I mean with that that Senator Whitehouse\nI Swear to God I thought he was gonna say do you like a lollipop ... little girl because she was so calm and he was being so nice store and here's the big problem the Republican Party is filled with ...\nAnd ... now there's a couple of New York ... words mosques\nAnd buses who were scared to death their own shadow not one Republican mail center white male center was willing to interview a woman for the thought they'd be called sexist racist than thousand other words by liberals they gave it to a woman a woman prosecuting Mitchell who was\nThe single worst prosecutor I haven't seen in my entire like near you and I could have put this girl on the stand and you and I would've destroyed or bill we would've had or just a apoplectic she wouldn't know what to say her entire case within ripped to shreds about five minutes and she couldn't get a decent question at home in ... around the five minute questioning\nShe couldn't get it out and you got to see using a true you fly all the time yes or no isn't it true now you told us too many you needed a ten day break to be able to drive your he isn't it true that you will not give us that there is no she gave the Washington Post isn't it true you belonged yourself with a foreign ... most of your life\nIsn't it true not one single witness backed boy you\nSaid and the guy who came from you isn't there you go out there who\nIsn't it true that you said that in two thousand twelve you finally awake and and when your psychiatrist because you were redoing your house and that renovation about the security door is what made bring back your memories of this attempted rape\nExcept there's a problem we checked your records and you built the house you did the renovation of two thousand eight not two thousand twelve you're a liar they could've said are you a democratic operative how many Democrats did you speak to who connected you at the top Democrat lawyers and George George lawyers\nTo get involved in this case they could have after a thousand\nQuestions they could've after ... you will they did after who paid for your lie detector tests and I don't know what do you mean you don't know where's the follow up question everyone knows ... why would someone do it for free the whole thing is ridiculous they could've after about a thousand issues like in two thousand twelve when you claim out of the blue you enter repressed memory of rape\nIsn't it true that in two thousand twelve Mitt Romney named\nThree potential people would be a Supreme Court nominees and one of them was Brett Kavanaugh is that how you came to know Brett Kavanaugh and isn't it true that Planned Parenthood two thousand twelve took out ads in newspapers all over the country that said roe versus Wade make believe it was just overturned and they showed the pictures of the night Supreme Court justice and they replaced\nGinsburg's faced with Brett Kavanaugh and they said this is going to be Mitt Romney Supreme Court nominee overturns roe versus Wade is that how you got to know his name have you decided to become a heroin or the left by make up a story I mean there's a thousand things they could have said is it true your father is CIA\nIs it true your grandfather was CIA [laughter] is it true your brother was working for a law firm that found a GPS fusion is that possible and you're not a democratic operative where all those questions\nHow bad is it true that bred Kevin O's mother a Maryland said John trial judge Robert bonded over the foreclosure and your parents who do you call\nIt kept me on that one 'cause they claim it was never quite for closed on and they got the house back\nSo why she was a young girl she was standing in a in a courtroom singer parents being questioned by a judge the judge and incredible power over the future of her family's life and even though of actually they tend to lose out that's my understanding they did not lose the house and the judge actually in the end kind of root for them\nIt doesn't matter you may have developed a deep seated hatred for that judge and found out that that judges son is going to be Supreme Court nominee there's a thousand things you could say the CIA one is amazing that's not a conspiracy theory her dad CIA at her grandfather CIA and her brother is with a couple of it's with a law firm founded fusion\nGPS on all things considered and other deep state fraud conspiracy there's no other way about it there's no coincidence any of this stuff but having said all that listen let's forget all that\nFor a minute forget forget he gave the most beautiful opening statement I've ever heard in my life I cried five times all my friends cry I've spoken to fifty are more women\nOn my radio show my TV show and letters to me over the last three days all said they cry because they've got sons and they can't believe that there's some was crucified like this I Believe America's on Brett Kavanaugh outside and I believe any poll you see that says ... says otherwise is another democratic ... job another lie another over sampling of Democrats\nI got a hundred letters today my column in the Vegas newspaper which was featured at real clear politics\nAs one of the most important columns in America today over a hundred letters Ninety five percent of them were pro I Love your your great way and what you said about ... and and I'm with you and five of them were liberals and all five of them in one way or another basically told me I Hope you get murdered or ... I Hope someone comes and murders you\nOr one of them had a great line they said I Hope there's a woman in your house and she grabs a night the plunged into your head out and mentally disturbed left is all they know how to do is talk about murdering people disagree with and then they call that's crazy I mean you're just dealing with sick people who will do anything and say anything because they believe\n... that the ends justify the means and that's why this Christine for came forward and that's why the woman came forward and that's why the sick go charge gang rape came forward and the next five women you hear about this week are all going to be liberal women\nWear pink vagina hats in March and anti Trump rallies who think they are saving the world by coming forward and lying it's as simple as that this guy is innocent he's a boy scout Jimmy Stewart it in the Andy Griffith and made very are empty he's a fine man at what they did it a character assassination and they're sick people there's something wrong with all of them\nDemocrats have men bill there's nothing else you could say we are target number one white straight Republican men are the target of the Democratic party simple\n... other provable fact in June of twenty sixteen Trump put on the loose the twenty five judges that would be on his list\nFrom what you would pick one of those twenty five million Supreme Court you might recall June July August that was a big deal with twenty sixteen she said that that uh because I'm Kevin O's name was on the Trump bliss during the campaign not also triggered some thought she had to come forward and do whatever\nIn reality ... Kevin O's name did not hit the Trump blimp until November twenty Seventeen more than one year after the election his name was known in the list for her to react to December twenty sixteen but the media doesn't boy that out either\nYeah lives in the best case I think out of all of those out of all I mean they're all standing but the best one\nIs that Dianne Feinstein knew about this in July\nIf this was real how can any once it gets real when they interviewed him one on one face to face and never mentioned that there's a woman claiming you attempted to rape or they have that for the last days to see first that they might be able to beat him some other way and then this is going to be their last chance Hail Mary to try to destroy and let's just go ahead and ...\nAnd and they're using the same deal they used against Clarence Thomas storm of the exact same playbook it's the same playbook\nAnd waiting for the FBI to produce this report we don't know how long it's going to take now the agreement is seven days\nA but at the FBI comes to the Senate and says it's going to take a little longer we're gonna have to do more thorough job here you can't imagine that the Democrats and Republicans would be happy about that but they say All right let's take the time the Democrats might be very happy about that frankly because you know the longer they can drag this out the worse it probably is for for Brett Kavanaugh\nMeanwhile Charles Chad lending ten now in North Carolina State University associate professor says he drank with Kavanaugh went both right yeah and that Kavanaugh was belligerent and aggressive when drunk and also it's had slurred speech and staggered from drinking he plans to speak to the FBI the investigation is to be completed by October fest [noise]\nWe have a trade deal the United states and Canada just confirming a new modernized trade agreement designed to replace the Nineteen Ninety four NAFTA pack\nThe new deal will be called the United states and Mexico Canada agreements us MCA the Associated Press reports the agreement preserved a NAFTA dispute resolution process something the U.S wanted to jettison\nThe agreement exempt terrorists on two point six million cars on dairy candidate essentially gave us the same access and offered and the Trans Pacific partnership trade agreement rejected by President Trump\nSteel and aluminum terrorists are not part of this agreement the U.S and Canada were under pressure to reach a deal by midnight Sunday when the U.S must make public the full text of the agreement with Mexico\nCanada the United states number two trading partner was left out when the U.S and Mexico reached an agreement last month to revamp NAFTA the north American free trade agreement Fox News this is talk went on for now he launched opinion [noise]\nSyria's foreign minister declares near victory over terrorism in says they are ready for refugees to return calling on the U.S France and turkey to leave\nSpeaking this weekend to the federal assembly the foreign minister called the United states an occupying force and that victory is near for the Syrian regime that they take back more territory from rebel groups this is the Trump Administration indicated this week that it can pull us presence on the ground in Syria is a strong possibility\nEven after the defeat of President Trump's national security adviser John Bolton said the U.S will pull out through the Iranian forces have exited the cuts for\nThousands of Iranian backed fighters are currently operating on the ground in Syria adding to an already complex to wish that in the past month so increase tension after Syrian anti aircraft missiles accidently shot down a Russian plane was aiming at Israeli fighter jets and Jerusalem trading Fox News\nOld man winter paid a visit to the state of Montana as other parts of the country continue to enjoy the sunshine Fox meteorologist Adams clots\nWe're looking at Boston Montana that theme from snowfall already so maybe a little bit more of a winter feel out in front of that you're looking at rainfall Foley across portions of the upper Midwest a kind of right along that for all about\nThe southwest in parts of Mexico will be getting a widespread heavy rain and flooding this week thanks to hurricane rose up a plan to re boot excuse me for a robot brothel in Houston needs a ...\nIt's the oldest profession with some new technology [laughter]\nNo you will find our to deter their instead the owners of the bravo called kinky dolls say they're human like robots are available for sale or rent and can talk they had wanted to open their first location in the U.S in Houston but the company whacked the permits required for demolition than construction of a new building\nAnd that's fine with Houston mayor Sylvester Turner you says it's not the kind of business he wants a new city ... Fox News ... Fox News radio [noise]\nThis is Henry From Gulf Coast morning with Kelly been wanting one for nine WVU the heart radio station\n[noise]\n\n\nI've only coming up the great American and are always good to get a female perspective to the men and women are equal but somehow were different all they're making more than I generally\nThink pretty much the same of Reagan babe dot com also great radio talk shows than Los Vegas Nevada and Meghan bars welcome again to the bill Cunningham show Megan how are ya\nI decorate them to\nGo I Want to get a woman's perspective I ... I Want to tell you what troubles me greatly about Thursday\nAnd then I Want to get your perspective and I I kinda look towards Fox News often as a place I can go to ... conservative commentary and things of that character and ah after a doctor forwarded testified the the son of Mike Wallace Chris Wallace did\nForce testimony is extremely emotional extremely wrong extremely credible\nNo uh no one could listener delivery delivery of those words and talk about these sold in the impact it at our life and not have your article author this was a disaster for the Republicans so started Chris Wallace Thursday Afternoon judge ended up ... generally are respected I think Dr Ford is exceptionally credible\nKarl Rove the great political theorist said forward as the credible unbelievable\nSo when when I heard those commentaries I thought we were done and then I of course watch brought Kevin O's testimony and they're still in the Democrats show toward him Thursday Afternoon and everything flipped completely ... but when you have Chris Wallace\nAnd you have Andrew Nepal a ton of and Karl Rove showing that a woman who's credible\nWho provide as witness names that turned out not to be witnesses at all when you have ah Christine Ford straight up lying about her and capability of flying which you flew everywhere\nBut every one of the witnesses re future story has no memory of the gathering and the woman who once anonymity to testify turn down the opportunity to be questioned in private and then we find out her lawyers never told her she had that opportunity at all\nSo every time I tried to test her credibility Megan bars it turns out to be great grossly locking\nSo when conservative commentator said she's believable she's credible and clearly she isn't it we completely lost our way\n[laughter] I think my ... to Karl Rove yeah completely lost our way because he wasn't on telling us that Donald Trump never had a chance of winning\nThe people can see through it I think most people that I was talking to the to your testimony nothing could swim in and then\nI found Brett Kavanaugh people even though there was such a raw emotion from falsely accused innocent man\nWho in the in the court of public opinion in the days leading up to this quote unquote hearing his life was completely turned upside down his wife was getting that threat and his career with looking to be entirely sabotage and destroyed\nAs well as his reputation and here we have Christine horn and I do believe that something happened to her\nOr she obviously has been in therapy for that age\nI she sat herself she has two front doors you know anybody that has to cross the doorbell no there's no snow\nSo obviously she had this you know it just because she says something happened doesn't happen and we have plenty of examples\nOr just because she says Brett Kavanaugh rape or maybe not but all the evidence that she's for that so far all start feeding additives\nIn fact if you present innocent of Cornwall in which the so called victim provides for names Brett Kavanaugh mark judge PJ Smith labeling Kaiser including her best girlfriend legal in Kaiser\nWho would have no motivation to line or a light all who said I don't even know Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd all of them said the event didn't happen including mark judge you wrote on the floor supposedly with the with bread Kevin on Christine forward he said it did not get discount more judging okay what about PJ Smith who simply a classmate\nWho said these events never took place when Christine Ford's said they did then wheeling Kaiser her best girlfriend said they didn't happen but she also said I believer why believer but they didn't happen I don't know\nI don't know how that works at all and then you have are saying that I I was flabbergasted when Trump running for the president being twenty sixteen what's the name of bread cabin on the Supreme Court list\nFact the matter is he didn't put his name on the list when he was running that didn't happen till November\nTwenty Seventeen so how could you be frightened during the campaign about Brett Kavanaugh getting the Supreme Court when his name one on the list at all\nAnd how can she be believable to those are like you just mentioned Chris Wallace Karl Rove and not all the time is up I don't know because ... ... exactly what were they watching\nAnd hear like you said when I had a sexual harassment case it fell short of being an assault case however I had the burden of proof that was my responsibility or order a present the evidence I had to be cross examined I had to beat the post let me tell you something\nI wasn't given lawyers from the defensive side that treated me what's kept glove no okay it was a very uncomfortable and hearing saw it talks about equal right on gender equality what do you know what\nI was treated not as a woman that as a mad at eight percent and bringing bringing forward charges against another person\nSo to watch that lawyer that the Republicans hired\nTreat her as though she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily poke holes in the many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly us
