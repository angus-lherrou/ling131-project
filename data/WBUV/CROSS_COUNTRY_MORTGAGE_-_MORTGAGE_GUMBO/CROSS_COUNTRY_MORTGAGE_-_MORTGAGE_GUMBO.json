[{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "I see are there any charities that you like\nWell yeah I I can I can uh [noise] they got a list of a a friend and carry leave things to that that that's not the problem the problem is not normally you ah have a close relative who animals all the details when you on [laughter]\nYeah so being you don't have that this might be going into the area of like life insurance goes by beneficiary designation but life insurance can pay into a trust as well as some of your money in like our razor retirement plans\n\nIf some of your money in retirement plans like an hour I\nNo no no no no no a qualified money when they\nOkay that makes it easier so one of those things might be of interest is to set up a trust doesn't necessarily have to be the your vocal kind but\nCan be the trust that basically leaves the instructions behind them how you won't everything's settled and then somebody would be a trustee that would do that but the the would\nFollow the direction\nOf that trust of how to handle the house the bank account and so forth\nWe kind of justice that called\nA well there's two basic types that it's used for succession so to speak a beat a living trust which is a real vocal trust means you can change your mind on it you\nCould even do it here of vocal trust is one that when you name the beneficiaries and how you want it to go you're probably not going to do that in that case but either way\nYou're setting instructions of how this is to go even if you want so much of it paid out a year\nCould be done that way as well but you would probably need to use somebody like an estate planning attorney to do so when we have the total wealth authority west Blanchard that you could use a Tom you could call the office and we could connect you with White House\nAnd get you some more help on taking care of these concerns that sound good Tom\n\nHandling feeling you expenses I have a life life insurance policies or to pay for it today I Am no beneficiary who can walk walk in and the policies to a funeral home yeah\nTrust can take care of that so you need to call my office I'll give you my uh daytime number from daytime job when natural advisor CEO of the farm\nOr the phone number for daytime is by boat for three to Ninety two hundred the websites Gregory rex dot com but called the office and will connect you with ... west Blanchard and get these details of is do you need somebody to\nHelp sign all this he's going to help you organize so that does help and when they come a long time down the road thanks for the call top thank you very much yeah and I'm surprised\nThat there's so many people in this scenario but we get calls them quite often and I love hearing about the people that have either adopted a charity like in an organization but we've also seen people basically just adopted non family member and I'm going to leave all my money to this guy or this gal says I Know they're a good person and I just want to help\nUm you know in our\nWe don't always know how tech savvy people are but you know you've got these genealogy genealogy any allergy websites and where you can kind of go in and put together the family that spreads out he's\nDoesn't have many any close connections but they're obviously connections farther out\nAnd probably some research there might help him on that or anybody else that's thinking about that could there because you know even in the family tree there's good people there\nThat will help looked out or could be instructions or might need the help\nAs well and I think there's been a number of great charities you know I support many charities throughout the year that we rotate I Know it it I said this next thing I Know I'll I'll get\nCalls next week wanting us to do other charities and all week we've kind of built that out and we might make some adjustments but we pretty much stick to what we feel good about those five uh one sees and and the work that they do and make sure the money goes locally\nAnd that the monies put to work so if I was leaving in the state behind us the things I Would look at is how do I help the community and some of it could be education help some of those people in a certain filled that you might sport may be able to borrow money either\nTo go to college there that some some neat things you can do\nWell I liked the idea of turning the your legacy money into an actual legacy now I have kids of my money is going to go to them and their grandkids or whatever but you know the college is number one businesses education but their second biggest revenue driver is the memorial business they bring in tons of money just so we could put Tom and met hurry\nDormitory hall or whatever it is that the naming rights either a gym or new theater or a dorm or you know you make these donations and maybe it's just an aquarium or something smaller like that\nBut sometimes if you don't have somewhere where your money supposed to go I Would look at the legacy business that looks like a really cool option for those that don't have direct airs the memorial business\nYeah and it doesn't have to be universities that could be high school playground or a part of the areas that ... that\nImpacts you and it doesn't necessarily have to be local school somebody else's community is local for them so there are some pretty cool things you can do or even in parts or music\nA lot of areas and ... for Tom just eat he's looking for help to start exploring that but he's more you know it kind of in like you know heck who who would pay the funeral and stuff\nYou know and and that's an interesting point because that's something we do help people with as a funeral trust also\nTo where Fonz can be made available\nNext day to take care of those things because technically when the trust is set up the money is directed for that and it can be tied with life insurance as well to make sure funds were immediately available to take care of those needs and\nThose that are involved in that trust are making sure those things were happening and the price and everything be unfair\nAs well so there's a way to get some of the stunt\nYeah infant part Tom story sounds oh let's say they have any family or whether what but what he does have is a pretty cool opportunity to do something the rest of us don't get to do and set up some sort of memorial approach to their stomach day jobs\nWell ... yeah we're about there but we were talking about the thirteenth check earlier in the show oh in the ... coming in is look yeah people are up in arms and I can understand if you're a teacher and ... because of where this is going\nBut that is a financial burden the math does that work long range and that's why this is coming up it's a question about the funding so this we're gonna talk about this more in the future\nAnd bring you the news that we pick up on that my day job financial advisor money manager ... ...\n... guide up the path maybe you're sharp a help fine where are you on the path and how does your final destination look ... what does it look like are you going to arrive where you want to\nThat's pretty cool get to where you

urge radio station\n[noise]\nThis is a Fox News alerts time ... year old a deadly mass shooting at Pittsburgh's tree of life synagogue hissing is very bad inside so there are multiple fatalities\nThere at least six centuries to include for police officers [noise] the police officers injuries at this time or non life threatening the other individuals are critical and serious in nature\nUsed that now they're using twenty sixteens data that's compared to sixty one percent Nineteen Seventy one okay now between Nineteen Seventy one or two thousand a lab in the share of adults in middle class fell by ten percent\nOkay\nSince the middle class has remained relatively stable\nSo that's all fine and dandy hey great Dwayne can you tell me\nWhat's the numbers are middle class so here you go into household income is two thirds to double the national media which is fifty seven thousand dollars this as a twenty sixteen so by that definition this is what Peter was defined it\nIt's middle class if your household income is two thirds to double the national median of fifty seven six fifty seven thousand six hundred so that means a middle income three person household that earns about forty five to ... thirty five thousand\nIf you're single it's a salary of around twenty six thousand to Seventy eight thousand qualifies you for middle class\nSo what do you think how do you fall I mean that seems like a pretty big number right twenty six thousand to Seventy eight thousand if you're a single person male or female you or considered middle income middle class\nIf you're a three person household forty five to thirty five thousand dollars\nOkay\nMiddle income for a two person how so it's thirty six thousand on up so let's look at the bottom arrange right 'cause they they give it a big old average year upper ... upper income they're considering for one person is Seventy eight thousand\nTwenty six thousand middle for a family uh to heart and ten thousand is upper\n\nMiddle is thirty six nine\nOkay\nThree people family we just talked about that middle was forty five offers one thirty five\nFamily of four\nHundred and fifty six thousand his upper fifty two thousands middle and a family of five fifty eight thousands middle ... Seventy five thousand is upper\nSo where do you follow those numbers hey or middle or upper middle what exactly is your number\nI just thought this was pretty interesting because when you when you put down incomes on paper it looks a little bit different right that which is south thoughts in perceptions are\nBut you know what I when I take applications at my folks take applications it can range I mean you've got some teachers that are making\nThirty five thousand you've got other teachers that are making a eighty five thousand dollars so you know depending on how long how long you been doing different things so I guess my question is is\nYou know is middle income really is it based on\nAge wise like should that should that have anything to do with it because hey maybe this five person family that's at a hundred and Seventy five thousand bucks\nYou know if they're if they're a little bit of an older family or they may be a head of the person that's sitting at five with middle income at fifty eight thousand I probably venture to say maybe they are in a little bit better shape\nBut I thought these interests are these numbers were pretty interesting to think that sixty almost Seventy percent sixty eight percent to be exact according to this people think that they are middle class or middle income okay so that's just kind of some some neat stuff in my opinion there I mean I\nYou know based sock tell you this based on the restaurants based on seeing everybody out everybody spends money like their upper class which is why we're going to talk about credit which is why ... and I bring this up is why we're in a lot of the situation that we're in when we're starting\nTo look at the home buying more ... to look at student loan debt when we're starting to look at all these other things that that are attributing factors to what the future holds for us\nThese are the things that income where we add how are we spending everybody's going to have to really really really\nRethink budgets really have to rethink everything and folks that's not a bad thing it's not a bad thing but it's just understanding that those are the things that we're going to have to do making sure when we move forward\nBecause as we've discussed that has been free for the longest time and it's not free anymore\nIt's not free anymore\nSo we get back from the break we've got a busy show we've\nGot a ... plant a lot of stuff about credit I Want to make sure you're aware of what a hall hard and soft credit inquiry is you can also talk about hey where's purchasing power going\nYou consider buying a home where's that going in of course we're also going to discuss a great watch as well you're listening a mortgage gumbo which Wainstein right here on TALK radio five oh four to six zero zero now not five if you want to join a show [noise]\nGot an apple we've all that but you really know if you had the proper coverage is at the most competitive cost it until I called team be with a free policy review and they were able to advise me on policies that meant money not my carry on the weather it's home auto all commercial let them do the same for you\nCall today Ninety five six one to Eighteen thirty to obey the teen B.

offering what is an open contingency versus a close contingency if you want to look at that hey just go to mortgage gumbo dot com click on past shows and you can listen to that but this was an awesome question here this was an awesome questioned by Peter\nHere's here's what I Want to say to you on this okay you know when you're selling your house you know the ins and outs of what's up with this house you know is this house perfect\nMost of them are not so you know what's going on okay chances are chances are a buyer and while it is not required we always recommend I'll buyers look at getting an inspection\nAnd in fact we go to three sixty home inspector dot net shameless plug there but these guys are the best\nSelling agents hate when they come in you know why because they're so thorough so chances are Peter for you who's actually me hey should I make repairs there's a couple of things that you want to look at here on any house that I've sold in the past here's what I can tell you I've had an inspector come out prior to me listening to house\nSo there were no I was not going to be surprised by anything\nOkay I wanted to know what was something that needed to be done\nYou know sometimes say you go up in the attic in ... and there's these little electrical boxes where all these wires me well\nYou know you got to cover those up well you know what for to for for two bucks I could put a cover on one of those boxes but I Need to know hey up and outlets not working maybe I could get my buddy electrician or come over\nIt for three bucks I could put a whole new outlet in there\nThose are the things that you want to make sure that you're you're you're taking care of because when you're looking at selling a house what is the market like we've been talking about it for months now it's turning into a buyer's market right so do you really want to put yourself\nIn a situation where that bark and go in and go hey I Want this fixed I Want that fixed and some other stuff fixed last year when things were blowing through the roof it take as long as you want it or not\nBecause you had five other offers on the table was that's not where we are right now okay so those are the things that you want to outside of hey listen it's normal when you're selling your house you're going to fix up the exterior you're going to spruce up the landscaping\nBut all you really looking at maybe find out go go Google or a a Web site maybe that says or or go to three sixty home inspections dot net and going there and check out their checklist it may be used that as a guide for things

[noise]\n[noise] from the Mandel viewing GMC studios [noise] this is talk on overnight somebody points and I urge radio station\nGetting ready for the big vote I'm Roger eastern Fox News ... hours away from what everyone expects to be the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to become the next justice on the Supreme Court boxes Jared helping his live on Capitol Hill with the latest\nHe would have to be Ninety seven years old\nSo my whole point is let's pay off that mortgage start putting at six hundred dollars a month\nSix hundred times twelve is what Seventy two hundred a year right so I mean let's just take if there is no interest on that I mean he's looking at over ten years alone just to get that mortgage taking care of\nWhich as I said he had Twenty years left so folks would I Want you to understand with a reverse mortgage is this\nOkay you have options\nNobody's coming to me with the to get a reverse mortgage because they want to buy a four wheeler or because they want to um go on vacation they're coming to me because they want to dial back\nThey want to start appreciating their significant other they want to make sure that their significant other is going to have a roof over their head\nAnd my point of talking about these folks as you won't meet with me personally\nTo go over what your options are so not only are we going to pay off this mortgage we're going to give him a couple of grand because he's going to do a couple of improvements he wants to add a shed a ... in the back a little workshop he likes to do some work\nSo he's going to add a workshop at a back and we're going to provide all bat\nFor him so here's option was a fixed rate reverse okay\nAnd we know from the show there's different concepts and ones where you build a lot of credit but here's option by paying off the mortgage with the equity half is a fixed rate reverse\nMy whole point of telling you is is there if you were talking to a no other company out there and they're telling you the first

Wal Mart is now it was this giant stores like a general store they have they had everything you could go there and you get some blue jeans you could go get your family portrait taken it the portrait studio you could they had a little corner of the the store that was all state\nRep you could go get your insurance taken care of then you could go get your tires change maybe a new diehard battery if you want to get a dishwasher over here maybe some forks on the second floor\nIt had everything it was it was like Wal Mart\nBut there was a young spry upstart that was cutting into their business in the main way they were doing it was just doing it cheaper offering everything under the sun but just a little bit cheaper than Sears doing it back then it was called Kmart\nSee now it's Walmart and they're fighting against Amazon\nBut it was almost an exact same dynamic that you have the Wal Mart versus Amazon today was Sears versus K mart in Nineteen Seventy nine and so that makes for some interesting audio gold when you go to Phil Donahue program and that will talk show\nHe had Milton Friedman on in Nineteen Seventy nine in the big discussion of the day was\nWhat are we going to do about k-mart what are we going to do about Syria you know Sears was this monopoly but a Kmart is coming up and you know maybe both of these companies are too big and we need to break them up and you know they keep throwing around this term monopoly like companies like monopolies even exist for any length of time without falling apart\nBut because they filed for bankruptcy on Monday is a great time to go check out how the discussion from Sears was going about what's almost forty years ago this is thirty nine years ago from the Phil Donahue programs\nYou can can serious by k-mart to and you're in you're of course you'd think so\nSears has been one of the great protectors of the consumer all over all during its existence in a matter of fact you say considered by k-mart the white Kmart has been growing the question is going to be can Kmart vice [laughter]\nAll right but that's\nAn example not take that into words you you really didn't want the Justice Department out of this too huh I mean you don't have any problem at all with with\nUs kind of fact in anti trust measure you can take in this country would be complete free trade\nAnd the Big East will eat up the ... little ones that is not we've already has the demise of many that has never happened there have been very careful studies May of what has happened to the concentration of industry in this country over the past hundred years\nAnd accept in those areas where government has stepped in it is not true that the Big East of eating up the smallest in fact it's often than the other one and Kmart is a good example is started from nothing Sears was running a major conglomerates Sears has been losing losing ground and going downhill in St Martin in rising\nAnd now both companies are a part of the same outfit and they're both going under together oh is it that's so sweet I mean if we'd only known\nForty years ago how the story what ended up we would've lasted all those people to say that the case was being made in Nineteen Seventy nine hey we need to break up so you know we don't need to break up the years go on any of the\nThese giant companies that seemed like these mammoth ... but he is at the time or you are being clouded by your what's it called contemporary biased where you think whatever's happening today will just keep happening in the future at in tonight I'm\nWell look if\nIf you're worried about a company today that's too big and you want to see it broken up you don't have to have the government intervened all you have to do is wait about Thirty years and the chances are they will of falling apart by then\nThe you know the average lifespan of a fortune five hundred company I'm not talking about the little restaurant that just open and close in six months on the corner I'm Talking about the five hundred biggest companies I eat most stable biggest revenue all that good stuff to five hundred biggest companies\nTheir ... their average lifespan is less than Thirty years there is no such thing as a gigantic monopoly untouchable that's doing the wrong thing\nWithout government intervention look at G. E. G. E. circling the drain just like Sears is genes on the cusp of heck that they screw around too much they're going to get the listed I mean they still have a ways to go before that but that's\nWhere they're headed yeah so all these people worried about oh you monopolies or we need to break up who was that that need to be broke up\nI think it was a who's I think ... if someone was saying that they would like to see a Google broke up because they control too much and they have monopoly and no one company should have that much power hey you want to see Google broken up just wait about Thirty years they ... they probably won't even be around there'll be replaced by something else\nYou don't believe me go after blockbuster do estimate gum rewards go as the years go after you get to go ask all these other places that have gone out of business are these giant wars\nSo fidelity investments\nI think ah if they're not the biggest custodian of investments they're one of them they they hold seven point two trillion dollars inclined assets are they made a huge announcement earlier this week they are announcing a new and separate company called fidelity digital assets services\nAnd the firm will this from this new little branch will handle crypto currency [noise]\nThat's interesting now does that mean that Fidel that he thinks that bitcoin and crypto currencies are the wave of the future\nNot really it just means that they found out a way to make money off of it at least for now and so they're going to go ahead and do that so this is not an endorsement of crypto currency is but we get a lot of emails and calls and Facebook messages on the topic\nSo we'll keep you updated on it but\nFidelity is the first Wall Street incumbent mean they're actually on actual Wall Street to officially provide crypto currency solutions including custody so\nFidelity investments is jumping all over this this could be is the steps that the crypto needs to become more stable more widely accepted and actually be used what its\nPurported to be used for and that is a currency a store a value so you can buy and sell and\nYou know I'm not have to use the barter system or not have your currency inflated while sitting there being held or change values well it's changing values so it's not quite serving the purpose you would hope for in a currency now it's just some sort of weird collectible beanie baby type investment\nBut I got my eye on it because if it ever does stabilize that there's going to be some cool little side effects unintended side effects that are going to change the financial world in earnest\nA bad news the twenty Eighteen federal deficit you know the fiscal year just in it at the beginning of October the federal deficit for last year was the largest it's twenty twelve absolutely an unacceptable seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars that [noise]\nSo this is the ... the fifth I guess that doesn't make it the fifth worst deficit in American history which means that this president is on track to be the second worst spinning president in history the worst was before him or the third worst would be before him\nSo the three worst physically speaking presidents that we've had in American history our last three presidents and no one seems to care I don't see Republicans or Democrats falling all over themselves to balance the budget and if you\nKnow anything about me you've been listening to show for the ... for a while that's all I care about at this point I don't care what the rest of the\nEither one of the parties is talking about is anyone going to balance its budget 'cause this is going to destroy us all this is what happened to Venezuela didn't balance our budget they printed more than ... than they can handle this is what happens Soviet Union is what happened the Roman empire this is how countries\nFall so until someone starts paying attention to that I don't have a political party\nSilly deficits ruined it for me or your home away from the show the winning it life at and winning it life dot com thank you very much for hanging out with this for a party of Saturday\nAnd are being better with your money you can go check out all of our episodes all of our podcasts are available for free on demand or you can live [noise] download the winning life apps and you're absolutely right now don't cost nothing [noise]\nSo hey good luck the football team today [noise] I Hope ah olive you get a when I Know all of you aren't gonna cause somebody you're cheering for opposite teams today aren't you [noise] time [noise]\nI barter this says wanting it live with Gregory wreck [noise]\nFrom\nThem and do you see in the studios [noise] this is talk going on for nine points and I urge radio station\nThey say he was killed in a fight so I'm ...

like that hey it's just a great weekly a newsletter that we put out that keeps you updated on everything that's going on so make sure you check that out\nGot a question this week and ... and we'll jump into this uh for\nUp against the break here this is from Alicia Alicia from Pascagoula give her a little shout out here at least show wanted to know I Am currently wanting to buy a home we've been looking at for a while so this is a house that she's been looking at\nI was told today after looking at it again with the realtor that someone has already made an offer but nothing has been signed jet\nAm I still able to buy this house is my real to saying or is my real are saying this just to get me to rush into the purchasing process All right\nSo a couple of things here Elise show if you're questioning your realtor and not trusting if she's trying to force you into the process you've got the wrong realtor that's number one okay that's number one however\nPersonally I think the it's the realtors job to let you know\nThat there is some offers that have been made\nBut yes you are still OK to make an offer on a property even though someone else has made that offer okay which is why this question is what triggered me it's a kind of starting to realize you know what let's talk about ... but absolutely yes you can\nYou can still make an offer now\nBe prepared or understand that if that initial offer at us ahead of you is a better off or something like that chances are you're still not going to get that property\nBut it is your age your job to sort of let you know that when I offer is being made my only question to you at least you would be\nHey what kept you from making I offer before\nOkay was it a new one pretty qualified you wasn't sure how much if you could afford a home or maybe you were waiting on something else so there's a lot of different factors which is why folks again you want to make sure that you're getting pre approved you want and I tell stories all the time\nOn the show and and I love it but the reason you want to make sure that you're getting pre approved this because when this house or you don't have to sit here and wonder should I made an offer because chances are with keeps most people on the sideline is they are more worried or they're embarrassed to find out\nIs the answer no and I understand that\nListen when you're looking at purchasing a home hey we got pulled the covers back it's sometimes people get a little bit scared about what's going on under those covers right they like to take the head shots only they don't like to take the whole full body part well we've got to do that when we're purchasing a home\nBut that's why we want to look at you pre approved at least you're so would I Would say in that process says listen I don't think you really just trying to rush into anything ah I think you realtors probably it's their job to let you know simply that hey somebody is making an offer on the home or has already made an offer and if something's not signed yet\nThat means they probably have a pretty good relationship maybe with that realtor that selling the home so she's trying to give you a heads up which I think is a good thing so um but again to circle back\nYou've got to make sure that you are using an agent that you fully trust folks that you fully trust and that's why so many people come to me before they even start the process\nThree clients this week alone I set out to agents that I'm working with okay because you know why because they trust me we got um pre approved and now that they're pre approved I sent them up with an agent that works in their particular markets so you don't don't go to the agent first\nCall the lender and get yourself pre approved not pre qualified we've been through that a million times hey when we come back from the break\nWe're going to talk about how much money do\nYou have in your savings accounts [noise] prepare to be disappointed runoff drive off

themselves if you're doing it in a state plan there should be an attorney and evolved\nLet's say you're in Louisiana for example I think a local attorney should be the one involved it's quite different than most states\nAnd they need to be licensed in the state which by being licensed in that state shows that they know those state laws\nLouisiana this community property and you've got forced airship you you can't have somebody in Georgia, Georgia attorney riding that and they might not even be licensed here writing it I just think it's where you want to sit down\nAnd have a conversation and that's why we have west Blanchard\nPart of the total wealth authority and I hear firms and and and they'll call their names as Randy banned the estate planning ... whatever their name is but they kind of make a focus on the state planning and they're not really that's their primary business and there\nIs an attorney he's not even there and I I see that all the time where they talk the talk but they're not walking the walk and this is a pretty big deal that it's done correctly and that's even if you're trying to do some of this do it yourself I've looked at\nA tight all a graphic will recently I was that possible it's not their kind of like what would this work and I knocked the attorney and that's why we have one on the team I'm not\nGiving you legal advice but I'd tell you I don't think this is bullet proof goes it is actually not in a graphic will and there are certain things in here 'cause I read it real quick as it yeah there's some other things missing and that's why you need\nTo have somebody help you get this right 'cause errors are so expensive and I had a client that um his dad went through one of these mills\nAnd when he his dad died and they took the trust trust was tossed said this is invalid oh no yeah so he had to go find the previously ... ... so it went back to the previous we'll\nGo we'll and the trust were invalid so he had to go back to the previous will to make sure he got everything and he and he he was kind of upset because it costs the sad like five six grand and it was job\nThey operate in thirty five states but in Washington where they're in trouble they're not allowed to hold any more state planning seminars they can't advertise they can't gather information first day planning documents that can't marketing a new lease or other insurance products you know and\nJust to explain why we don't hold the I'm not involved in the actual state plant I'll give guidance and some of what you should be looking for and I said you know and that's why we have west part the team you don't have to\nUse film but it is his thing\nI Want to walk right into this first story though we go over to Houston and insurance agent just took a plea deal on a new ... scam Gregory she's a insurance only in we weren't you about the brokers versus I Do share his but\nShe has accepted a twenty year prison term in a plea deal that's huge for a plea deal Twenty years what was the alternative that share what did she do she sold annuities she took three million dollars in total from them said she was putting it into an annuity\nAnd then after the surrender period there were to get annual or a regular payments from it sounds normal right she never put it in the new to she just putting her own bank account spin so they wrote the checks out to her yes they wrote the\nOnly way it could happen is they wrote the checks to her and that's giving somebody custody that show American Greed obscene\nA show about a guy doing that as well and it was just unbelievable and look everybody shows up on that show was give somebody custody\nAnother big fat red flag here Gregory rex she singled out clients who are older and had no nearby relatives and all of her victims were well over eight Seventy\nYou put anyone into an annuity over Seventy I mean it'd be pretty tough huh this is the biggest red flag that's on fire two of them were over the age of Ninety\nWhy would you ask me if we put somebody in over Seventy you asked me out a way that made it look like you wouldn't do that\nWhat it would just be tough if you have something with a surrender period on it you know we're we're we're talking about someone over Ninety if they're going to wait five years to get their money back ... the older you get the less set some of these annuity products made its high impression\nI if she if she lied to him because I don't know of any annuity company that would take a nine year olds money actually I don't know of any\nYou know you might can do a multi year CD type of annuity four eighty five fish to where it has just a couple of years surrender period\nAs such a ... I just don't know I\nI think ... actually I'll I'll put it this way I don't think any insurance company or take money of somebody eighty five or older what I find difficulty in as they have difficulty watched you reach age eighty that pretty much does it except for\nSome short term CD annuities it's not uncommon for people above Seventy to utilize them because once again it's correlated to their overall\nAssets and no matter what age you put your money and there's a surrender period so that has to be correlated to your other assets and what your\nLiquidity is it's often we have somebody come in that Seventy or older and wall no risk\nSo where do you go to yield\nAnd have it be risk averse helped me James whereas just in the ... well yeah it is that in ... that you gave me got me there is because you don't know they're they're it's bike CDs or there was Wall Street know yelled at the banks and risk Wall Street so\nThen the other question is why would somebody a seven day put their money at risk it should be drastically reduced what they put at risk at that point you know would you put it eight Seventy would you put a hundred percent of the grass at Wall Street\nI think that's insane ... right yeah so it has to be dial back that does it means to have people coming in wanting risk but\nYou know what we're going to look out for them on that and say hey you you might need half of your assets and ballot spin ... portfolio that but the thing is regardless of age I think there should be some sort of ballots risk versus no risk there and it's just a conversation that you have this person was\nPurely a con artist 'cause I don't know of any company that would take money at age nine any well I'm sure she told them some story because she is having them write the checks to her oh yeah Ninety year olds perfect for that but there wasn't no insurance company who's gonna take it\nWhatsoever it was that crook there's a reason for\nUs surrender period and you might think of it as\nSomething wrong I mean that there's a surrender period the reason there's a surrender period has the money needs time to work because they're taking the money and putting it in treasuries and high quality corporate bonds\nSo if you're putting it in that it needs some time you know what are you getting on a ten year treasury now if the insurance company wants to take longer to get yelled fine\nBut they're typically given somebody somewhere in the neighborhood of uh ten years surrender period\nThat's what makes it work\nAs a product is having a period of leaving the money what company so the company can make money\nAnd pass along the guarantees\nTo you and a lot of companies don't want to die for Seventy five\nAnd some don't want to die for Seventy so it starts reducing the field of how many companies want to be in that business now\nAre they changing a little bit because of longevity\nYes but they don't have a comfort level that they all have the money long enough that it's viable for them as well as the client and that's what you're looking at on a surrender period as somebody comes in her Seventy five is like are you know we're not doing health history or anything and he's not having to qualify health wise\nLike life insurance but statistically it's a actuarial basis is how long is this guy going to live and this is going to be profitable for us we don't want to do start this deal in him die in a couple of years they'll lose money in that case\nNo thank you very much for hanging out with us today uh we do the six days a week if\nYou don't get to catch all of our

nine nine five they really appreciate Brian current joined us there in that second segment I Want to get into got a really uh uh we get questions all the\nTime and emails and and the one this week as most of the you know I Do reverse mortgages and and this really just\nClarify for me number one why I Do what I Do as far as meeting with people before I send them to go get counseling because it it was disturbing in in a lot of times the emails that I Do get\nA or basically from people who have been misled or pointed down the wrong road or just given horrible information so ... in a nutshell this email here\nUm my mother age sixty five and my dad step at age sixty eight have a home in Long Beach that my mother had paid off\nMy step dad and reverse mortgage company talk to her into signing the home over to him\nAnd told my mom she could find her property she can she can sign her property over him and they could add her when she turned sixty three Okay Number one that that's disturbing their cause legal age of sixty two\nShe now sixty five and it found out that for two years ah she's been being told that they were going to add her but have not added her and now that an out the taxes are passed to enter and step dad is in poor health\nSo and now they're in a situation where with dad being in poor health here's where this kind of so now dad's in poor health and on top of that they now have to adopt\nTheir nephews that are Thirteen and Fifteen Years old so\nHere's a little bit of what happened here okay in in this is where the education piece and that knowledge and sitting down with someone who is looking out for you and not their bottom line okay\nSo after I talk to I called the daughter and she isn't just disarray because now mom is potentially going to lose their home and I'm actually helping them to try to get this figured out\nAt the time when mom had house paid off got remarried dad was a legal reverse mortgage age but mom wasn't\nSo they talked mom into signing house over to dad so they can do to reverse mortgage but here's where they went wrong they totally took her off of the reverse mortgage\nOkay this is wide number one if you come to me and I told somebody this week I Would not help them because one person was sixty three and the other one was fifty eight\nNo kudos to my boys who sixty three and he married to fifty eight year old how about your boy he's doing good so good for him but what I was not going to do is I was not going to do a reverse mortgage where somebody else is not a qualifying age\nAnd this is one of the reasons why because now this poor lady okay step dad or or new husband regardless of what my real thoughts of him are\nOkay kinda scammed mom out of this money by becoming on the house okay now I don't think that was his intentions and we know is intentions wanting to become deathly ill but now on fortunately\nMom is in a situation\nThat she cannot rightfully buyout that mortgage or take over the note on the mortgage\nWhereas if she would have been put on the mortgage as a non borrowing spouse and this again is why people have to work with somebody that knows what's going on and you can't just go to magnum PI or the fonts\nAnd talk to somebody out of a foreign country that's going to say you need to do this call this number and then when you've done that call me back\nThat it's not what you should be doing\nOkay because if she would have been put on even in that horrible situation as a non borrowing spouse\nAt least shoot if she would have Ninety Days\nTo prove that she can legally be part is part of the home or that she could afford to pay the taxes and insurance is and remain in the home", "year": "2018", "show_name": "CROSS COUNTRY MORTGAGE - MORTGAGE GUMBO", "city": "Moss
