threads his whatsoever do\nYou have high ceilings yo yo yo luckily in states at all the ... the news guy yeah a lot of news going on to a lot of new going on Yeah Yup some of the news here is a is not good\nSome real good and I think the reason why we've been doing a show about sixteen years now in the financial never is lacking\nFor giving us stuff to talk about is it never never never know but I thought it today we spend a little time going through some good things and bad things and also some checklist and an eight thinks everyone needs to know when when we talk about Wall Street because\nEverybody is in Wall Street whether they think they're in Wall Street or not everybody has some ties to Wall Street a lot of people say I don't care about Wall Street I'm not in it well maybe the company you work for years and if they have a bad series of reports you might want to think about looking for another job somewhere else before you get those pink slips that might come around the house and every single week we we meet with folks who want fortunately\nGet those pink slips and then we'd meet with him and we try to make sure to\nTo bring them back from the roof you know 'cause that that's really bad when something bad happens and emotionally you're in a different place when did this the ... the stages of rage in stages of depression and then you basically combined when you are told the company doesn't need you anymore oh yeah but he just closed its doors when you get there so\nOne of the things we do with people we serve is that we help them map out number one where they are right now and amazingly\nIt's not as bad as you think of as many times and we and matter of fact we seen some folks who were told by a company that they weren't need anymore and when we sat down to analyze were they were right now financially where they wanted to go into in retirement and their dreams and and even the dreams not just an easy but then once\nThey could have retired a couple of years ago if they have the right way of putting the right plan together translating that financial plan that everyone has and you might not think you have one but if you have any money saved anywhere you have a financial plan for you and you know when you always planned to save more in the future but it never happens Mr Moore but it's translating that\nLump sum and everyone has a lump sum somewhere maybe more than one translating that lump sum it up into a retirement income I call it [noise]\nPhilip money that's going to come to your mailbox each and every year regardless of what happens in the market regardless of what happens anywhere you're going to get that check and hopefully that check will increase we built increasing income into our retirement plans and so it's basically taken the ... out of living in retirement when you know that checks are gonna come Monday bills are going to come to I think\nExactly right and we I had a nice listen to come in and the other\nHey there was a that is a ... my twenty six years of my so what's the most enjoyable part of your job that is telling someone that the numbers tell us that they can retire sooner versus him later dead even a lot of times that we can retire today yeah\nYou know and I'm Wondering I'm finding too as if uh you're you're working with younger clients what I'm Talking about say the late thirties into the forties and they may not think about these kinds of things and it's it's good that you make sure that they are aware no matter as you said coach whatever their financial situation is right now right they can augment that by doing the right things with your advice\nYeah yeah absolutely right and so and then that knowing that you can retire when you want maybe you don't want to retire I'm not I'm not planning on every time but I Know\nIs that his name to hack yeah like yeah it's one of the timberland but [laughter]\nYou know as he as good as he seems like it's really good he's really nice guy I met him yet the nightclub were on the radio obviously so we've had a special meeting with them in the last year I got to meet a band called ... have you ever to order absolutely really cool it really cool guys to do\nA lot of these people you see on TV uh they're they're stuck up and they're not fun to be around do you watch homeland it all on Showtime course I went up I read some reports the other day about ... it was his name Saul yeah he's one of the most unfriendly guys to work with in Hollywood they really mean he walks in says lines and what's right back to the trailer [laughter]\nOh man he looks like when you think about it yeah he does all the ways that part of\nA very very bill ... but evidently\nHe really is I mean I don't want I wouldn't know about that I Would hope you do everything I Want to take so I get the heck yeah yeah and he finally takes all day doesn't kill that in character maybe later in character the hold up well a sort of is that John McEnroe wish and speaking of that Steve rolled it takes [noise]\n\nWell Marty I Want you to talk about this for me to because we got this report came on the wire services and in the wall Street Journal by the way\nMerrill Lynch to resume charging commissions on retirement accounts and then they said that it was the move as a result of the court ruling throwing out labor department's produce it ruined client's best interest interest so let's talk about this you you are you called my tension in this report so I Want you to tell me a little bit about your feelings on this ...\nAbsolutely as many of you know that there was a fiduciary rule that was going to be put in place and it was basically going to say that any retirement account\nThere could not be any commission's charge to get that account it would have to be the only so Merrill Lynch the largest investment firm and the country decide they would get out in front of his real Chuck and say okay if you're not in a fee based account and it is an IRA account we have to move you\nTo a fee based account or you're going to have to take the count and moving away from era which\nSo some of the people were already in a commission based in other words they paid commissions to get into the account those are called ... an interest rate sort of like when you go to the state fair unless you're lucky enough to have a coupon to get in free you pay for it to the right and so they paid the entrance fee and the deal the entrance fee was\nWhen you get into a show like that there are fees are going to be a lot less in the future because we're there might not be anything because you paid a fee to get in so they already paid the fee to get in and then down the road to come up with this thing we're going to move you out of the the account you already paid the fee to get in into an account we're going to charge you see every quarter absolutely\nAnd they and they said that the food that rule was requiring you don't do that which is false and this is the key the rule never pass\nKind of rules and they came out with this after they knew that the deal already didn't pass now how can they get away with something like that just shut day are a big company they work with the banks ... billion with a\nBank to bank of America O'Hara legit here's here's what's so crazy Chuck imagine this you're sixty five Seventy years old you're lucky enough to be in an account with marijuana it's a retirement account and let's say you have some principle production\nMerrill Lynch says we have to move you to a fee based account which is a risk account and invested in the stock market the market goes to a correction which we aren't dissipating a correctional the market\nImagine is let's say your brother is that an account this principle protected they say you have to move it into a risk based account because we have to charge you a fee and the market correct about twenty five or thirty percent how do you feel about that ...\nNow you've lost a lot of your double whammy yeah it's it's it's going to get away with something like that as we mentioned we weren't going to get by and what can you have a big meeting with other apps and they get them all excited then they play this music oh\n\nWell that's a straight guy for that consumer and the client will tell you it's not good\nWell here's here's the thing about that it's not been an issue because the market it's just been going up and up and up and up and up\nThat people are going to wipe out if they see those losses that you're talking about when they moved out over I mean so what's the alternative what can\nThey do well this is the this is what this report that came in and they made all these changes but everybody in the the the basic counts that goes you know what would change their mind that we're going to go back where we can starts commissions get oh yup\nYup well I mean so doesn't make any sense for the consumer doesn't\nKnow it will be no city out of the consumer and if I were Marilyn quiet I Would have some serious concerns about this change of direction\nSo we have a financial checklist we go through one of the things on there is does this make sense to you to do this you're the person listening you the person who has her money there and that would fail on our test one that I Do share a review fail tests west and and that would not check and so once we have one no\nWe we throw it out because they should be all yeses on his checklist if we have one do I don't like these things well it's not going her deathbed or it's okay or that's what everyone else is doing no that's wrong you know and that's we see that way too much\nIn this report their coaches passionate about that I read this report and there were Thirteen different times in this article where they use the word broker\nFor any of our listeners when you hear the word broker that is I commissioned type if he is not an advisor he is he or she or he usually we see a lot of them as your email brokers out there he or she a radio a broker if you call yourself a broker that is very difficult to call yourself a new Sherry\nI used to joke that they call themselves to broker because they make you folks you know need my opinion do need for broker anymore when you have a license for new series out there who were ... the best advisors\nExactly right and they called themselves advisors advisory that's ...\nYeah I Want a true fiduciary which is an investment advisor license with the state or the federal government is different licensing has different test is called a series sixty five license so point blank ask your person who you're dealing with our you sixty five license and they'll say oh yeah here we are in a sale you also broker license summer but some are due license\nRight I mean they can charge fees and commission and then the double whammy as I'll basically we're talking about either on your side or they're not on your idea of a different agenda point blank say they're either on your side whether or not the right ... that's exactly right they work it for you or are they working for the bank that's right but\nThat is exactly right I Want somebody in my retirement I Want so yeah he was working about me and not\nAll the time so I'm not for me Ninety eight percent of the time of the bank to present a time because that's you know I got to be a hundred percent right on your side and they must be you know nobody I mean this alert lighting for you I mean well yeah Marty sent this that we all basically where ...\n... I saw this article when I was just a do use a term that my dad used to say I was flabbergasted\nWell we're baffled did it get away with these days this survey but they hide behind the big bang umbrellas a lotta times right in the lobby like millions of dollars to lobbyist and to get away with it and we always see when when they get caught on this you hardly ever see someone go to jail or or get fined\nIt's always the bank pay into finding those they they always say well we pay a fine but we don't admit any guilt well if you pay the fine [laughter] I think you're if you're paying a fine what do you think right what do you think Bob ...\nAnd I'm going to\nVery careful because this is your money we're talking about this is your retirement you may have to work longer maybe retirement because you have someone taking fees that I always used to say and I've said this for sixteen years on the radio and twenty six years to clients whose retirement fund to yours or you brokers\nYours yeah All right so\nIf you're one of the ten people call but at least two hundred thousand dollars save for retirement this offers for you will put together for your very own retirement plan will look at where you are right now in the financial world were very passionate about making sure you're on the right track will isolate any financial termites you have folks that is unnecessary in my opinion\nThese risk and conditions we call those financial termites\nThey're hitting a lot of times if you had termites in your house would you want to know about them today\nOr ten years from now or certainly before you're out as a really long term I guy comes and puts a little trap around the yard and then the ... will put some financial trips out there who are like mouse trap so once we find those fees are not get away we are going to get rid of before you were going to eliminate them\nBut you're not going to get rid of them if you don't admit they might exist and if you're saying I don't have any fees you're absolutely wrong is always be somewhere right so we'll find out what's going on well look at the financial pass you on right now\nWill diagram a way that you get to for you to get back on that path or if you're on the right path in the great to know everything's fine Gore and really no it's fine deep down inside your mind is always that will seat of doubt that you're not quite sure if if you're going back every year to the guy who gave you the first opinion for a second opinion you're really not getting a second opinion getting reinforced\nFirst opinion so let's get that through second opinion we call it a financial MRI\nLot deeper than X ray looking at everything that you find this world in diagram me out for you your true retirement plan your true peace of mind when we go through Social Security reviews we we've had people that are what kind of claim of Social Security strategy that we're going to cost him about a hundred thousand dollars worth of their life if they didn't take the right one so we are limited to that confusion\nWe look at the fees will get the risk we make sure that you're on the right path we have some money dedicated\nTo retirement income we call it [noise]\nFinancial to plant every single year retirement you get a check the check could grow we also have a spending leave playing you you have a like let's say someone has a million dollars and they're worried about spending it because they want to leave it to their spouse or the next ... next of kin\nAnd spend a week when we'll give you income for the rest of your retirement and when you pass away\nEqual to or greater than what you started with goes on your next of kin spend it and leave it and then we also incorporate the advance to protect strategy you get gains you advance it you walk to gain in if the market goes down the next year you don't lose\nYou always advancing and protecting makes a whole lot of sense we see that the football team gets to lead\nThey're not passing them all over the place they're going forward for yards at a time of dancing and protecting and the three main points that are missing in many financial plans growth\nProtection in income you can have all of these do you call right now for the next ... worked great for you guys out there with a million but as long as you have two hundred dollars that we can get to work for you to get you on a path to financial righteousness\nOur goal here at the shows to help you make the best decision possible\nSo if you have any questions about what we're talking about or how when they apply to your own situation you can sit down and get a retirement roadmap put together\nAnd Paul Roberts whose coach Pete's local trusted financial coach and the Biloxi area and his team will translate for you that complex financial world and it's a very clear instructions now if you want to take advantage of getting this true\nOne of the three guys behind the basics\nAnd everyone's heard of Richard Branson and he must course but Peter demonic says the brains I think behind the operation and and so that one too and makes a couple years ago called the vision ear\nAnd you'll look around that society these days there's always somebody trying to do something to make things better\nAnd then there's always someone trying to do things worse too about the bank they're charging fees on people so\nDisruption that call Amazon dot com is has just written well first of all disrupted the book selling industry now is disrupting everything you know after ... ... you get you get an Amazon at a bank and everything I wouldn't banquet Amazon by the way I buy books from actually weeks' supply why we buy paper towels and beverages and everything from 'cause it's a lot cheaper\nCan be wise to just press a button and it is to have to go out and go shock and if you lived in New York City or if you lived in a skyscraper think about when when you want to go shopping back to the day you'd have to that's all day event\nSometimes as the the L day was broken Seattle walked down thirty five years I have a taxi cab which were owned it's its own fun and games there and you're ready to go to a store buy the food lug it back into the cab we'll get back up the steps\nAll day if they are right or you press one button on Amazon deliberate did or the FedEx and UPS men are too happy about that [laughter] I'd had opposed Mandalit a flight of stairs I'll tell\nYou what I got seven grandkids that's how we give them since we use that as I I don't touch it it gets sent right to their house all wrapped up in looks pretty\nTalking about what makes me excited the Amazon gift card 'cause I mean you can get anything you want their editors trying to get something you don't want like when I was younger we will get underway for Christmas [laughter] ever the friend alarms oh gosh I myself\nI don't know I saw an article today Jeff Bezos view that sermon of the company they said he makes one point five million dollars a day on his money on interest the nonprofit more interest on his money that's pretty nice pretty nice yeah that's like the whole kind of money [laughter]\nSo we look at the are going to quickly touch on this and then when we were on the next thing we're going to go through what we call brokers behaving badly unfortunately this is a story or more every day we finally have to go down to one a week but I'm looking at something called the auto retirement here that we're designing and it's about when you look at an artist and artist starts with a blank piece of campus and\nThen it's up to him or her to make a masterpiece\nAnd if you gave me a blank piece of campus and I and a paint brush I'd make a mess ... well that's got it on the war and all that so that's happening a lot of times when the financial world how do you know the plane or you're dealing with is Israel is an artist a financial artist how do you know\nIf they're working for a big institution you trust that big institution has looked at it but how do you really know if they're putting a plan together\nBased on what you have and so let's say that you you give the artist you give the Blake canvassing you give them some uh some yellow paint\nSome blue paint and some red paint and they paint just red yellow and blue on the painting\nYou gave it to a real artist and a real planner they'd make yelling boo now they have green writes it in ... and if you mix the while he let me give you test jak if you mix red and blue what do you get purple [laughter] so it's about the visionary not just saying what you have the right let's let's take those colors and let's combine them\nLet's hybrid dies I mean let's make a painting that everyone can be proud of and now you've got a ... kind of thing where you get the guy just those pain all over the stuff\nThe cameras and things oh we're going to try to sell it for a hundred and ... let me tell you what it is when he was going to love that you know the painting ... is is a five thousand years old and you you've got these guys looking at it let me tell you what he was like what he was like in any way that her ... as for me to talk of what he's trying to get done real quick taco truck without going to talk of the heritage was outside of\nThe food Carrie it's not going to try you know he's gone up so it's about putting the proper plan together and I know we joke about it which\nOn the financial world but it can be fun folks we want you to know that retirement plan and can be fun if you get the right team on your side and we will take what you have and analyze it for you and show you if there are better ways to put your plan on campus\nGetting that plan you can be proud of we call it the art of retirement and we if you are with the Next Fifty people call we will custom designed your own financial retirement artwork in other words your plan there'll be proud of you can display it to tell your family and you can look at that are and know what we were thinking and what you are thinking when that was\nDesigned how important is that that's absolutely crucial just back to that point we are talking about a few minutes ago so it's a personalized play and it specific to my goals and objectives\nYeah so again if you're one of the next Fifteen people keep in mind folks were very passionate about your belief that you deserve a secure independent retirement and that's why we offer at no cost a new obligation a consultation to a radio listeners right now the next Fifteen this consultation will help you determine how to prepare and

considered viable explosives that they are potentially destructive devices even though as I said the evidence seems to be mounting that these would not have gone off\nSo we've uh with the twenty four hour news networks you get a few facts and then you're you're left with twenty three hours of speculation yeah a has any of the is any of the speculation a ban on target to or I've heard the interesting theory or that it could be a foreign entity\nYeah I I think that has to be considered here especially due to the fact that this could be considered another form of election meddling so to speak and we've heard a lot about that through social media and such\nBut does this could be considered another form of that just to throw the whole process into\nA little bit more mayhem and to fuel speculation on both sides whether it'd be a Republican or Democrat or right wing or left wing fuel a speculation and rumors on both sides as to who might be responsible for this and to create more of a divide\nA than we already have in this country ... between the political parties so I think that that is a viable explanation I'm sure it's something that the authorities are looking into\n\nSo bills for you you mentioned that there's a lot to the authorities know and they're probably not letting us know yet or is there any any timeline that we can count on should we should we expect this to be resolved a week from now\nThis is also interesting uh I Believe that the investigation is ... is progressing quick enough that we could have a an arrest some time in the next week or so but\nThere is now some speculation uncle Henry that if there is an arrest made that that tales of it would not be released until after the midterm elections are so as not to fuel a the the ire of one party or the or another or to damage\nOr either party before the midterm elections now that is completely a unsubstantiated at this point but it it's certainly something that a is an interesting aspect of this whole\nThing well and that's something that I also wondered about because certainly or if there's an indication that that whoever did this is leaning really hard in one direction or the other politically um the the opposing sides going to want to make the most of that\nYeah especially to if this is I mean as we've heard some speculate that this was a democratic hoax that it actually is democratic supporters who wanted to create the situation in order to damage the Republican Party evidence found out that that\nIs the reason for this or it could have an impact on the mid term elections so yeah that's a that's a question to keep in mind as we move ahead but I think this investigation is moving ahead fast enough that we could have a some action taken and the next week or so\nWe're we're out of ... bills for thank you\nYou're welcome have a great weekend\nAnd said that was friday morning on Gulf 'cause mornings while we were talking about the suspicious packages\nAnd like I said this was a situation where you had a lot of information and it was moving pretty quickly now knows them for sad that could be in the next week before we get more information about what's going on\nBut it really was just a few hours after we did that interview where they arrested somebody in connection with these packages\nA law enforcement source confirming to Fox News than an arrest was made in this string them suspicious packages faxes Rachel Sutherland had more on that friday from Washington\n\nThis will be a big break in the case in several suspicious packages sent a prominent democratic officials over the past days\nThe arrest comes after the FBI scouring the sprawling nail sorting facility outside Miami, Florida\nWhere several packages are bleed to pass through two more were found this morning one at that Florida facility intended for democratic senator Cory Booker and another was discovered that a post office in New York City intended for former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nSay these packages are similar to others that contains suspected explosives in Washington Rachel Sutherland Fox News\nSo what we know and what we do now is changing pretty quickly will continue to keep you up to date with what's going on in regard to that particular story another story that was kind of ongoing through the week involved the migrant caravan and possibility of more than one migrant caravan heading toward the border\nAs that friday afternoon hundreds of us troops\nThey're planning to deploy them to the southern border as that caravan of Central American migrants continues to push northward and once again it's Rachel ... who's got the integrity\nSecretary Kerry ... Fox News the truth to assist us border patrol\nAnd they've asked for San air support for someone just excellent planning a vehicle barriers\nPresident Trump continues to send a clear message that the migrants who will not be allowed into the country this man says he still going to try this book papal organizers said they'll try to cover more than sixty miles today Rachel Sutherland Fox News\nOnce again that was a friday's story I just want to let you know that cause Gulf Coast issues there is a different times through the weekend now\nAs far as the ... elections coming up we're going to continue to keep you up today with what's going on there\nWhat was that with those suspicious packages that have been sent to different addresses over the week the migrant caravan a lot of different issues and the other big local one now this week was ... or ... von ...

Fox News the names of the eight men and three women gunned\nWith me right now out here in the political lucky is coming down the hot air retirement is income yeah and it refills the balloon\nIn this don't believe those big balloons were talking about it refills them so they continue to flow and float higher and higher yeah never coming down next to make sure our income plans are like that too so there are strategies for creating and preserving\nRetirement income and a lot of people are overlooking those we we have something we when we sit down with radio listeners we go through the financial spectrum it's called ... and it goes all the way from red to green and everything in between and you should have money in each and every one of those categories okay but unfortunately so many people were like the old seesaw they have all their money at risk\nAnd none of safety and none in income\nAnd so it's like the the big fat person on the seesaw sitting there and your way up and they are not coming down you gotta have proper about proper balance has always been the key but what is what we see this overlooked so how do you get from wondering if you have proper balance to having that proper balance where the worries are taken away\nWe have a three step process and incompetence twenty two different steps that go on behind the sea doesn't really wow\nSo three steps I think it's pretty good I like that yet\nI've never a good dancer but I think they had one called the two step right and they'll do this is one more to add one more death of chicken [laughter]\nBut uh it's about having the right income and an income strategy built in any financial plan turns it into a retirement plan and so I Do you you know about this I'm adamant about this because a retirement plan is one that his income but so many people out there I\nThink they have a retirement plan because their plan or the current financial planner who may or may not be ... keeps telling him everything's fine\nAnd maybe it is maybe it is it but I don't like the word maybe when we're talking about lifetime income now you either have lifetime income that's guaranteed for life that is growing and it gives you income and it's protected\nOr you do this and it was pretty cool it's like with a coin either it's heads or tails if it lands on sales in your broker keep saying that says [laughter] side of it broke her you know or maybe covers it up and what what what you see what it ended up but here's what I Want to do let's make it simple\nAnd we're gonna we're going to open the doors even wider this week 'cause

I was\nTalking about the person sounded okay that is that makes sense no and that's an immediate loss now you have for the year right unless it I mean what's that real estate goes up like crazy now here's the thing and that's bad enough that I think you agree that's bad isn't it and risk does that make you met data us it does I mean that's almost ... percent right I went to\nHarris Teeter shopping center to buy a half gallon of ice cream for five dollars\nYou give the person five dollars and of course tax cuts that on there to see how you get to the person five dollars and fifty cents [laughter] and\nWhat they do is they take your gallon ice cream to take this big knife you see like a ginsu knives [laughter] remember these to cut through the cans with it yeah and then it got through a tomato I remember the guy to take the ginsu knives out then they take a tape measure out and they measure one fourth of the ice cream\nAnd to cut it off a heart attack and then they put the dripping part of that's left the big three forced into your bag and drift over everything up they take that one fourth and they start eating it right in front of you that's equivalent to what happens when the person takes a fee\nAnd edit out of your money that you're trying to best why that's a really good in the United states slice outlay slice of the money you put in when somebody goes in your pocket some of them do and yours while and so but that's bad enough but another thing is when you buy these real estate investment trust\nThey are ill equipped for the most part they are non traded really hurt us you've heard the phrase non traded ... have you heard that I have\nYeah and probably when I met when I'm Talking about for me you know yet what about you know yeah in that but\nAll right to non trade that means if you buy it\nYou can't sell it right or locked okay it's like when you buy silver and gold now but it's been silver and gold at least is liquid because you can sell it back to the person you bought it from shore her last yeah sure you buy it for a hundred dollars and they'll say well why we buy back from you for night [laughter] I\nMight as my commission they say so they make commissions both ways okay yeah so it'll be very careful if someone is peddling\nA real estate investment trust ask them why\nAnd say how does that fit in what I'm trying to do okay sure because they're taking advantage many times of the fact that people know the where they want some real estate in their portfolio and if you want real estate go buy some real estate you can sell tomorrow that's what I was going\nTo add and we we hear a lot of people who say advantage of the rental situations uh read is very different than okay\nSo we've got this cheat sheet that you can use to and it's like oh gosh one two three four it's got six main topics in each each of those main topics has eight sub topics Mm So forty eight\nDifferent sub topic wow and six main topics but then be because you need to go through this before you buy something you'd never heard of ... like a real estate investment trust there we go yeah and one of the things that you have to say what what is that what are the strength and what are the weaknesses of that\nBecause many times when people come in and show us what they have\nAll they've heard about the strikes a which is hopefully this will go up in value can sell for profit but what we're doing not liking it then it's yeah the maybe the hospital I said hopefully hopefully yeah yeah I'm\nGoing to get a bell but ... and\nYou said maybe thinking though economy hopefully your fun to play with ... All right so\nBut it's not joking better people are getting into these they should get into that and a lot of that money's money they need to have liquid in a cup in the future maybe five years ten years there's no guarantee that money ... ... and there's no guarantee that money will ever go up and we've seen a lot of people lose a lot of money in real estate investment or I'm going to ask me

and that's the dilemma that's a problem a lot of people have so what we usually recommend is something we call bucket balance right so buckets of money so we need to take your money out of that one big bucket and balance it amongst three buckets and each bucket with its own purpose\nAnd you know balancing your buckets is very important and so simple and yeah but it's but you know 'cause we're looking at one big bucket and and if you ever have a big bucket of back in the day we've had these gigantic ten gallon buckets we'd have to fill fill water and bring it in one place to go there we put ... one summer and then\nForgot about him and just whatever health reasons but never tried to carry a big bucket of water that spilled over the top what happens to well let's see well I suppose it's all over and it doesn't help you know doesn't know and so every now and then uh maybe you'll lose balance in and they'll all be gone\nAnd so we have our money in the market bucket and the market goes the wrong way ... we may just run into\nRubble and maybe we'll get overloaded as the market keeps going up like a does what are you going to do the money's going to continue to go up if the market goes up but at the market goes down this what people forget about what happens to your money them\nAnd how do we know with certainty that we're going to have a count that has gross protection from the

balance better be going pretty good after twenty five years at a company or I Hope so yeah so when you when you put money into four one Kay what do you put money away for\nYour retirement that right at steady retirement income later on in life\nSo but the main problem I've seen is the options many times you don't have enough options or maybe you haven't had good guidance because you have a four one K. a person who administers the four one K. you may luckily if you're walking see that person once a year if you're lucky and you really have to say do what makes you feel good they really don't spend enough time with you and then you don't really\nYou know how the performance is or the hidden fees and therefore would catch whereas personal experience tells me that absolutely so again the four one K. accounts or for your retirement when it'd be great to retire your current four one K. was not performing well all announce to the past year so to speak there you go you know and so a lot of people ask Ken I retire my four one K.\nAccount wasn't working really oh yeah so that is interesting that I'm ... yeah and it will financial planning gets frequent everybody shore so is that possible well saving money to four one K.\n... does has some benefits are actually get the match into ... but some people find it unfavorable because the lack of flexibility yup inside the plant absolute and no income availability and they're so what you're doing is you're saying to put a lot of money and my four one K.\nWill Steve I think if you go both ways a lot of people get over confident and a strong economy and they spend more money than they should we like to categorize money in red\nGreen and yellow accounts the yellow counsel for emergencies that's the money you need to build up its outside the four one K. and outside of retirement plans that you can get if you need it for emergencies if you haven't built your emergency account up now is a good time too and if you

got when it looks like a big golden feather okay yeah I can see it at our studio and then our offices we have two of them and I actually have a ring the best selling all three wow which are are they maybe pay four dollars but I thought I was qualified to get it in the spring and looks like a Super Bowl rings okay it does yeah yeah and I got one of the one of the ... at least for success or not mix with the four okay\nOr the other one raise those Evan baby steps one I Love ... wonderful love the stores throughout it but the success anonymous books with Steve Forbes is loaded with chapters on how people can make themselves better okay\nAnd Thomas we talked earlier on the show about the retirement ready to get we did I get and make sure you retire when you're ready on your terms and\nWaste a recession proof your retirement years now what does that mean to you when I say recession proof your retirement what does that mean to use the thirty two year old\nOkay so that makes me think that are in the long term when I Am ready to retire I don't have to worry if the market where to begin to thing yeah I'd have that confidence\nWell yeah because the recession and I remember my grandparents that this was back in the seventies nothing ever got thrown away food wise ... I mean my grandfather make chicken one day and the next day be chicken soup chicken something else to catch it or you know it was like he would never waste a chicken as they would take the chicken bone or the turkey bone\nAnd put it in a stew pot and make turkey stewards ... you go yeah so it is it making sure that everything that you have gets used the right way okay and unfortunately when we're paying fees that we don't need to pay ... you are in effect throwing that edible food away every single year yeah and\nIf that food could have been put into better use or maybe you know get a lot more food with it so basically if you're paying the you're losing the buying power for that money so we need to make sure number one rule of recession proof in your retirement is make sure that the reporter forensic the analysis to make sure you're not overpaying on these that's right and\nAnd a lot of folks maybe like throwing food away they thought I was just garbage ... anything else with\nIt so you look at a statement and it doesn't look like you have many feet right not statement where the fees are really show many times when it's looking at the actual products of strategies you're in and many times the fees are built in or they are in documents that you don't know how to read\nIt's incredible every time we talk about it I just don't understand how it will I really\nThe recession proving retirement well it shouldn't be something called the fiduciary standard where the advisor is supposed to put your needs ahead of their needs us right I've been practicing that for twenty five years since I started very but a lot of people don't so I like to put myself in my listeners shoes in what they are doing what they need\nAnd what would make me mad is would be paying fees that don't have to pay through that I don't know about truth right double play wrong thing I hear you and so when we look at we we want to be prepared\nNot surprising retirement so about ... you can retire early if you get your ducks in a row the right way we need to make sure that we don't over analyze things we get a good team planners on her side\nThat understand what your needs and desires are and custom design the plan that fits what you're looking for the very very important yeah we're going to talk about this and the next segment oh in real detail but nine ways to protect you\n... okay your nest egg is money you're saving for retirement so about a bird it sits in the nest and it's like sits on the egg and it gets it all nice and warm and they finally had just mhm 'cause it's growing right right well you don't want it to be stolen or or crack before you before it ... and so facts are because we want to make sure but\nSome of the topics here we need to talk about is and who else out there besides million you\nIs worried about rising healthcare costs\n... a magic many of our listeners\nNow it's a big enough for when we have a paycheck coming in that's right and you get mad about how much comes in and it goes out to shore to think about retirement when you don't have a a work paycheck coming in and you still have now let me ask you this to the health care costs go up or down when we get closer to where to retire [laughter] I Would imagine they would begin going yeah\nSo we are going to get into the way back machine\nWe're going to talk about the nine ways to protect your nest egg this is from a class that I taught back in two thousand and five not\nAbout this on the radio show started by the way wow and so that's a long time by the way time but it is it doesn't seem like a do you enjoy what you're doing exactly so we need to make sure we designed plants that we have a transfer made this conversation okay\nAnd that's an informal usually private discussion in which two or more people exchange thoughts feelings or ideas by spoken word\nOften causing someone's life to be better in some important way and that's right from Webster's Dictionary right so a transfer made his financial conversation is from my dictionary here and we're going to go through all those ways ... ways to protect your nest egg we're also going to talk about the twenty two steps now we're ...\nWe do these all behind the scenes in three appointments but the total retirement plans\nAnd this is a way to retire with confidence many times to retire early but when you retire you know everything's going to be like it should because there's no guessing\nAnd there's no might happen that's right like when you talk to some advisors or here's some other radio shows the guy say\nWell if everything goes right and in certain things do happen you have about a Ninety percent chance of everything being okay dangerous we're not as what I don't like and I don't like all that stuff but the main thing that I have four is a hundred percent chance of everything coming out right to strike so then it's not a chance anymore right us right that's right when the chance to become a guarantee you when it's a hundred percent\nExactly when something you said as well coaches you want to prepare for retirement a success not one where you have to take you know ... percent of your income like a lot of people's strategy for\nWhere we end again yes we ain't for a hundred and twenty percent of your working income in retirement not Seventy percent of sort of we call retiring with success there you go not guessing and hoping for success exactly [laughter] and I I Love all these legal legal these things these days where people put disclaimer at the end where they tried to make a\nWell everything will be fine assuming no wait a minute once you say that word assuming everything you just said gets a race verbal racer examine other word is but exactly you know I Want you to have a great retirement but ... you don't really want me to have a great retirement that yeah so we need to be concerned\nA lot of people are concerned about if they'll run out of money in retirement so we need to check that off we need to totally eliminate that concern of running out of money every time it but not just not running out of money but having enough money to do what we want to do when\nWe want to do this right period mhm no disclaimer no but no uh most of the time all these other words\nNo data mining like I heard one guy and radio show say when we were talking about the way he was talking about four percent really had a caller call in and they said well\nA lot of visors say the four percent rule doesn't work it rained down market right and so he proceeded to say well it worked signed it up markets don't listen to advisor who talks about the bad things [laughter]", "show_name": "Robert's Wealth Management Financial Safari", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss Point",

services on the other hand the confirmation process of Brett Kavanaugh was the epitome of some of the most disgraceful conduct\nEver exhibited by United States senators in the history of our nation while associate justice\nKavanaugh did Nazis bullets emitted death he was most certainly assaulted in the most offensive ways possible by those who are supposed to support and defend the constitution of the United states of America\nThose very senators knew all too well to to judge was not protected against defamation because of the case of the New York times versus solving in other words politicians and public figures\nHave little recourse to slanderous conducted less actual ... says proven innocent almost impossible standard to prove which means that the judge by accepting the nomination to the court had to be willing to ...\nSelf and his family to horrific conduct by those opposed to his views if a nation is ever going to attempt to rebuild itself to very character of the nation must emphasize selflessness a moral code of decency\nAnd personal responsibility our national character as represented by great heroes like sergeant major can really is under assault\nThis battle was more than just the battle for Supreme Court nomination is about the very struggle for survival of the freedoms that we espouse in the bill of rights and for which such a major kindly and millions of others fought all of us in the military and government take the same oath of office to support and defend\nThe constitution of the United states of America the conduct of the senators attacking Kavanaugh on here said innuendo for political gain was disgraceful\nThose senators victimized justice Kevin okay Dr Ford and all of us for political gain\nThe different type of battle

unwavering criticism was the primary underpinning genetic civilized societies the presumption of innocence this nonsense that the presumption of innocence did not apply because it was a job interview is a travesty is a travesty inflicted by the opposing side upon the very character\nOf a person and our nation it was a sad day for our entire nation and those of us who fought\nTo defend this nation and our constitution your bill of rights and common law the sheer to publicity of their arguments fell on deaf ears of those of us who had to defend while in the military the character of our nation and our people elected leaders of which I Am now one have a responsibility to be statesmen first\nAnd politicians second the travesty the conduct of those opposing Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court cast shame and dishonor on the institution which they were elected to serve\nFortunately others in the Senate stripped from\nAnd upheld the societal framework of the presumption of innocence those brave senators was tremendous pressure to conform to very precepts of the constitution that they had been sworn to uphold when the nation centered citizens into combat and into the military\nAs a moral responsibility to support and defend that same constitution to military supported in harm's way whereas elected leaders are obligated to support the constitution and the halls of Congress both arenas are critical if our nation is just survive only through our emphasis on self sacrifice moral courage\nAnd a personal accountability where our nation survive our founding fathers
