[{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "Making sense of the stories you hear clearly and concisely you ... you ... [noise]\nOh Michael J. wonder how you doing [noise] those worms will join us crazy right [noise] Michael Jackson house this song crazy that was one of the greatest songs ever especially during this time of year happy\nHalloween folks let me be one of the first to tell you I'll be hitting a low Halloween parties and I put on by the title [noise] can't wait [laughter] gonna be a blast as I said I'm dressing up as a former not one in looking to win the competition got an old ... overalls\nI'll throw a plaid shirt on a straw hat and we'll go from there by decided to go scarecrow I'll go to one of the low cost to places and put some straw like in my shirt or something that's the versatility\nHey we provide education and options to you every Saturday right here on mortgage gumbo with Wainstein at one o'clock on a heart radio do you want to join a show Feibel four to six zero zero non not five hey just to talk about it a little bit about what we were discussing a second ago with interest rates in with everything going on\nLet me ask you this in in in this article came up and oddly enough I had a client this week will call me they've got some credit card\nThat they've got to he lock out there they wanting to pay off some stuff they want to do home improvements it's it's it's the typical client they've got some equity right they pay down their mortgage\nThey've got a four percent mortgage rate which is a pretty solid in this day and age right we're on we're we're on the way up way above that now\nSo called me to look at some options about refinancing to pay off some some credit cards\nBecause when he was wanting to do some home improvements\nOn credit cards okay so oddly enough there's an article this week uh on market watch one third of homeowners are paying for renovations with credit cards so my question to you is this revolving dead folks let me be clear is a fantastic thing\nIf you manage it correctly it is needed it's the easiest way for us to get your credit score up but you have to be careful folks you have to be careful\nThirty six point four percent of renovations in twenty Seventeen was done\nUsing a credit card eighty five percent said they use cash of savings to pay for renovations thirty three percent said don't use credit cards and only four fifty percent said they use it securing a home loan so that's why I wanted to bring us up you've just got to be smart managing your money\nThis particular client didn't like the five point seven five will save him about four hundred bucks a month and given 'em cash out to do is home renovations\nBut he thought he was going to use this credit card because there was a zero percent interest right one of those credit cards that's been sitting in a draw for six months and he would just pay it off then well listen if you had to thirty thousand in cash you'd be one of these other people that are using a cash to your home renovations\nSo you rarely just got to make sure you're being careful there so that's my point of the aisle discussing with every one is how we just got to change the mindset\nAnd get off of the fact that the interest rates are higher than what they were last year the interest rates are higher than what they were two weeks ago but that's okay it's not too late take advantage of the value of your home today and maybe look at all your stuff lay it all down you and your wife sit down have a taco\nOn may go hey let's just sit down and look at everything here and see where we're at and make the phone call and within Fifteen minutes I could let you know exactly what we can do\nThat settlements can wreck your life I agree one hundred percent\nLet me tell you how that settlement works folks number one debt settlement works by stopping paying your bills that is never good okay then you give a firearm a debt settlement from\nYour money so they can go to negotiate how to pay them okay\nWhen you give them when you save about half of your outstanding debt that will then begin to contact your creditors so you're giving\nThese firms all that money that number one is not a good thing that what they're going to do is they're going to call it try to make a lump settlement and I'm going to get into that in a second 'cause I guarantee you there's a lot of this that you do not know because I Know they don't mention is on the commercials\nOkay and then you pay the debt settlement company twenty percent\nOf what you save twenty percent you talk about predatory lending\nOkay so if you oh ten thousand dollars and they settled for five you're giving them a a thousand dollars to the debt settlement from\nThat's a lot of money so let's look at this so you oh ten thousand dollars\nYou settle for five thousand you get the debt settlement company which twenty percent of ten thousand folks to grant right so when you're looking at this do you understand that difference\nOkay that difference of what you pay that company you were going to have and here's the caviar that I Know you all don't understand\nYou're going to owe taxes on that three thousand bucks\nThat your creditors wrote off you owe taxes on the money that the creditors right off okay so the reason I'm saying you got to take out the money with the credit repair with the credit debt settlement company\n... were you aware of that that is a taxable event\nThat is why I cannot stand the debt management companies I cannot\nBecause so many folks do not realize what you've got so you owe the IRS okay in this situation basically you're twenty five ... if you're in a twenty five percent sales tax bracket\nYou're going to oh two hundred fifty dollars for every thousand bucks that you know if you're in a forty percent tax bracket forty percent of four hundred dollars on every thousand that you owe\nSo take that example ten thousand dollars you settle for five let's make it simple say you get the debt settlement management a thousand\nTwelve hundred and fifty bucks is what you owe the IRS folks you don't have to do that let's look at credit repair let's look at what some of those options are those who have worked with me understand a lot of times we let those sleeping dogs die if it's old debt\nWe're going to leave it to be we are going to leave it be\nSo the reason I bring this up is I'm hearing more and more and more of these people out there and I watch these commercials and it really is offensive to me it's almost like they're in pastors because nobody is understanding your credit\nWill be absolutely\nTrashed okay your psycho score will absolutely drop it'll be like throwing a walk off of a cliff or into the water\nOkay because what you've got to understand is watch that stuff done\nThese things are going to start reporting all thirty sixty Ninety Days late or longer they're going to be reported then they're going to have charge also on a charge off can stay on your credit up to seven years\nThat is going to be a tremendous effect on your credit score\nSo I just want you to be made aware of that and that's why I wanted to make sure it's not a whole bunch to go into but that's one of the things that you have to be made aware of\nIt if you had enough money to sit here and negotiate and pay some farm to they'll go go go negotiate you probably do a better job of managing that yourself\nCall me during the week I can just play more about this than I could tell you about I'll free credit repair program we got five oh for two zero seven seven six zero zero or even for a mortgage gumbo dot com say Dwayne let's chat

[laughter]\nSo accustomed to write Marty's accustomed Taylor fitting a plan but if you're listening right now and you want to get accustomed plan you want your four one K. analyze the big problem with ... a lot of people are participating\nThey're putting money in every paycheck but they really don't know what allocation of sweat that they don't know if the selections they have a good and they don't know the hidden fees that exist in there and by the way folks are a lot of hidden fees and four one K. or they wouldn't be pushes or we can analyze that for you get you right on track and go according to go through a Quarterly Review process with your selections\nAnd then make sure that when it comes time to make sure that four one K. now turns into a true retirement plan that income we can help you with that as well but the first step is to get a financial and retirement review looking at the road you're on right now the path you're going down and we take a GPS satellite view making sure that the road you're on right now will get you to the true destination you think you're going to\nAnd you'd be amazed how many people are way off course\nAnd they beat every year with their visor visor tells them everything's fine ... why do they tell them that that\nThat might be a place that that's why we stress the folks has come in and get that analysis done so we put an Eighteen page report together\nAnd it is the best of luck in opinion that you average it on your investment account we look at these we look at expenses and we look at risk adjusted return Jeff arm are returns where they should be commensurate with amount of risk that I'm taking which is crucial and that's what we call it the personalized plant\nSo we take those Eighteen pages and we consolidate them right down to one page lineage review and if your radio listener right now and you have at least four hundred thousand dollar save for retirement\nThis review will be for you or strategies do work best but those have you with over a million dollars but as long as you have at least four hundred thousand or so safe retirement and in for one k.'s or not you're home you're home you're not going to sell your home and live in the streets of retirement but anything but real estate like that is right now if you have rental real estate that can be included in that\nBecause a lot of times when people get older they want to transition out of the real estate and into a safe investment that will grow it'll give them protection it'll give them income for the rest of their life\nAnd if you have rental real estate it all depends you only get into someone's paying your rent I write so we'll we'll put all that together for you if you're one of the next twenty call was right now and Marty the most important thing is they'll have their own customized income plan poked you have your own income plan if you call right now that you'll be competed in and it'll be true again it'll have gross\nIncome and protection all built in is a triple play the positive triple play in the financial world but what Marty talked about the most important part of this whole Eighteen page plan\nIs we give your own personal lives and customize calculated risk exposure level as it currently exist now based on their risk you're taking right now in the market what would happen if it went the wrong way what would a duty of portfolio and if the market keeps going up what would be on the positive side said well wait a positive person negatives the secret of retirement is to get that curve down\nSo if the market goes down you don't lose much if any of your retirement money now there's nothing wrong with taking risk but don't do it with money you're going to need\nAll the way through retirement we can show your own calculated risk exposure level as well as your very own income plan which we call turning a financial plan into a true\nRetirement plan no cost her obligation\nWe seen others offer this for over a thousand dollars or more and you know we could charge about two hundred dollars an hour for this but we're going to have it as a radio listeners to call right now you meet with me Marty Parker and the team will put together a plan for you that you can be confident that will take you all the way through retirement\nFinally someone is offering retirees and pre retirees common sense and straight talk instead of financial double talk in a retirement sales pitch folks you need to sit down and get a retirement written that put together\nAnd Paul Roberts who is coached Pete local trusted financial coach and the Biloxi area and his team will translate for you that complex financial world and it's a very clear instructions this is an excellent chance for you to get a true practical

result of the court ruling throwing out labor department's produce everyone client's best interest interest so let's talk about this you you are you called my tension in this report so I Want you to tell me a little bit about your feelings on this ...\nAbsolutely as many of you know that there was a fiduciary rule that was going to be put in place and it was basically going to say that any retirement account\nThere could not be any commission's charge to get that account it would have to be the only some Merrill Lynch the largest investment firm and the country decide they would get out in front of this real Chuck and say okay if you're not in a fee based account and it is an Iowa recount we have to move you\nTo a fee based account or you're going to have to take the count and moving away from era which\nSo some of the people were already in a commission based accounting other words they paid commission to get into the account those are called ... an interest rate sort of like

I'm going to work there for a day I have an element yeah very cool and then they're going to interview me alone quote unquote working there and er about my experiences with blockbuster in the past you

had never library books back into the check a book out and you have to do overdue by maybe forgot to turn it back in all summer so they they sent you a bill for like fifty dollars typically costs twenty [laughter] so that's what they did with his videotapes too if you didn't turn it back in ... a lot of money yeah\nAnd there was no recourse I mean you had an oil yeah no way of proving it so it was it was a he said she said they haven't really had to be very careful on that so anyway that I thought I'd share that because we're we're positive about the movies and I want a couple of these

these guys are amazing what they do every day\nYou know the sad thing about all of this you know I Want to remind\nYou because ah you know I've lived through some of this myself at all explain that in a minute but you don't remember when Bernie Sanders it one of his supporters shot Steve ... shut up\nAll these Republicans at a ball field a nearly killed Steve ... says the fact that he's a walking miracle and I know because I knew what was what he was really going through at the time was far worse than was reported and uh people wanted to blame Bernie Sanders says you can't blame Bernie Sanders for what one does listen\nNow I I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here All right and I believe him\nAnd I said that and just like I said in the years gone by remember when the one guy broke into the White House\nWhen Obama was president and is it there came up a number of times I have a number of tape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but\nProtecting our elected president is is job one for all of us as Americans he is our elected leader whether you like it or not and here's what I said Mr Speaker you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House\nNot only did he get in the door but he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms of the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas\nThat is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah I mean what ... ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect our president that that represents the free world\nSo they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and any time any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile and and if we're not protecting our president we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching this\nSo I said that many many times you know and I say this only because um there's this idiot on fake news CNN is they my ... what's his name John Avalon somebody who's taken cheap shots of me a number of times over the years\nAnd I want to play for you what he said because he basically links the bombs sent to De Niro to me let's just played that part of what needs but basically blaming me listen to this\nLike Sean Hannity says had a direct language man we don't we don't know who it is we don't know the motive but what was fascinating is you see a direct patterns between the president's attacks on Twitter and and the stage in big echoed an amplified by Fox News and other folks in the conservative jets yeah because here it's not like the others right why Robert De Niro\nWell one of things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blessings in Europe for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things which you said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden it becomes ... or the Robert De Niro calling the president devil and us devil worshippers effect you know\nI'm used to play the victim card but at the top of mind ten days ago and the ... see what is that when we find out who this is um because some of these figures are are more prominent on the on the campaign has been ... so you may sort of\nLenient blaming me because the narrow got one of these packages well let's listen to De Niro and the things that I've been critical of De Niro about let's listen to what maybe I was talking about\nI mean he's so blatantly stupid he's a punk his dog he's a pig he's a con\nArtist a mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework doesn't care fix these gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster he's an embarrassment to this country\nIt makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool disposal has wound up where he has talked how he wants to punch people in the face well\nI'd like to punch him in the face today the world is suffering from the real Donald\n[noise] I'm On um\nHe's been charged to die with five federal crimes including interstate transportation I'm an explosive\nIllegal mailing of explosives threats against former president some certain other person's threatening interstate communications and assaulting current and former federal officer\nAttorney general Jeff Sessions at a Justice Department news conference moments ago saying the suspect could face more than fifty years in prison if convicted also saying the case sends a message\nBut let this be a lesson to anyone regardless of their political beliefs that we will bring the full force of law or get anyone to attempt to use threats intimidation and outright violence to further and agenda\nEchoing statements made earlier today by the President Fox is John decker live at the White House\nIn announcing that law enforcement in South Florida has arrested a suspect President Trump said that these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country much\nNever allow political violence to take root in America\nAnd I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it\nMeanwhile law enforcement officials tell Fox News another suspicious package has been intercepted in Burlingame, California address to Tom Sawyer the

policy takes over the house you know she's going to have open borders you know she's going to want to raise taxes you know show hunted killed jobs she'll put back in regulations and guess what they're going to try to impeach president so\nYou've really got just over a week\nTo try to stop poetry and the Democrats from winning and the Republicans really need to have a laser focused on that and run a very very hard contrast campaign and the worst thing is right now in Ninety percent there's a story I think Ninety percent of the congressional districts that are competitive\nThe Democrats are raising the Republicans and it's not by little amount it's by big amounts so you have a congressional race where the Democrats are spending a other Republican two million to one million in in Virginia ten were barber construct running for reelection people were saying all your polls were wrong because you have a point it had\nAll the Democrats last friday put in for a million dollars in the last two weeks versus are two million between the Republican or groups in a center account I mean Congress on contract so the Democrats are playing for keeps and the Republicans need to have that\nLooks like the Democrats have just seeded the Senate than in other words they're putting all their money into house races just to get the one chamber absolute so let's say that that that what you're saying is true if the Democrats blows you become speaker and the Republicans hold on to the Senate and they pick up seats in the Senate so that would sort of be a split decision by I guess any measure right\nOr just split decision except that the Democrats will have a focused they will control the house I think of the committees that are going to change\nTo think of think of the intelligence committees set of newness running it you'll have Adam Schiff gets what's going to happen with the with the with all these investigations et cetera\nGuess what's going to happen with the Judiciary Committee ... there'll be relentless investigations are President Trump that he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go they'll go check his taxes the leak all this stuff and it'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know us Paul\nSoon as we get calls before the elections from hedge fund guys for major Wall Street guys what are you seeing in the in the election all you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means to the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think Doug shown to you in the same area you said it's getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see it between twenty five and thirty see I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house\nThat that is correct time could jak thing they\nDon't want it or they are saying the Democrats could win by little as two seats\nI Am saying that I said on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same range I think John's analysis is very very rare and I think he is right to say that the Democrats\nAre mobilized and focus on the um on the house to the exclusion of the Senate but the amount of money that's being spent on really the thirty races I think Sean butter on your website cannot be underestimated and\nYou know mid term elections tend to be referenda on the president and the incumbent party and there's one little dirty secret\nIt's not so much Donald Trump said as a risk it's the Republicans in the house and Senate will have much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nAt one of the weaknesses as it relates also to the Republican House is there's so many retirements what are their forty five separate retirements are incumbents and name recognition for a lot of people in a lot of these races is negligible zero it takes years to build up name recognition in a district John\nAbsolutely and by the way that that top thirty most important races that you put on your website\nThose are critical to set the Republicans really need to win and and Doug is it is I mean granted the Democrats should be listening to them but fortunately for us they don't listen to him too much for one Democrat that does listen to him his former Mayor Bloomberg in New York City\nWas a big superPAC and it's putting the resources into electing Democrats in the house now that he's gone back to being a registered Democrat and the Democrats really\nDug understands it they they\nThey're very smart they really understand how to how to win races and how to take power and the Republicans need to wake up I mean those of us who are older I remembered delivering a survey that Haley Barbour helped a pay for Nineteen Ninety four in September that had we had the generic Republicans up\nSeven and that was to the house leadership and there was a soon to be Speaker Gingrich with Bob Michael I was presenting the numbers to him saying you're going to be the next speaker and\nWe just need to not compromise on Clinton care well Haley Barbour far ten million dollars to help when more seats and win that election the Republicans are raising record some say the orange she has out raised a has out raise the uh uh uh Democrats their National Committee two to one of\nThe ... that money needs to find its way into the into these top thirty races that you've outlined where the Democrats are spending has virtually two to one and all those races this week and you've got to be able to put money into those races where there's digital LEDs a\nTV ads even national and saying stop polo see\nWe've got to have an equal voice with the Democrats\nAnd uh uh ... they've really they really are focused on trying to take over the house and it's and it's their their shot at power\nWell they're shot a power but remember you know as those that have been saying the investigations into the deep state in I don't believe that's true because we have Senate committees that are just as capable of doing that as well and similarly if the Republicans were able to build their majority in the Senate any legislation that Nancy Pelosi and company want to pass\nThat is going to be against what the Republicans want in the Senate is never going to get through it'll die there\nAnd we'll have divided government but I think you're most right and the fact that it's going to be basically two more years like we've had and that is endless you know ridiculous absurd obscene investigations show trials by Adam Schiff Maxine Waters you know Gerald Gerald Nadler and company and\nIn other words the progress will will slow down dramatically now there is also the hope that Republicans in the lame duck session could actually get in there and pass the funding for the border wall and maybe repeal and replace Obamacare in the meantime\nLuck I think Sean that if that is John and I think folks that are suggesting that more likely than not the Democrats win the house what we are looking at with almost great certainty is ... come critical out for two years\nI make a slightly different on a book on the ... first before I'm a ... I Know John is certainly knew shot I just hope we stop demonizing of doing what Maxine Waters it saying\nTrump responsible for ... for a set of uh uh sending that the ten or twelve arms around or vice versa plan that Democrats can we focus on our national or our borders and our future\nIf we had that I Know you've got to admit that we had the wall we didn't have to worry about the the migrant caravan watery\nBuilt building the wall and having a pathway to ...\nOkay so that I hold trucker offered that deal to the Democrats that do have a dream it\nIn a heartbeat why didn't I was ... because I think it was pulled off the table pretty quickly when some of the Democrats said yes but goodness gracious I Would do that in our heartbeat I think it makes sense or Don Lenny in Indiana is saying that and I think he's right\nOr Donnelly is now down by four to broaden the libertarian candidate thankfully is falling off a little bit in Indiana anyone votes for the libertarian in Indiana you're just basically a giving a half a vote to Joe Donnelly but Joe Donnelly is in trouble I think the biggest polling surprise that we saw in the last week was Joe Manchin down by two\nPatrick Morrisey was on this program yesterday that seems like a potentially winnable race ... are they in\nA mansion where when that will win a rail I felt\nThe same thing or two but I Will tell you mentioned didn't vote for the tax cuts mentioned didn't vote for Gorsuch it appears that mansion had an election year can conversion by voting for Kavanaugh because he knows his career would be over and more importantly the economy was saved in West Virginia coal mining industry by Donald Trump not by mentioned\nAnd I think mentioned did have an election year a conversion and that's all of the good\nElection year going to hunters and mean lets be a phony for for a couple of months they will go back to being the liberal we really are\nThat he's not really a liberal he's the most conservative Democrat\nNow literally live in this environment that means it's just not a super radical\nYou know left wing lunatics that is all happening All right we'll take a break we'll come back more John McLaughlin Doug shown are posters eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number\nA we'll have the latest on what is going on in terms of this the suspect that they have now in custody\nAnd more details as they become available they've uncovered recovered fourteen suspicious packages addressed two prominent people will get to that of course the blame game has been on since the first thing this morning\nAnd it's absolutely sickening the way especially CNN has been handling this and much more straight ahead right so the biggest part of off year elections mid term elections that turn out that means you showing up\nAnd this election that we have coming up well it's the most important we have seen in decades why because your savings or tax savings that's on the ballot the American economy is on the ballot America's comeback is on the ballot your jobs are on the ballot your kids' future is on the ballot your wages your four O. one K. is that is also on the ballot\nAnd if you're a small business owner your tax cuts are on the ballot\nAnd here's the biggest issue on the ballot who is in charge of America's future\nPoliticians bureaucrats the socialist in DC or you you want to preserve the victories of the past two years\nOld get involved this election this November and go to big choice election dot com big choice election dot com they're going to make it simple for you to do your part\nSocialists left leaning Democrats and the New York state assembly and he's trying to cast himself as a Republican or a moderate in his district these narrow brief wants the word Democrat\nHe's trying to deceive and condo voters here and just say okay I'm a moderate I get along I work with everyone you know when he gets he sucks up to Cuomo in silver whomever is telling them what to do and he's one of the twenty four Democrats across this country who's trying to deceive\nThe voters by saying oh no I won't vote for Nancy Pelosi meanwhile he's taking a max the nation fourteen thousand

in New York City Governor Cuomo Alec Baldwin all of these Hollywood\nLeftists who are all in just trying to attack the president and try to hurt the upper a region of New York where are our middle class taxpayers are finally seeing a break free policies for this president\nBut never things to the governor of New York I'll say that and you know the district by the way approves of the way the president's doing his job\nOf courting so the latest polls and Trump won the district by a healthy what ten point margin over Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen I think it was eleven points to be specific\nAnd it's a district that has benefited not because of anything Albany has done I mean there was a recent editorial about how bad upstate New York has become under Cuomo and\nYou know I sat with him and he looked me in the eye and said he's going to open up fracking before the last election he just lied to my face he did the exact opposite right after he was elected\nAnd meanwhile Pennsylvania's economy is growing up because they are now ... securing the prosperity of natural gas that exist in their state and we can be doing the same thing up in your area and we don't do it yeah\nActually we call it the Berlin Wall my district goes into Binghamton groom county which is on the border of Pennsylvania\nAnd you see the stark difference between the southern tier which has watched so many jobs this is where IBM was actually founded now we've lost it thanks to the policies of the Democrats in ... that have just strangled our economy we're actually seeing an uptick I'm a small business owner in this district our family business which started in Nineteen forty six\nI'm I've been around and just see I've traveled to fifty or Seventy five businesses I have yet to meet

I don't really get the sense after reading his statement in hearing what he's saying and what he's with standing in the halls of the Senate today\nUh that that really might impact that much at all I got the sense that he did it for all the right reasons as well as articulated by senator Collins and what was the most riveting one hour speeches I think I've ever seen on the Senate floor that actually meant something\nAnd now she's systematically went through every single not only allegation but the role of advice and consent\nThe meaning of the constitution the interpretation of the federalist papers\nUm what it means to the whole issue in process of\nOf a presumption of innocence and and how important it is to society or even issues where I disagree with her like for example roe v Wade and precedence and and judge Kavanaugh is real record she she brought a level of of seriousness and sobriety to the entire debate\nI just I I I don't know her and I frankly was blown away by this today and it give us some reaction to all this we have David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney gray Jarrett much those legal analysts author of the number one bestseller the\nRussian hoax Greg what was your reaction to that speech I don't know if he had the same reaction I did I was I was stunned I I don't know Susan Collins well but I Know a better today\nIt was nothing short of brilliant ah with with uncommon eloquence and sound reasoning she delivered the finest speech on the floor of the U.S Senate that that I've ever witnessed in for a non lawyer\nIt was a come Halloween legal brief in support of Kavanaugh I thought it was important\nThat at the outset Collins condemn the outrageous behavior the distortions by special interest groups activists protesters and some Democratic senators making it clear\nThat their shameful character assassination backfired on them as far as her vote\nIs concerned and and I I the best part of what she said uh was re counting many of Kavanaugh's opinion to demonstrate\nThey'd even Democrats and liberals should be satisfied if not pleased with Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice but you know she did something unique here uh\nShe reported the sexual misconduct allegations and said in no uncertain terms that presumption of innocence and fairness is relevant in the Senate advise and consent\nDuty and she announced her own standard for considering accusation she said it should be more likely than not which lawyers you know in the civil cases is called a preponderance of the evidence or and she said it wasn't there\nThere were no witnesses to corroborate Christine forward including your closest friend nobody has any recollection of it all said so under penalty of perjury so she present ...\nThat was probably the most impressive I mean her of a real obvious heartfelt caring for professor Ford\nAlso excoriated whoever it was and she doesn't believe it was Dianne Feinstein and she defended both ... and Senator Grassley in terms of the fairness\nWhich I said from the beginning I think the seriousness of the allegation deserved a serious response from the Republicans and often a critic of them and I think they did handle this perfectly on their side\nAnd but whoever did leak this today grave disservice to this woman and there's no doubt about that David shown let me bring you in and get your initial thoughts on what we watch unfold year now with the announcement Jeff Flake Joe mansion and Susan Collins it would appear that tomorrow's vote expected to be around five in the afternoon eastern time on a Saturday\nOr that the\nThat judge Kavanaugh has the votes to be confirmed to the United States Supreme court\nBut certainly looks that way I'd like to think that senator Collins speech brought some dignity back to the process is certainly did for the moment when she was speaking she you know as a student at Senator Bill calling from Maine I was very close friend of mine with whom I disagreed on some issues but it was ... he thinks that same vein\nYou're absolutely right what she said was so critically important\nAgain it emphasized the language of article ... section two accredited she'll have the power\nWith the advice and content that's what's been lost and all of this also critically important that you emphasize the presumption of innocence you have some legal scholars and commentators during the course of this that they were all of a sudden this and one of the presumption of innocence doesn't really apply this isn't a trial it's not a trial based\nConcept in American law that kind of fundamental American principle that's the way we go about our business we don't assume based on allegation and a man or woman has built up a career is guilty was important for that\nUm I worry still I have to say about where we go from here because we have seen behavior by United States senators and has been going on the scale that I never in my wildest perhaps naive dreams couldn't imagine with hospitable people who simply don't know anything about\nProfessor Ford or judge Kavanaugh who ... carved out a dish and you were a bad guy if you didn't wear black to Columbia Law school during the Kavanaugh hearing that meant you might believe judge Kavanaugh this is beyond the pale is the future lawyers I'm worried about where we go from here in the last one I Want to make um this is\nThe very same people who are land that the president for daring to criticize crooked FBI agents who have been proven to be ... et cetera those people for whom stroke was a hero\nOr now criticizing the FBI this wasn't a fair a thorough investigation they moved the ball or with their criticism whatever it is for judge Kavanaugh was that he was a sex offender now is not that they don't like the meter because he took it personally when\nIt 'cause I don't know they don't like his temperament was once opposed to respond to be a serial drug or ... and gay rapist of teenage girls I I don't know what the appropriate response except if you're innocent just outrage and anger at a level that I couldn't even begin to describe but\nUh it looks like this goes forward it looks like Kavanaugh has the votes that will support his nomination and that this will conclude tomorrow barring any unforeseen\nLast minute you know insanity but I Will tell you we won the issue we've got to deal with and I'm I'm I got to say goodbye to both of you thank you both from weighing in on this Lindsey Graham is coming up but I Will say one thing\nI Will vote chicken

show up but if you don't show up all of the progress that we've made in the next two years is in jeopardy\nAnd you're going to get endless investigation possible impeachment they have stated publicly they want their crumbs back they have stated publicly in other words they want to raise taxes well that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama\nWhich put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty and he became the only president in history ever to never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on manufacturing jobs of post jobs so never coming back\nWell in less than two years Trump's brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nHalf the time he brings it back not only by ending burdensome regulation and asking businesses well what do we what can we do to help facilitate you working here and building here in grading factories manufacturing centers here and\nWell they tell him well you know it's costing us you know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... that because of that regulation or the president's wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that is created a tax incentive for business to build in America and then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just walls humiliate publicly any company that is not building in America\nAnd then on top of that each challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years and he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out\nAnd we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico\nHave you don't fight for a better deal you're never gonna get a better deal pretty amazing\nI Know everybody's been all hyped up about Kanye being in the White House you know I listen very closely what ... was saying and I'm like\nWhy do we think we need some prison reform I'll give you an example\nWhen the president ... commuted the sentence of ballast marine Johnson remember the woman at a given like a life sentence one of the fence drug offense a grandmother apparently she'd running a horrible economic difficulties as like ... there's no new ones sometimes in our criminal justice system\nAnd we spent Twenty one twenty two years in jail I had an opportunity to interview or\nI absolutely fell in love with this woman she comes rushing out of prison if the President Trump does this for her\nRight into the arms of her loving family I got to meet her sister and I got to meet somebody a lawyer that was working for her pro bono and helped make this happen and then she goes to the microphones and she says to America thank you\nThank you for giving me a second chance I'm not going to let you down\nWell I Want to find all the hours Murray Johnson's in prison that or like car with that attitude that deserve a second chance and you know that would that maybe but given heavy sentences for reasons for whatever the reason happens to me I agree with you we can find those people\nYou also talked about safe neighborhoods we need safe neighborhoods I disagree with among stop and frisk only because the murder rate in New York well I've been here under Rudy Giuliani went from about twenty five hundred a year down to three hundred\nThree or four hundred burning Carrick was a big part of the success of that program\nIt just works unfortunately got to go into the neighborhoods where the crimes are being committed with the shots being fired wherever it happens to be\nAnd you have a grasp of resources and policing of those areas so every man woman and child can go to sleep at night and not worry the bullets are going to be flying through their windows and the next hour it's unbelievable that nothing is ever been done\nAt this point to pick Chicago\nI mean it's it's sad it's unnecessary ... our our human our human family and talent or being literally you know are literally evaporating before a rice\nIt's unbelievable we can do better we ought to do we owe it to people to do better and then he's talking about bringing jobs making things in America and creating jobs in America\nYou know they shouldn't be about conservative liberal Republican Democrat but liberalism fails socialism redistribution has failed and we see it we had eight years of it and width hasn't done a thing\nAs white as a any African American conservative that speaks out is just beaten up and excoriated on a level that his downright racist and disgusting\nWhy is it matter if somebody happens to be African American and a conservative and it happens all the time and somehow in this era of political correctness\nIt's acceptable to say the most disgusting and atrocious and obnoxious vicious viral thing you can\nListen to some of the things said about Kanye\nWest is what happens when negroes don't read flat folks\nOn about his praying tiny west and the racial giraffe now all of a sudden ... because he put on a mat hats and he's an attention more like the printed as he's all of a sudden now that the the model spokes person he's he's the token negro of as of the Trump administration's this\nWas an embarrassment ... mother is rolling over in her grave\nI think you had there and man has clearly not okay to president who's willing to point that was a combination of famous consciousness I felt like I sit in on a psychiatric ...\nAnd a commercial for Donald Trump on the question of of of mental health on the question of other cleaning ham I felt very good point and to me\nI never something very fragile valid and sad about tiny probably had a phone and France played Taipei in his country outside I think that for their own and falling out somewhere picture of a ... I mean just to expand on that it seems like an important point I haven't heard anyone else on television make at that but I think\nWe had a thoughtful play by play and political on out here not thinking is that with ... on our white\nI'm just going to be honest and they gave me a lot of trouble for it I feel actually for bad for him what I saw was a minstrel show today him in front of all of these white people mostly white people embarrassing himself\n[laughter] this is white supremacy vibrant trend of course I'm a black mouth is moving but white racist ideals are are flowing from Kanye West smiles\nKanye West is engaging in one of the most and the various practices and yet how black body and brain power the warehouse for the articulation and the expression of anti black sentiments that have been ... by people with far more rigorous credentials\nIt is so vicious and vile I don't even know where to begin\nHow was that acceptable to any body this I don't know Kanye except I talked to him twice in my life\nAnd we talked about safer cities like the city of Chicago we talked about economic empowerment and opportunity for people for everybody in this country he's a billionaire\nAnd ... is a pack on that vicious horrible level I don't even know what to say\nMy friend Heisman Trophy winning football great Herschel Walker he's called out CNN's Don Lemon for allowing all all of those insults to go out against Kanye West and\nThe questions is on their behavior and as a guest or a referring to them is quote the people want to repeat what you just heard\nAt least the president also tweets he'll visit Florida and Georgia next week these types of trips usually allow a president to see the disaster first hand and be more understanding of the need for federal assistance usually in the form of money congressmen that gates represents parts of the panhandle\nDeaths disaster response relief is locally executed they managed in the federally supported\nMeanwhile the power and the water remain out in many panhandle towns Gulf Power says it could take weeks to restore full energy service Lisa\nThanks happen the president so far resisting calls in Congress to sanction Saudi Arabia over the disappearance of Washington Post writer Jim ... last seen nearly two weeks ago entering the Saudi constantly in Turkey which accuses the Saudis of killing him they\nSay that they have audio and video evidence that point to that effect last year during the reporting that that evidence has been shown to U.S intelligence agencies that Assad is officially said that he left even though video shows him going in but not coming out\nOf business networks Hebert Laurent that the White House the Saudis denied any involvement in the show these disappearance meantime American pastor Andrew Brunson held for two years in Turkey is released and then the judge convicted him on the terrorism charges he denied before setting and free\nReally they're real right now we're overjoyed but it might seem real his\nSister Lauren telling Fox that family is looking forward to a reunion an hour to the clothes on Wall street the downs up one twenty four fluctuating all day after two major sell offs and right now\nA rally this is science [noise]\nThis is talk went on for now the Israeli Army says it was defending itself as mass protests along the Gaza border turned violent again at\nLeast six people are dead and hundreds more injured after protests erupted along the Israel Gaza border for the twenty ninth friday in a row\nAnd Israeli military source told Fox News that some protesters were killed after throwing an explosive device and tried to take over an idea position today's demonstrations come amid particularly high tension as settlement talks in Cairo, Egypt have slowed\nThis week negotiators reportedly asked to mosque to stop the weekly protest and the group refused in Israel ...

I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you got a notice this week you noticed the market went down ... up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stuff but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and they would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done on regulations of businesses with the economy and they wouldn't want to raise taxes again\nAnd that would cost jobs that was slowed down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations\nAnd what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened with the backlash\nOf about the whole having a hearing it how unfair it was and you can see we had a poll this week where I'm McCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I also Joe Donnelly is now down right in writing Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have polls there because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want shops\nAnd what Gary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is\nIf you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your closer to raise taxes take what you got to take away the jobs take away the pay raises and the vast majority of Americans\nDon't want to go back to that I mean we had polls in September with were Nancy Pelosi has fifty five unfair will among all voters she has she has the fifty three percent\nUnfavorable among independent women that the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and part of the drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country so these house races you're talking about\nOverwhelmingly most of the ones in play a Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats they're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where\nYou know the smart money on Wall street saying hold that she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoug shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet\nFor the house but I think the Senate you have to have been looking very good for Republican pickups I think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort because\nAs somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know they ... they want to get rid of ice won't fund the border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear average is gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively in the direction\nThat Kavanaugh had a lot to do with it\nYeah I Do I think they are really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nI Would kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the values of New York\nUh I've noticed which is a pretty hard core left wing state even a Governor Cuomo does anyone want me in the state did you know that I didn't know but if I got I got taken it no he actually said those conservative\nThat that problem is not me and then all of them are they stream and those are\nMade with it that are closer to the extreme conservative so he knows that it's not\nIt's simple no one Hans within a fast life oh no I'm\nA I'm right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I don't I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nI'm Sorry but there's no place for me in the state of New York you said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be governor governor the you love and vote for once me out of town\nI speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think that you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity in New York or to promote Hannity\nOffice I Would like to run for it I think my friend John and I can\nI ... well you disabuse our friend Doug I'm very notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I think look you're still the kit for Franklin square you're still you're still am when you're working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because New York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers of New York state\nWe send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no no income tax and no state income tax may have jobs but by the way Doug fold than out on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg\n... I heard it oh yeah yeah I I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid of them 'cause he's moving so far left\nChat it's unbelievable he's gotta get whiplash\nBut but I don't even think I don't think they'll make to get through Mayor Bloomberg could get through a Democratic primary these days because they're so radical\nAnd that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing in the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as Sean says the most important midterms in our lifetime because you really have a clear choice for a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back\nWhere the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world are we we we're basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them that the swamp is being put back in its place that that the average person might have something to say about how their lives are going to be gotten governed have control of their own healthcare but\nBut if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next feature she will be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country she'll be the national face and voice of the Democratic party and that is just frightening\n'cause it let me tell you something we're not just friday is a frightening Republicans Doug shown does not want this do you do oh\nI Want democratic candidates at all levels in the house to say I will vote against her because that's the way to get votes in these marginal rights is absolutely like she should go period\nAnd start absolutely and and does point about in previous times or have been on the radio is you know you know what the president's message was when he ran for president was making America great again what's the message of the house Republicans to get re elected this time\nWhat should've been on the should be better stop Nancy Pelosi's from getting\nWell I think it's got to be not I I think\nLook if you if you like the success of
