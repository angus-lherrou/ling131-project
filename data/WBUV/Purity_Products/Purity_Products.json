[{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "And really if you just get on one of those sites and enter your PSA information that will take care of getting in ... I just wanted to save me a little work there\nOn this week's edition of the city desk pod cast from the city of Alexi they focused on the status at the singer theater and some repairs and other city issues\nSo we're going to start out by sharing that with the\n\n[noise]\nCity desk news interviews from city hall Biloxi and now the host of our program city desk\nPublic affairs manager for the city of Biloxi Mr Vincent ...\nGood morning William ... we are recording this program on Thursday October twenty fifth and it's ten thirty six in the morning here for the city hall and joining me after a week long sabbatical\nIs sue sue your dogs' fault and public affairs specialist for the city of all let's say\nAnd learning you jump right into yesterday and I'm going to say that you would but again what's going on with the sangre theater\nAnd the thing is a theater um they are continuing to mark on repairs for this thing in theater and now it's been a long process but there is a process to go to in the city wants to make sure that everything is done to correct\nWhat they have done if they have reviewed the outside of what we're parents that are needed in addition to that they had to go in and find out what\nThe structure was made up a\nIt was not a lot of good detailed information that might sound bombing them in the building was down in like Nineteen twenty nine we've had storms and hurricanes and stuff like that so they had to go and be fine detailed information and then they also had to actually go in and find out what destruction was night after that has taken us a while\nIn that research that they find anything like historical old switches papers documents Markey's old letters I mean that places now\nLadders but they did find some old they were talking about an old information like that\nBut but what and so they know that when they're at right now is they are the engineers and architects are working with the history and our guide to find out what materials\nThey can use to repaint make these repairs they also see the need for repairs to their flight power which is the back part that kind of tell her back part not going to\nDo and what was the tower is whenever you go see your production and they're changing the sets when they raised the sets high up in the air that's where they go into the tower\nAnd they see that that part I mean the most immediate attention so they're going to work on repairing that question I think at the ... material sees hopefully the ads will go out and then they share work without in the beginning of next year and they simply anti next year\nAn abstract question but related that used to be a world class for mayor sangre brothers motion picture house and they're still holes in the war in the back at cetera are they thinking about restoring that you can actually show movies\nActually what they did is do their research they found a lot of old newspaper articles in photographs of what the outside in the inside and look like back then the Nineteen twenties in Nineteen thirty are they going to do their best to restore what they can the best to\nThat air but then when the when we we've had that fly tower and they're going to go out for the ads to repair the out how to work with we talked about that before that's just yelling Nebraska and and we pairing that and the reason\nThat I'm aging the AC on the race and we've had that and how well hopefully you go out to visit sometime next year and of course they complete that then they got to work on the inside but they got to go through that process and evaluating what needs to be done and going out for bed and then working on that\nPart so it's a long process\nAnd they see the engineers architects knows that it is that we want to make sure that it is done right and that it will be able to be used for for years to come\nAnd we want to make sure people know that it's not just sitting over there there is work going on just because\nYou can't see it that is because they have to do the specifications associate you bought the specifications for construction and go out for beards and everything along every step of the way as you noted has to be approved\nBy the Mississippi department of our cats in history since that senator is on the national registry of historic places one interesting thing that came up in the wake of Katrina when ever said he wanted to make repairs to the inside of the bullets\nThe White House the bullets\nThe White House has a cast iron structure but inside the\nThe the tunnel\nBut to ... is a it's one with bricks and the issue was they couldn't just go by bricks off the shelf and the reason they could use today style Briggs is because they are heavier they are bigger so if you were to replace parts of the\nWall inside the White House with bricks made today they would crush the other ... because of the weight so they had to be careful in\nIn what materials they're huge which is another part of this anger process\nSo it it's time consuming and it and it is a it it's something that frustrating for people because the Gulf Coast symphony orchestras a great example they were supposed to start their season in September and the sangre they started their season in September but they were not in the sangre John\nMcFarland our good friend who is executive director of the Gulf Coast symphony said it's like a football team play every game as in a way again so\nI Would appreciate everyone's patience\nAnd I said the city deck and other facilities such as I'd like to visit or senator down it's not just in the ... center\nThat day I have opened for\nOther groups that used to use the saying where they can still have their events in Biloxi and when that spaces as well\nAnd remember folks when this is done with the amount of the study is detail you're going to have\nA benchmark you have a slice of Americana as a show place no one else will have\nGoes back to the ball bill or a think Nineteen twenty nine years or so\nThe one of the ways that we are going to pay for this is the mayor's been looking for our cops in history money he's been looking for grant money are we thought we had some federal money tied up for it but to federal money was ruled as ineligible for that even though federal money had been used book for\nThere's been a change in that determination but right now America which is proposing to the members of the city council people just going to borrowing fourteen million dollars to keep major projects moving that we have been underway right now\nWe're talking about bricks and mortar stuff and we're talking about design and engineering or a large portion of the fourteen million or in that figures like five and a half million would be spending more marketing on water Seward drainage sidewalks et cetera\nThis goes along with the promises that the city made so long ago to upgrade all\nOf of the community\nTo city levels services that they expect and deserved a there are also in the fourteen million dollar bond is repairs to the cedar lake bridge the seed Oleg ... it it can handle fire trucks right now it can't\nHandle the way the vehicles that may need to go across seas or like bridge the cedar lake bridges at to see like exit go north probably about two or three miles is what is known as a swing you know it's kind of candle\nWhere you put it on a on a huge structure in the bridge swings open when folks come\nIt's a little while and bridge fortunately does not have to move or open a lot for marine traffic\nThe mayor's also looking at using some of the fourteen million dollars for upgrades of the main street braille crossing one important thing to know about the fourteen\nMillion is that a share of the fourteen million dollars is the city's twenty percent match to get eighty percent in federal\nSo some of it is tied up in that their main street crossing is a great example of that\nWill market sidewalks as so there's another great example\nTwo million dollars of the fourteen\nMillion dollars is a lot into this anger theater to keep that were going on\nThe past we've talked about the new pope spare bridge we would like to sing one day we've talked about the pending pending I say because it is going to be happening\nThe extension of pops ferry road all the way down the highway Ninety we've got design engineers who are looking at the right away we need to buy they are all making steps on these big projects even though they're years away even though we don't have the funding for the overall project\nYou still have to keep it moving and get in bed ready it's called to where it's ready to go out forbids when we do secure that money we want to be ready to go so\nLast year at the state of the city we made a big deal about happening now\nWell as my two hundred and said we want to be able to say happening tomorrow as well\nThat children are good reasons that the mayor's looking to move forward with this or fourteen million dollar bond borrowing fourteen million would require no tax increase the the money to pay it back", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Purity Products",

Ninety nine and five FM the dragon immobile new shuttle launch coming up in ten minutes before we get to the news headlines\nChili Bennett has an industrial gift in Biloxi\nYeah we've talked a little bit about the Harrison county school bond issue at something that keeps coming up it's going to be on the ballot November six\nAnd we've got the Harrison county school district assistant superintendent Sherry Washburn in Studio with us this morning to kind of break down the whole school bond issue for us so I Know there are some things you really want to make the voters aware of so I'll let you started there\nOh thank you very much Kelly I appreciate you having me on the air today\nI Am from Harrison county school district as assistant superintendent but I'm also speaking today as a citizen of hairs and county school district um I live in the county and the district is on has on the ballot for November six\nAnd no tax increase bond issue\nAnd districts trying to being very responsible\nAnd not increased taxes because of the bond issue so I have no control if the if taxes increase obviously that's the board of supervisors but because of this bond issue\nWe're planning on paying actually ... pain the bond we had that money already set aside that we know that will pay on it\nUm for for years to come but um we just paid off the debt service in December and that that payment we have rolled over and ready to pay on this on this issue if it passes\nThey'll miss when that's the first time hearing on this because I think when most people here are school bonds fifty five million was the amount that they keep giving out\nAnd most people just automatically assume that's going to include a tax increase of some sort and the county so you're telling me you already had to bond out that's you're just going to roll it over so the way it was being paid is just going to continue\nAt no cost increase that's exactly right you know tax increase bond that we feel like\nThat's that's a definitely now point for voters obviously we would like voters to be well aware of what we want to use that money for that when you start talking about the Fifteen thousand kids that we serve and Harrison county school district\nWhere growing every day on the board of supervisors the of the city councils they all are very well aware of where construction is happening we have to housing developments just in on the market area six hundred and four hundred pounds\nObviously they won't be built overnight but there are other projects in the county all across the county that are have been approved and they haven't even started breaking ground on yet\nWe know we've got to prepare for that ground so when that preparation we're going to um we're going to set aside sixteen million dollars it's already been set 'em up ... Harrison county school districts funds to put up with the fifty five million\nBond issue if it passes will be able to build new schools one in the east side of the district one on the west side of the district\nWe also have a major costs that we have included in that bond you have to lay out your plan\nAnd that plan is for um warnings of dollars to be spent just renovating um north of port school will also put money into um security and safety in and all of our schools eventually but the bond as you were able to immediately\nDo some security measures adding security measures to about nine or ten of our schools\nAnd that's a big issue with students today so are there um upgrades that need to be done in regard as the security I'm just kind of curious I haven't been to every school in the Harrison county school district\nYou know or they're older schools that need these upgrades or what exactly is is there a little bit of everything that kind of a mixed bag school building wise\nYes ma'am I'm Glad you asked that question Kelly because we have twenty to school with those twenty two schools some of them were built Twenty years ago some of them were built years and years ago I I'm not even sure the date of\nOf some of her older schools I Know will market school for instance on the registry because of the age of the building\nUm we're very proud to have those buildings but when they were built security was not\nThe the the design mhm and today's schools security is more of the design and when you talk about those older schools because of our population student population and the growth that we have we can't just abandon those buildings we have to update upgrade is building\nNow there was another thing I wanted to bring up and that is you know you can't really talk about a school bond issue without mentioning the fact that Biloxi in Gulfport are both trying to get this off the ballot basically they want more time to discuss it\nI Know it's a it's it's rare to see that happen but I'm kind of curious\nUm because I got a press release from the Harrison county school district yesterday kind of explaining why kids in the city is a Biloxi in Gulfport go to Harrison county school and that's not really a decision\nThat's made by you is it it's a state and and it's a state thing yes ma'am\nI'm I'm Glad you asked that question let's go back to um which you originally said\nWhen um the the\nCity councils and other entities have asked for it to be postponed number one it is on the ballot has been being voted on with absentee voters a for a month or so so that's that's done ... idea of postponing\nI don't know how anybody would want to postpone for a year or for a month more than where we are now when you're talking about the security and safety issue [noise]\nUnfortunately we ran out of time there I'm sure there was a lot more we could get into but for their part the city of Alexi came out earlier this week actually on October six\nTeens and this was their statement to the press residents of Biloxi whether they live and will market eagle point or other areas\nOut to be able to a tenth Alexi public schools mayor Andrew folk yell at his lungs that and on Tuesday to Biloxi city council asked the Harrison county school board to help make that happen they say when will market in eagle point became part of Alexi in Nineteen Ninety nine Biloxi public schools didn't grow with the city and as a result\nThose residents remain in the Harrison county school district where taxes are higher than Biloxi about two hundred and fifty dollars a year higher on a two hundred thousand dollar home\nThis is from the city of Alexi again now mayor Gillett says this isn't an issue for him he says he's asked about this and he's been asked about this more than once since he became mayor in twenty Fifteen and now the county school board is asking Biloxi residents north of by ten and Dan eagle point\nDevoted to borrow fifty five billion for improvements to schools in Gulfport ... the mayor says frankly if you live in Biloxi you ought to be able to enjoy the lower school taxes we have and you ought to be able to attend but Biloxi public schools and a rated district with three blue ribbon schools I think it's that simple\nThe city council did vote unanimously save for councilmember Nathan beret who abstained\nTo ask the county school board to delay the November fifth referendum on borrowing money and instead for the two school boards to discuss other reasonable feasible alternative if the bond vote is not delayed the Biloxi mayor and the black sea council\nAre saying that those are that are voting should say now so\nIt is as something that the Lexie has has come out and stated and they're very clear about their position on this the city of Gulfport has made attempts to get this off the ballot as well\nI'm just trying to present all the different sides of this issue so that voters will have the most informed information when they had to the polls on November sex 'cause at this point it's still on the ballot and like uh the Harrison county um\nSchool ... ... assistant superintendent cherry Washburn said in that interview on Gulf Coast mornings on friday you know we've already got absentee voters voting on the issue let's\nMove on to something else you've got a group called one coast and they're getting together supplies for those that were impacted by hurricane Michael so over the next few weeks the task force which is made up at city and county employees throughout Harrison county\nAre planning to travel to Florida to deliver supplies to hurricane Michael survivors and first responders as they began what is going to be a very long process of cleaning up after the storm I think folks that lived through Katrina\nKnow exactly what they're dealing with there so the first caravan of supplies left on friday at six o'clock\nBut you've still got an opportunity to help with this Michael relief\nYou can do to eight items that any

September is unemployment statistics which found that Asians unemployment rate at its lowest level since the Nineteen sixties here do story through the numbers is John Tammany John ... is director of the center for economic freedom at freedomworks\nJohn welcome back to American radio journal John the unemployment numbers are out for the month of September and once again it would appear that the economy has yielded a low number of unemployed the lowest perhaps in decades so tell us a little bit about that\nIt's got to be remembered that economies are just people and people naturally grow their naturally trying to better their situation the only way they can is a natural barriers are putting their place usually of the tax regulatory trade tariffs and an unstable money variety\nAnd so I think it's a fairly strong signal that while President Trump isn't perfect in terms of economic policy\nIn particular on the trade front overall his policies have been rather benign in some degree pro growth and would that people\nIn the economy just naturally migrated to better and better jobs and more and more people have come off the sidelines to get to work and so it's very positive sign\nIn terms of the growing economy and job opportunities are we seeing this just in certain groups of people or is this extending across all economic classes and all demographics classes\nEverything that I've read has so far indicated that this is a very deep\nEconomic rally as Senate hitting people of at all levels of the economic spectrum from from the high end of earnings too low low\nYou're hearing about a smaller businesses and or a service businesses that are really struggling to find good workers right now just given given the high demand for them so it's it sounds like it's as always the case a growing economy generally lifts all boats and we're seeing that happen right here\nIn terms of these job openings and what appears to be a growing lack of qualified employees is this a factor that could possibly hold this economic expansion down going forward the fact there aren't enough qualified workers out there now for the jobs available\nI don't think so and my example is myself I come from I guess you'd call generation X. people who graduated in the late eighties throughout the nineties\nMost of us didn't grow up with Internet or anything related to the Internet\nBut my generation adapted to work this Internet based very quickly and that same generation had a lot to do with the Internet boom and so my take is that as it is it's always the case people can learn they learn quickly what they need to learn in order to be employed and and what brings them into employment is that\nCompanies looking to add quality workers raise the amount that they're willing to pay\nAnd that serves as a fairly ... so I never worried\nAbout that skills people can develop skills very quickly\nYou mentioned one of the areas where the president maybe is not as free market as other places is when it comes to trade we have a new NAFTA agreement and although I understand you don't have a crystal ball what effect do you think having an agreement actually in place now will have on trade\nWell it's good in the sense that it removes some uncertainty certainly the markets like that probably what they would have liked a lot more is if President Trump hadn't done anything investors broadly like NAFTA and so\nThe fact that the good news here is that in bringing it back Trump largely brought back what we had before there was a bit more central planning to it and that's unfortunate there's lots of things like certain cars if they're going to be made and sold in North America tear free they have to have\nA certain amount of labor costs at least sixteen dollars per hour the inputs in the car have to add a percentage of I think Seventy five percent be made\nIn North America all that's unfortunate that the Republican Party has historically been one about free markets and freedom for producers to do is they wish without a meddling there is a little bit of central planning and the new NAFTA but largely at the same as the one before and investors broadly like that\nBut let's talk for a minute or two now about the Federal Reserve and John many Americans of course of her to the Federal Reserve a lot of folks maybe don't quite understand how it operates in what impact that has a just very briefly what impact does the Federal Reserve actually have on our economy and how does it tried to manage it\nWell I'm One of these people and I'm somewhat of an outlier here I've\nLong believed and I wrote a book about it called who needs the fed I I think the feds impact on the economy is vastly overstated the fed exist as a lender of last resort to solvent banks but can't really do that you know solve the bank would ever go to the fed for a loan it'd be admission of bankruptcy\nThe fat also regulates banks but it can't really do that very effectively as two thousand eight reminds us and then of course it aims to\nSet the overnight rate which banks lend to one another button interest rates price like any other you don't need the fed for that and so I think the feds impact is vastly over it people say well you know they're going to reduce interest rates and that's going to ease up credit\nThat's the equivalent of married ablaze you send in New York how apartment rents are too high I'm going to reduce how much landlords can charge for apartments all he would do is just cause scarcity and the same way of markets actually responded the fed\nThe fat to the best cause scarcity by trying to artificially lower rates below what they normally it in the marketplace so my point is is is we in the real economy we largely act as the fed doesn't exist that that sort of an ... that sort of an\nPosition but I Believe it will be increasingly common place in the coming years the fed has been\nAnd on a rate increase I won't say binge because they've been doing it in smaller increments this past week it did seem to get her the markets a little bit will the fed raising the the rates will that cause the economy to cool off or given your previous comment cereal really don't think it's going to have much impact in the long run\nNow I don't think it will have much of an impact in all let's remember the fact kept rates low mountains here or the rate at him set for years and years for basically two thousand nine until what about twenty Fifteen or twenty sixteen\nThere is no major economic boom during that time the fed can change reality when when we're when we go to the market to borrow money we're borrowing access to real resources\nTo trucks tractors computers desks chairs most of all human labor that that can expand the amount of that available I Can't make these resources cheap and so I think the answer is is to always remind ourselves with\nThe fat as just another entity try and influence things not very well\nWe have been talking with John ... who is the director of the center for economic freedom at freedomworks John ... have been about freedomworks also working folks go on the Web to get more information from your\nFreedomworks is a wonderful organization based in Washington DC that makes the essential point that Washington is not going to change in less politicians realize that they're the voters are
