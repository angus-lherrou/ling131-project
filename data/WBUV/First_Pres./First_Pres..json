predictability that they provide really save us from the nastiness that we've seen on display the last few weeks well I'm somewhat skeptical\nWhen the stakes really be that much lower if Kavanaugh were in the wrong for an Eighteen year term on the court with with everything else being equal in other words if the current conservative liberal split and the potential fate of the abortion law were hanging in the outcome the promise that Kavanaugh would merely sit on the bench for Eighteen years we're probably not bring Democrats down from the barricades\nAnd nor would it make Republicans any less likely to push for his confirmation but even if you're just will term limits are actually a bulwark against the hyper partisan environment that's increasingly spilling over into the Supreme Court the idea might be worth considering for two other reasons\nFor one people seem to like a recent morning console political poll found that sixty one percent of voters favored term limits for Supreme Court justices including majorities of Democrats Republicans and independents\nAnd for a second reason it would openly acknowledge something that everyone already knows\nThat control the Supreme Court is a reward for electoral success now this goes against what the founders may have intended they wanted lifetime Supreme Court appointments to buffer the justices from political interests but it's clear now\nIf it wasn't already that both sides Democrats and Republicans view Supreme Court appointments as the spoils that come from controlling the president's the in the Senate\nSo if the high court is going to be politicized anyway maybe it makes sense to have those seats the democratically accountable and\nActually reflect the results of elections over the previous two decades which is what the Eighteen year term limits system\nWould accomplish now imposing term limits would require a constitutional amendment that's probably an impossibly heavy lifting the current environment and there's plenty of other stumbling blocks to in all likelihood nothing is going to change will continue to muddle through with the same\nSomewhat broken process that we're using now term limits or the lack of will not fixed the underlying problems plaguing all aspects\nOf the capital confirmation process for reason magazine I'm Eric bam cut you right back here next week on another edition of American radio journal\nThe next time a nominee to the Supreme Court is presented to members of the Senate the Senate needs to act in a more civil fashion so says calling Hannah of let freedom ring usa on this American radio journal commentary\nPresident Trump's domination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court was bound to be ideologically controversial because it would create a generally conservative five to four majority for what I Would argue is the first time since FDR it's not before\nI expected that the primary ideological issue with the abortion and whether he would tilt the balance of the court away from the constitutionally liberal articulation of a right to privacy that permits most abortions too are constitutionally conservative interpretation\nThat the documents simply cannot be stretched to the point of either permitting were prohibited abortions\nI expected some charges a massage and they and ingrained prejudice against women and I thought that the makeup of the Republican members of the Senate Judiciary committee eleven white males many of whom are rather shall we say senior would be used as a case in point by the other side\nBut I never thought that the process would descend the level of embarrassing spectacle that it did no matter the outcome the Senate and by extension our entire Republican form of government has been ... by the emotionally charged\nThe accusations of sexual misconduct and they were responsible drinking and the equally emotionally charged defenses of judge Kavanaugh the self righteous posturing and ... on both sides of the aisle and the casual discussion of improprieties has made CSPAN X. rated\nThe Senate likes to call itself the world's greatest deliberative body will it certainly was not that over the past couple of weeks it was more like a locker room or a late night bar venting session the me too movement has properly awake and many Americans to the plight of victims of sexual misconduct especially rape and attempted rape\nIt is completely understandable that victims were repressed their memories of such incidents and be fearful of disclosing details\nHowever that new willingness to give the benefit of doubt to victims cannot extend to the point of ignoring relative facts and testimonies there are many cases of false accusations even if they constitute the minority of all accusations of sexual misconduct\nFor instance there are too many African American men convicted and jailed after having been accused of rape or attempted rape of white women where in fact\nThe accusation was ill founded one of the most well known of these is the case of high school football star Brian Banks was falsely accused convicted and serving time in prison with his accuser finally admitted to fabricating the entire claim\nWe will probably never know what really happened in the summer of Nineteen eighty two between Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey or at Yale a few years later\nBut we are looking at the judicial record of a lawyer and judge who's conduct has never wants to my knowledge been subject to question or a scandal in the many years that he is practice law or served on the bench\nYet his adolescent conduct may have been reprehensible and should not be dismissed lightly but it's not the student Brett\nKavanaugh of over a quarter century ago who was nominated if the judge Brett Kavanaugh of the DC circuit court\nThe wants in this regard as his judicial record by those who oppose him on ideological grounds but don't have the courage or intellect to challenge him on his record shows the world that we base our ideals by our bum best I voted for President Trump and I support his nomination of judge Kavanaugh\nBut I cringe when I hear him mock doctor for it I think judge Kavanaugh has what it takes to be a good justice of our Supreme Court but I cringe when he allows himself to make snide remarks to a senator who is the daughter of an alcoholic or when he descends into partisan comments about his accusers\nDo you ... of American radio journal feel the same way do you feel the need for a shower after watching some of our senators\nAre you tired of political arguments that have little to do with the subject being discussed and are really all about acquiring are holding onto a political power\nAfter the dust settles on judge Kavanaugh's confirmation vote joined me in writing to your two senators to elevate their advice and consent role to something more reflective of a great democracy and less reflective of spoiled

"Yeah I I think that has to be considered here especially due to the fact that this could be considered another form of election meddling so to speak and we've heard a lot about that through social

or Democrat or right wing or left wing\nFuel a speculation and rumors on both sides as to who might be responsible for this and to create more of a divide\nA than we already have in this country ... between the political parties so I think that that is a viable explanation I'm sure it's something that the authorities are looking into\nSo bills in for you you mentioned that there's a lot to the

uh I Believe that the investigation is ... is progressing quick enough that we could have a an arrest sometime in the next week or so but\nThere is now some speculation uncle Henry that if there is an

radio weekends boards time capsule\nBut what is our structure here and if he's in say\nStarting averse Nineteen he says you who are out are now and you're no longer strangers and aliens\nYour fellow citizens with the saints your members of the household of God built on the foundation of the apostles in profits Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone and you hear all of that as temple language\nThe cornerstone of our temple isn't a huge rock it's Jesus himself and what's the foundation is not an an evenly spread mixture of concrete the foundation of our temple is the teaching of the apostles in the prophet believing in what got upset about himself\nAnd so now there's Twenty one the whole structure is joined together and grow into a holy temple in the lord so where do you find God's presence do you have to go to a building in Jerusalem no\nYou find God's presence whenever a group of people comes together and Jesus is the cornerstone not a building\nAnd the foundation is we look to this book the foundation of your muscles and the profits we believe the scriptures and we have faith in Jesus\nThat is where you find God's presence not in a particular building so what happened to these symbols for the Jews what what went wrong for them with these ideas of the temple and keeping kosher and circumcision because God gave them to them as good things\nWell what happened is they kind of perverted them and turn them into idols and so instead of circumcision being your part of my family and let's extend that other people got became national the God of Jews only\nAnd instead of ... saying you're wholly different in your displaying my character to people got became external\nLike God is pleased with just ... journal things as long as you don't eat these foods you're good as long as you're dressed a certain way you're good so they perverted their symbols to say that got us national that God is racist he wants to use only\nThat God is external you just have to do these rules and then he's happy with you\nAnd finally they got his local that got his pinned down to just one location we kinda have got under some we know exactly where it is where he is and we can visit him anytime and so what gone does is he he blows up all three of these symbols um he says you know what people don't have to be circumcised anymore\nYou know what I'm going to let the Romans ransacked your temple and you're not going to rebuild it and he says you know what those kosher laws we don't do that anymore because that's not how we define ourselves\nCan you imagine someone coming to this country and saying Star Spangled banner we don't do that anymore nobody is allowed to sing that song\nAmerican flag we don't pledge to that any more but that's not our symbol any more can you imagine the the uproar people would not be OK moustache rights and they wouldn't just be making rational arguments that would be saying this person is betraying our country\nThis person must be fought against because they're trying to destroy our liberty our values the documents that we built this entire country around and yet when Jesus comes he takes the three most precious symbols and he says no we don't do that any more\nKosher Peter here's a vision of some animals coming down on a sheet and you can eat whatever you want now temple I tell you what I'm Jesus Says in your lifetime somebody's going to come and totally level this temple and it's not going to be built again that was devastating to the Jews devastating\nNot keeping their laws that was how they knew who they were that's how they knew who was in and who was out and now they don't have to keep kosher [noise]\nAnd what about um they're circumcision you hear a lot about this and the New Testament that people don't have to be circumcised anymore but that's what got sued Abraham that's backing genesis how can you go against the scriptures which say this is how you prove that you're faithful to God is by being circumcised\nWell the big questions\nMoving from the Old Testament to the New Testament in understanding the Bible was can ... be saved the part of God's family as gentile or do they have to become Jews it was a question about symbols\nWhen people come to Jesus and they didn't grow up his shoes there's ... do they have to be circumcised do they have to go to the temple and pay the temple tax and make their uh\nA secret journey you know\nChildren which I think you do they have to make a pilgrimage to the temple and do they have to keep kosher do they have to keep these laws and the church answered a resounding no on all three of those ... received the Holy Spirit\nAs gentile not as those who are circumcised or have loyalty to the temple or who keep kosher so it was a huge huge deal for the early church and Paul writes about it a lot acts is concerned with it a lot\nCan ... get into God's family as ... or does their conversion have to include these symbols these boundary marketers uh Judaism and we talked a little bit about why they were able to say no to all three of those things and the reason was\nAgain not just cultural not it's outdated like oh we've never really liked that stuff anymore so here's a chance to kick it to the curb\nThe reason for all three of those things was Jesus himself because Jesus is what the Bible is about Jesus is what all the symbols that God gave people are really about so Jesus transforms and recon figures all three of those symbols to make them really about himself\nSo let's go back through them and talk about these symbols\nThe similar Jesus is not circumcision is baptism\nThe symbol of Jesus is not only for Jews and I might add only for males the symbol of Jesus entering into his family is baptism and it is available to all regardless of your nationality and regardless of your gender [noise]\nSo the sign of Jesus it's really the same thing as circumcision is the way you get into the cabinet family it's a symbol of God's face a and his his faithfulness and we put our faith in what God has done so in some ways it's it's the same thing as circumcision\nBut it's transformed around Jesus I'm so glad we got to do a baptism today that was so cool was my first one up you can do [noise]\nThis baptism was a powerful symbol because I took a child and I looked at the family and I said God is a ... is a God not just to you but to your whole family\nAnd it's not just circumcision which was of the Old Testament but we took a little girl and we sprinkled her the same way we are sprinkled with the blood of Christ and on the last one on the holy ghost I tried to get as much as I could and poured it on her because also symbolizes pouring out the Holy Spirit man what a powerful symbol\nAnd it's it's different than circumcision but it's really circumcision fulfilled its foot circumcision was always meant to be open to everyone in a signal of the fact that we actually have been saved by Jesus not just the promise that God was giving out that he would save us one day [noise]\nWell what about keeping kosher we don't keep kosher anymore we don't really do that stuff\nAnymore and why because when Jesus came he said it's not about the external things you do it's about the internal way that your heart is gone says I've never really been that concerned about your burnt offerings and things like that we read that assault fifty one you know why because those were just extra things you could do whether you love me or not\nSo what is the mark of a Christian what what symbol to wield to say we are in we are part of the family if it's not kosher laws like what we wear or what we eat I'll tell you what it is we are known by our deeds of love\nThat is the symbol of Jesus how do you know that somebody belongs to him because they've been baptized into the family and they live like our savior they live out the seeds of love and Jesus Says that himself doesn't he\nDoesn't he said this is how they're going to know you by the fact that none of my people eat pork by the fact that none of my people wear polyester no they will know you because you love each other [noise] if you love each other from the heart that is something that only the Holy Spirit can do\nAnd so when people look at this community and they say that water thing was kind of a kind of weird symbol that everybody has to do that before they get in you can say yeah everybody has to do that before they get it and here's why here's what it means but perhaps even more powerfully you can love people [noise]\nYou can love each other and it's a lot harder than just eating some things are not eating other things but it's also a lot more powerful because Jesus has taken the symbols of our faith\nAnd rearrange them around himself [noise]\nWell what about the temple I'm gone does not confined to just one location right if you don't have to fly to one place in the world\nIn order to be near a God how can you find God how can you find his presence how can you know where he lives where he he lives in us through the Holy Spirit so we can say both individually and collectively the temple of God now is a group of people who believe in Jesus and who do acts of love right\nIf somebody wants to meet God we don't give them directions to a particular building right come to frustrate but here in church doesn't matter who they are just lives in this building no because gone covers the whole world right\nWhat we say is I tell you what once you come over to our house well why don't you come on Sunday Morning when we hear God's word and we sing songs of praises and we remember who we are and maybe you'll find God's presence there not in a single physical location but where his people are\nAnd why why do we do that why do we change from a building to a group of people because of Jesus [laughter]\nBecause the symbol was really always about Jesus the question where does God live where can you find him was answered

I'm a center is asked it before you this morning and said I'm Phillip I'm a center as I pointed out at all if you are reminded you that you're centers where am I on the descriptor tells us the wages of\nSin is that we all deserve to die because of our sense\nBut there are times when our sins so blatant so obvious that we really understand that and then everyone knows that that's what Jonah deserved but God was not going to let\nYou wanted to not amazing job of trying to take his life and God says no\nWho's in charge gods in charge going back to that ... passage so pointed to a man to die once and after\nThis comes judgment right appointed who appoints that God can we sort short circuit that absolutely not\nJonah or God wasn't just determined to save Jonah from the consequences of his and he was actually determine to save Jonah from his\nPart of the backstory of Jonah it's not just who's in charge\nBut it's the story of what God is doing and Joan and he's moving him from disobedience to obedience he's moving him from rebellion to submission he's doing what he does and all of us this glorious work of sank to vacation that begins from the moment we embrace the true God until the moment we die\nHe's saving him not just from the consequences of this sin he's determined to save him from his sent next group is determined to save his the people of none of them [laughter] let me remind you of where we come from\nChapter one verse to comes to Jonah inverse too says arise ... that great city and call out against it Jonah says no Jonah runs away\n... since the storm God has Jonah tossed into the sea got appoints the fish to swallow Jonah now fast forward a few days when the when the fish regurgitate Jonah onto the shore and then God comes to Jonah again chapter three verse to\nReverse won the war to the lord came to Joan of the second time saying arise go to none of that great city and call out against it\nOr why was God determined to save none of us well just like Jonah he was determined to save them from the consequences of their sin from the calming destruction he called Jonah and said going warned them of my judgment this coming\nUpon them now Jonah for ... that call but God never for ... book his compassion towards enough\nHe was always determined to send a profit to none of us a call out to them and more specifically he was always determined to send Jonah to none of them to call out against them so runners he might\nHe cannot run God as much as he might want to die and avoid this call he can't avoid God's calling on his life why because God had the ... lights in view\nNot just the consequences of their sin but also like Jonah used the term to save them from their said he's aiming for their repentance for their salvation and that's exactly what you see when you\nGo further into the book of Jonah the lights repair it I think one of the glories in heaven is that one day we're going to meet some of these ... ... repented at the preaching of Jonah because God was determined to save them\nThird group from the text that we see God determined to say\nIt's the sailors we think they just kind of accidentally showed up in the story you think maybe a sovereign God even took in Jonas rebellion even appointed the exact ship that he was going to be on the exact sailors that we're going to be on that ship was trying to save those sailors from first of all the consequences of their sin\nThese men live with foolish fear their whole life\nThey're afraid of the the wind in the sea and ... and and not a\nI'm not talking about a a an unhealthy fear of that uh you know when you have a storm like Michael bearing down upon you and everyone tells you to flee the coast\nIt's not trusting God\nTo remain on the coast is it right we understand that God's since those things and we recognize that and we run from it but what they were fearing was not that God had brought these things that were actually afraid of wind of of waves\nAnd it was a false God that they attributed it to he was removing this this fear of scenes this fear of false God and translating it to a godly fear ultimately he wanted to save them not just from the\nConsequences but actually from their sin itself\nIt's data fearing the wind and waves to fear the God of the wind in ways instead of fear and fall Scott's to fear the truth and living God a fear that actually leads to worship and then the beautiful when you get to to uh to VR sixteen\nThis little word then\nThen they feared the lord exceedingly and they offered a sacrifice to the lord and made the house\nThey already recognized that it was the God of Jonah that sent this they already recognized that they couldn't do anything to apiece him they already recognized that they were bound by the circumstances that he brought in all they could do was simply throw Jonah overboard\nBut notice when they began to fear exceedingly in wasn't in the midst of the storm it was in the midst of the calm for them they knew that this was the true in living God and this guy has spared them and I love the picture here they began to worship\nThey offer to sacrifice they made vowels and again I'm convinced that didn't happen we'll meet some of these sailors who were converted because God sent storm and a profit of rebellious profit\nWho mentions the name of the true God and they began to be exposed to him and began to worship him [noise]\nGod was determined to save the term to say Jonah determined to save the ... determined to save\nThe sailors you can make that argument all throughout the tax but I'm Will tell you another group that you're not going to see in this text which you're going to see it all over the scriptures and that's this\nGod's also determined to save you and they\nGot us determined to save you and me from what from our sense\nOne of the things about the book of Jonah is a lot of people talk about and it's clear here the Jonah is a type of Christ",

this I'm going to do this I'm going to do this I promise but he doesn't do it or at least not all the way and the whole New Testament is people saying we found the key\nWe've we've we've seen the twist ending and we know that God actually has kept all of his promises and how does he teach them how does gone said yes to all his promises in all the Old Testament\nJesus is God's yes if you want to know if God as faithful Jesus shows you that the answer is always yes\nMarshall is a couple of places in the Old Testament where we have something where it's like OK is going to be faithful how's he going to do it because there's two things that seemed like they are at odds\nAnd then I Want to show you how Jesus is God's faithfulness Jesus is gone saying yes to his own words and then when you read the Old Testament on your own\nAnd there's something where God says he'll do it any kind of promise I Want you to gain the skill of saying man got said he do it he's going to do it how did he do it how is Jesus God's yes in this situation in this promise and so I Hope that the Old Testament we will be richer for you because of this\nUm and the first one I Want to talk about is\nSimilar to what I talked about last time about God's presence right are we talked a lot about the temple and how God dwell in the temple but only certain people could go there and yet God had made this promise that he would live which is people that he would do well with his people but\nHow can that happen how can God live with us\nDo you feel that tension God is a spirit he lives in heaven and he cannot be around sinful people so how is he going to live on earth with us who are sinful it it can't happen right do you feel the problem there\nAnd we talked about um I guess this has been two or three weeks ago how Jesus is God's yes to that promise so does God live in heaven as a spirit and that's just inaccessible to us or does he live on earth and keep his promise to to live with us spirit in heaven or body on earth which is it\nYes yes and the gas is\nGod the spiritual eternal being sued wells in heaven and cannot be among singers has become a man and come down to earth and he lives with us and that was like Jesus name is Emanuel God living\nWith us so he's got a spirit up in heaven or is he a human here on earth living with us yes that is guys yes to his problems\nThere was another one that trip should be pretty familiar it's will kind of fundamental to just salvation and that is does God punished sins or does he forgive centers\nWhich is going to be right can't be both in the same person and gone has promised to forgive his people's sense right in the Old Testament God says he'll wipe away our sins how can he do that\nHe I mean he can't he can't just wiped away our sins just say oh well you know it doesn't matter or I'm going to you know sweep it under the cosmic rug\nThere's one in particular where he actually puts the both of these two things together that God is the guys who forgives but also the God who punishes since I'm it's in excess thirty four when he's talking to us about who he is he says I'm the lord and this is what it means that I'm the lord\n... past before Moses and proclaimed his name saying the lord the lord a garden merciful and gracious slow to anger and a bounding and steadfast love and faithfulness\nKeeping steadfast love for thousands for giving iniquity an transgression and sin Mm yes got his gracious and merciful he forgive since that is his promise that his his character listen to the next part\nBut who will by no means clear the guilty but visits the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children to the third and fourth generation got is fair and just that is his character he punish people who do what's wrong because that's the right thing for him to do so what's it going to be\nThe sea forgive you or does he punish her sense\nYes yes\nIn Jesus he actually does punish her since he doesn't just winking and ... and let them pass he actually punished as than in Jesus and by doing that he is able to forgive you of your sins so is that justice or is it forgiveness yes in Jesus another\nOne that is very fundamental to the whole testament story is this idea of Israel having a king right Israel's given a king um it's a good thing in fact David is like the best king and God makes a promise to David especially in second same do seven it's brought up in the songs a lot\nHe promises David one of your sons will always be on the from always\nSo Israel is always going to have the king and it's always going to be somebody who comes from David sign because David Was was such a good king well maybe it was a mixed bag he killed a bunch of people but gun still promise to him because he's ...\nBut the Old Testament ends and there is no king not only is there no king they kind of lost track some of Davis line the temple is gone there is no real like center and Jerusalem everybody's been exiled to Babylon and other parts of the world some people have been allowed to come back\nBut God has made this promise that there will be a king a son of David in Israel and there is no king talked about lacking integrity and and trying to figure out how God how and this is where we get some of those songs where people say God what are you doing here\nGot I'm taking you at your word I'm calling you on what you said you said that David would always have a son who is the king and we don't have a king at all so what are you doing where's your integrity how is this going to line up\nAnd so we face that dilemma with God will always be a son of David on the throne or will God punished Israel because of the bad things that they had and because of the way they followed those back kings\nIs very similar to to mercy injustice will there be a king David or will God punished the nation because of the way they followed their bad kings\nYes yes he will\nAnd the yes is Jesus his death is what allows God's mercy injustice to come together his life his resurrection is what allows got to keep good on his promise that there will be a king forever because Jesus is that king\nJesus is the king over the whole world he traces himself from David\nAnd it's even better actually than what God promised in the Old Testament a lot of promises he like ah he liked turbo chargers them when he actually fulfills them with these as they get to be even better than what people thought they were going to get because it isn't just that each time one of David sons dies there'll be another son who takes his place\nThere'll be one son who lives forever see Jesus is immortal now because he has been raised we can be a hundred percent rock solid sure that there will always be a good king son David on the throne because Jesus having God wants we'll never die again he will always be became\nSo again this dilemma of God's character and integrity\nWill he punished the bad kings or will he give us a good game\nYes\n[noise] um one more than that I Want to talk about um and this was this one that is especially turbo charged in the Old Testament especially to Abraham gone promises a piece of land it's called the promised land quite appropriately\nWill entertain and he promises to Abraham and he says I'm going to give us your descendants and what made Abraham a man of faith is that he believed God even though he never got to that land even though he never saw that he'd have you know thousands of\nOf children he believes that God would do that even when he couldn't see it he believes in God's promises that God was a person of integrity\nBut Israel fails to get into the land right once they get out of Egypt there believe in God yeah we're going to get in this land gotten the person of integrity he's gonna keep its promises and they end up doing circles in the desert for like forty years\nAnd it's it's like God what are you doing\nAre you really going to give us this land that you promise to give us or are we going to have to keep walking around in the desert forever and even after Israel does claim the promised land like I said the way the Old Testament ends only a few people have come back\nIsrael is not a powerful nation that week they have a little bit of their land but not nearly as much as they used to\nAnd so the Old Testament ends with this question we'll God's people really inherit the land that God has given that will he make good on his promise or since we know that he will make good on his promise how exactly is he going to do that does it sure not looking that way to us\nWhen Romans chapter for when when Paul tells the story of Abraham and he's and he talks about his incredible face that he believed God believe that God was somewhat of integrity who keep his promises that's what was counted as righteousness too and he then says\nFor the promise to Abraham that he would inherit the world did not come through the law but rather through the righteousness a face\nSo when Paul looks back on the promise to Abraham he says Abraham wasn't premise just the promised land this little you know this little chunk in the middle east the promise was actually the whole world how does that work\nHow does God giving his people the promised land equal ruling over the whole earth well the answer is yes because Jesus is the king over the whole world right\nJesus can't be just the king of ... and just the king of promised land of the promised land that's way too small for God's people so what does he do he turbo chargers his promise and it wasn't just one little piece of land", "show_name": "First Pres.", "month": "10", "state": "MS", "day": "14", "station": "WBUV", "city": "Moss Point", "locations": [["Vietnam", 16.16667,
