I don't I don't know nothing about I'll go with my okay I don't\nReally know you really don't know about our ice and such do you understand how Social Security works not really going to\nBe okay well there's a benefit but if you're starting at age sixty two you're taking almost eight thirty percent reduction from what would be the value of your full retirement age so depending on your date of birth that's probably\nFor a for use probably going to be a sixty seven to get the full financial benefit so it depends on your work history have you received a Social Security statement lightly\n... no not not as probably the one maybe ten years ago maybe okay\nSo that's why also you might want to go to ss said dot Gov that's a Social Security administration dot Gov\nAnd sign up for your Social Security account on line so you can see what you're earning sister years and it will also tell you what your benefit would be at age sixty two\nAt your full retirement age which I'm assuming is sixty seven and also if you wait to eight Seventy so based on what you saved\nAll you have is Social Security at this time and you're going to need to save a substantial portion of your income to impact that at all it's not about the return it's not about risk it's how much you can put away\nAnd the thing is when you start looking at those numbers and you're making forty five or fifty to fifty five thousand a year it varies we understand your Social Security is going to be one heck of a lot less than that\nAnd then you're reducing it even more because you're wanting to turn it on at eight sixty two my recommendation just on this little bit of information is\nWork longer than stopping at age sixty to in fact work as long as you possibly can up towards Seventy because that means you're getting a larger Social Security benefit\nOf a ... of his boss I guess it was more and Michael's but mine but somebody else screams very drawn quitting I'm not at all thing and then when he went home and it

Pocahontas\nSo you have it ah what what you saw here\nWas that the left has this whole framework of something they call cultural appropriation right the last has this framework where they will say um you are not allowed to make the cuisine\nOf another of another culture yeah you're not allowed to wear the uh the garb of another culture\nAnd cultural appropriation let me just say is a stupid concept\nBecause all culture\nBorrows and steals and it influenced by other cultures all the time in fact\nIf you were to look back at what we consider to be western fashion a lot of the most well known western fashions today come from other parts of the world are ... are from fabrics that we're only possible because of colonialism and I mean there's there's a lot of stuff\nSo I mean you were like oh you mean like Muslim city of Mosul for example a ... you know getting a pattern from Malaysia getting me think of as a very ... northern\nNortheastern American kind of a thing but no uh comes

financial talk radio we'll see where we get every might come back to that topic you're in a moment by on the brake also we were talking about Tesla\nSo it has some issues coming forward you know just like who's buying it well then you know they're probably going to have to borrow more money and probably going to do it in the form of convertible bonds I've got one point one five billion coming due essentially\nHere in the next year or which at the end of June Tesla had about total to point two billion in cash on hand\nSo the first one that sucked coming due in November two hundred and thirty million it has a ... five hundred and sixty dollar and sixty four sick version price\nAmateurs and November well\nAlong with his fines for um whatever you poke the bear you know the SEC ... sword that he can absorb this probably too but the the next one is nine hundred and twenty million matures in March in it as three hundred and fifty nine dollar in eighty seven\nSet conversion price that's going to be a little bit more of a problem and they're probably gonna raise some more money through bonds it'll be convertible because they don't really want a collateral off\nThe company because if things go\nBad yeah bondholders like taking assets in that way so I just kinda threw throw that out there\nAnd look here's my shopping experience going back to ... we talked about you know\nThe and probably they're going to lose another hundred and forty store so the problem with whatever it is a chairman Lambert thanks they're going to be after bankruptcy and you know and I'll mention this toys are us went into bankruptcy thinking they would come out of it\nAnd they haven't yet but it looks like their debt holders are going to take the company out of bankruptcy and see what they do with this is kinda yeah good luck with that but hey if it's a way you can get your money go make it back\nIn that case so Tesla don't want to be in that spot no they don't want to be in any spotlight that so we just got to get the building\nCars\nConsistently ... why why did he leave the the venture capital market anyway and go sell bonds stardust diluting the shares I suppose\nWanting to keep that ... believing is on hype that he's going to pull it off\nAnd maybe in time he will it's just gosh it's long ways to go doing that\nChairman lamp or you know I had bought a few hundred dollars worth of tools a lot set late September they're just some of those strange things I felt I might need just like a number of other things I have is\nIf I needed I have a good price\nAnd and then in this they print out these bonus points and such if you come back this month and by salt and you get thirty three dollars towards it I don't know what the minimum is you're going to buy it didn't really say and go to the website was kind of\nIt was going to take more than a couple of minutes to figure it out so I moved on so I went in there yesterday and bought a couple of things but I showed them I was thinking I said well how do I take advantage of these thirty three thousand points which a thousand points get you a dollar\nSo he said well let's look it up well I hadn't even been credited about my points you know the white September ... couple of weeks ago now\nSo I I should have already been credit so it got me to thinking so when I\nArrived back home I said I've got to look into what's going on with his points in another thought came to my what if you just want me to the previous time by some warranty on something of course I said no\nSo what happens if you do have a warrant to see what happens at warranty if the company goes under to bankrupt while going bankruptcy is kind of the ... thing so it depends you know and also those pension holders they're the largest\nCreditor it just was undisclosed the male by the federal pension court but they're listed as the number one creditor on ballistic creditors so but hey if I've got a warrant the dilemma credit ... thing breaks yo you said you're going to take care of it\nYeah and see that so what happens is in bankruptcy\nAnd probably why they haven't been credited why would they credit them if they're going to make them all go away all these points they have out there\nIf you didn't ... you might not get to redeem them now because the points can go completely away in bankruptcy and so Ken the warranties on all the stuff as well so it makes you know a\nMember of General Motors when they went through bankruptcy\nThey unloaded a lot of ... liabilities out there why didn't you down to NATO yeah when they did bankruptcy back
