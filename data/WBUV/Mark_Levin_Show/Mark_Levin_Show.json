I'll I'll I'll go get their act research staff on that one as we take a look at tomorrow's games that we saw in Miami lose tonight to Boston College to suddenly turnover chain is not nearly what it was a year ago but some are obviously you'll get Florida Georgia the big Markey game on the schedule look Florida is one of those teams I think every college football fan goes\nYeah but on the really that's good yeah but are they really there's good and we're going to find out tomorrow\nYeah the answer is probably not quite yet I mean it's you remember where they were last year I mean this was a bad bad team uh nothing was working at all with the team walking with Jim ... to be fired\nAnd they turned around fast you know it's not that easy I mean Tennessee's not turning around in a heartbeat nebraskan UCLA\nYou know certainly weren't able to flip this fast\nBut then ... will step and it was a good situation they didn't ask to a completely you know got got the building here for this thing they just need to tweak a little bit as it turns out yeah they are this good they are okay\nBut Georgia's ... one of the top four teams in the country so tomorrow's really that day where we kind of see okay now this clears up a little bit so either it's one of those days where we kind of clear out the you know the riffraff a little bit alright Kentucky let's see what you do it in Missouri Texas you got to go to Oklahoma State\nYou know Iowa and Penn State there are couple which uh one last teams out there that are going to be hanging around and after he put an article that I write in conversations that All right we'll see if you're still hang around after this week\nWell that's one of the things obviously me and in the Big Ten you got\nThe Iowa Penn State game well Wisconsin North West we'll get to that later a Penn State a team you know Jason taking a baseball bat you out of out of you and Cajun Iowa Stanley sixteen and six almost sixteen hundred yards mix surely has been fantastic in spots\nOf Iowa on the road ... out of state hold up\nAt Penn State now we have to look at them through a different lens because All right that the one big performance against Ohio State in the last but they've not really done a whole lot else I mean you lose to Michigan State you know they need everything in the bag to get by Appalachian State it's been a good team they blew up some bad teams\nBut no no we find out because I was good\nThe bad match up for Penn State ... meets families who played really well or the office of light is starting to figure it out that defense is great against the ... so a mix are always going to have to be amazing\nThe guy wins I think they keep going I I've said for weeks I think I Will win the big tent west but we're gonna see tomorrow if they can really get because they went tomorrow they're running the table and they're going to be a Lebanon one then it just comes down to whether or not was caught is going to lose again\nI'd give me an upset tomorrow you wouldn't be surprised top twenty five if what happened tomorrow\nI wouldn't be out of my mind shocked to Florida beats Georgia because it is a you know it's a rivalry game and as you start Texas Oklahoma sometimes those things sort of in\nA northwestern it might be Wisconsin because north western has a a little bit of a ... over the badgers in al ... is in the concussion protocol and I'm actually going to the\nGame where you know you go at all or do you mean that it's probably going to be thirty four degrees and raining or whether it\nWas a little bit and I write this evening in some parts of the suburbs\nLittle bit yeah so it's a family find out but I uh I think Texas loses to Oklahoma State I have it there's nothing really to go on that other than Texas is due for a ... one of these clunkers to go the wrong way and Oklahoma states do to have a good game especially with two weeks off so uh Oklahoma State over Texas is kind of my one for tomorrow\nAbout navy mixing hangs up just enough to make it interesting I mean obviously a twenty four point wide\nBut yeah interesting as you say interesting if you like the ... for a lot of points against an option to you but this isn't the navy team in the last few years it's not as Chris but defense isn't nearly as good and they know the names had two weeks off but\nThis starts a run for games in five where the Irish are away from South bend and there's just a quirky and if the schedule there's this game in San Diego\nThere's the Syracuse came in Yankee Stadium they got to come back out to LA or the west coast or to play USC late in the season are still going to come down to Evanston employee northwestern I mean there's a lot of land mines left\nA and you don't want to lose it now because this is not

need to get to next week for five games that are interesting\nBut next week Alabama LSU we start seeing things get serious as you get down to three games before the end of the ... and that's going to be the big one that that you see All right what kind of game is this going to be is finally are we going to see Alabama playing close game is that once you lose is how far do they dropped down can they still get two teams in the play off\nEverything was going the Dodgers way it looked like everybody was loved asleep\nAnd boy Jackie Bradley junior got to pitch right out over the heart of the plate and he just hammered it into the stands in right field the red Sox dug out is blazing right now electric and I don't I don't want people to think I'd be like they're all like no no no no they are just so easy to here in\nRight now when you were all happy and in your mellow phase Jackie Bradley junior he's keep on keep it on right now no that's right he's watching a\nChance and obviously this was one of the big issues during the regular season yet health concerns and then you add the performance of giving up the teen home runs this year in his sixty nine appearances he'd only give it up six or fewer and every other season in his major league baseball career and\nIt kills what was a great stat for Walker I mean there's still exist obviously Walker be alert but it's a little less exciting now that you have a tie game and that you will join a rare company seven scoreless innings or better to hit your fewer and zero walk to the world series game he becomes the third\nMember of that club with Roger Clemens game two of the year two thousand and then Don Larsen we keep referencing yeah with each game you had to go all the way back in ...\nAnd for Jackie Bradley his tenth RBI the postseason every RBI with two outs and the red Sox continue their two out RBI run so here we are a bit of a shock or going on right now Boston the Dodgers one one in the top of the eighth inning but\nIn the NFL this week it may be the biggest match up is a loser leave town elimination 'bout because when you think about the magic number it takes to get to the playoffs in the national football the the\nNumber six is a big red numbers circle by everybody you go ten and six you'll make the playoffs anything outside of ...\nSuddenly\nYou're likely not making it once in a while\nCan you can at nine and seven yeah you can but\nTeams are going to win ten games and you leave it outside of your hands you get to that magic number six it's a very big deal Sunday the eagles and the jaguars the game it starts early 'cause it's at ... stadium you have both of these teams sitting at three and four and tremendously under achieving\nNow granted the loser is only going to be three and five but you have to stop at this point by saying oh this is going to go on a run actually going to run you're talking about then the second half of the season these teams can lose one game one game and still make the playoffs\nThat's how serious things get when you get the five losses you can only afford to lose one more game and you keep saying all the eagles or the chance they'll figure it out all the jaguars when the AFC title game last year they'll figure it out they haven't figured out yet\nThere is no magic pill there's nobody coming to anybody's rescue the loser of this game will not make the playoffs in the NFL tell you that right now well you go down the degree of\nDifficulty in terms of your schedule such as hey we got X number of games left for the eagles is not an easy road and you've got the cowboys coming off the buying a couple of weeks then you have\nThe saints on the road\nThe giants whatever they are at this point to games left with the red skins who are currently atop the division you got the rams\nYou you have another game with the cowboys by that point you fully acclimated I'm already Cooper I don't know what that means I mean we're still waiting to see\nA when it's all said and done but opportunity there and then your Houston Texans mixed in there as well but the jaguars how much is Carlos Hyde able to stabilize thing when you got a quarterback that you don't believe in you've already bench and now you're doing all the\nWay here's your vote of confidence ahead of a trip overseas it's just a bad business right now in the defense a shell of its former self\nSo this is where you're at I'm going to say I know it's kind of another home game\nFor the jaguars bought the eagles find a way to win a close one they have the better quarterback\nThe eagles staying there the better team and the jaguars season continues to spiral out of control well I think I also get points for Cory climate during an interview and saying hey this is zombie Corey climate right now because he ... he was having trouble so I'll give the bonus points to that\nTwitter about how about a ...

Fox News President Trump calling in another case of guilty until proven innocent\nSo when you put this in context you think about why because for folks on the left\nThere's just resigned themselves they can't figure out how in the world I mean on and not your ration day I had to listen to pin heads around their\nHours oh he's he's out after that I mean well first is going to be impeached but who he would never be reelected I mean people already seen the mistake that to me like you you really just do not get it\nThe first thing is when you're putting that in context you have to take a look at\nWhat it would take for someone who voted for that President not to vote for them again\nI mean yes you can have new voters that come about over the course of four years and if all those new voters leaned heavily in one direction maybe just maybe you could move the needle and by the way I keep track of that and I'm going to give you a little piece of a story I'm actually working on for my local shows here tomorrow\nJust wrapped up the research on this little while ago checking in on the state's voter registration and from info you're interested to know how Florida has gone over the past couple of years since the twenty sixteen presidential election well yes a Ford did break for Donald Trump beyond that\nAt since the twenty sixteen presidential election through today there are thirty thousand fewer Democrats registered to vote\nYeah thirty thousand fewer registered Democrats in Florida for the past two years we have fifty one thousand additional Republicans registered to vote\nOh by the way\nProbably not going to make the news anywhere even stateside\nAnd do we do have quite a few independents that have registered to vote over a hundred thousand there\nMy point being even to the extent that we've seen people from a point of partisanship registered to vote like they're all Democrats even though you would think that every young person you hear all the time all the young people go without registering to vote and then they're all Democrats well we heard from Joshua\nTwenty two years old Washington DC in biology left our\nWho's a thoughtful conservative so that can happen in DC well it can happen in other places too and so don't be surprised that's part of the story beyond it you've got to think about what's happening here and ... is a lot a lot to feel good about\nFirst ... you you take a look at the economy we have the best economy in a generation I never voted millennials for buying into the hope and change bull crap they didn't know better they went through school here in front of a bunch\nOf people who didn't get in the education establishment they get out there and go yeah this really does suck they hear Obama and they go with I guess he's right until they actually are given an opportunity to see what the US Economy is capable of and then you've got some lines\nThat are up and that's the gun in the in the generation\nBut we have two Supreme Court justices tax reform the end up the Affordable CARE Act mandate Lewis unemployment rate in forty nine years in by the way record low unemployment for all demographics except Asian and white men yeah remember how it's all about the white men white man\nAnd Asian men they will only demos out there that are not at a record low unemployment\nRight out oh by the way but\nYou also have the biggest increase in the take home pay and thirty two years by the way I mentioned that I Believe on friday and I receive some notes from some angry folks on the left always happy to try to deal with him but I Want to lay the groundwork for that one once again because not hard to get there is a little math\nAnd it's easier than calculating the Pocahontas math if you're the Boston Globe listening\nIt works like this you take the overall salary that the average person was making last year you take a look at what it is today by the way it pays about two point eight percent base salary a year over year okay All right\nThen you take a look at the average bonus that has been paid out so far this year when you do that it gives you a little bit over three percent\nAnd then you take a look at the average net benefit of the tax cuts which happens to be for the average fulltime employee person about Eighteen hundred bucks this year you put all that together and boom you get six point seven percent\nAnd complicated suicides histories one side of the facts Israel and by the way in the event that you're the angry leftist that goes yeah but I I haven't seen any benefit for the tax cuts well\nThat's because you know where your employer probably David about it which by the white personally thirty million people who are in that situation where employers that might get adjustments you didn't make adjustments so if you're not seeing it it'll be reconciled when you file your taxes and congratulations you'll have likely given the government in interest free one but\nIt's still there because of well over Ninety percent of people do benefit from the new tax law\nBut that's all the cool stuff right I mean all of that progress that I just decided\nTo ask yourself well if you voted for Donald Trump why would you vote against that in two years answer is if anything he probably has attracted more votes ... if he didn't nothing else no other accomplishments they always status quo from here until twenty twenty it probably gets re elected\nAnd again sixty five percent of presidents who run for re election in so if he were less successful than he is he would still likely be reelected in twenty twenty but here's the the next point and this is the under stated point\nI Want to work on something conceptually before I give you some facts will do that in a little bit\nHow often were we talking about domestic terrorism thing about that how often did we have radicalized domestic homegrown terrorism in the United states\nPrior to Donald Trump becoming president that was a fairly regular occurrence wasn't it now you take a look at not having that problem\nTake a look at not having Tea Party and and white people\nSpecifically all these are angry white men men are singled out by the Obama administration as the number one focus on the watch list and instead you have people that do fit the profile or potential Islamic terrorism that had been number one domestically under the Trump Administration and guess what\nDoesn't make the news if they stop it before it happens which happens a lot\nWhich happens a lot\nAnd the foreign policy success I'm not just talking about North Korea\nAnd the fact that to date we've always kept to Russia at bay or that Syria as much of a mess as it is\nHas been dealt with about as peacefully and with as little damage to the United states in our interest as we could have hoped for the spotlight and talking about all that might even talking about the trade deals that had been worked out this far to our benefit that are often under Scott\nI'm Talking about the eradication of ISIS but also the implications for other parts of the middle east now one of the amazing turnabout and all this had been Saudi Arabia\nWe actually had Saudi Arabia under the Trump Administration say that they are with us with Israel a Middle Eastern country\nSaying there with Israel against Iran\nThat's holy cow material now that's where this whole situation when as I say we got this journalist who by the way you know has a interesting history of his own that goes into a consulate in Turkey we have some ah folks from uh the the Saudi regime that enter\nAnd a few hours later they leave and you know probably not putting his foot beat up by eating bond bond so we we have a missing journals okay\nThat's where this whole situation gets complicated because we've made some progress with Saudi Arabia but the problem is back to my sliding scale morality if you are\nNot there anymore all at the started your compass you can become pretty evil at the root of it and it's important to know who in what these people are that we're still dealing with and I'll bring you the rest of the story as the late great one would have said uh I'm going to bring it

for him to remain there and be tortured because well you have many more potential witnesses and a lot more difficult situation for even turkey to account for at that point so\nOf all the scenarios

I couldn't help by itself but to put together some information on Taylor Swift and on the race that she endorsed and her clear lack of understanding of any of it when I ended up ... and this was the headline I Believe it was on Sunday on CNBC how\nTaylor Swift political adores men could become the biggest red\nAt the polls ripple ever\nAs the polls [laughter]\nI mean OK okay maybe just maybe not how you thought here's an actor\nLast week pop star Taylor Swift made waves by breaking or stands up political neutrality and backing democratic congressional candidates in our home state of Tennessee\nThe effect of Swiss surprise endorsement which was made the on Instagram photos were felt right away as thousands of people between the ages of Eighteen and twenty nine registered to vote\nAccording to vote dot org\n[noise] okay now I'm\nGonna get straight to the point about the Taylor Swift the fact that some of the media as recently as a couple of days ago are still my gosh it's happening I think it's quieted down a little bit\nOver the past year or so because I think more of them are like being pointed to the polls and going hey are you say it was up in Tennessee or\nSee I'm Taylor's specific endorsement of the Democrat so Britain sending in tendencies US Senate race you see at the time at the endorsement Marsha Blackburn the Republican challenger in this race\nSheila's average in a three point lead and the three most recent polls in Tennessee right Blackburn three point lead in the three most recent polls prior to the Taylor Swift effect where is she today and the three most recent polls in that particular race early it is now\nNine points so oh\nNot exactly what you're probably thought would happen here so the Taylor Swift effect in the immediate aftermath of the race that she finally weighing in on is negative six\nPercent in a week so I like to say you got two sides to stories in one side the facts but here's the deal you got a lot of folks are if you play the millionaire the concept that for every action got the equal and opposite reaction I enter science guy on earlier in the show\nHere's the thing that I'm In in the south in particular\nYou have a lot of folks that will end up getting energized about the moment you got celebrities that are weighing in and specifically when she ended up outing herself\nPretty much immediately or her lack of understanding of pretty much everything including the person she was endorsing\nSee if you're in Tennessee and you're fine politics you might have noticed that she was a bit of an obvious hypocrites for a few reasons among others now she said that Marsha Blackburn doesn't represent her Tennessee values\nBut you see here is that the the dirty little detail Taylor isn't actually from Tennessee she's from Pennsylvania\nPennsylvania huh\nAnd she happened only moved to Tennessee to pursue her music career in high school oh by the way she's lived there less than half her life\nYou know in the you know Taylor Swift as to Tennessee values as say a Elizabeth Warren is due to Cherokee Indians you know the person sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren better known as the bad Pocahontas smelling now\nShe spoke up supporting elegy meteorites\nGB T rights as part of her Tennessee values by the way [noise] I guess what\nThe Democrats the she endorsed bill Bratton than he doesn't support gay marriage and a bunch of other issues he's on the record as much [laughter] so it's clear that she's never even looked into what he believes in no go\n\nAnd then you've got the optics you see for maybe you could activate some of those young folks in in Nashville better\nYeah but here's the thing anybody noticed that you got Taylor Swift endorsing an old white guy who\nDoes not support\nGay marriage and host of other old GB T rights that Taylor says are part of her Tennessee values from Pennsylvania so she's endorsing in the old white guy bat evil these days and leftist politics right over a younger woman\nHa ha interesting\nI mean and there's a lot more we we can continue down that rabbit hole but it's not necessary but you see those instead of saying they pretty much get the point to and law you log\nIn terms of Tennessee values I'm from suburban Georgia lived in Knoxville for a time when I was small and I'm pretty familiar with tendency values and they take a look at these celebrity in in Hollywood endorsements and ah well\nNot often impressed so it probably is going to continue to have the opposite of the fact that they weren't as a painting I mean come on\nAll these celebrity endorsements work right Katy Perry holding up Hillary Clinton's arm\nEither way it wasn't an awkward moment I mean I did the trick always does\nAnd so here's the funny thing if you're taking a look at when celebrity endorsements actually matter well she kind of Mr moment you see if she actually wanted somebody with her Pennsylvania\nTendency L. J. B. T. writes values she couldn't actually weighed in in the primary because Columbia University actually did prove that\nSome Democrats are impressed by celebrities for example Columbia University they did show pretty empirically that in the two thousand eight democratic presidential primary\nOprah Winfrey's endorsement really did encourage an additional ... million people largely black do vote for ...

with what you were just touching on but um\nThis is Taylor Swift thing could be even a larger on a larger scale where people are just rejecting a Hollywood talking heads as being anybody of any value or lack of value whatsoever that's number one\nNumber two I don't know if you recall but on a night of nine eleven you remember they had that music vigil of ... a vigil with Springsteen\nAnd Tom Petty where they were pounding the war drums you recall that not really to be honest with you\nThey all came on and Tom Petty song is we won't back down um it was all a\nIt was all in a kind of aggressive music or that hinted towards we're coming at ya but they're the same they were covering the same cloth especially Springsteen where they were anti war or they they are just so hypocritical I'm hoping that God that people are just not taken serious anymore\nWell I can take I tell you this much in in Tennessee in particular there are some places where the celebrities do play if you're in California I have no doubt that that plays in fact there is research that did show up from Columbia University back to two thousand eight\nA presidential primary to where there are Democrats or a percentage of them that are activated by celebrity but you've got to you know somebody's got to be open to the message is what I talked about when a I'll describe being politically persuasive one of the most common questions I get how is it that I find somebody who I can uh you know convince of of what's right\nWell the first thing is you got to find somebody who's open to the information if you find somebody who's closed minded\nWell it doesn't matter how hard to try their not to the information so when the case of the celebrities when you're talking about what's going on in Tennessee oh well you've got a large swaths of that population that is not not going to be turned on\nBy a celebrity endorsement but what's worse and this is the most offensive thing and I say this yeah I'm not really a true southerner in the sense that I'm from suburban Atlanta\nAnd to be honest with you I didn't even know what the the saying get out of dodge meant until I was sixteen made that kind of thing didn't come up where where I was from but I Do understand a lot of southern culture and\nYou know when you say that you have tendency now use\nAnd you're not only not from Tennessee where you're from Pennsylvania [laughter] name they drew many of the folks in Tennessee that those people and so it's\nKind of like a no offense to you and in in Jersey Joe but I mean in Tennessee you know Jersey\nNot not the best reputation so anyway it's a good point\nStates all jerseys kind of cut in half you know ah almost had the center of the state um for the most part I'm and I'm Down in the you know more conservative area but I I just ... hoping to God that these numbers who who\nWho rely on these celebrities for their political opinions are shrinking more and more and more that's that's my ...\nYeah I I think the only celebrity that are necessary have to worry about in terms of this cycle\nIs the president of the United states\nI mean there is then irony there are certain extent you know he's obviously successful independent up these celebrity but you know hey just a\nWarning out with somebody otherwise probably will as I don't appreciate uh Joe and Menendez I mean come on really you you got some

did some great work\nCompiling those two topics in the last week that's where we are going to run on Thursday well a ... at the October breast cancer awareness month benefit Halley wolf doors open at six PM you know where the hell and wall sat right over warehouse district downtown New Orleans\nSo yeah some ticket Web dot com I if you go to Google and just do bra country it will pull you there are\nRamsey is jewelers one of the sponsors as well yeah I went to a W ... dot com or sister station here in New Orleans and that's where I\nPulled it up as W and oh we dot I heart dot com\nThat's a good picture of actually at the top it's not what she looks like in real life hey so did you see the same article I did 'cause I saw you referenced the number of how much would it take to start a McDonald's franchise yeah yeah so the average total start up investment is between is about one to two million bucks depending on where you're at\nBut what caught my attention was the um revenue from it\nA hundred and fifty thousand that profit that's not even revenue that yeah well that's what I mean profit but you know revenue yeah quite a bit of revenue but whatever the average one makes about a hundred and fifty thousand and profit lotta burgers yeah that's a lot of burgers that's a lot of money to put out\nThere in\n... million nuts Fifteen Percent profit two million seven and a half\nWhich still pretty good but I don't know if I Want to put two million out there for\nSeven and a half ago uh [noise] so if you want to make a million a year you need ten McDonalds\nOh man I mean you may when I met hard it is\nIt is you've got to go through acquiring a bunch of stores to make some money well here's the air in another interesting\nThing the actual franchise fee that you know just a ... the building is its own set of expense all the equipment or whatever but if you want to say I have to worry McDonald's on your\nFranchise forty five thousand dollars just for the rights to use the name by comparison to become a chick fillet franchisee that franchise fee is ten thousand dollars\nSo\nOkay better a little less selective huh\nWell\nYou're not going to buy one if you want to be open on Sundays that's true too yeah and you know ... let's see how many things they do let's see uh just one thing chicken\nThey do good and they have something I Wish everyone else had diet lemonade is I Love lemonade and\nI don't like what you have to have diet yeah I Know the franchise that does chicken only gangs yeah Louisiana based yeah yeah they have lemonade I don't know about the diet but they have some good lemonade over there too\nI I'm just I'm not on a diet it's just I just want to keep my wife interested that's all okay here's another a wicked statistic unless you wanted to jump in I don't know if I interrupt you a second ago but the this one doesn't make you very happy Gregory the top three percent of taxpayers in the United states\nPay the majority of income taxes and twenty sixteen which means the top three percent pay more than Seventy million Americans\nWhen it comes to taxes [noise] a lot of people like\nTo focus on the income inequality well there's also a tax inequality too\nAnd when when you see that the spread right there as looks like it's pretty much in line right seems pretty fair to me if they're going to be\nMaking all this money they got to pay a lot of the taxes so I won't grab by the taxes if they don't gripe about the time is that a deal Gregory\nYeah this is Mike are you you're good there yeah\nThis was interesting a story every red actually a week ago about the a mattress from filing for bankruptcy so we\nBut another big firms spin around for like two decades file for chapter eleven bankruptcy protection the mouth would be closing as many as seven hundred stores in the U.S and I believe they closed a couple of stores\nOr around the metro New Orleans or Abbott looked along the Gulf Coast and such\nBut mattress from is the U.S largest specially mattress retailer with an estimated three thousand two hundred and Seventy two stores across us according to wed Bush\nAnalysts F ... store counters grown significantly in the past years as it is expanded quickly an acquired competing change such a sleep piece which purchase and twenty six team what the heck is sleep is it's a mattress place you know kinda makes you sleepy [laughter]\nAnd accommodate sleeping I got the chain um they had too many stores and us given the mattress says are\nA product that is typically about every seven to ten years\nYou don't grow up there by ah you know we've had this thing for a year to go spend another grand get a new one\nOr just throw some pads on it it'll be fine according to a start up think I'm\nForty two point six percent of mattress firms stores are located within a mile radius of each other well that's kind of a problem what yeah\nThey just oh there's one Merrill is all move stores into their idea that the proximity of mattress for firms store locations is related to mommy law during or any illegal activity is absolutely false Murphy told Business Insider\nWhy didn't bring it up for it [laughter] what are you worried about it is yes\nI Do yeah that was thrown out there so there are some law suits and stuff on that but at the end of twenty Seventeen its parent company Stein hall holdings which is currently being investigated on charges of fraud said it would be closing two hundred mattress firms at the time and analysts expect that many more\nWould follow suit in that oh I see what's going on but when you start going in and\nLooking at the numbers which I don't have here in front of me but when you start looking at the numbers and the amount of\nMoney owed to these mattress companies it's scary it's it's ... Dick you'll is that that they have piled up and a Stein off has financial\nManagement problems there's a lot of money mismanagement in the company that led to these difficulties there what ultra\nLow rates have basically encouraged all these entities to go out and go get some of that cheap money while they can and then a rising right world is going to make an untenable I see what you're saying they'll use that they have over three thousand stores one thousand of them though are right around lake Ozark it's the weirdest thing is [laughter]\nAnd that's a money laundering joke from Netflix for those few and by the way I'm almost caught up to you we're we're gonna have to have a chat about that soon but I'm two episodes behind\nSo hey we got another event coming up in November fourteenth so it is exactly one week away ... I mean one week one month away and his over halfway full however it's not too late to go in RSVP reserve your seat it's going to be six thirty PM Ruth's Chris in ... it's a Wednesday so it's not going to coincide with the saints game to have to worry about it\nBut a ... by you been wanting to come by to last event and the one before that and the one before that and make this one the one gives a nice little early Christmas present combined meat Gregory and find out what he can do with your money and you like it and I think it's going to be a good fit than you'll just coming to the office enjoy some wine at stake in the meantime and or just have a good\nWednesday so our sep at the website ... dot com called the office Bible for a three to Ninety two zero zero [noise] so you can also reach Gregory for his day job [noise] your home away from the show any life dot com and the winning at life app I'm James Parker we are winning it life with Gregory rich [noise]\nToday's episode of winning it life is previously recorded\n[noise] winning at life with Gregory wreck [noise]\nWhat do you live with Gregory wrecked cars for educational and entertainment purposes only\nAnd does not recommend the sale or purchase of any specific security investments for investment strategy Gregory rex is an investment advisor representative with global financial private capital what do you live with Gregory rights is the copyright of down south strategies for the private use of our audience bind pod cast in contact info and the winning it like that and winning it live\nDot com [noise] we are winning it lives with ... [noise]\nFrom the men do Buick GMT studios he's used talk going on for nine point and I urge radios [noise]\nKilled a Saudi Arabian on Saudi Arabian territory then probably took ... body away in a van or put it in acid or something this is terrible it's\nAwful kind of like when Kate Steinle was gunned down by some of the wailing but for the last week or ten days the media is in overdrive the blame Trump\nOr Jared Kushner or some relationship there saying somehow we did it that were responsible that Trump somehow with uh with um Mohammed bin ... so called M B. S. than MPs is somehow\nConsulting with Trump to decide what to do at a time which is a bunch of crap\nNobody's in favor of this we have a western mine are Judeo Christian ethic we believe and due process at least Republicans do\nSo we believe in fairness\nAnd and so whatever happened to a Saudi Arabian\nButter Saudi Arabian government\nIn a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey is interesting but hell we got ten thousand murders in this country every year not being investigated by CNN or obsessing by the New York times and the Washington Post where he worked as a contributor kick him we let it go a little bit and see what happened and when it comes out\nThat the M. B. S. directly or indirectly heck a show the murdered in a horrible way because he was a dissident and it's a ... and offer regime and Saudi Arabia that's what's going to come out\nI guess Trump's responsible for that to it never stops it never ends I Can't take it anymore it's awful and so can we move on from that the\nAnswer of course is no this is the ah\nEvent there's your the event this week and next week they keep coming up whether it's Kavanaugh or Julie sweating ache or Deborah Ramirez or a bunch of other incidents that have arisen in the past several months of the Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump\nHow can we use this event how can we take Christina for how can we use this event that didn't involve Trump at all and some out last this upon him and stain or smear him with some news event\nThat Trump is nothing to do with doing nothing zero zilch nada didn't happen as possible but it goes on and on I I tried to watch for hours\nWolf Blitzer and others on CNN it's impossible to watch it as if MPs is on speed dial with ... and Trump taking orders assuming he did it what does that mean what might be behind it is is\nThere are many in this country and in the media who thinks the Iranian deal was wonderful for our country and that brought Hussein Obama delivered one point eight billion dollars in cash on governmental pilots to use for terrorism by Ron man that was a great idea we ought to do more of that\nAnd so because Saudi Arabia is the pitch enemy of Iran\nMaybe those in the media wants to get back to the Iranian deal and weaken Saudi Arabia in the middle east\nSo that Iran takes over larger chunks of the middle east Iraq and Syria not paying enough maybe that's what's behind it plus as you may know if you've been paying attention Israel and Saudi Arabia have become brothers they become sisters they become friendly with each other because their enemy is Iran\nThey're the enemy of my enemy is my friend so because Israel\nAnd Iran are enemies and because Saudi Arabia and Iran are enemies now Israel and Saudi Arabia are working together and lots of areas so there may be parts of America that wants to get rid of that uh that budding friendship between Israel and Saudi Arabia\nBy weakening the Saudis\nBut whatever it is we don't have a dog in this fight you may want to strengthen Iran and the media does or weaken Israel which the media does\nBut by doing that were hurting our country after nine eleven which I think Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers came from Saudi Arabia we got a little sideways with Saudi Arabia for a while but now we're back together and they're spending\nI think the president said the other day something in the range of a hundred and ten billion with a total cost of five hundred billion dollars\nOf taking our military hardware to upgrade their military to fight Iran who's our enemy they'd been our enemy since ... since we helped get rid of the shah of Iran look what happened there\nAnd so whatever happened happened it\nOccurred let the Saudi Arabians deal with it if the government ordered the killing of someone which by the way America itself has done on a regular basis\nCountries do these kinds of things if Saudi Arabian government decided to murder Jamal ... show gig and stupidly they decided to pick a consulate in Turkey to do the Daschle deed and if that's a violation of some criminal law somewhere to the Turks are the odds you\nKnow what I say have at it\nBut according to diplomatic law the consulate Israeli Saudi Arabian territory and so what happened there stays in Saudi Arabia so whatever happens happens it is what it is can we move\nOn absolutely not you see\nThe mid term so now only about what twenty days away twenty days from now the ... and so things are heading toward\nThe Republican way in many states especially in Arizona Nevada and a Montana president it's going to make a greater parents there in North Dakota Heitkamp that allows the thing with the disclosing the names of sexual assault victims so the red wave appears to be building and the Senate\nAnd that was the big news story so the last several days the news media said wait a minute this thing is heading toward the Republicans to help Trump we can have that so they started this other thing about ...\nWho was killed\nIn Turkey and he's a Saudi now as we speak the last several days there have been hundreds of Americans who have been killed a few dozen by legal aliens there was a horde of some two or three thousand Central Americans making their way up to America paying their passage\nMS Thirteen with are girls being raped and men being killed it's happening right now and so there's other news stories going on in the world and because it was kind of going toward Trump's direction and as Rasmussen approval rating was up to fifty one percent the media might have said you know what this was going the wrong direction\nIf we can go after some out the sides and you and in their place put Jared Kushner and Trump somehow responsible for the murder of cars shaggy maybe that'll be a good thing maybe we can stop the building red wave in the Senate what's gonna happen in the house I have no idea so so let's continue with more\nThan ... line becomes available which it never does\nEight seven seven three eight one three eight one one eight seven seven three eight one three

... one ... one one [noise]\nMy belly counting of the great American in for the great when Mark Sullivan way of case and Chris and Josh and many others\nTo lines are open to you know the ... if you'd desire to join his eight seven seven three one two three one one last night before I go to you uh keep babbling but that's a good look at it this way Tony days from now\nAnd uh I met with the president or two or three days ago we're going to share with you some of his thoughts later on that uh it appears to me\nThat the number one issue right now is the court system is I just told you Seventy percent of the judges are appointed by Democrats great majority of the cases Ninety nine point nine nine percent never get the Supreme Court and so if\nIn twenty days the Senate flip through the Democratic party Chuck Schumer will hold back and not confirm any\nAny of the White House's judicial nominees through twenty twenty which really is January of twenty Twenty one\nAnd then at that point of Trump is reelected which most of us believe he will do this and that stays democratic is not going to be twenty Twenty one it'll be twenty twenty three he will not stop\nThey will not nominate you could nominate but they went out confirmed one judge so what's on the ballot and twenty days is the court system and whether the destruction of our constitutional several more rights than traditional values will continue\nOn or else we can make the turn some out back to the mental secondly all the investigations that the house becomes democratic which is appears to be very likely\nThe investigations of every aspect of Trump's life his wife's life Jared Kushner's live everyone's life for the White House will be laid bare\nAnd the next two years or not be about legislation but rather investigation so if you want the mob rule that you've seen the past several months\nWhere Republicans are shot run off the street cars blown up and beaten than incentivize the mob by giving them up power by putting their house back in Georgia Nancy Pelosi and watch what happens\nIt's going to be unbridled is going to be unbelievable another\nAspect to courses foreign policy right now despite the efforts of CNN and others to destroy our relationship with the sides things are pretty good\nNorth Korea's not shooting missiles anywhere right now Iran and Iraq are somewhat quiet right now Syria is heading toward a conclusion I've got a horrible war incentivized by the Russians by the Iranians and vibrant Hussein Obama who allowed the Russians and the Iranians to come into Syria\nForeign policy wise things are pretty good that's\nOn the ballot the economy according to some national international experts the American economy right now is the greatest it's ever been in American history\nHow were the stock market react if Nancy Pelosi begins investigations of every aspect of the executive branch of government it won't be good plus you got the impeachment issue is there any doubt in your mind that the Democrats who wants to eliminate Trump from office so if you want the next two years now\nBe about judges not to be about a and only about investigations and impeachments in a hurt the economy then that's what's on the ballot so when Trump comes to one of these states and he came to Cincinnati a few days ago I spent some time with them and and play some of his thoughts later on\nIf that happens do they're just don't talk which is all we do go they're physically in confront and say yes I Am here as his testimony to what this country can be and should be do I like all the tweets do I like the horse ed comment about the strip or no\nBut the policies the procedures what's happening with the court system what's happening with the economy what's happening with Foreign Relations you know is damn good it's really good\nAnd so think about what's on the ballot and twenty days because the Democrats are as incentivize is they've ever been and it's going to get more ridiculous they're going to more incentivize and if you incentivize the mob by buying them all for paying them off is going to be nothing but difficulties so let's go to your calls now\nWe have a case in Los

saying that because I've been looking at al Jazeera English and they've been reporting from day one that us and tell us I don't know if it's the deep state\nBut the league that they had conversations with authority print and his entourage arranged a kitten that this guy though and if you look and recently um John Brennan the last past two days and then and they say he confirmed that through his CIA operative so I think\nUm yeah we are complex and even though we didn't have involvement in the murder and we did not warn him and that's what a big issue in the final point and\nOh don't do on that point do you believe al Jazeera any more than you believe CBS why why\nWhy do you rely on al Jazeera which is an arm of the extreme Muslim Palestinian Authority why do you believe al Jazeera how

L. M. got what they want it what are we went dead cops when you want them now and re most in lieu were tortured and killed\nThat was a one day story and the media quickly dropped it because of who did it one officer Jason Ellis was murdered in a barge down Kentucky ambush killing we don't know who did it\nAnd at this point what is in the media spend time instead of the show geek in Turkey take up the calling of a police officer who was tortured and murdered in uniform and spent time as to who killed him and why was murdered\nRe most uh Lewis killed according to the black nationalist he said that he wanted to come and kill police officers because what cops had done to Michael Brown and Eric Garner\nAnd so the media covered those stories as if cops killed wrongfully Michael Brown in Ferguson which they did not to Michael Brown tried to kill a police officer Darren Wilson and it was proven beyond a shadow of a doubt\nBy Obama's Justice Department then Michael Brown should have been killed because of his behavior and Eric Gardner killed was killed he died because he was resisting arrest\nAnd so but when the media cover these events\nWas a sick mind in Baltimore who thought police officers ... fold because of the way CNN covered the killing of Michael Brown who was an unarmed robber who tried to kill police officer Darren Wilson and grabbed his gun inside the police car and that was proven that was proven\nBut the media cover these events in such a way that causes black murder nationalist the hunt down ...

instead of doing that they take sides in a dispute and ignore all this other evidence that doesn't fit their agenda and then they go after the obscure fact\nOf some saw being killed in Turkey which

or\nIt was very sad a beautiful in one way and very Saturn and other kids were beautiful they loved her and she came back and she said I Hope you're going to\nContinue to give a lot of money because they needed it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just that on the human race as they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact on\nMe and the other thing the mid west I look at Canada Mexico and South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what'd you do not cause Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominee you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were taken so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe were unable to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now just men to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a a much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton do you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea so\nHow many jobs and talking to my every time I can or Mexico we talking about a million\nWell you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab they make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least is fair and are farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed\nHow can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers well we can't sell\nInto their into into their countries they have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even not elected\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing your cars because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away and then a with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said\nListen we're not call me back but are going to give you one more chance and has said that's okay I'm going to tax the cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money\nI've had my share mechanics calling me saying well they found something wrong that needs replacing when I've taken my car and for an oil

this on Monday and Elizabeth Warren reveals proof of Native American ancestry how 'bout that headline how about the a P supposedly objective independent the AP quote Warren DNA shows Native American heritage how about CNN you'll love this one this is as of Monday Elizabeth Warren\nYou know Pocahontas quote Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests was strong evidence of Native American ancestry BBC\nElizabeth Warren DNA tests fine strong evidence of Native American blood\nThat strong evidence amounts to something less than point one percent in reality she is less Native American blood than the typical so called white American has Native American blood it's unbelievable and are about\nThe Daily Beast on Monday quote breaking news Elizabeth Warren releases her DNA test yes she is Native American\nHow 'bout that Boston Globe her hometown newspaper quote Warren reveals test confirming ancestry NBC News the nobody but Clinton network NBC News quote Elizabeth Warren releases DNA results indicating she is Native American heritage when you break down the numbers\nThe testing that this person did involve samples from Columbia in Peru not from America\nAnd that she is something less than point one percent Native American blood that she played for decades as a minority to make money\nAnd so it's amazing to me how the media covers for those protected inside the progressive tribe if you're part of the group\nAnd your Louis Farrakhan using hate speech against Jews Twitter will not ban you\nIf you're in the group like Brock Hussein Obama and you admit in the presidency using drugs committing felonies it's no big story at all but if you're outside the group and your name is Brett Kavanaugh and when you were Fifteen Years old you drank beer\nOr had some posting in your your book my God that's a big story\nSo Clinton in office as president drugs\nNo problem Brett Kavanaugh drank beer you're ... when he was Fifteen major major problems and so I look at the puck receipt of

and you it came across over the phone that he respects you quite a bit it was a great interview in regard to this or\nA Saturday a journalist from the coast I hear constantly on the media is portrayed as a journalist\nOr from Washington Post inferring that he's an American American citizen and this is just trying to prove that Trump doesn't care about journalists and uh he he kisses up to the Saudis it's these are people that have been helping us fight terrorists\nFor years under Obama he had written lines\nAnd ISIS was a a JV team took a Trump a one year to get rid of ISIS you don't hear about that in the news anymore\nBecause you know I don't know because it doesn't fit how long did Obama deal with ISIS eight years now and Trump got rid of them and when you are how big of a story was that\nA just a blip on the radar for one day\nThey'll let me ask you this was ambassador Christopher Stevens and American\nUh invent guys who had a credit you know all the time you know\nProtecting

with a grain when Martin living back to your calls that I have a lot of tech and then I some of the most literate audiences in radio is\nThe ... show because of the strength of his affiliates and the and the reach of these is intellect and we have caused all over the country including San Francisco and Chris in San Francisco welcome to the ... show and Chris please go ahead\nOn high or you are incredibly articulate and it's a joy to listen to you you get the F\n... and very ... thank you thank you think\nAbout what I'd like to say is you know I keep hearing about that the media lying and that's all we get is there information they yeah they're dominating the news surface all liars well why don't we get more stations than Fox and get a budget competing\nConservative stations because I keep hearing people call in and say\nWell I don't have the concert at station where I live\nWell we'll see are you going to go on how about the art TV you check to see our TV you can check some news\nDot com one American network out to check with your cable company I think see our TV does a great job Fox I Can't watch Shepard Smith in the afternoon if I Wanna watch that crap all watch MSNBC so I Can't watch Shepard Smith there's parts of Fox that I Can't watch\nI Love Hannity I'll watch him Laura no problem Carlson no problem I Love watching mark on Sunday night but there's there's parts of Fox that that I Can't watch and it's because if I Wanna watch Shepard Smith crap I'll watch MSNBC instead I'm also get the true thing but but I and I worry about Fox long term\nBecause of the drift of what it's doing and it concerns me but I I like more information not less than ... when I I tell you what I Do Chris I get up\nAnd I check out a Drudge Report news match dot com I check mark ... website I go to the Daily Caller I go to daily wire\nI checked out Fox and I go to those six or red state dot com is pretty good I certainly do seven or eight and I feel\nFairly well informed to start my day and then throughout the day I check those websites for information I Can't pay attention to the so called mainstream media it's too much for me I Can't watch it drives me nuts but but I think there is information out there but you have to be a little more proactive and finding it\nAnd if you watch the our TV dot com and you and your own Newsmax Daily Caller Daley wire Drudge Report I think you're good to go\nI ... except when I leave for into is that mainstream media where people don't have the ... and ... they don't go to that effort because they're they're on the facts they don't want for conservatism is we need to get out there it'd be a competing like the local news and the mainstream media we need to get in there\nYou know Chris I I tell you what would happen money controls everything if CBS or ABC said from top to bottom from the top of the tree through the root system we're gonna have conservative viewpoints on all of our ah channels can you imagine the ratings\nSkyrocketing say at CBS News if they determine they're gonna do television much like one of America's network or Newsmax or see our TV if CBS would say we're going to cover news objectively moderate\nTo the right side of things wouldn't they make billions of dollars\nBecause you can't NBC ABC and CBS it's the same news casts every night at six thirty if one of them would go against the fracas and reflect the values the once and the whims and the wishes of the majority of the American people wouldn't we be better off and when they make a lot of money\nYeah well where are the people that are being proactive enough to do that to get into the mainstream these radio shows and his TV 'cause they're picking to the choir we need to change minds like kind of starting to go out and go on these mainstream media because I don't know if you've got to go there\nYes and it's okay to come and be all with me it's okay to do Fox or do my friend Sean Hannity now mark ... may get them on on a Sunday night on Fox on the radio\nBut but he needs to go out and this guy is wonderful the sixty minutes interview he took Leslie stall apart on Sunday I thought it was fabulous and he's he's his own

the television shows like Beyonce metlife stadium this is a superstar when you get in the presence\nOf Trump it's like the messiah it's it's unbelievable\nAnd I've never seen this in politics I wasn't old enough during the Kennedy era Ronald Reagan yes I Want to Reagan rally in Nineteen eighty four pretty good\nBut there's nothing in politics that equals a Trump rally and that's why you can go to Montana Iowa Erie, Pennsylvania Cincinnati Georgia Florida he'd go anywhere\nAnd draw one hell of a crowd I Wonder what would happen if the Trump stir one to Central Park in New York City I Wonder what that would be like\nYeah I Wonder if it passed and he took that stall apart\nYou know she she was a ... to ... you know and this is off the subject that I said well irony and the dentist because they're starting to accusing him of going after young prosecutes theirs is competitor and boy as he whining about how unfair it is it's cracking me up\nBut uh I'll tell you what's unfair criticism when you picture our first lady as a stripper engaging in sex acts in the oval office and the mainstream media doesn't care about it and the other floated says don't gather around ... to protect her can you imagine if Michelle Obama\nWas pictured in a a video performing sex acts in the oval office what would the media due to the person that did that to Michelle Obama\nWell where's the outcry there is none me because the Trump is Mrs Trump ... that no outrage is sufficient to cause criticism\nAs long as the Trump Bullock we gotta go Chris thanks for your call I Want to thank once

Fox News secretary of state Mike Pompeo is back from his but she'll be Saudi Arabia and the turkey trying to learn what happened to journalist Joel ... you will brief President Trump in the morning on what he learned but on the flight back to Washington the secretary admitting it the diplomatic tightrope\nKilled a Saudi Arabian on Saudi Arabian territory then probably took ... body away in a van or put it in acid or something this is terrible\nIt's awful kind of like when Kate Steinle was gunned down by some of the wailing but for the last week or ten days the media is in overdrive the blame Trump\nOr Jared Kushner or some relationship there saying somehow we did it that were responsible that Trump somehow with ah with um Mohammed bin Salman so called M B. S. than NBS is somehow\nConsulting with Trump to decide what to do ahead of time which is a bunch of crap\nNobody's in favor of this we have a western mine are Judeo Christian ethic\nWe believe and due process at least Republicans do\nSo we believe in fairness\nAnd and so whatever happened to a Saudi Arabian\nBy the Saudi Arabian government\nIn a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey is interesting but hell we got ten thousand murders in this country every year not being investigated by CNN or obsessing by the New York times and the Washington Post where he worked as a contributor\nKick him we let it go a little bit and see what happened and when it comes out\nThat the M. B. S. directly or indirectly heck a show gave murdered in a horrible way because he was a dissident and ... and offer regime and Saudi Arabia that's what's going to come out\nI guess Trump's responsible for that to it never stops it never ends I Can't take it anymore it's awful and so can we move on from that the answer of\nCourse is no this is the ah the event does your the event this week and next week they keep coming up whether it's Kavanaugh or Julie sweating ache or Deborah Ramirez or a bunch of other incidents that have arisen the past several months of the\nTrump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump how can we use this event how can we take Christina for how can we use this event that didn't involve Trump at all and somehow wash this upon him and stain or smear him with some news event\nThat Trump is nothing to do with doing nothing zero zilch nada didn't happen as possible but it goes on and on I I tried to watch for hours\nWolf Blitzer and others on CNN it's impossible to watch ... MPs his own speed dial with coach dinner and Trump taking orders assuming he did it what does that mean what might be behind it is is\nThere are many in this country and in the media who thinks the Iranian deal was wonderful for our country\nAnd that brought Hussein Obama delivered one point eight billion dollars in cash on governmental pilots to use for terrorism by Iran man that was a great idea we ought to do more of that and so because Saudi Arabia is the pitch enemy of Iran\nMaybe those in the media wants to get back to the Iranian deal and weaken Saudi Arabia and the middle east\nSo that Iran takes over larger chunks of the middle east Iraq and Syria not paying enough maybe that's what's behind it plus as you may know if you've been paying attention Israel and Saudi Arabia have become brothers they become sisters they become friendly with each other because their enemy is Iran\nThe ... the enemy of my enemy is my friend so because Israel\nAnd Iran are enemies and because Saudi Arabia and Iran are enemies now Israel and Saudi Arabia are working together in lots of areas so there may be parts of America that wants to get rid of that uh that bonding friendship between Israel and Saudi Arabia\nBy weakening the Saudis\nBut whatever it is we don't have a dog in this fight you may want to strengthen Iran and the media does or weaken Israel which the media does\nBut by doing that were hurting our country after nine eleven which I think Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers came from Saudi Arabia we got a little sideways with Saudi Arabia for a while but now we're back together and they're spending\nI think the president said the other day something in the range of a hundred and ten billion with a total cost of five hundred billion dollars a of taking our military hardware to upgrade their military to fight Iran who's\nOur enemy they'd been our enemy since ... since we help get rid of the shah of Iran look what happened there\nAnd so whatever happen happen it occurred let the Saudi Arabians deal with it if the government ordered the killing of someone which by the way America itself has done on a regular basis\nCountries do these kinds of things if Saudi Arabian government decided to murder Jamal could show gig and stupidly they decide to pick\nA consulate in Turkey to do the Daschle deed and if that's a violation of some criminal law somewhere to the Turks the sides you know what I say have at it\nBut according to diplomatic law the consulate Israeli Saudi Arabian territory and so what happened there stays in Saudi Arabia so whatever happens happens it is what it is can we move on absolutely not you see\nThe mid term so now only about what twenty days away twenty days from now the ... and so things were heading toward the Republican way in\nMany states especially in Arizona Nevada and or Montana president it's going to make a greater parents there in North Dakota Heitkamp than a lousy thing with the disclosing the names of sexual assault victims so the red wave appears to be building and the Senate\nAnd that was the big news story so the last several days the news media say wait a minute this thing is heading toward the Republicans to help Trump we can't have that so they started this other thing about your mouth can show gay\nWho was killed in Turkey and he's a Saudi now as we speak the last several days there have been hundreds of Americans who have been killed a few dozen ... illegal aliens there was a horde of some two or three thousand Central Americans making their way up to America paying their passage the MS Thirteen\nWith the girls being raped and men being killed it's happening right now and so there's other news stories going on in the world and because it was kind of going toward Trump's direction and his Rasmussen approval rating was up to fifty one percent the media might have said you know what\nThis is going the wrong direction if we can go after some out the sides and you and in their place put Jared Kushner and Trump somehow responsible for the murder of cars shaggy maybe that'll be a good thing maybe we can stop the building red wave in the Senate what's gonna happen in the house I have no idea\nSo let's continue with more\nThan ... line becomes available which it never does eight seven seven three eight one three eight one one eight seven seven three eight one three one one

[noise] and I heart radio station [noise]\n[noise]\n\n... there's only one part of and you'll be going seven seven ... one ... one one [noise]\nI've only counting on the great American in for the great when Martin live and we have Keith and Chris and Josh and many others to lines are\nOpen to the ... ... if you'd desire to join his eight seven seven three one two three one one last night before I go to you I keep babbling but that's a good look at it this way Tony days from now\nAnd uh I met with the president or two or three days ago we are going to share with you some of his thoughts later on\nThat uh it appears to me\nThat the number one issue right now is the court system is I just told you Seventy percent of the judges are appointed by Democrats great majority of the cases Ninety nine point nine percent never get U.S Supreme court\nAnd so if in twenty days the Senate flips through the Democratic party Chuck Schumer will hold back and not come from any\nAny of the White House's judicial nominees through twenty twenty which really is January twenty Twenty one\nAnd then at that point if Trump was reelected which most of us believe he will and if the Senate stays democratic is not going to be twenty Twenty one it'll be twenty twenty three he will not stop\nThey will not nominate a you could nominate but then when I come from one judge so what's on the ballot and twenty days is the court system and whether the destruction of our constitutional several more rights than traditional values will continue\nOn or else we can make the turn some out back to the mental secondly all the investigations if the house becomes democratic which is appears to be very likely\nThe investigations have every aspect of Trump's life his wife's life Jared Kushner's life everyone's life for the White House will be laid bare and the next two years or not be about legislation but rather investigation so if you want the mob rule that you've seen the past several months where\nRepublicans are shot run off the street cars blown up and beaten than incentivize the mob by giving them up power by putting their house back in charge of Nancy Pelosi and watch what happens\nIt's going to be unbridled is going to be unbelievable another aspect of course his foreign policy right now\nDespite the efforts of CNN and others to destroy our relationship with the sides things are pretty good North Korea's not shooting missiles anywhere right now Iran and Iraq are somewhat quiet right now Syria is heading toward a conclusion I've got a horrible war incentivized by the Russians by\nThe Iranians and vibrant Hussein Obama who allowed the Russians and the Iranians to come into Syria\nForeign policy wise things are pretty good that's on the ballot the economy\nAccording to some national international experts the American economy right now is the greatest it's ever been in American history\nHow would this stock market react and Nancy Pelosi begins investigations of every aspect of the executive branch of government it won't be good plus you've got the impeachment issue is there any doubt in your mind that the Democrats who want to eliminate Trump from office so if you want the next two years not to be about judges\nNot to be about er and only about investigations and impeachment and hurt the economy then that's what's on the ballot so when Trump ...\nAnd so one of these states and he came to Cincinnati a few days ago I spent some time with them on to play you some of his thoughts later on\nIf that happens do they're just don't talk which is all we do go they're physically in confront and say yes I Am here as as testimony to what this country can be and should be do I like all the tweets do I like the horse had comment about the strip or no\nBut the policies the procedures what's happening with the court system what's happening with the economy what's happening with Foreign Relations you know is damn good it's really good and so think about what's on the ballot and\nTwenty days because the Democrats are is incentivize they've ever been and it's going to get more ridiculous they're going to more incentivize and if you incentivize the mob by buying them off or paying them off is going to be nothing but difficulties so let's go to your calls now\nWe have a case in Los Angeles and Chris in Atlanta line becomes available you know the routine let's continue with more Keith and Los Angeles welcome to the market live in show hosted by the great American bill Cunningham please go ahead\n[laughter] hey bill thank you for taking my call you asked a question if the U.S has complicit\nWith the democracy show um murder I Would say two hundred percent yes and reason why I'm saying that because I've been looking at al Jazeera English and they've been reporting from day one that us and tell us I don't know if that's the deep state\nBut the league that they had conversations with authority print and his entourage around a range of getting that this guy do and if you look and recently um John Brennan the last two days and then NBC confirmed that the CIA operatives so I think [noise]\nUm yeah we are complex and even though we didn't have involvement in the murder and we did not warn him and that's what a big issue in the final point\nOut on on that point do you believe al Jazeera any more than you believe CBS\nWhy why why do you rely on al\nJazeera which is an arm of the extreme Muslim Palestinian Authority why do you believe outages era how to cut her why do you believe them I wouldn't blame one word they said\nOkay I hear what you're saying but when they're right there at the same for twenty four seven out of your family the factual information all doing is recording factual information where

don't know what to do with and there's all kinds of rules to ... those are the two big topics so I imagine ... uh I'm going to push a couple of those cars that we did some great work\nCompiling those two topics in the last week that's where we are going to run on Thursday well a Gregory ... at the October breast cancer awareness month benefit Halley wolf doors open at six PM you know where the ... sat right over warehouse district downtown New Orleans\nSo yeah some ticket Web dot com and if you go to Google and just do bra country it will pull\nYou there oh Ramsey jewelers one of the sponsors\nAs well yeah I went to a W ... dot com or sister station here in New Orleans and that's where I\nPulled it up as W and oh we dot I heart dot com\nThat's a good picture of actually at the top it's not what she looks like in real life hey so did you see the same article I did 'cause I saw you referenced the number of how much would it take to start a McDonald's franchise\nYeah\nYeah so the average total start up investment is between is about one to two million bucks depending on\nWhere you're at but what caught my attention was\nThe um revenue from it\nA hundred and fifty thousand that's profit that's not even revenue that yeah well that's what I mean profit but you know revenue yeah quite a bit of revenue but whatever the average one makes about a hundred and fifty thousand in profit it's a lot of burgers yeah that's a lot of burgers that's a lot of money to put out\nThere and\n... million nuts Fifteen Percent profit two million seven and a half\nWhich still pretty good but I don't know if I Want to put two million out there for seven and a half\n[noise] so if you want to make a million a year you need ten McDonalds\nOh man I mean you may want to own that hard it is it is you've got to go through acquiring a bunch of stores to make some money well here's the air in another interesting thing the actual franchise fee that you know just a ...\nThe building is its own set of expense all the equipment whatever but if you want to say I have to worry McDonald's on your\nFranchise forty five thousand dollars just for the rights to use the name by comparison to become a chick fillet franchisee that franchise fee is ten thousand dollars\nSo\nOkay better a little less selective huh\nWell\nYou're not going to buy one if you want to be open on Sundays\nThat's true too yeah and you know ... let's see how many things they do less the uh just one thing chicken they do good and they have something I Wish everyone else had diet lemonade is I Love lemonade and I don't like what you have to have diet yeah\nI Know another franchise that does chicken only canes\nYeah Louisiana based yeah yeah they have lemonade I don't know about the diet but they have some good lemonade over there too\nI I'm just I'm not on a diet it's just I just want to keep my wife interested in that's all okay here's another a wicked statistic unless you wanted to jump in I don't know if I interrupt you a second ago but the this one doesn't make you very happy Gregory the top three percent of taxpayers in the United states\nPay the majority of income taxes and twenty sixteen which means the top three percent pay more than Seventy\nMillion Americans [noise] when it comes to taxes a lot of people like to focus on the income inequality well there's also a tax inequality too and when when you see that the spread right there\nAs looks like it's pretty much in line right seems pretty fair to me if\nThey're going to be making all this money they got to pay a lot of the taxes so I won't grab by the taxes if they don't gripe about the time is that a deal Gregory\nYeah this is Mike are you you're good there yeah this was interesting a story every red actually a week ago about the a mattress from filing for bankruptcy so we've been another big firms spin around\nFor like two decades file for chapter ... bankruptcy protection the mouse they would be closing as many as seven hundred stores in the U.S and I believe they've closed a couple of stores\nOr around\nThe metro New Orleans or I haven't looked along the Gulf Coast\nAnd such but mattress from is the U.S largest specially mattress retailer was an estimated three thousand two hundred and Seventy two stores across us according to wed Bush\nAnalysts Seth ... store counters grown significantly in the past years as it is expanded quickly an acquired competing change such as sleep piece which purchasing twenty sixteen what the heck is sleeping it's a mattress\nPlace you know kinda makes you sleepy [laughter] and accommodate sleeping I got the chain um they had\nToo many stores than us given the mattress says are a product that is typically about every seven to ten years\nYou don't grow up there by ah you know we've had this thing for a year to go spend another grand get a new\nOne or just throw some pat on it it'll be fine according to a start up think I'm forty two point six percent of mattress firms spores are located within a mile radius of each other\nWell that's kind of a problem what yeah\nThey just oh there's one Merrill is all move stores into their idea that the proximity of mattress for firms store locations is related to money laundering or any illegal activity is absolutely false Murphy into Business Insider\nWhy didn't bring it up like that [laughter] what are you worried about it\nIs yes I Do yeah that was thrown out there so there are some law suits and stuff on that but at the end of twenty Seventeen its parent company Stein hall holdings which is currently being investigated on charges of fraud said it would be closing two hundred mattress firms\nAt the time and analysts expect that many more\nWould follow suit and that ah I see what's going on but when you start going in and looking at the numbers which I don't have here in front of me but when you start looking at the numbers and the amount of money owed\nTo these mattress companies it's scary it's it's ... Dick you'll is\nThat that they have piled up and a Stein off has financial\nManagement problems there's a lot of money mismanagement in the company that led to these difficulties there\nWhat ultra low rate ... basically encouraged all these entities to go out and go get some of that cheap money while they can and then a rising rate world is going to make an untenable I see what you're saying they'll use that they have over three thousand stores one thousand of them though are right around lake Ozark it's the weirdest thing is [laughter]\nAnd that's a money laundering joke from Netflix for those few and by the way I'm almost caught up to you we're gonna have to have a chat about that soon but um two episodes behind so hey uh we\nGot another event coming up in November fourteenth so it is exactly one week away ...

million dollars on his receiving all this media attention\nFree media attention all other candidates or not\n\nWe're going to have a special show on life liberty and all of them this Sunday ten pm mine is the last of the shows without reruns on Fox on the weekend before the election on that Sunday\nAnd I'm going to do things a little differently on that show I'm going to uh do a monologue and I'm not going to do it normally but I'm going to do it in this case because it's an extraordinarily important time in our history and I'm also going to have an expert on the program to go through a number of races that are very close and I consider very important\n\nWe're truly battling a very bleak force they very dark force in this country that do not share our values and principles they lecture us while they attack us they tell us to tone it down why they call our president Hitler\n\nAnd there's many big it's among them many like Don limit of CNN\nThe thing he said the other day is a fireball offense or Steve Schmidt on MSNBC another big it\n\nAnd the things he has said\nAnd I've gone through and look these are firing offense is but the executives the corporate executives on the boards of directors\n\nOf these companies Comcast Time Warner and the rest\nThey obviously want this\nThey want a divided country they want the race baiting they want the anti Semitism coming out of the media\n\nThey don't want a United Nation a United Nation they don't want people having civil substantive serious debates\nThey want centralized power\nWith these corporations and these executives believe they can uh they control outcomes in this society\n\nOr we're going to talk more about this is the program goes on but I Want to hit this issue again the birthright citizenship\nYou are hearing people who make absolutely no sense on this issue saying that the president cannot use an executive order to address birthright citizenship again my caviar it is that I Know the courts are going to be hostile to any effort\nTo curb birthright citizenship statutory or by executive order\nBut I hear people say a statue will be stronger first of all they're not going to get a statue because it'll be filibustered in the Senate so it's a non issue the Democrats aren't going to allow it they want birthright citizenship\nSome of the filibuster rule in the Senate there will be no statute the president as aware that\nThe commentators on TV even some conservatives they pretend they're not aware of it but we're all aware of it\nOr what have been done already they said the same people in Congress who refused to build physical barriers on our southern border to protect this country and to enforce immigration laws suddenly they're going to pass a statute\nOutlawing birthright citizenship but why passed a statute if in fact as the laugh says and some of these conservatives say\n'cause they're no not things that birthright citizenship is in the fourteenth amendment which is what Paul Ryan said preposterous\n\nIf that's the case then how is the statute gonna fix statue won't fix it\nBecause they're saying you have to amend the constitution when's the last time we actually amend the constitution the old fashioned way or want it to the old fashioned way it's been a long time why because the left changes the constitution all the time and now when we want to address something that they did\nOutside the constitution now we're told we have to pass a constitutional amendment helps her\nAs we discuss the other day\nAs I discuss this Daniel Horowitz from conservative review discussed with me\n\nBirthright citizenship was not actually implemented in this country into the sixties and seventies the Nineteen sixties and early Nineteen seventies by the bureaucracy\nBy the bureaucracy\n\nIt wasn't in the constitution no court ordered it and the statute was passed so why do we have to amend the constitution or pass this statute while while the better chance in front of the Supreme Court if that's the case we have no chance in front of the Supreme Court\n\nAnd as much as this battle of Kavanaugh was so crucial he's not Clarence Thomas he's not Antonin Scalia and neither is John Roberts\nIt's just what it is\n\nThe president happens to be right about this the president happens to be right about the constitution the president happens to me write about an executive order however it turns out and all of his critics happened to be wrong he knows more than they do\n\nAs Daniel Horowitz put up there on the conservative review today leftist\nConcocted an ingenious game of judicial sir premises him that create say one way rash it for their policy outcomes heads they win tails they win yet the so called conservative legal community chooses to play the game\nNo where is this more evident than in the debate over so called birthright citizenship\nWith a left cherry picks one non binding footnote of a terrible decision misrepresenting another bad decision that violates previous presidents that plane meaning and purpose of the fourteenth amendment sovereignty and the social Compaq\nWalk collectively ignoring enlist I'm interrupted case law indicating the opposite\nOff for the political outcome of giving our sacred birthright to illegal aliens\n\nThe fourteenth amendment representative James F Wilson Republican Iowa the chairman of the house Judiciary Committee back in the Eighteen sixties who helped draft the fourteenth amendment spoke in fat ugly that it was quote\nEstablishments no new right declaring no new principal on quote

so forth\nThese are the forces these are the people we must defeat\nNow we can't right now to feed them in our public schools and college campuses we can't night right now defeat them in Hollywood in Beverly Hills and the entertainment industry we can't right now to feed them in the media the ladies in general we can defeat them at the ballot box\nIt's up to you\nAnd I'm Serious when I say I think about the power we have if we make sure three four five six seven people who we know and who will vote the right way to get out and vote think of what election idle really looked like\n\nIt is in my view particularly in this election you're patriotic duty\nTo take care of business here I really believe that you're patriotic duty this is not just another election\nIf we lose her grave consequences

my district people came home Halloween you want to spend time with your kids enjoy your evening together and mailboxes were filled up with an attack peace where\nThe the mail or one half of it was just a hanger hanger like to put your coat on and one line that said Lee Zeldin plan for women's health care\nAnd it's discussing what we're on the game one and all across the country I'm\nFighting for my daughter's I'm fighting for this country this nation and we got to vote\nThat is incredible absolutely incredible and you know what ... uh the any any notion of civility has gone out the window

audience but all across America to be confronting opposition right after that\nWe had someone who showed up at one of my campaign offices confronted one of my volunteers said that every a supporter of

audience won't ah and that's the country that we're fighting for its only six days we could do this we can keep control of the house we can even pick up a few seats in the Senate and the alternative

do with men and women all over the world who are facing enemies their lives are endangered they've left their comfort of home and their families as you did a some years back\nAll we have to do his boat make sure five or six people who we know of like minded also boat and we will strongly a defeat the other side\nThat's right and and our national security I mean the embassy in Israel moving to Jerusalem the president not just fulfilling his own campaign promise and doing the right thing but filling promises of presidents past withdrawing from the fatally flawed Iran nuclear deal\nWithdrawing from the Paris accords were we were making these commitments on our end Waller country like China was agreeing to actually increase emissions\nMaking your understanding their enemies do not respect\nWeakness they only respect strength we can't be silent not because we want more but because you want to prevent it we have right now a president any national security team behind\nThem that is ensuring that American exceptionalism is nothing to apologize for we are respected again and I love it\nWe have to continue going in the right direction and the president needs people in Congress who are going to support him when he has a backbone standing up to threats to our country that is how we protect ourselves a next generation that's how we protect our freedoms and liberties and I'll tell you as an army reservist\nI Know that if I was ever sent into harm's way I Would be sent to win or not sent that all where we've had conflicts in the past where we send our troops in harm's way and we set them up to fail\nSo I feel good as as a U.S citizen and with with where we are national security as a member of Congress and also someone who I actually just got selected last

[noise] now they've had a little chance to get to catch their breath come back out here and they need to put together deepest than Pascagoula need strength together a couple of first down Monticello\nKirkland shots in at the tail back and we did get work ... tore his ACL Tommy and the first happened\nProbably out for the season first than CNN [noise]\nPanthers Kirkland has the ball and he has running room he's at the thirty ... thirty five forty\nGreat block it to forty five he's down to forty thirty knocked out of bounds their montel Kirkland\nWould not go down and that's what he does when he has green space\nAnd what a great play from Kirkland as he takes it twenty five thirty five forty five forty six yards first down below and bill I Wish I made a recording before the game of another good job of down feel blocking about Charlie miles Kirkland set it up and miles set up the did the block as as well\nCareful not to hold and cardinal went by that block and picked up another thirty yards or so so again great job down feel blocking wide receiver hadn't had a ball thrown his way all night but he has been a very major factor in this game with his downhill blocking the one two punch of Corey Walker and Mattel of Kirkland I mean they're just awesome to watch\nPascagoula not thrown a pass in this game first intended to twenty nine and the handoff goes to liberate the substitute full back\nWho came in after the injury to Hauser and\nWhile fight on the field as one of the panther helmets came flying off from a warrior and a flag fly I don't know if it's all upsetting or what but\nIt takes it takes an effort to pull somebody's helmet off bill that's got to be an injection I saw the whole thing developing ... miles is the path of receiver will slung to the ground and his helmet a ripped off probably frustrating from the previous play when miles did a great job the outfield blocking that's got to at least be a personal ...\nOh my goodness oh they're calling it on both teams uh I don't know about that bill\nMiles as I said I don't play because his helmet game off where it came off the coast of the ... defensive back ripped it off as it\nYeah it takes some effort to get a helmet off goodness first down I'm Sorry second down after all that shakes out yet Pascagoula leading by three\nJust uh just to finish that thought bill excuse me that at the at at the end of the net result that was a a post whistle penalty flags and that's the reason the second down now when there was a flight from\nSecond down in our formation at the twenty nine yard line Kirkland got us down here and now black flies before this map\nAnd they're discussing something Sam's was in the ear of the referee and I'm not sure what the discussion is but he quickly blue is whistle to talk to the referee and the whole crew now in their\nBill was there a flag or was just a whistle blow to for a discussion\nThere was a whistle blower on for a discussion I saw uh the two of them talking so and I don't know what maybe they were talking about the clock whether the clock needs to be running or not and the clock is stopped salad already not now they wind up\nThat was actually a break for good luck\nBecause the ball [noise] yeah they place\nThey were out in the game part and reset the clock so Pascagoula still gets four twenty five second play clock to run down some more time\nMonticello Kirkland the tail back ... leads about three there at the twenty nine of the reveal\nPitch goes to Kirkland around the end he's in the thirties flag flies and he goes out of bounds there some smack talking going on between the two teams holding on July is the call\nAnd I'll Pascagoula needs that they all need to keep it together right here the leading by three and yeah that hold it and going to help\nThat a flag was in the backfield some two or three yards as well bill and as you know in high school level holding as a a spot fell so that's going to be a greater than its attend yard penalty but the march off is going to be\nMore than ten years from the loudest Graham is whether it's happening in the backfield\nSo it'll be ... down from the forty two they've got to get to the twenty so second down and twenty two\nFor ... and Corey Walker getting his helmet on but\nAre going to hold him off for another player's Kirkland is the tail back the ball gulag moving left or right and the ball is on the right hatch\nSecond and twenty two [noise]\nA formation\nMake get up throw it and he's tone it down feel an incomplete\nWas in the hands of torture saying any good to hang on if you watched Ole Miss Alabama\nIn twenty Fifteen it was the same type of play it bounced off the war you're into the hands of towards us at any couldn't hold onto it oh my goodness and that was six he was behind the defense and that's going to bring up a third and twenty ...\nPass it was the elected by the a warrior defensive secondaries sometimes you know when that when that tip comes it's almost like getting thrown a change of all boy I guarantee you talked to Georgia and after the game he'll be the first one to tell you that he probably should have come down with a ball\nAnd what a game changer that would have been what looked like it was going to be an interception that looked like it was going to be a touchdown for Pascagoula\nNeither of which came to fruition so those are the worst part about it as the clock stopped by forty five left and Google is going to have to call to come out\nOf the play waffles down to two bill they had to call that are facing the last game penalty so\nWhat a roller coaster of emotions and the last\nLeft in one minute of game clock [noise]\nOh my goodness I said Walker I don't know who that might have been Kirkland on their own it was ...\nAnd so the ... has first down at the one\nActually it's at the two yard line unbelievable\n\nFor thirty left in the game the ... breaks the huddle its first thing go for the warriors at\nThe two Wally\nTakes the snap goes forward\nFollowing his blockers is down at the one\nOh my goodness heartbreak city\nThey kick it to Pascagoula we can't find the handle at the two yard line one of the speeding credit the ... one of their speedy backs getting down to the field wreaking havoc in Pascagoula gives up the ball\nWell they also have the short feel to cover bell remember they were kicking off in the past ... forty five yard line so not near as long a run as a traditional kickoff\nForty three forty Panthers leave but the ... scores on the one yard touchdown by jade and Wally and just like that\nThe warriors lead for the first time in the game\nThat you took the words out of my mouth bill for the first time tonight Pascagoula trails that game that they have to feel like they've been in command of for most of the night but now here we are three points now with the extra point fending can make this a four point lead for the ...

I mean we were up ... were twenty five seconds left\nAnd somehow the ... credit the ... day battle back and I think they woke up in the second half where we were up twenty nine seven\nAnd a it's hard to to fall much in this game you know it's just a\nIt was it was a it was a typical\nGoing to win the game\nAnd that's what happened that is so cliche but in this in this case so fitting a bill for you to say that or whoever had the ball last\nThree you were joke you know the over Ninety seven or the other recovered the three three drive by the Advil or in the fourth quarter or less than a

this perfectly for the entire country now the sunset and I'll give you an idea of just in the grand scheme of awful where they stand\nOne of their a major endorsements today was the glowing endorsement of Debbie Wasserman Schultz so on the grand scheme of of of sucking they are all the way they're okay they're the people that hold the Baghdad that make the case for Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nSo it is the consider the source thing but I I Want to illustrate some points here\nThis is an excerpt from an article yesterday police union endorses Republican Ron dissent is for governor for years after endorsing Democrat\nRight\nLife from the story a major union for police officers the Florida police benevolent association is endorsing Republican Ron disadvantages for governor four years ago the Florida PBA endorsed the Democratic nominee for governor Charlie Crist\nAnyways a lot of people's Charlie Crist Charlie Crist are literally has been everything politically in in our state if you're not familiar he currently has a Democrat but as a serving now the saint Pete area but uh anyway what's the last time he actually it was a Republican governor and and Florida\nRubio ran him out of the ... what happened anyway I'm continuing and Wednesdays endorsement at the Santa is the PBA president said dissent is\nWould be the kind of governor who would stand up for what he asserted are unfair efforts to malign bullies quote the men and women of law enforcement want to tell for the ... that Iran did say that this has our\nBacks that's why I'm proud to announce that we have his back said the Florida PBA president\nAnd his endorsement of this and this is sorted that police had been treated unfairly in recent years said the quote\nFrom the president of the or the police benevolent association as we've seen in the past few years police have been scrutinized for doing their job and kicked to the curb by special interest groups media\nAnd politicians which have resulted in the rise of law enforcement officers being killed or assaulted and the line of duty he said and the my blood boil boils here but the the whatever you want to refer to this\nPose or\nThat pretends to be an objective journalist I wrote this garbage for the sun ... he ended the article with this he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny of police has resulted in police being killed or assaulted\nI'd call myself down\nA morning show yesterday I think at one point I was actually yelling not had any mothers that their children in the car but you know what this is that big of a deal because if we don't have good cops what happens in this country it's game over its came over\nAnd part of what made me so upset I notice what was going on\nNot long after the whole cap or next thing broke was taking a look and and I was tracking\nViolence towards police officers remember before the whole capital Nick thing even if you had the Dallas Cowboys and they wanted to honor you know the the cops who were murdered the NFL wouldn't let them and all that and I started being more aware of what was happening to police officers in this country and I noticed that there had been escalating violence I actually started a weekly series that I Do here in South\nFlorida that tracks the violence against police officers and here you have someone posing as a journalist who has the audacity to say he didn't offer examples have ... scrutiny of police as a result of the police being killed or assaulted\n[noise]\nWell I got it for you you might suck at what you do might not do any homework might not want to because it would just prove the nonsense narrative you advance but here's what's real\nIn this story remember this is the for the police benevolent association and about politics is they endorsed the Democrat four years ago for governor there endorsing Rhonda saying is the Republican this year\nSo obviously it's because it matters more now right now they fill in the blanks here

share your Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations on the Marco then show just take those straight to the FBI place\nNow I'm right before the break\nMentioned persuading people how to persuade somebody politically or over the course of my career it is the single most common question I have a receipt and the easiest way to tell you how to persuade someone is to tell you who you shouldn't be attempting to persuade\nPeople are closed minded if somebody is genuinely not open to information odds are not going to get anywhere and that's the problem they most\nPeople and this is true conservatives to by the way it's not like this is unique to liberal is there a lot of close minded conservatives to but you've got to be open a new information and you need to identify who those people are in your life\nYou know I mentioned\nThe Kavanaugh polling firm Gallup that start to finish everything that's happened over the past three months everything public sentiment I'm Brett Kavanaugh only shifted by seven points the entire time puts it\nIn other words at most seven percent of this country was even persuadable Brett Kavanaugh\nSo what does that tell you just go to the average person in that opposes your thought process and expect to get some way somewhere now you needed all you're doing is banging your head against the wall and you're going to make yourself on happy\nSo if you want to be persuasive the first thing ...\nThe right people people are open to information not the loudest people who will fight with you politically and the next thing is credibility\nOne of the biggest mistakes that people make just by lack unit because once you give up your credibility why is anybody going to listen to you\nExcept for that reason operate with facts operate with information if you just operate with opinions independent of the facts and the information somebody who is otherwise open to that information\nThey're just going to view you as someone who is highly political train that can communicate or your your emotion rather than principal a because typically what you'll find for those that are truly persuadable uh is that they are analytical\nAnd that they genuinely are inquisitive looking for more information and by the way\nThis surprises a lot of people but I find that common link that millennials are a number of reasons and it starts with the economy\nA lot of folks have given up on the millennial generation which by the way the youngest millennials are I closing in on being legal to drink the youngest one's right oldest one's like thirty five thirty six now\nAnd I have not blame them right along because when was it that they came of age they came of age and the great recession right\nHere they went through the education establishment they were fed a bill of whatever the education establishment feeds them and then they come out and the economy's terrible\nAnd they weren't able to get opportunity and so it made sense to them yeah you know what capitalism this economy doesn't work we need change that Obama probably made sense because hey that was one our teachers told us in here we are and things are working\nThey had never seen a good economy never seen a good economy we finally have it right now is one of the most important window of time\nWe have two really good opportunities to reach
