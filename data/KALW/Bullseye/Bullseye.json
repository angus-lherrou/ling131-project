Wyoming ... on many Mr\nChairman or were you in college or Harris and you're right you're proud German if we cannot be recognized I moved to return if you're coming out of the Kavanaugh hearings both Democrats and Republicans vowed to use the anger the hearings generated to motivate their supporters\nAccording to ... ... there's a pretty good chance that could work but it might do a lot of damage in the process Marcia is a political scientist at Stanford University earlier this year she co wrote a study which found that partisanship is becomes so entrenched in American political life\nThat voters are more likely to cast a ballot against someone may have been in favor of someone they like Marcia ... good morning walk on the day six\nHappened to be here morning is there anyone left in the United states who's getting ready to cast a vote in favor of someone they like rather than against someone may hate\nOh wow I that's a great question I think there are certainly people ah who do believe are very much in their party politics but it does seem as though the majority of people are really being driven by this part of negativity this dislike of the opposing party\nIt's almost like hate boating and and your research has shown that there's a rising tide of a boat but how do you measure people's negative feelings about a candidate\nYeah there is something called a feeling thermometer such a fairly well known to all that we ask people on a survey\nFrom zero to one hundred how do you feel about a candidate or a person or group you know with zero being very negative and one hundred being very positive fifty being andme at points to fifty would be you know I have no feelings with this person whatsoever I'm pretty neutral yeah okay\nAnd what did the viewing thermometers say about Clinton and Trump twenty sixteen\nSo it's really interesting is that the most popular response for people of the opposing party was zero and this isn't even asking about Clinton and Trump this is asking you know if you're a Democrat how do you feel about Republican or you know if you are a Republican how do you feel about Democrats the the most popular answer with zero which is pretty astounding did it used to be higher\nI don't really read simply actually the most popular answer was a\nForty so that was you know sort of mild dislike but it's really shifted over the course of the past decade or two\nDown to zero is a pretty precipitous drop [noise] so what what has happened and what can you tell us when it got so low or what precipitated that\nThey've actually been a pretty well known are well documented trend since the Nineteen eighties aware apart assistants have expressed more disliking more negativity towards the opposing party but it's really accelerated in the past two decades mhm in the two thousand\nBut what about the last election that was a division of time in American politics would change things quite dramatically did\nFour zero it didn't seem to accelerate it it was very similar to the results that we were getting in twenty twelve so it seems as though the reason that the contest was so ... was that part is since tend to really dislike the opposition as opposed to the other way round\nSo now we have all of this anger in politics what do you think its effect is on on democracy has changed politics [noise]\nThere is a big broader concern right about what happens when people are motivated to participate by their hatred and distrust the opposing party or there is this concern of accountability when we have politicians uh you know who supported driven by how negative they are about the opposing party\nWe end up in a system where politicians aren't really trying to propose policies that help their constituents but rather sort of competing for how to bash the opposing party the most\nSo once a politician has written anger to office there's no incentive to broaden their appeal\nYeah in fact the incentive is to just continue to push on this anger and this negativity which in turn creates this sort of self reinforcing cycle where you know politicians that she had a party that million voters more negative and so the voters are more sort of pushing on politician to bash the other party\nAnd it would certainly demand that a certain kind of politician someone who does feel empowered by being hateful would would put themselves forward but what happens if if someone decides to turn the tide of a single positive candidate comes forward do you think that that aberration could reverse the trend\nI mean I Wish I could say that it did but I think there's been a number of attempts right not only at sort of curbing this a tide of negativity but it also\nMay be exploring maybe third party options are moderate options and those haven't really seemed to work out partisanship is a really powerful social identity and people are very much drawn to their tribe\nWhy do you think this was happening now what what's going on in people's lives that make the other side so completely disposable to be hated\nPartisans tends to interact more than ever with\nPeople of their same party so we know for example that inter marriage rates between people over the opposing parties are down we know that there have been some studies on online dating where they a show that people are really not likely to date people have the opposing party\nAnd we also know that in social media people tend to self segregate into sort of groups these sort of echo chambers\nSo in the end all of this sort of results in a very sort of fractured society where Democrats really talking interact with Democrats and Republicans really talk and interact with Republicans\nDo you think the whole idea of why ability as a quality candidate should pull out of it is done\nSo I think that sort of personal traits likeability sort of integrity really matter is when it comes to things like turn outrage so we saw in the twenty sixteen election that democratic turnout in a lot of places that Hillary Clinton really needed to win seem to be lower than a in twenty twelve for Obama\nYou know the real place where these qualities matter is not from turning people who would vote for a Democrat into people who would vote for Republican or vice versa\nBut instead and turning people who would you know maybe stay home because they feel odd satisfied with their choices to actually get them to go out and vote\nThan if you ever going to have been making about brings it in the u._k. and Trump and the U.S and the rise of extremist parties in Western Europe which is that you know if you want you can just call the people who are voting for these movements all kinds of names racists access to hate balls you know for whatever you want in some cases that might be true\nBut the reality is that when a ruling class fundamentally fails to safeguard the interest of a huge portion of the population sooner or later they're going to realize that and they're going to be supportive of whoever is perceived to be on the outside of that system that they hate and threatening to burn it down and I think until we come to grips with that\nAnd start engaging in some self critique going to have a lot more breakfast Trump's in Boston ours in our future\nIt's widely believed that ball so narrow when tomorrow glenview expect the day to be peaceful or do you think there'll be turbulence\n[noise] I think the only way there would be turbulence and that there were a very unexpected result namely the workers' party winning there has been some slight shift toward their workers' party over the last week and it's not impossible but Boston are has already said an advanced that he would regard any\nResult other than him in and the by product of fraud and he urged the armed forces to take action against it so I Would only expect unrest in turbulence in the unlikely event that Boston are losing\nGlenn Greenwald thank you very much

would you explain this rise in the public expression of women's anger over the last month and in particular this past week\nI think what we have here is very clear indication that women are fed up they're tired they're exhausted they're sick of being subjected to this kind of behavior vote that intimate levels but now very clearly an egregiously it's institutional level and so it's not so much that the rage\nIs I'm new to be honest but that it is being acknowledged by women themselves and external eyes in ways that are traditionally a police\nAnd is that what you mean in your subtitle when you talk about the power of women's anger\nYes I mean we didn't qualify that word because of course it can be a powerfully negative force if it's not understood if it's not acknowledge its meaning is not made out of this notion buck likewise it can be a hugely positive force and we need to acknowledge that\nAspect of anger we tend to denigrate anger and associate it with contempt unfair and discuss which we see in Trump's rallies all the time right but anger is also what is behind that compassion and empathy and dry for social justice that were simultaneously saying\nIn the hearings last

will follow that was Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos this week he was talking about his company's decision to raise the minimum wage of its employees in the U.S to Fifteen dollars an hour starting November the company also pledged to lobby the U. S. government for\nFederal minimum wage increase or Amazon has no plans to do the same and Canada though it says it's already paying wages around or above Fifteen\nDollars at most Canadian location Amazon's move with widely lauded by industry watchers and politicians among US Senator Bernie Sanders\nWho had raised the heat on Amazon last month with a bill to subtly titled the stop days act\nFor ... years old today has done is gone only enormously important for Amazon hundreds of thousands of employees it could well be will be shot heard around the world well\nThat being said not everyone is convinced the Amazon needs is to move out of the goodness of its heart this week the company came under fire\nAfter reports that it also plans to phase out employees mostly bonuses and the current stock option program Amazon says its workers total compensation was still increase but my next guest says the biggest winner in Amazon's minimum wage deal might be [noise]\nYou got Amazon itself Louise ... is a staff writer at wired Louise welcome\nToday sex thanks for having me so Jeff Bezos has framed Amazon as a leader for raising the company's minimum wage how much credit does he deserves for this [noise] so he's certainly not\nThe first major retailer to raise wages in recent years target is facing and a Fifteen dollar minimum wage as well that will fully go into effect by twenty twenty and Costco also recently raised its wage to fourteen dollars an hour they're not the first company to raise their minimum wages in recent years and it's kind of an surprising because there's so few people in the U.S\nAnd other places looking for jobs right now since the very tight labor market\nRight and also I mean there's been a lot of people organizing around the issue of raising the minimum minimum wage or looking at a Fifteen dollar minimum wages well correct\n[noise] [noise] yeah I think we should really unpack kind of this Fifteen dollar number because it's not something that Amazon necessarily came to on its own it's a very symbolic numbers since twenty twelve fast food workers and other workers and the retail industry had been\nFighting for Fifteen and it's been this kind of grassroots movement across the country so I think they really chose that number very particularly because it has so much symbolic importance\nNow you also mentioned the timing um why do you think Amazon made the decision to announce the wage increase when it did right at the start of October\nSo there's both a historical reasons and a future is and I think the historical reason is that over the summer and the spring they faced a series of investigative reports that show that working conditions in their warehouses their driver\nUm reports about grueling practice is about you know not having enough break feeling like the work was really hard you know workplace accidents and those reports were coming both of us the u._k. and elsewhere that were workers striking\nI think that's part of the equation and and the other part of the equation is that in the next several months they need to hire you know over a hundred thousand seasonal workers to accommodate the holidays\nRight and and how competitive is that now to find workers to to work during the Christmas season it's really competitive\nThe um you know the unemployment rate here in the U.S just dipped below us four percent for the first time in years you know there's not a lot of people looking for jobs right now\nYeah and I and I think too I mean there's also the news that came I think it was just this week is well known that Jeff Bezos has just overtaken Bill Gates has the world's richest man so how\nMuch is this might also be good PR for Amazon to look like it's a it's a real leader for workers' rights\nI think there's a lot of it I mean I think Amazon kind of is much more public facing company that a lot of these other retail giants they employ less people than Wal Mart but there's still one of the largest employers in the country here in the U. S. and you'll be in play a lot of people in Canada as well\nBut unlike some of these other retailers Jeff Bezos is such a publicly known figure he's a household name Amazon is not only a retailer they're also you know a tech company either an online platform\nAnd I think being the richest person in the world is not doing them any favors and you know it's a very he's a very easy target I you know no one no one knows the CEO of Walmart is right that's not a household name but you know Jeff Bezos has\nYou know grace the covers of magazines you know people know who he is and his workers know who he is and they know how much money he has and I think that really plays into it\nYeah you you mentioned some of the concerns that had been raised about conditions for workers at Amazon soon addition to enhancing the increase to Fifteen dollars an hour did Amazon announced any other new policies to address the issues that workers had been complaining about\nThere was no update about working conditions which\nIs one of the things that organizers are talking about that they still think that they need a union or collective organizing in order to address these other issues right all of this is still in Amazon's control right now they get to choose how much they pay their workers you know while this is a good move and it's going to help them it's not necessarily evidence of the fact that they always listen to what workers want\nTo feel like the other thing that's hanging over this is the question of automation and we know that Amazon has already placing some warehouse workers with robotic systems so how does that that sort of you know increasing and looming threat figure into the company's equation yes I think what investors are\nThinking about right now is how are they going to pay for this pay increase and I promise you that Amazon would have not you know done this unless they really knew how they're going to pay for it and make sure that they know their bottom line is their priority and automation is definitely something they're thinking about the long term\nWant their warehouses have left off right they wanted to be an incredibly you're well oiled system that's mostly automated and I think there definitely thinking about that here you know in the future we're going to have less workers it takes a lot less money to ship goods through Amazon than it did only a couple of years ago because of advances in automation\nBanks who you're hurting my doctor to\nDoctor marry another era is the c._e._o. of a Venezuelan health observatory and a professor

twenty fifty Sharon and Bram announced their final farewell tour before hitting the road they agreed to come by the day six studio\nSharon hands inbred Morrison welcome today sex thank you very much\nI Know your debut album which was also your first Juno nomination one elephant does and I found that was forty years ago at sharing what were you thinking about it at the time did it feel like it was the beginning of a long journey no [laughter]\nIt felt like it was a moment in time we made an album we we decided to make an album together and we went back to singing individually after that we had no idea what they had\nNo ... no business plan or artistic plan no nothing plan just do it hey as Matt nice and continue on during what we were doing\nAnd hasn't felt that with like a different parts of your career did it always feel like you had planned to head or does it always feel like you were just living in the moment as you were going along\nWell it was a very large learning curve you know we had a lot to learn every step of the way because we hadn't done any of the things that lay ahead of us a lot of work and a lot of fun yeah\nWell you know as folk you use the folk music world is very casual kind of world which I like very very much but when you get into public performance it's a whole other thing and you got to learn the ropes yeah\nWell and also you you know some pioneers in the work that you were doing in that you were doing children's use it but also family music that you were actually kind of inventing the kind of music and the kinds of performances in a way\nWe always thought that our audience was not just children as you said it's families too because some people who perform for children\nAnd low and they may hit for a while but the parents pull out their hair and run screaming from the room and we would have none of that we wanted it to be really an ensemble experience for the whole family\nAnd who's tougher kids in the audience for adults in the audience in terms of the\nFans are the kids are very direct [laughter] you know if they don't like what you're doing they let you know but they're also very responsive and parents if they're if they're smart they participate with their children because they're doing it together and they're setting an example\nYou know there's one example years ago I says I have I had just finished I said boy I was a great song I really like though a lot of five year old voice from the back came out I hate it [laughter]\nReally love that [laughter] some amazing well the first album comes out and you think you know we're going to go off into her own things that was fun that was a lark but then came more albums live concerts television ramp how did that then all come out after that first album\nWell it was kind of stuff for our guess after we made the recording and then we did our first concerts at the young people's theater and that's why we've come back after forty years I think the next step after that was our parents at the Vancouver international children's festival and the following spring\nAnd is that was extremely exciting for us and I must say that CBC was a factor in that and in our career because it was really through CBC that people got to know about us so in the spring of Nineteen Seventy nine we went to Vancouver in the new um\nInterest from the public and from people who wanted us to perform for them and that and another record and it all unfolded in that kind of surprising way for us but by and exciting way yeah\nOne of the one of the things as we were actually being one of the concerts and greeting people goodbye shaking hands and saying hello to buy a one of the children said to us okay you can get back in the record now [laughter]\nAnd and speaking speaking of goodbyes now after this extraordinary I'm In a forty year career of recording and touring this is your farewell tour and I'm thinking about the song skin marine because it feels like kind of a perfect goodbye song\nAnd I understand that there may be new lyrics coming for them to make is this true yes indeed\nFirst of all skating rink has always been the perfect but by Don Was saying at\nIt came to us through a cousin of flowers she brought it back and we recorded it and it was been with us for all along\nI didn't even get to sing on it saying them Elvis Sharon segment harmony and I play the ukulele part on the high string guitar they didn't let me sing on it until record or two later [laughter]\nTo prove yourself had had no idea what\nThat song was going to be right and we love it and we never tire of it yeah and we were approached by penguin Random House to do with a skating rink puck and with the help of my daughter who wrote a new introduction to the song and new versus for the song\nAnd the the new words are delightful I'm were thrilled with him and the illustrator is channeling and it will be released in the fall of two thousand and I thought\nThat's already recorded and we're keeping it secret for right now\nNot smell pushing it but my singing it and you're sitting at so if you come to the farewell to our ... the new version of\nOf going to marry my dad also get to sing the parts of skating rinks that they're familiar with the we all your prize no I like that would be like are really are no to hold them bomb or a serious\nSerious serious bummer I'm a share and you'd you'd mentioned that ice skating rink had come through lowest in through her husband and Bram you said that to Lois had come to the group with a different musical background than than you and sharing so what did she\nBroil a shirt and I we're products of the folk music world just lost his background was classical music at the piano\nAnd also Broadway show music and she was kind of a jazz baby in the group and so one of the reasons that our repertoire there's such a mixture with some very hip songs like job that they don't mean the thing of it I got that swing and that sort of thing\nLast brought those to us and we said yeah\nYeah yeah well I think it also speaks to the fact that again you were weaving in these different you know musical traditions and genres and in speaking to also um multi generation audiences chew and holding them on\nTalking about that for the last few years I've said we've had three generations the kids their parents or grandparents who are all involved with us and just a few months ago a woman said to me I'm bringing my great grand children to your concert and I said for\nFor for ... for\nGenerations that's extraordinary to have you

doing yoga we've seen puffin paint classes and inspires creativity for a lot of people\nAnd that that's a lot of business opportunities we heard something about a candidate a sushi bar how does that work\nRight well that's what's happening here there's there's two chefs coming in that or you know professionally trained or no sushi restaurant owners even as they have classes where\nYou will sit and you will you know roll it you know a sushi roll and then you'll roller Kennedy's joined at the same time and obviously you know it's it's sort of funny for the you know the whole month she thing right so you can eat the sushi while you're rolling your than joined afterwards it's funny but you know it's it's it's an attraction for it\nTo separate but related skills\nSo it's all in the fingertips right\nSo if you are starting a bed and breakfast in Canada what what off or would you make to make yourself stand out in the market\nOf I mean I can just say you know based on what we've seen here in in Colorado specifically\nYou know we have places that are booked out almost a year in advance laws that are providing a a full blood bar so you walk into the place and instead of a bunch of alcohol and whiskey bottles there's jars of cannabis and smoking paraphernalia and then you walk into the next room and there's a cannabis yoga class going on\nAre often taken to meet some of these young people who are working at\nSome of the foundations of the crown prince is established arch foundations and other initiatives a group that's trying to develop tourism for instance you know so so that excitement is white infectious but I think you know probably what was required was to take a step back and do a folder accounting of his tenure\nIn the United states there seems to be a kind of deadlock you know they're limited in what they can or will do in response so is this a case of recklessness and inexperience on behalf of the prince or is this somebody who understands exactly how powerful he actually is in terms of real politic\nWell with respect to the disappearance of about ... and we don't know who's responsible obviously they're these signs\nYou know we know that in the past U.S intelligence has picked up conversations um involving Saudi officials talking about a plot they said was directed by the crown prince\nBut we don't know all the facts in this case yet and so you know it's a little hard to say whether this is due to his reckless this or you know some other factor\nIf as a result of what's happening now the west with Ross its approval in some fundamental way does Mohammed bin Salman have other options will he look elsewhere for partnerships and alliances for example or does she lose power does he then become a endangered by by what's happening\nIt's a terrific question I mean what goes on within the Saudi leadership\nUh is very opaque there was a report today that king says men\nAre is displeased with what's happened for instance but you know whether whether that would be\nReplacing Mohammed then says man is very hard to tell and the idea that the west is going to fundamentally alter relationship with Saudi Arabia at this point also seems that um you know possibly farfetched and ... it's a little early to tell whether whether that's on the cards\nCaring for him thank you for talking to us thanks for having me\n... for him is the

get to test video games for a living [noise] and then it quickly realize the pressure that you're under to make sure you are committed to the company in your your\nMom worked long hours and support the team you know when a leader board where uh you know I got third place with a hundred and Eighteen hours in one week and uh I think the person didn't want to have a hundred and twenty four hours\nThat's Canadian video game developer Adam voice these days Adam as CEO of iron galaxies studios but he's still remembers the intense hours he and his coworkers sport in the started his career\nRemember one project I was on where I'm because we're America just sat in a newborn baby and a real stretch where he slept in the office for nine days straight\nAnd I would just bring him close and I mean sure he was fed and his wife would bring um his daughter to visit um there's a bed and then there was a shower at the studio and it was cool we thought it was ... at the time we thought it was like wow do you see how much that person work and they they just wouldn't stop for anything\nOn it was it was she were held in high regard those are the people that you sort of aspire to be\nThat level of extreme overtime is so common in the gaming industry developers have a name for\nThey call it crunch and while Adam believes the crunch problem has gotten better in recent years it hasn't gone away rockstar games is the company behind blockbuster hits like LA Newark and grand theft auto next week they're releasing one of the most hotly anticipated games of twenty teens\nRed Dead redemption to\nAnd according to rock star cofounder Dan house or the team has been working extremely hard to prepare the game for launch\nKing a mention that they have been working hundred hour weeks on while I'm that's more than fourteen hours a day for seven days a week no days off\nHauser later clarified that remark he said that the corps for person writing team were the only ones working those hours and a number of other rock star employees have since back them up on that\nBut industry watchers say the gaming industry still has come to terms with the working conditions that Dr Brendan Sinclair has been following the story closely he's the north American editor for games industry biz I spoke to him on Wednesday [noise]\nSays that crunch is widespread in his industry happens everywhere so why are people so focused about what's happening at rock star\nI think people are focused on rock star because they sort of represent the biggest in the best the games that they make Red Dead redemption in the grand theft auto series are widely loved the last grand theft auto game a is about to sell its hundred million a copy so they are sort of\nThe standard bearer for the triple a big budget blockbuster game development industry but were you surprised to hear that employees a rock star which is obviously ... one of the most successful\nIt is getting ready for lunch I was not surprised at all rock star has a history of will say scuttlebutt around the industry painting them in a pretty negative light about nine or ten years back they released a game called manhunt to which was a initially developed by rock star Vienna\nThey shut down that studio put fifty people out of work had another team of theirs finish off the game ... released it with the credits of votes fifty people omitted from the game and the retail version when the original Red Dead redemption came out\nThere was an open letter called the rock star spouse letter [laughter] a witch accused the studio of mandating twelve hour work days six days a week or the employees would face a disciplinary action\nOr managers were told to uh get people to Russia until the deadline and then\nJust push the deadline back so that they would have been a permanent period of crunch and arbitrarily decide to reduce bonuses or time in lieu\nWhat did the spouses say the effect of all of this work was in on their lives\nThey claim that are just caused incredible mental and physical stress on them and their spouses [noise] the thing is everyone kind of knew there were these issues that rock star but Red Dead redemption the game itself sold millions and millions of copies everyone bought it\nThe rock star acknowledge your own any of the claims are allegations in the letter\nRock star has been consistent about denying or downplaying any of these claims whenever they come up throughout the company's history\nThere's a lot of if some employees didn't feel that they were valued or if some people felt like they were pressured to work hard and that wasn't what we wanted and we want a healthy environment but when you read between the lines of the corporate statements it does become clear that they have a culture\nThat definitely values people putting in those long hours as a matter of passion and dedication to the project\nAnd do you think that that's what ... what do you think that they hear these stories and they say oh people work to the bone to produce this game it's going to be a great game\nThat's something that's changed I think in the last decade or so five or ten years ago I think gamers were actually more likely to hear these stories glorifying and lying eyes and developers I think that was used as a marketing tool\nBut is there a sense that if you if you don't work these hours there was somebody more than willing to take your place and to just step into the traces and do the work themselves\nThere absolutely is these blockbuster game productions can have thousands of people working on them\nAnd they're largely new fresh faced people out of college who don't have family attachments or a ton of obligations\nAnd they can be made to put in the hours and then after a few years of that they burn out they find better pain employment in a in an adjacent field and the average career length in the industry right now I think is a about six years\nBut that sounds like a recipe for exploitation what do you make of the fact that Mr ... at a rock star has said that they have limited to one hundred hour work weeks to the four core people who are writing that game\nI'm very very skeptical of that claim a um we ran a story with a a former rockstar developer who was talking about working on grand theft auto for and said it was it like working seven days a week with a gun to my head Dan how's her statement that rock star put out clarifying us position saying it was just the four\nAnd now he's going after her calling her name\nThat CNN analyst April Ryan responding to President Trump's tweet earlier this week calling Stormy Daniels for space\nRyan is also the White House correspondent for the American urban radio networks and that's a job that she's been doing for more than two decades back to when Bill Clinton was president\nBut in her new book she says her job is changed drastically over the past two years the book is called under fire reporting from the front lines of the Trump White house and she has indeed come under fire at White House press briefings\nIt seems like you're hell bent on trying to make sure that whatever image you want to tell about this White House safe because at the end of the day and let me in the game but you know what you're asking me a question and I'm going to answer which is the president I'm Sorry please stop shaking your head again that happened\nBarely three months into the current president's April Ryan is one of the only black women covering the White House and during the Trump presidency both her race and gender\nHave become part of the story and so is she in fact she's asked questions that have made national news here's one from February of last year this is the very first question April Ryan asked President Trump\nUntil he went to include the Congressional Black caucus and the congressional while I Would tell you what do you want to set up the meeting and you want to set up to a meeting no no no but I set up I Know some of them but I'm sure that's set up a meeting I Would love to meet with a Black Hawk is\nApril Ryan author of under fire your morning walk into the program\nGood morning thank you for having me\nThank you for being with us we just heard the first question that you asked of the president a month into his job why do you think Mr Trump asked you if\nYou were friends with the Congressional Black caucus\nAnd ... and you need to really read the book to understand what am I answer but let me let me think that a lot of people were thinking it was racial and may have been tennis racially but I looked at it more and then you didn't weigh in here because I just gotten into a fight went on in front of\nYou to be a very good friend of mine right is it about two weeks prior to and she was in his ear I'm sure\nMurray point which is not true I'm Sonia next question [laughter]\nThere's I've watched to ask you ... but all move on to the next question is why yet\n'cause she thought I'm going to say this to you and I and I'm going to end it on that we used to be friends very close right but once I became\nThe enemy of Donald Trump I was hurt in any she wanted to prove so for a few pieces that silver she wanted to throw a cut her friends head off and put it on a platter evidence Donald Trump\nAnd that's fine for her but it wasn't fine for me I Wish him well but as far as our relationship it's over I can forgive but I don't forget I Believe in redemption that she says for her to walk on one side of the street and not be on the other\nIn addition to calling the media the enemy of the American people\nThis president also singles reporters for criticism in and you believe that he has singled view out for your race your job [laughter]\nYou don't think oh most definitely you have when they don't like someone to go after them um you know not it was almost ... who was the president did it with Sean Spicer did it with Sarah Huckabee and do I need to go on\nOn the way they've attacked me and a lot on me and and and put a comment on my head they don't like me but I don't care I was there before they got there\nBut the fun out there when they're gone but when when they do this to you though it makes you part of the story and I know that you're not comfortable with that\nI'm not comfortable with that at all um I've been doing this job for Twenty one year and typically reporters just kind of fade into the background we observe and watch what's going on but I must be doing my out well for them to be that upset about me um\nYou know I don't I don't know why but not you know why and I'm I'm not going to play that game I Do know why I'm you know they perceive me not as their base\nIn my book the first chapter I I I think it's Nineteen and talk about on business I Know in order to unify people you have to find a common enemy I'm One of the most common enemy they found\nBut when he asked\nYou the Congressional Black caucus question you you said in the book that you thought that maybe you should quit\nOh ... yeah it was it was a combination of things it was on all those the fight that was ugly\nThan it was that and then that was Sean I said but I sat can't because I'm not coming out the am I going to be it was expanding but they that's all they wanted me to do they want me to quit and I no no no no no I Will ask questions and a lot of people don't get here\nAnd there will question they use their real answers\nHere's one of the questions that you asked the president that strikes me a rush to be the most provocative but you about this is from January and this year let's listen to this I Know which one okay here it is\nSo when Martin Luther King Day US President Trump's views are racist why did you feel that you had asked that question of the president on that day\nSome real questions you do you remember the timing of that do you remember what was happening around that\nThis was after the president asked the question about why America's accepting immigrants from countries that are not like way way\nThat's right people came out of that meeting federal lawmakers wound up coming out of that meeting saying oh my God you're pregnant called brown and black nation as a whole country\nAnd then just before that we had Charlottesville this for that and we had started the day that Johnson who was one of the soldiers who died ... um and it was a big back and forth about\n[laughter] you know that's been a lot of racial overtones in the White House and then I'll take the money\nOnly time in that moment with the backdrop of ... I was going to be around the president\nMany leaders not just black leaders were a lot of people say he's a racist you got to be careful how you label someone 'cause that's the six so I called the N. double ACP the night before and said what is the definition of racist and they said the definition of all races is simple it's the intersection or the meeting\nOf power and prejudice\nAnd so simple so I asked him Mr President are you a racist because people were saying and that question late in the air so much so that by Sunday night Monday morning because of the holiday weekend\nHe had to answer ... still they're still smarter about that question\nBecause you know ... ... ... ... the number of White House press make things right now you\nSound like a huge disaster [laughter] the number acts like a number of\nWhite House press briefings at an all time low and it it seems to me that they've been able to sideline the press corps from doing their job but they've been successful\nThat like it's about access it's about access to the principal and information in the late ... over ... ... when you suppress the ... when you press the press it there and begins a dictatorship\nI I don't know what you call this this is not democracy no checks and balances and now we're has died we demean we're told that we're the enemy we're told that we are the opposition party and it's to make people not believe us because we're telling a quest for truth and they don't like it\nAt the end of your book you say that that your journalism is now your form of protest but if you're taking a form of protesters that blur the lines of objective journalism and hours\nAnd let me tell you how I protest by doing my job\nI'm protesting by staying you're not going to push me away I tell the story the way it's in front of me and I'm fiercely trying to tell the story it accurately as I said my protest is staying in that job because you want me Don nope\n[noise] in the book you say when we administration decided that they wanted to make a target other view when Sean Spicer made an example of you that it hurt your children\nTry to make an example out of me which he now he's gone by going on\nBut well you said at the time though that this was hard on your kids at school\nIt was their collateral damage with all of this stuff\nIs ... I mean my kids and the greatness of the Internet and technology is that you get things in a moment's notice\nI'm sitting in that briefing wherever I guess the headlines flash while she and my oldest daughter's in current events class on a computer and she text messages me mommy you okay I said I'm great I knew something was going on\nSo that's the downfall of everything you don't want your kids comedy sci fi okay you're supposed to be calling them to say are you okay but you know I'm Shaun as a parent to and now Sean and had to reap the rewards if you will of his behavior at that podium\nDo you believe with Misha administration has done you'll still be in the White House press corps\nYou know what I've covered for presidents now Twenty one years\nI Would love to cover on I'm fifty one [laughter] we'll see what I have in me but I'm not going to stay for another one who knows I mean who knows who knows I could I could wind up being a press secretary for president who knows I don't know um\nBut right now I Love my job and I'm there I'm not planning on going anywhere I'm not planning on going anywhere right now unless you know something", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bullseye",

whether it's legal in Canada or not it's a bad idea\nAnd as you may have heard once or twice a day for months on October seventeenth marijuana will be legal right across the country just for more sweet spot for Robert rosy robot\nThe arrival of legal pot is bittersweet\nIn Canada Rosie is famous for his drug convictions were not being so most you know given the number of convictions in the late ... cents infamous is absolutely the better word or whether there's no money in the infamous so you know even after legalization there will be no money in in the\nRose you grew up in Belleville, Ontario and then the sixties and seventies he was part of the equally infamous ... college in Toronto it was a student run\nDiverse Rosie loves everything about it he was first introduced to drugs when he was Fifteen by the time you get to rush Dale drugs were part of his life and he wasn't just consuming he was supplying his first major conviction came in Nineteen Seventy seven\nWell let's see the first time was a ton of hash at the airport and I got fourteen years and appealed it down to nine the second a conviction was uh was sixteen thousand pounds of how she's five hundred pounds of oil and a bunch of ties\nBack then rosy had Neil Young and writer Norman Mailer stepping up to his defense they were still within eight years later when rosy received the sentence that made Canadian history\nIn Nineteen eighty five I was convicted of importation and conspiracy of traffic conspiracy import and I never has a sandwich are always conspiracy\nThe big net and um I was sentenced to Twenty years they ask for life and the judge said no I don't want to give them twenty of he was giving me a break\nIt was the longest sentence ever given in Canada for dealing so called soft drugs and it wasn't the end for Rosie\nI peeled back got a new trial and then I got Seventeen and then I got another uh an Eighteen consecutive for talking about buying some marijuana saw altogether I was sentenced\nTo sixty nine years for cannabis in Canada and all those sixty nine years how much did rosy surf Twenty years [noise] three or four months\n[noise] what are the reasons judges or top and

reasonable to think what we date imminent Rosie would be celebrate but he's not for one thing some of the people who fought to put ... users dealers in jail are now part of the newly legalized industry\nJulian ... is the former commissioner of the Ontario provincial police he's also a former MP and a member of Stephen Harper his cabinet key along with former MP Gary good year\nOr on the board of a leafy a new medical cannabis provider and they aren't the only former police officers or politicians investing in the industry\nWhile the hypocrisy of the police officers and and the MPs being involved is just a just throws me off\nReally really throws me off because I don't understand\nThey I don't know how they can have the guts to say [laughter] talk to press the being\nStating that yeah we did that but that was that now we're [noise]\nWe're now we're doing a desk and uh and uh we're enjoying the work and we're going to make some money yes\nThat's what we're doing it for\nAnother thing that bugs Rosie is that he can't invest in the industry because of his past criminal convictions\nI'm not actually into the money part of it but why can I participate I have things to bring to the table and soda is a lot of other people which I Would bring along with me\nBecause I wouldn't want it to work [noise] I mean I have a thing in my head what I what I Would like to do

world too\nIt's not just that he's shut out of the industry the federal government has yet to make a decision about pardons an amnesty for people with previous pot convictions that means that in addition to not being able to invest\nBecause his convictions still show on his record\nI have I have three children\nIn in in United States I have seven grandchildren I have three great grandchildren they have to come up you see me I'm an undesirable\nSo for Rosie the arrival of legal pot doesn't do anything to settle the question what role he played in the story including serving time amongst murderers and sexual abusers\nWas a a a preserve the war on drugs you know current ah because I didn't see me as a criminal ... I was doing time are always ... years not putting them down or anything but there was this ...

maybe you should take your celebrities like you take your friends you know somebody's really well informed than maybe their opinion should matter but I think more importantly than that\nYou should be the one doing the research you shouldn't necessarily just be listening to what a celebrity says you shouldn't just be listening to what a politician says you should be seeking out the facts and really make decisions on your own [noise]\nMark Harvey is the graduate director at the University of St Mary in Kansas and he's the author of celebrity influence in\nWe have to take a short break coming up

not a dummy if you Miss USA word now and again which begs the question how many English words and phrases are we all screwing up all the time if you've ever said something you weren't definitively short was right well\nYou might want to hear from my next guest Ross and Kathy Patrick or the brother and sister duo behind the book that doesn't mean what you think it means\nA guy do a hundred and fifty of the most commonly misused words and phrases in the English language and they are with me now caffeine Rosh ... walking back today say\nGood morning hey coffee I snuck or is it sneak a couple of grammar Michigan instrument that preamble did you catch them\nWell and how could we not right begs the question\nThat many like grunting mighty how many times have\nYou have you looked up the Miss USA begs the question\nIt's funny that's one that I always had used wrong I thought begs the question meant you know raised the question which doesn't actually mean that it was it\nWhat what can we can you explain it to us it's hard actually\nIt's um a logic term and it means that you're trying to prove something based on a premise that needs to be proved itself right so it's it's it's ... it's faulty the reasoning behind it but people as an example of it we have in the book is\nFrench films are the best because they make films that are in France that begs the question because you're assuming something and then you're not supporting it\nRight so the assumption is that they make films better in France and we don't know why you think back so the question is how do you know that\nExactly right so it does not mean raises the question but that's how I Would say Ninety nine by nine percent of the time\nThat I saw you over here so Ross is there anything else in my introductory flunk me for you bet definitively right I was misused okay do one thing that interested\nThose you used Peru's which I I always used wrong we wrote the book okay I always assumed cruise meant kinda skim yes it does it mean to go ... and here comes a problem with language all the time\nIf I just said I Peru's your memo new I mean I looked at a casually or do I mean I thoroughly studied it right and this is what to some degree it's\nIt's not just ... to look at words and try to use them carefully laws have some real consequences right demeaning to be almost a ...\nPerfect human dictionaries yourselves or are there out we're\nGod no you you were off on a Ninety nine percent of the partners to get a big strong but what about you Ross weren't weren't trips you up\nUm besides per well this one I'm In my defense Obama used raw okay non plus I bought at one point during the elections that he was really pleased that his kids were non plus about everything a non plus means\nBut we'll dirt rise right frightened stop it you can't say anything more huh I previously sort of assumed that meant kind of like calm cool and collected yes and interestingly enough when Obama said non plus incorrectly a whole bunch of people came on line and so it isn't it wonderful to have a president who uses correct word\nRight [laughter] I don't think Casey did let the honestly I was a lot better than someone else [laughter] your coffee\nAnother word from the book that really got me was pristine can you use that one correctly for me was that\nWe went down I to be honest with you I did not know what it meant until I wrote that section and that was one that I had written because I thought Christine ... you know clean perfect like you go like this like pristine bathroom and you ... it it doesn't it technically means original it like in in its original state so you can have a pristine swamp that\nThat week sin is covered in like [noise]\nYou know write something because it's untouched it's like ... although this is an example of a word that has been used so often to me the way I thought that we as like\nYou know ... ... it does now mean appearance spotless I might only D says it's considered ignorant by educated speakers but I Will cop to being one of those ignorant speakers because I still use pristine to mean you know clean as everybody else does yeah and and\nUnlike the misuse of the word non plus which is the complete opposite of what the word is intended to mean in the case of ... gonna mistake what you're saying\nNo no I and I think that's a really interesting point that you've just written the real issue is Ross alluded to earlier alluded not eluded\n[laughter] is that we we it's it's good to use words to me and exactly what they mean to be able to communicate with no issue with communication if if you're not going to miss understood I think we can just cut everybody a little flat\nRight okay so here's former FBI Director James Comey he'd because he's one of the people that you have singled out for grammar mistakes and this is a clip of coal me speaking to the Senate Judiciary committee listen to this\nIt makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have some effect on the election but honestly\nIt wouldn't change the decision so ... what they call me get wrong I'll say hey this is a classic classic error particularly found in New York City so you're nauseous means causing Natasha what he should have said is it makes me nauseated\nThat means feeling sick to your stomach there's a distinction there but in New York you would actually say ... you would\nNot nearly as I said this is this\nHow did it for noxious work that I use it for me in a sense okay um\nI don't I I I I can go now and then his language doesn't make any reviewing speaking it is the\nProblem\nHere that the English language has so many rules and so many words that sound alike or similar enough that that I mean\nI got I got one I got one okay okay the pristine swap mhm even though it's caused us older nauseated me right okay um was beautiful beautiful\n[laughter] [laughter] [laughter]", "show_name": "Bullseye", "year": "2018", "city": "San
