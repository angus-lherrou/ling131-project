[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nIt's time now to practice some very useful praises I saved them first you repeat I remembered and together that's but yeah\nThis is radio lab today translation\nIt's time to begin\nWe'll have five experiments in translation trench creation\nLesson number one the best words by my mother got cut off the people who remember you know you try [noise]\nHi there Hi that Doug yes oh boy so uh this episode was inspired by a guy named Doug\nDoug Hoffman a professor of cognitive science Indiana University Bloomington\nUh you may know him as the guy who wrote ... Bach which is a a hugely influential book in certain circles are published in Nineteen eighty nine we actually got interested in in a next our producer levy\nBecause of an obsession of his which predates that sixteen I was sixteen year Nineteen sixty one\nI was taking a French literature class from one day I came across this poem a tiny little about\nThe kind of sat right in the middle of the page\nLike a long\nStint sausage beautiful often you know three syllables per line it was super skinny and twenty eight lines long and mom and it was delightful it was very cute and funny I fell in love with a poem immediately and memorize did I still not by heart\nDiplomas basically a get well card was written by this guy ... who was a poet nearly Fifteen hundred at the court of queen\nAnd he wrote a pound for this queens daughter she was seven or eight and he'd gotten sick flu or something and this problem we supposed to cheer her up and it was very sweet could you said in France let's just here at first yeah okay it's called a ... ...\nOh so to speak accumulate they affect young lady\nMommy none of us who doesn't look boom through Lucy ... ... ... ... to beat them all ... to\n... see onto the top ... to ... to ... to ... about it the hard on them for ... to dwell on the boat and I'm young\nI'm like I didn't have gotten so many checks and you were I was really [laughter] exactly\nThe opposite I was I was [laughter] I Wish [noise]\nOkay so you read suppose files it away deep in the corner of his mind that's what about Twenty years he publishes his first [noise]\nThey become very popular and the publisher decides to have it\nTranslates into a number of languages including French in that process which took years it put me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and\nAll of a sudden one day that home popped into his mind and I said there is a challenge what is it what is the challenge okay what I meant was to set we here's the thing he says he got this problem mommy\nNone of the new loopholes and if you just focus on the words and basically just the guy talking to a younger girl saying hello my dear I'm Sorry you're sick being sick like prison ... piece of I ... wish you to open your doors get out into the world ... get out of bed\nEat some jam fee too so you don't look so pale out and you lose your lumps shaped bailed out or you know it's sort of like get better here's your good health drifted want something done I mean young\nBut just saying those words in English misses the whole spirit of the ...\nThe tone the light hearted in us and and this is key for Doug ... also known as the bones form it's wonderfully catchy little sausage shape when the page the fact that the lines rhyme you know\nA B. B. C. C. D. D. and\nUh the first line mom union is identical to the last lying I mean young to sort of has the feel of a ... it has the poets name in the middle of the poem loan to Vermont oh and I did I say three syllables per low you didn't ya ya or three syllables per line I mean that's crucial and then also twenty eight lines long\nSo all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me\nSo Doug sat down and got to work and a quickly became embroiled in the question of like how do you translate this come along the way\nEven began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines of the problem for example vast fee on to the top ... used to like this line that basically says don't wallow in bed I had a lot of\nPossibilities and I'll just read you the a little diagonal display here\nInstead of hurting blood in bed instead of burping in your bed instead of bursting out in instead of lurking in your instead of hurtling out of instead of hurting their instead of squirming in your head of slurping slop in in the dead of burning up in bed instead of turning blue in bed\nOn and on and I came up with you want me to read my ... my sweet dear I send cheer all the best\nYou're forced to rest is like jail so don't AOL very long just get strong go outside take a ride do it quick stay not sick band you're a ... for my sake\nButtered bread while in bed makes a mess so unless you would choose that bad news I suggest that you'd best sooner rise so your eyes will not glaze Douglas praise health being near my sweet dear\nAnd I I like the ones on jam became bread though the bread and butter\nButter ... yeah well I just figure jam and jelly they are words but the words represent concept and the concept to have a kind of a halo around them I mean when you talk about jelly your implicitly talking about bread and things that you spread it on ...\nLike just stick their fingers and jelly no bread needed OK okay fair enough\nFeeling like he hadn't quite nailed it Doug sent them home to one of the guys that translated his first book into French yeah a guy named oddly enough Bob French\n[laughter] and I said hey Bob can you do it and a Bob Said well give it a try\nFairest friend let me send my embrace quit this place it's dark\nHalls and bank\nIn soft still regain health dress and fleet off with ... Clement who calls from\nVery different in tone and really quite marvelous\nYou got the pale face in there you got to a gym Clements name in the middle but at the same time it didn't have the lightness the tone is much more ancient which you could argue well it's an ancient pounds but\nDoug said no no there's a bigger problem was thirty lines long so extra long and when he ate was a sacrosanct number for this just two lines though no no no no no claim on my whole wrote a three syllable poem twenty eight lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was\nA form rather than a a\nThan a message that is the message was get well\nWhich is pretty simple but Doug would argue it was a form that's what made the things funny charming until the question for him was who could get the feel but nailed it for him he ended up sending the pull him out to like sixty people\nDoctoral students who my sweet treat one regard oh too hard to your colleagues friends chicken D.

P. C. A. C. A. G. in other words whatever it was it was reading the DNA and sell maybe it was reading it in triple not pairs because if you have pets of three or rather than to the game I figured well that give mathematically would give you more possibilities and that might put you on a path\nTo making all those hundreds of thousands of protein ...\nNow this was just a guess but shortly after the double helix duo Watson and Crick\nAnd a group of other scientists worked at all out they they figured out how you get from physically get from DNA into proteins\nYou're so works sort of inside the cell the DNA is sitting there [noise]\nOld coiled up a set of molecules come along at ...

I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't end or in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode a contains some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no don't don't see that we have to say that we don't we ask you and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping so we must but we ... it is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with the you may want to make and went on it yeah anyway\nThe story comes to us from producers Simon\nHappier so let's start can we start in two thousand eight sure about what the song yes please check [laughter]\n\nSo uh December twenty seventh a sunny Saturday morning ah this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of\nYeah [laughter] it was a humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies\nThat right there are you guys\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering Stephanie newer\nAnd what what are you calling now that I'm supposed to their same\nNurse in as in like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies\nAnd they would receive a warning from Facebook for uploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this [noise] they want to face but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [laughter]\n\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this small\nPeaceful protest will turn out to be this morning a face off on Facebook\nOne of the opening shot Facebook triggered a hornet's nest in what would become a loud but to face with rockets\nAnd global\nBat embattled Facebook CEOs boxer day playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches [noise]\nBut but rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of them free speech [noise]\nViolence against Rohingya Muslims what we can say in what we can't say that again by this photograph what we can\nSee and what we can see it led Mueller right kids in front of me\nOn the Internet\n\nMr sacrifice I got to\nYou some jak laid prioritize or censor ...\nCongresswoman we don't think about what we're doing is censoring speech\nBut there are types of what what what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook what you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook to digital documented it's about fifty pages if you've printed off\nAnd diet in bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the globe which made me wonder like\nWhat are these rules how were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test ... so uh let's start back a on that morning and two thousand in the morning that you could argue started at all [laughter]\n'cause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was a big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to\nSwitch and just read so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when I'm One of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote that extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought into read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so at the\nTime when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind this isn't nearly two thousand seismic\nChanges this week and the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path and ice space dot com is now the most visited website in the U.S Facebook had\nIn the neighborhood of ten million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of confidence like ... ...\nAnd Peter and things that come up onto their screen flagged her to Facebook and\nOn Lake meaning like Iowa user saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards\nThis is Kate ... she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing and and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of\nContent and then [noise] that content along with an alert\nWould would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen\nMost of what you were saying was either naked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason\nWhy someone had reported because it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying\nAnd every time something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at that computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it down and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou turn your ... leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do with this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you where are you both wouldn't known you'd Google some things\nThat really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard uh what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards that they at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry that that the guidelines were really one page long there are one huge long\nAnd basically all this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad take it down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until [laughter]\nPrize Fight for the lights that replicating\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie me are those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group\nWho had organized ironically enough through Facebook so to coincide with the live protest they just ... you know typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse in two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nAnd then change their status\nTo the title of our group a Facebook breastfeeding is not a team and they caught on social networking website is under\nFire for it and how long the motives of women right leading their children to twelve thousand members participated and the media requests started pouring in a bad thing is not I didn't hundreds of interviews for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine in New York Times Washington\nPost so Internet users resisting Dr phil it was a media storm and\nEventually perhaps as a result of our group in our efforts Facebook was forced to get much more specific about their rules so\nFor example by then nudity was already not a lot on the site but they had no definition for nudity they just said no nudity and so the site integrity team that those twelve people at the time they they realized they had to start spelling out exactly what they meant\nPrecisely all of these people at Facebook were in charge of trying to define nudity\nSo I mean yeah the first cut out it was visible male and female

admit that they worked for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAct for about ... watch\nBlind several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what

story about Facebook and free speech and we just want her mind you guys are there there's you're just tuning in this episode does contain some graphic content some strong language which must in order for us to make a point but but we do warn you that you're you if you don't want to hear this kind of thing on their kids in the room mate would fit it out yeah you'll get back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once they're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe and ways that are fair and consistent\nAnd I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty Thirteen\nStrike and Carlin Rhonda Maryland but sorry but if I had to make it up thank you I mean how can break we add some breaking news uh otherwise I wouldn't cut you off so abruptly Carla\nMonday the fifteenth twenty Thirteen just before three in the afternoon [noise]\nTo pressure cooker bombs [noise]\nThrough the crowd near the finish line Boston there [noise]\nYou have sort of dust begins to settle\nPeople are springing into action\nOr just one man in a cowboy hat sees a spectator who who's been injured fix him up throws them in a wheelchair\nAnd as they are pushing him through this sort of ash cloud ah there's a photographer there and he snaps is [noise]\nAnd the photo shows the runner and the cowboy hat and these two other people pushing this man who are\nHis face is Ashton from all the debris and one of his legs is completely blown off and the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then ... skin and muscle and tendons it's it's horrific\n... meanwhile\nCBS studio on the other side of the country is fine I remember snippets of the day [noise]\nFacebook employees were clustering around several deaths staring at the computer screens watching the news ...\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so I have\nMemories of of watching some of the coverage chilling new images just release of the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo published\nOn line and it wasn't long after that\nSomeone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the orders event here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly voters going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this image is spreading like wildfire across their platform it appears to be way outside the rule they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like\nShould we allow it or should they take it down according to the rules in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone and so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yup however have to ... says\nIs worthy\nEssentially just photos being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately received\nPushback while I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and\nThere are no exceptions there is either either mistakes were improvements we made the guidelines for moments like this ... the other side shoots\nBack oh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe is publishing this all over the place and we're taking a downed like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow how do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of\nThe stuff van other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down but before they can pull the lever\nWord starts making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources and executive ... sent down in order\nWe were essentially told make the exception\n...\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this down\nYes so um yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook has just become a publisher where would they don't think maybe they have but they've made a news judgment\nAnd just willy nilly they've become a news organization\nYeah ... and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook is sort of collective scrapbook for us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want or yeah it is it now in news organization friends' parents\nDo you get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question that kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook is\nAnd this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this is a I view us as a tech company\nBecause the primary thing that we do is build technology and I said you're responsible for your content which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built product basically\n... and others that the company or arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the\nWell Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where are they can't be held liable\nFor much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations however where were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside what ... what really strikes me about all of this\nIs is here you have a company that really uh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective is possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound\nThan what people find interesting or important what what people find newsworthy ... he'll give and I'll give you know give you a great example of this uh\nAnd this video starts being circulated out of northern Mexico\nAnd it's a video of a of a woman being grabbed and forced onto her knees in front of a camera and then a man with his face covered\nGrabs her head pulled her head back and slices her head off right in front of the camera and this video starts being spread\nI Can't count how many times like just reading my Twitter feed I've been like you know like\nOne person who came across this video or at least dozens of others like it was Shannon young\nMy name is Shannon young I Am a freelance radio reporter I've been living here in Mexico for for many years now and\nThere'll be is covering the drug war in doing so years back she noticed this strange phenomena\nIt first caught my attention and early two thousand ten should be checking social media you

please be forewarned\nWay you're [noise]\nYou're listening to radio lab\nRadio from WNYC [noise]\nHey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today\nWe're going to start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times he's a guy we've had on the show before ... say something high [laughter]\n[laughter] okay I think it's good All right\nWhere we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started again what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and killed when that became a national\nThere was a lot of belly a king and the press how many people do we see killed in the United states about ... each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire me right Jason Harris than to budge on her animals become sort of a national story [noise]\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trend in one way or the other or police shooting more black people and white people just very simply yeah the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies\nDon't for the most part and I said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police department itself\nIn the police department it does on the local level however uh it doesn't exist in any accurate\nTo tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody now there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete\nYou know because most of those you know like the guardian has an online database most of them rely on media reports so the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public\nConsciousness that is right to ban in his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nBrazil burst study had Florida the third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records lawsuit\nLegally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places ... Ben sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nI think three hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five years worth of paper\nAny paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting not for this involves a year of work how many police departments is getting lawyers involved as as a massive thing that evolved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThink Sir Ben put together\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of show back\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here to check it out yeah\nHow many how many documents you think you have sitting on this stuff is probably five thousand pages so I have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me six feet tall we've\nGot um broken down by county but you can see uh\n[noise] so a or B bay county\nBook or a thon boys and beach uh all the way through the alphabet\n... basically just have a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across the entire desk\nBut the combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings the represent\nEight hundred and thirty one shootings\nI Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and the and in six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise]\nSo we did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team didn't involve a an armed suspect was or chase\nAll the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those bullets than we thought looked like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and um [noise]\nYou know hopefully draw some conclusions lessens some solutions didn't\nAll went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there at last link to it from my website radiolab dot org highly recommend hopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency\nTo keep track of this stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they ... about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category\nAnd he says you know what you see like on the most basic level a are that about a third of the\nQuote mentally unstable and this is a case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence in the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds anytime of the shooting and in that category been\nSays they found a surprising number of cases the whole suicide by cops which is where somebody who is usually a mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally\nPerson is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door and raises a weapon toward a the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon\nSo it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm gonna make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know\nThey're the news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto frontline and dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question\nWhat do the numbers say about race I think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising\nThat a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nAnd that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nAnd your what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nDoesn't tell us much right now but the breakdown between the ... for their same demographics and its without they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest\nYou know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent you know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty and numbers themselves don't really get you very\nFar percent six kind of ... he says one percent or more years just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what gets me is like the I don't know\nIt's back to where we were in why we want to start this\nMethane gas fields just moved by the single case maybe the cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is [noise]\nYou know I mean they're all written in this uh\nSupplement investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler received a call on this as the Cato Darryl police speak Fowler approached department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles\nArmed with a knife and apartment to fight it out every one of these every report is at least one human life someone was either you know more often than not gravely injured or killed [noise]\nUh so we have on this table that the investigation but death [noise]\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one\nPeople who [noise]\nSo we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay times as we grabbed a couple of soldiers right off the Montgomery giant boulders to act to follow wherever those stories might lead\nMatt guilty and Ben traveled around Florida and a few different occasions talking to the people behind those statistics you heard and today we're going to bring you one\nOf those stories and if you're interested after this episode you can head to our website radiolab dot org and you can hear part two of the series where we follow a totally different story than the one we're going to tell you about today but I'm\nOr so after the event ended at the community center crystal took a bunch of Mondale gotten their cars and drove over to this like little gem shop\nJust like you guys do this after every every event or you know for no one knows inland and has been telling everyone about them\nThis de ... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nBut no we didn't know anything about this but they must be part of the different types of learning to part of just hoping right you're right we all just simply trying to find our way is a crystal gathered\nLike probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I Hope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the larger staged a certain point 'cause it was talking to these two women and she's had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like\nThen I open my windows and I just knew when I go to our house she says it's age comes her down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christel House [noise]\nMid sized one story house into it and and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin were in the kitchen\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them into their own stories these stories\nHeather [noise] it's like they just they just have fun\n\nIn the night before they'd all gone out dancing together in\nThe summer when a fire [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton we start to stay over eight inches of houses\nWith me in each other bad on the couch you know a air mattresses it becomes like a huge sleep over and the rest of the corn asleep for up talking you know getting to know each other you know or the vice shows results like therapy for\nVicki slept in the past but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really stuck with me I Believe or add\nMarlon promise to\nWin crystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we're basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass so we usually the video that's\nMom's house probably over like right\nAnd then the police caught attained behind them was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here\n[noise]\nAnd that's why we call the execution of vegetables are 'cause the guard and wants to hear and\nWing and all that\nBut I I Am saying 'cause I'm when a when you know when they took him away in released they sit down and take us that we came back here it's all you can smell what's going on and so now like when you have any like is it not as it's not as bad now but just the association for when I'm playing onions and you get that smell like it just you get those flat ... in your\nToday and it brings you right back here mhm\nAnd the twelve is just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\n\nReal science or ... some of the other one that started to cry\n\n\nAnd then you don't want me to a Texan yeah my find the best model what about falling to me a couple of women handed me the phone\n\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and\nThey just stared at the camera\nWith this sort of straight face alright three two one\nThree two one [noise]\nThen we all started walking back to the cars [noise]\nWith us because I Know [noise]\nIt was also very ... we saw that once a week\nAnd I threw o'clock in the morning [noise]\nWhat I remember the and I used to tell you how do you live\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\n\nTo go there I saw\nYeah that was for how could you not\nIt ain't no way you like you want to go take a chair\nSit there yeah\nAnd it's crazy because like if a if a cemetery like a little bit further out\nAnd it's crazy you know that is like a certain time every\nDay and it's just little white man we share\nEverything like that I like he literally I think he does he like go have lunch with every day\nI mean I don't know if you if it's a way out of going on in all of that and it's a little white guy they always say not\nBe taking ...

Kennedy Airport course rural place wants to get away you know\nI ended up there with our producer Alan Horn we hadn't actually meant to come to the guy that we had been interviewing\nDaughter for a large it'd be portrayed by demeanor and the rest of your heart emotional and right in the middle of the interview he'd gotten a call alert all that he had to run or that's where you are crap we have

start\nStepping forward to the computer here the loading image is they have a best\nWay to reach the ...\nA gallon again that was so fast\nAll knew what\nHis promise I'll tell you but let me just keep going\nTo explain Paul ... studies faces the human said he's probably studied the face more than anyone\nUp until my work that was person Seventy eight we didn't really know how many expressions of face could make and there was nothing like a musical notation for the face\nSo about Thirty years ago he began by examining his own face very closely to see how many muscles are in there and there are roughly fifty then he spent the next couple of decades trying to figure out how many ways those muscles can combine to form a facial expression\nI developed tropical official action cutting system\nBasically a muscular scoring system you can apply to photographs feeling realized behavior you just do a one to for your your numbering my facial especially the one to the most common fingers were up to us raising your eyebrows office weren't too far it's just raising the upper Arctic serving his concerns are are\nAll in all the human face is capable of three thousand different expressions that's what he thinks it's we sat in his publishers office in midtown Manhattan is about an hour before the airport incident running example yeah he demonstrated if you\nOK few fabricate anger very unlikely you'll put in what we call the anger reliable muscle which most people can't voluntarily move\nYour ten senior I'm\nTouching their red margin of error that's\nEarly to click you looked fierce when you do that instantly so have you on the someone's mad look at their lips conversely if you want another happy genuinely happy and they're not just faking it he says look at their island skin\nIn between your eyebrows and Europe or are they in the genuine spontaneous and joins while that's good news lightly down\nHard to detect by visible you know\nYou just didn't like you said that anyway the reason that we're talking about him here an hour on lying is because with all the attention that being paid these days to finding life by using fancy brain scanners\nX. men is kind of on a crusade to remind us that you don't have to do that you don't have to look in the rain because the brain is actually directly connected to the face in ways that we can't control\nOf these muscles are activated involuntarily when an emotion and curves without your choice\nOr the things happening on my face on her face on any faith\nFor Germany or no you don't even know that ... tried to make your face [laughter]\nWhich brings me to my new favorite word leakage leakage leakage yet it is a word you hear again and again when you talk to anyone in the field of like catching take for example burying

in a sweat that because of ... nervous system that you have no control over basically telling the truth is easy that is the crux of the\nCoating Steve Silverman a reporter for wired magazine the truth is kind of sitting there in your brain your brain knows it you say it no problem\nBut your brain has to work harder to generate the line there is an effort\nAnd with that there is always leakage even in an instantaneous moments sometimes you even hear it were a person's breathing pattern will change or the size that people do\nAnd what particular time did they do a you're not trained to look at it most people ignore it\nBut if you've been trained and you know what to look for corn ... man is it it will strike you right in the face\nSpeaking faces are talking about a particular brand of ...

that you're smiling\nGames but on the inside is a vote to know you can attest maybe you got them reach a little little being all that but on the outside you're smiling now a microexpression is went for the tiniest tiniest moment a little bit of that in a rage slips out onto your face\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nAnd these are just little link to fleeting aggression that are usually pretty extreme but they're very fair skinned happens consciously says but so fast that most of us don't eat at all\nMost of the stuff they most everyone around Ninety five percent of us are what you're learning you know\nAnd what you don't win going back then you wake up to the start on the possibility that times are everywhere\n[noise] ...\nEnough to make sense to me or my daughter was born ... years ago or deciding on life you're going to leave my life without a line\nTo see whether you can feed her life without vying yeah that sounds very hostile it's very tough but I'm always looking to see whether there's a way I can solve the problem\nI Would say where when I Want to be there and she would say three o'clock at the doctor's office than I Would say okay and I would go\nBe the early you know to forty five\nAnd uh she would not be there at three Fifteen would roll around and three thirty would roll around there I Am sitting sort of alone in the perception is sort of computer you can I help you she would say oh without a doubt one was at one o'clock or I Would notice on the sign in sheet that she had actually signed in it I could see the handwriting and indeed it was ... and\nShe signed it two hours earlier\nYeah so yeah yeah and as discontinued I Would say repeat that for me three okay so three o'clock I mean these are moments in crystal clarity of life you're not losing track of stuff\nThen he gets a call from a woman named Leslie I met hope off Craig's list actually put out an ad for a roommate and she moved in with no furniture she showed up with just all of her stuff in trash bags and then she disappeared\nLeaving the back behind so it was right around that point where a check down and I was like oh now and so through mutual friends she tracked down to ... I was kind of like OK well she has a boyfriend she called them call them and sort of wonder if that gives the enormous she had no idea what she's talking about no he didn't even know she had a roommate mean lastly\nI mean who the hell was who are you know who are you you will mean money and no I don't and she'll you know it was all very confusing\nNot knowing what else to do Leslie decides to go into hopes for him and start looking through her spine I just like you know I'm just going to go through this see what's in here and that's when I found those notebooks\nBorrow ban that book\nAn

say\nMy own responsibilities are not withstanding to be um\nYou know pregnancy and what about Leslie at this point when she well Leslie wondered how many of those people in that notebook hoping not through Craig's list which is very lively met her she went back to Craig's list and started posting warnings\nMany times a day I\nThink the white female make specific case me the Gray Thursday twenty

computers and it just started from there every time we talked to one victim to lead to one or two other bit of hope has a almost like a cult following you know her ammo was that\nShe knew she got to know him really well\nI've talked to a lot of victims and they just don't trust people anymore\nA lot of these people did some good human open heart things with her and said\nThis to poor girl I've got to help her out and there were there really let down there just don't trust people anymore and it's sad you know not only do you have to worry about cleared up your credit than getting your money back from your bags you know you've got to deal with with people in the surf now that you don't know you know who you're standing next to\nShe just had that feeling\nHelp it blown through in San

we're totally untrue\nIn this letter to his parents hope for that [noise]\nAt at one point during\nPregnancy she was having complications and the the main symptom was like severe ... bleeding and bad news is that she was on somebody's living room\nAnd that um that I had that I just left\nTotally abandoning the situation in my responsibility in just a graphic and ugly depiction of an awful scene [noise]\nCheapest traumatize the whole experience he compared to an earthquake\n[laughter] have you ever been an earthquake no never well\nOne of the things that happens is that there's these aftershocks after the earthquake and there for a little while after the earthquake you're not sure\nThat when you put your foot down the ground is still going to be in the same place so that was a minute ago there were days\nI can tell you there were days when it was significant to hear anybody say anything of any consequence that was just\nYou to say\nI have a carton of milk in my refrigerator that expires on September ... and that was from was it didn't say September nineteenth or September fifteenth and said September Seventy to other\nPeople crying on the phone talking to me about this situation and they were victims six seven years ago people are embarrassed they're embarrassed and then they become mad\nYou know that's when they become detective [laughter]\nMake lousy practice\nWhere are you know front of hopes mother's house in a bad\nNeighborhood in New Orleans and around midnight what's your name and her mom Marcia Valentine and why are you there exactly I could kind of gotten a little obsessed\nWith how he got upset\nWhy I have no idea [laughter] I definitely having technical tests I was telling her to there was something about imagining\nHow she was doing all this so nervous was like really fun to imagine but maybe also happens Leslie to it like once I started looking I was able to find a lot of victims a lot of information and I wanted to meet her\nMarcia Valentine Marcia Valentine\nThey're not around here that are going to live and what you mean everyone's ...\nI'll come back there\nOkay next right ... but what did you know about hope at this point well I knew that she had had a daughter\nWho really knows anybody\nYou know not choose\nThe timing was all wrong and I had locate\nThe father well I'm standing outside of hooked Smothers how shares through class of ... piled up against the ...\nI don't see any land inside the house\nNext morning I went out to find a woman named ruby ruby moon I live in New Orleans Louisiana wherever he owns a coffee shop I live down the street from hopes mother someone who came to New Orleans um her mother you know\nIntroduced us really has a kid who's about the same it just helps daughter and they go to Montessori together and when really opened her shop a year ago\nHope to car pool today she would pick them up and when we got home about five thirty six o'clock we'd all eat dinner together and she would spend the night sometimes\nAnd quite frankly I enjoyed having hope around\nTwo weeks later the cop show up to a raft hope\nShe had printed a check on her home computer with a made up account number divide twelve thousand dollar used\nHere you are you really like this woman your kids love her and you can't believe it you don't believe it and I wanted to stand by her I wanted to help her\nYou know and she hadn't screwed me over she hadn't done anything to me so\nMaybe she's turning around\nCard off the shelves that he put away because the credit card with maxed out\nAnd she'd been buying gasoline and paying her phone bill wasn't much was like two hundred and fifty dollars it really wasn't much and my husband was like oh why\nYou know inconsistencies big ones\nAnd then the hundred and eight folks that she ... she found a pathological liar twelve actually twelve twelve out of a hundred and they say ... or they pathological Arizona depends on how you define I Would hope that she found twelve people that she wanted\nTo look at further she said to them would you be willing to come out of purely voluntary basis into the lab and let me scan your brain [laughter]\nJust another day of office\nOut basically put people in the scanner and then we scan their brain\nScanned everyone's ... all one hundred and eight or participants the liars and the non liars no one knew which group there and ... and she was looking at a particular part of their brains just be on there for it called the ...\nCortex and this is the part of the brain that\nPart of the nation is where the real thinking at making decisions and more judgment for example\nIf you do me into that place just behind you for him [noise]\nYou'll see two kinds of brain tissue you've got gray matter and then you've got\nWhite men I've heard him gray matter yes well we think of the brain is being gray but actually too thick gray and white the great\nStuff kind of thing but it's like the computer processor part yeah these little clumps of neurons that process information\n[noise] computer [noise]\nBetween all these cars on the computer the way met her in other words is move the thoughts around gray\nIs where the the thinking happens and then why is when you move the thought from here\nThey transfer information from one end to the ... because\nThey've got your grave that you're white ... thought she would see when she looked into the brains of people\nWho lie a lot I found out we would see a reduction\nSome piece of it not they're missing something physically she thought she would find less gray stuff less of the thinking why would why would\nBecause that's what she's seen in other mental disorders that are kind of like this and if you think about it in a really simplistic level the graves where do you think your thoughts and it's also among other things where you crunch your moral calculations and liars she figured have trouble in this department some maybe they have less great\nThat was okay but when she got the pictures that what you saw was such a great increase it\nAnd not the great more white matter\nWhite stuff a lot more\n... than a quarter to twenty five twenty five percent more connections in their head the non liars yes\nBefore we get to what that means what were you thinking when you saw this\nI was really bubbling [laughter]\nI thought this was this was something something something something ... years her idea so far ready if she thinks that these extra connections play a crucial role in\nA kind of in the moment storytelling that's essentially what lying is coming up with a story on the fly let me give you an example mhm you're leaving work you're walking on the elevator and annoying\nBut nice co worker corners you hey Sallie corners unique

I'm rubber crow which is radiolab and today\nWe have a legal case well it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal case\nThis case it's it's um what my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away that it gets under your skin this is Lisa ... I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nAt the Columbia school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she sat down not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna feral brought us this story and under whose skin or he also seems to have got yeah\nIt it just made me\nNot know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nSure Jim Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist from newspaper guy for the post aren't glimpse Bob's he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the ... which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eight Nineteen Seventy three for young people did Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping out around ... pulled off the road a aside road off route thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two towns and went to sleep for the night\nAnd on Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM to the campers\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they thought was his middle aged men peering into the tent\nLooked like a conservation officer he had a door with a feather on sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck and\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he get\nThe other two campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing in semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen ah of killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods\nTook him into the woods near a brook in pairs of two with him behind them are\nThe kids of course we're scared out of there which he pulled out some real basically he had he had to each of them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun at him and then the last one he type\nSo after we had the four people tied he went back to the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski and because the other three kids were spread out to the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled with boys\nGet really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happened to him\nWhat was happening to the man stabbing ... stuck and I\nHad been five times in a chair\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running neck Fiorello ran to his car Carol Ann ... ran through the woods [noise]\nButton demand caught one of them David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had to lay down in a ditch\nNext to him to kind of monitor the situation I guess\nSo Freeman in um the killer laying in the dead chapter then our men come\nMen that the other campers the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert\nLocals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted than a killer and Freeman laying down in the kitchen when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun and he's going to shoot\nAnd the manner the gun just kind of stood up\nCalmly and Cooley walked into the forest and not began what was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road as you can see when the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in state police standing by\nOur there was a scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down our manpower into a roving patrols men\nArmed with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods\nThey eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and it comes back with an ID\nA thirty seven year old Robert Darrow Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward today he was an ex convict\nHe'd been in prison for rape ... seven years\nNow armed with a thirty thirty rifle and nice and the story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday how do you feel at night when the people got panic when you're all are well one of the doors are short of arts people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fast I don't care that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left barbecue smoldering they left behind coolers sides a manhunt dragged on what happened was Garrett was able to use those camps in that food and those drinks to survive\nDay after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men now\nThe police follow her lead that he had stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on him and uh\nSeventy three very very hot day one of the hottest summer\nThat day a conservation officer named ... spotted Darrow\nThese freeze\nOr drop your gun something to that effect and Carol started running\nLow block fire four times got 'em in the back\nThe arm in the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but\nBut you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\nThe\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with him there and the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing but he wouldn't talk and it's at\nThis point that the story that I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this law professor lethal Armand again is\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording this other guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank Armani\nBreakage army\nThe lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or or money that's Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use urban but it is or money\nA couple of months ago producer Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York Missouri money's now in his eighties he's retired\n[noise] my name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert\nGirl um\nWhere I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like ... how did this whole stories start for you well were there just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I like ... flights go fights I'd like standing up for the little guy\nAnd that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for defending your fighting the state and ... and he was doing really well\nHe has well respected had a good reputation\nThen he met Robert De Niro\nYeah black you're strong back to ... you need a forty five and a or to head the field I mean this guy is dangers and love of things are going to happen\nThis is the year before the men and Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers you represented him at first on two pretty small things\nOne one school teacher has a shelf to his child he was sued the school\nAnd I talk to them a little bit and then head on all of them will be ... I remember that\nBut then pretty quickly it gets dark Garrett was charged with trying to kidnap to college kids that kids got dismissed but then become picture for\nOh let's see some younger kids\nTwo very young girls age ten eleven Garrett was released on bail he skipped this court date\nAnd just disappeared and then we pick up where we left off the murder the manhunt and an August ninth the night Guerra got captured Frank gets a call from girls life\nFor about thirty minutes bells you talk to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went up to the back door [noise] took of\nDriving the lady friends car to try to lose any too\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here\nWhich may be as far as we walk up to this old abandoned mine [noise]\nWent out there last February with reporter Lauren that chemistry and that tells you provider of Mariah Tom's 'cause the father so there's some a road that goes to the minded or what is fair to them on it was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road is is a\nTrail of her own or you're just\nBecause I'm very icy that day the share this used to be an overall [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hill is fairly feet or know leaves and all the trees were\nAnd I'm Sorry skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are many and this is the only way they came in here\nTo write up here we are in our son do shoots and rebuild trudging choose for is looking for [noise]\nSpent hours look [noise]\nFrom this was her friend to allow\nYou see the airship after they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across\nThere for this or get any such yeah you don't want to fly down in there and so they couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down and there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak the shoe of blue sneaker\n[noise]\nAnd and a leg I said to myself this bitch does it end he yells back up to Belgium get me out of your\nMoney back up very\nEventually algae found the other body ... she was in a cemetery where Guerra headset he left her\nBut our money wasn't there when ... founder\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's see how that play that out what what are your options shirt so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just can't we took her to know to keep the confidence is over ...\nUnder the current rules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that is yet that can be or we'll be right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up when even if they have hired detectives and even if the local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that\nBut there's no if if if people are already dead than you ... the the lawyers\n... that's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is\nIs to to play the part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates ... even if everybody hates you even if maybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person\nThat fights as hard as they can for the client the lawyer is the agent of his client only only the\nAgent of him or also a citizen and a member of the ... part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and family seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right is there a week you're building on on the side of ... just tell tell\nOf course yeah soon I knew Mr hawk from bowling who's who's the other daughter or my daughter were in the same slash and I knew him from church\nAnd wanting to be an animal\nOf the family and then you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\n\nSo now what has [noise] coming up that hard but it's even harder [noise]\nWe'll be right back [noise]\n\nFor me from Arlington, Texas radio a lot of support in part by the Alfred P

I'm I'm Rhonda I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right and they knew they knew this thing they knew the client was very guilty of something they found the bodies of these two girls and a\nNo brainer what is it what what's their next move well so they decided to put the burden plea bargain\nThey take this information to the prosecutor and say\nI have information that will help you solve some cases some cases yes and in exchange they want you to give me a better deal for my client\nTo get ... into a mental hospital instead of a Christian also right away they're going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give her Lulu and you're going to take it a little\nWell that's kinda gross you know yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank perspective he's got this information\nAs a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargains then that's a way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client so\nJim Tracy again they called a meeting with Henry McCabe investigator from the state police detective McCabe and the district attorney harmonies office and when they met army ... search the briefcase us up to be a and the investigator make sure they weren't wearing a bug because their parents there's going to be\nPresent the deal he says listen I've got information on two bodies I Want you to agree to put my client in a mental institution instead of sending them off the president and the prosecutor apparently very quickly put two and two together and immediately thought\nThe whole there you're talking about Susan and only show like these are the two girls that we're most concerned about we think they're alive and Belgian said I'm not telling you anything unless we have a deal\nAnd Lisa told me about this panel she organized back in two thousand seven for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility and there were about four hundred people in the room most of them layers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love feast\nDoes what does this is what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that\nI don't go was here are just was a lawyer the ... job\nA ... I was a good lawyer and\nI thought so art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and bell gee did a good body is case it's taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what a people thing what if what if what if\nPeople face so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham just stand up\nHe represents his client's best interest if you and in sitting in on these classes and in talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely used because professors can point to that they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can see in this situation\nThis is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n... ... ... ... ...\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the\nFamilies involved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing your mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nWho's in the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing machine camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law school and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what\nIs considered to be correct\nAre 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things\nIn an ethical class is\nTotally and comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out\nTo yes it was yes you are the only in talking to you did I Know that yes\nMaybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they are trying to defend but what about the victim\nAnd I think that that should at least be an equal shot in their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um that that you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes only oh my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and\nAnd went to the police station and\nSitting with the police men\nThey received the policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call that Danny's\nMy daughter's boyfriend what his body was found\nAnd that's that's all we knew and we never really had any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and\nObviously there was no closure and it was just\nAnd then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who was um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later\nIn the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as just sitting a lawyer which my husband did it was a total Eli\nMaybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing more months\nAnd that's why they think taught law schools\n[noise] so anyway\nJust to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professors law students there um when they approach that says it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain they I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could\nAny of those possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it\nAnd so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk\nTo you to kind of um but you have a chance to communicate some of that experience yeah well it's\nImpossible to really communicate words\nI made forty years later I'm Still\nI I ... and it's still a struggle to discuss because you don't ever go away as long as I\nI don't I guess\nI'm Wondering if we've been talking a lot of um south south I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about\nI'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know\nThat you would want to share I don't know you don't have to but\nWell\nWhat can I say she was\nShe did receive her degree pass too much sleep I we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where it was too difficult for us\nAnd [noise]\nAnd Danny what's her boyfriend had bad just that summer and he had a full scholarship to Herbert any uh graduated just the year before and so to me\nAnd I'm sure the other two children get great future I had a true and\nJust a horrible tragedy\n[laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter] so it's horrible to be in the position\n[noise] let me relieve whose daughter were one of the ... for protecting the person to kill her\nNew justification you couldn't just took my mind\nExpect [laughter]\nBut we lose\n\nUm I'm going to get just a minute of silence up here so it's okay\n[laughter]\nEchoes of dogs on the mountain things tend to travel up the [noise] the hill kind of bounce around um that water I think it's\nTrue deeper down in there dripping I Can't tell where it's dripping everything up here is frozen solid so what that is [noise]\nBut I think I'm going to turn background\nThrough wish I'd
