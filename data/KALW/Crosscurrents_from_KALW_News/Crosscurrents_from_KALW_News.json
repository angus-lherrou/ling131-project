D. J. for the Golden State warriors Oakland voice his graduate down mood daily met up with the sharp to go through his memories of the sideshow [noise] ooh\n... grew up in these though I Lived on fifty first jak rum and and the time with a crack era [noise]\nNice though it was popping I'm Talking about it was crazy like I look back at that and I'll be like damn I'm Still alive [laughter] it was like that\nYou know to me here's some vivid memories of that time and they all came pouring out when she was one simple question about growing up in Oakland have you ever seen a side show\nAlways right from my house like I mean all the time so it's like it's like you know you know going out and just being out being so young and then like seeing like\nSeville full of just slapping [noise]\nShe describes a show like that I I feel\nLike when we were coming up believes it as\nIt was cats who were working on a car you know they would they would they would go out and display what they've done to their cars to hype 'em up you know what I mean at at an intersection and people will gather brightly colored old school classic cars will slow down the street shiny freshly painted I remember when I was a\nKid in hopes the sound systems would vibrate the street car trust would be packed with speakers ten and twelve inch Fifteen eventually you could tell who's car was by the stumbling blocks away\nOne corner in particular sticks out in the ... food open the trumpet he got [noise]\nYou know I remember this cat had ten teens\nYet you've you've poppies for opening his ... his hands in the back of and it was\nA children's day I Can't think of another car that I've ever heard slammed that hard it was ten teams tense up over and it was perfect in the back it was like it was it was it was insane [noise]\nWas planned [noise] he was playing a ah [noise] the soul train [noise] so so trying thing\nBall ball ball ball ball ball ball ball that day it was it was pounded so cause [noise]\nAnd everything he played after that was it was all like it really wasn't no wrap everything he was playing with like SOS man and just like\nIt was like stuff that like was like no yeah boots and Collins like a no one's going to love you both ball ball ball ball like just knocked him super hard and that's one of those actually after ... the most vivid I remember [noise] um and I always\nAfter that I wanted to severe [noise]\nHe wanted a four door Cadillac severe and he knew exactly what kind of speakers who get four I wanted a Ford or Seville I was like I could do it for twelve to me\nThat was my thing I was like I if I got four twelve this was mia ten years oh by the way back up or it will be allowed to be not and you know what I mean so\nKnocking slapped been popping bumping banging cracking open NATO's like the shark creatively re purpose words to describe cars and the speaker\nSays terms for beautiful great in Oakland side shoveling and then you have certain cats who come through just flashy and just pull up and just you know like which was\nKnown for that just pulling up slamming hard shutting aside showdown oh man who just show up with just just his presence that that um that orange or what was it the uh the colors\nYou just pull up just just shut it down you know what I mean we're all man he's talking about Richie Rich like a local artist higher classics I show anthem called the sideshow [noise]\nAnd if you listen to how these Sharpe says flashy shut it down you can make you feel like you're right there with them watching the streets begin to peak as local celebrities and pull up in their car and some\nGirls looking real pretty much all man and he was he was like I mean as far as\nI can remember coming at you I mean rich would like to get it in terms of car culture in Oakland though he has some legendary car like real legendary car like you can email you back into it pointed out in the\nRich and India tone Indian tone ask them for their cars to Indian tone is a mythical figure decide showed I competed with people like Richie Rich for the unofficial title sideshow camping now\nIndian ... had a cougars early on a Mustang and share of like he had some veils light on\nLike like the I mean he probably hold the title\nOakland kids of the sharpest arrows debate about the type of thing either way I how I Would I Would do it would just want him and rich I mean\nYou know just through my eyes coming up in the subway and you know what I mean it could be other cats but like\nI mean I've seen like like Indian tone had that as a\nPolice he had a ... you know the war in the ... you know what I mean like the detail that went in to light\nPutting that that cartoon gathering you know what I mean it's like us is like showrooms level [noise]\nThen you probably got it done and you don't really know what I mean\n\nAs for whether sideshow originally began and many still wonder the most qualified answer I could find was from Dwayne wade gifts\nDoes your brother Raphael so deep in the churches of east Oakland during the seventies early eighties he responded online to answer the question of where the sideshow start you said in a Facebook post eighty first and the sport\nIn the quarter pound a parking lot but the answers vary depending on who you're talking to and what air they came up in a lot of people stay where really the into the mainstream popularity was later in the late eighties around ... mall near banned from McDonald's parking lot [noise]\nYou\nReally\nA side show is like a pop up shop or they can open and close on any corner so people will remember them and all kinds of places like foothills where the coliseum or right by the life\nYou can do things in\nWherever it again open sideshow cultures here to stay at least in memory and influence alone\nFor a Martian lunches post game golf carts celebrations cows football field or any later kept shooting the bobble heads off\nTo the Golden State warriors used the phrase the town you know when it's officially NBA Jersey land from the opening scene of the hit marvel movie Black Panther which featured in the Trump to shore it's classic sideshow song\nWhich of an open marriage Jerry Brown two thousand five attempt to jail people\nWithin a hundred feet of a sideshow language it's usually DJ's fashion it's car culture and they're all part of Oakland history of creating innovative ways but unfortunately in this car culture created by people of color\nDoesn't necessarily get the respect that others do in America like NASCAR monster trucks\nFor top down imagine if they do maybe the city could help young people learn a trade start a business with the cars they produce or put on city Central Park competition so and closing dance with the one who brought you support the ones who made the dances and music and my car culture you love so much\nSo I always to the next like in my Pop's Cadillac DeVille me\nWas his dumb daily for cross country but

devastating effect on the southern Louisiana landscape\nKLW is Angela Johnston interviewed Quinn about his movie rodents of unusual size\nNutrient are these twenty pound rodents that are native to Argentina or their kind a like a rat and that they have a long tail but they're huge much bigger than a rat there also kind of like a platypus because they have these Web defeat that they used to swim around they spend a lot of their time in water\nAnd then unlike a lot of rodents they have these gigantic orange bright orange teeth that comes about from all the iron and all the plants that they eat whether or not you think that their horrific ugly or really really cute and enduring kind of depends on the context you see them in the contacts most people see them in as you know swimming around in a swamp\nUh or like crawling up through the pipes in your toilet and the middle of the night and so they can be really really terrifying animals\nUm but in the case of people that raise them as pets or a you know turn them into costumes for Mardi Gras parades I'm thinking you kind of start to see them as being a little more ah more cute little more beaver like\nHow did they are right and in Louisiana\nSo in the thirties for was really popular and it was mostly making mosque rat but it was something that was only available to the super rich and it was just the height of glamour was to be able to afford to buy your wife a fur coat so\nThere was a group of people that were looking for a cheap alternative to make and ... and\nThey found out about this South American rodent nutrient [laughter] it was a little more rat like it was a little less attractive\nMaybe a but the first very lush stress and beautiful and so\nThey decided to bring the nutrient to Louisiana and start raising them on for farms at but at some point the new ... skate into the wild and where they really really flourish was just in the swamps and the wilds of southern Louisiana because unlike Argentina\nThere not killed off by regular freezes there are no like giant cats that eat them the only\nPredator besides man is our alligators and an alligator early to nutrient and ... just take a nap for like a month or so huge so the alligators aren't really\nA a good means are controlling them and so they just multiplied and multiplied and multiplied until they became a huge problem because\nThey eat like

surge and so coastal Louisiana is losing a football field a planned every hour well slipping into the ocean so\nUh it's really really important to get the nutrient under control to help start to

Bek holes and democratic organizer Buffy Wicks are competing to represent California's fifteenth assembly district\nThat includes Berkeley Emeryville parts of Oakland and Richmond and San Pablo they're running to replace Tony Thurmond who's now a candidate for state superintendent of public instruction\nEarlier this month two weeks and ... had the chance to speak to some of their potential voters and candidates forum in Berkeley hosted by the league of women voters KLW election coordinator Angela Johnston has more\nHundreds of people from students to retirees gathered in Berkeley community theater and very quickly the candidates got to one of the biggest issues of their campaigns housing it's clear ... and ... both have a desire to solve the housing crisis where there are differences show is how to solve it\nTake for instance proposition ten that's a measure on the state ballot which would repeal the Costa Hawkins rental Housing Act\nIn order to allow cities to expand their own rent control laws\nThat goes as a strong supporter of prop ten\nI absolutely one hundred percent support\nWe have not [noise]\nContinue to displace\nOur community members in this in in our district\nAnd that's why I we ... we\nHave to build more affordable housing\nPlease vote for ... this November\nBecause the rent too damn high wakes agrees on the high rent but not on supporting prop tent\nI've spoken to folks who build affordable housing\nUm affordable housing experts um the N. double ACP the building trades labor unions and they're all in opposition to proposition ten because they are concerned that this will exacerbate or housing crisis by halting the construction of new homes and we desperately need new new homes in California\nWe have a severe shortage so if you talk to folks that build affordable housing they have these concerns\nInstead wakes wants to increase the rent or tax credit from sixty dollars to six hundred dollars she also spoke about creating a legal Defense Fund for renters who are facing unfair and fiction [noise]\nAnother main campaign point for both candidates as health care both support a single payer health care system in California a system financed by taxes that would cover the cost of a central health care for all residents but how do they differ\nIt's more a question about when the current system could change which doesn't believe that President Trump would give California the funds needed to enact a single payer system anytime soon\nSo in the meantime let's make sure our system here works well let's put a public option on the exchange that way and a twenty twenty environment we can then actually work with the federal government and create a single payer system here so that everyone can have the access and health care that they deserve and the state\nThat goes reminded the audience that she worked as a mental health specialist for Contra Costa county for Eighteen years and she insisted on working to get a single payer health care system as soon as possible\nI Will move towards a Medicare for all single payer health care system\nThat takes profit out of out of the service of of people uh that's why I Believe that at in California we can do that but until until that happens there are certain things that we can do right now\nLike she says ensuring that done\n... and the hospitals and implementing what she calls a quote publicly funded care coordination system unquote between providers fighting to protect existing health coverage [noise]\nThen education took the stage that goes once a moratorium on new charter schools in order to spend more money on public schools\nWe've seen how a of of the for profit education system is ruining and sucking the life blood out of our public school systems and that's why I Will be a champion so fully fund our public schools\nAgain which disagrees instead of an actual moratorium she wants to make sure people get a better understanding of how the resources on charter schools are being spent\nNow I Will never ... parents were sending their kids are charters you know parents are making difficult decisions I'm a parent I understand\nBut we've got to have heart count ability and transparency around our charter schools\nBoth candidates also want to tackle funding problems in the higher education system that goes and wakes agree on closing what they call it the commercial loophole and proposition Thirteen this future reform could allow the state to receive more tax dollars from commercial properties by assessing them at their current market value and to put that money towards education\nWe subsidize it by taxing the rich\nWe close the tax loophole and prop Thirteen and and as I said earlier that's how we do it that's how we get the resources that we deserve we as working people in California we are the ones that created the well California is the fifth largest economy in the world with the largest concentration of billionaires\nWe will workers created that will\nAnd we deserve to have the resources that they would bring forward and and so again that's how we fund universal preschool that's how we fund universal tuition free public colleges for all of our students in California\nWe chose to focus on the racial inequality and education system\nKids of color have less access to good early childhood care\nRight in starts even before that a mothers of color have less access to prenatal care and then we see those racial inequities exist within our education system all the way through to the point that UC Berkeley last class only was only three percent African\nIt's really it's a very special part of my life\n\n\n[noise]\nMm\n\n\nMm Mm\n[noise]\nThat's a very special part of my life\n\n\n[noise] Mm\n[noise] oh\nYou can see Patrick an

[laughter] I've been ... ...\n... on up the law and most recently had a baby it happens a lot to so many people every single day\nWell ever since high school people have pronounced either to my advantage as name wrong and when she correct they're put on the Asian that asked where she was from as if it was a foreign aim\nShe'd say I'm a fifth generation south Texan\nAt it as a new one woman play why would I miss pronounce my own name explores her struggle with people's perception of her over time and her identity and multicultural America this is the second generation of her plate tell me your name I spoke with at at about the play in this interview from our guides\nI was very interested in ... why do people have such a reaction if I tell them my name is ... and I refused to say that my name is Irma Herrera\nWhat kind of reactions well look at like what well how do you say it in English well there really is no English translation for my name you know my name is ... name\nYes if you want to pronounce it in English that is how you would say it but that's not how I'm going to say it and I think the first rule of\nMaking friends doing business with anybody is respecting their name and\nSo you grew up in South Texas I did and did you\nI never thought about it because I grew up in complete segregation I grew up in a Mexican American community that was totally segregated so I never really dealt with white people until I went to high school and\nIn high school of course teachers and classmates did not pronounce my named the way I wanted it pronounced\nAnd so you go to the school people call you Irma Herrera ... do you remember what you feel\nI that\nWasn't me you know that type responded to that because that's the name they called in class but that really wasn't me ...\nAnd at that time where you starting to be aware of that and I yeah I was starting\nTo be aware I became aware of the importance of names very early on oh what about six years old I'm with my parents and we visit my favorite on called my deal a deal and his wife\nAnd around noon we hear the pick up the truck that my uncle drives delivering gravel and construction materials and when he comes in house inside the house I notice he's wearing a shirt with the patch and it has\nThe letters T O M I'm just learning to read so I sound it out and when we leave I said to my dad puppy quite a steel shirts say Tom\nBecause that's what they call him at work do people have different names that were\nKnown me he die it's at the ... can't say or deal so they call him Tom\nBut why doesn't deal teach them how to say his name\nSo very early on I saw that my uncle who was a very dignified man was being disrespected at work but he had limited education he was a labor I'm sure he never insisted on his name being pronounced correctly\nBecause what would that mean it would mean a loss of his job in a sense I feel that the privilege I have\nOf having had a wonderful education of being a lawyer of having some\nPower limited in society in a way I feel like I'm the proxy for all those people who don't have\nThe opportunity to say to someone else no that's not my name I prefer that you call me by my correct name and that name is ... Atlanta but I remember one day I was upset because I Would hear newscaster say on NPR\nPronouncing French names so beautifully\nJacques you hawk ...\nBut you get a Spanish name and they'll go Tom parade as well as the last name as bad as it's not ... what is it why what is it it's a status thing ban is just a low status language and people would be embarrassed to speak poor French\n... even though the number of people who speak French in the world is like two percent but it's always been\nAssociated with status and international diplomacy in class so Spanish is a low status language and uh people don't care\n... and one day I remember being yelling at my radio because they were talking about the former secretary of transportation ... but they pronounced his name Frederick Rico\nKenya Mm well she is a pineapple and there's no there's no there's only one are in ... it's not Fred to Rico and so I'm asking where the\nPeople who are doing the news stories you're not pronouncing that name correctly and this person is as deserving of your respect as ... or ... or ... or whoever [noise] um and so what do you want people to leave with after they see your play really [noise]\nI really want people to think about\nAll the ways in which we discriminate\nBecause we all do\nThat's really all I Want is for people to think about what do I do that I should check myself about ...\n[noise] so can you take us out with a bit of performance [noise]\nWell uh sure I'll tell you what my my closing scene is and so a few years ago I was in Copenhagen\nAnd I saw this sign a in front of a store that said eat my I are in a in huge letters and it turns out the largest and oldest grocery store chain in that country is named each month and pronounced like my name [laughter]\nSo in the closing scene in my play I say now when people ask me where I'm from I tell them Denmark [laughter]\nAnd then I tell this story about going to that story and I show 'em a bag that I got that has either my written on it because that's the name of the store with its logo and so I finished shot by saying\nStanding there I began to wonder if people back home thought I was from Denmark would they try harder to save my name\nAnd leave him thinking\n[noise]\nAtlanta's play why would I mispronounce my own name starts today in place through December eighth at the Marshall theater in San Francisco find all the details at K.
