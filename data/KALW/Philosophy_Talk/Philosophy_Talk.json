privilege is racial injustice well I mean I'm just not convinced that the rampant mistreatment of blacks is\nAn instance of or even proof of the existence of what you're calling white prove will come again well okay we're philosophers let's start from the beginning of what exactly do you mean by white privilege timing is\nThe fact that white enjoy so many other advantages relative to others not just in the criminal justice system but in just about any fear of life you can name John So you think the fact of\nWhites are much more likely to be treated with respect by cops is a sign of honor and white privilege well\nWhat did they do to deserve that privilege except be born in\nYou know racist society yeah I Do know they were born doesn't everybody black white brown anything in between deserve to be treated with respect\nAll anyone ever has to do to deserve respect so it's not a privilege\nWhat are you trying to say I'm not sure what you're trying to say that\nYou're misconstrue in two different things related but different violations of black rights and protection of white privilege and I I don't get it look I grant you that cops too often trample the rights of black people\nThat's not to say that they don't trample the rights of white sometimes to or that they often treat everybody just as they should be treated\nBut violations of black rights are routine and are done with far a ... with impunity uh and and when whites are mistreated they're usually isn't doing very well you're just pulling my point though I'm refuting your point the problem isn't it the cops are wrong to respect the rights of whites\nThe point is that are wrong to disrespect the rights of black\n... wait a minute are you denying that there's such a thing as white privilege\nNo not at all but I'm saying that having your rights are respected is not an example of white ... book can you want or eliminate racial injustice\nDon't focus on white privilege right closing the country clubs or a a won't help much focus on securing the too often trampled rights of people of color\nPerks are belonging to the country club but but a A R up white supremacy there's a lot more serious I got just a fact of whites are\nBut deeply more deeply into them they're important distinctions but right now I'm going to remind our audience you're listening to philosophy talk and today we're thinking about white privilege and racial injustice\nIs eliminating white privilege to key to achieving racial justice or is it really a matter of securing the rights of black\nDoesn't really matter whether we use the language a privilege or the language of rights to describe our racial situation can't we just try to fix it and forget about Samantha debates privileged who writes injustice plus your calls and emails when philosophy talk continues\nYou can get our monthly e newsletter by taxing the word philosophy to to do eight to eight to stay current upcoming episode content [noise] other philosophy talk

philosophy talked to a program that questions everything\nIncluding your poetry but not your intelligence I'm Ken Taylor and we're thinking about white privilege and racial injustice is the key to achieving racial justice eliminating white privilege or is it advancing black rights or to those amounted to the same thing\nOur guest is Naomi ... from the University of Oregon a author of the uh white privilege and black rights so now I mean\nI think we can all agree on the existence of a certain phenomena and\nHe's got various dimensions black people are often treated with less respect than white people and many contacts have less ... less access on average to the good things of life and all that everybody can agree about that phenomenon\nBut practically speaking I Wonder why doesn't matter whether we describe this phenomenon in terms of white privilege or black right\nBecause there's been an erosion due to a couple or or more a U.S Supreme Court rulings of um constitutional rights so the Fourth Amendment is supposed to give us all a protection against unreasonable search and seizure\nAnd the fourteenth amendment or it's supposed to give everyone equal protection under the law\nNow these amendments are seem to have been violated in these recent high profile cases and uh uh the violators the killers are are not punish you know there are they not indicted or else they're not convicted for the you know what\nYou're saying that if we I mean okay ... that's all sounds right to me but are you saying you legal yeah you're right it sounds like you're suggesting and I'm just trying to make clear whether you are not\nYou sound like you're suggesting if we adopt this discourse of white privilege instead of the discourse of of of of violations of black right we're going to be blind to exactly what's wrong what's gone wrong in a situation\nThat's right you know the problem with it ... it was white privilege is not the reality is that why you're better off I mean that is a problem but that's not what I'm disputing I'm just saying the discourse of white privilege especially when white people engage in this discourse\nIs kind of ... you know what it's like it's like it's like food he's talking about how wonderful their meal is in response to hearing about world hunger\n[laughter] well so you're saying\nGee that sounds that sounds like a pretty darn ing can I say the word damning uh in in the indictment of it just goes to fight for it and it also sounds like you think it is mostly white people you think ooh engaging the discourse of of of\nOf of white privilege and and but I Know some are more\n... it may not be for self serving reason it just may be oblivious a oblivious reasons oblivion um I ... I think one has to at this point to be a little delicate in in distinguishing who's saying\nWhat a about what and it's very different of black people talk about the how to better off and talk about white privilege\nThen if white people in answer to a stark injustices start talking about how privileged they are and we're hearing a lot of that from otherwise well meaning white people that's what I'm trying to ... ah make a little intervention or concerning\n... Sunday on me philosophically speaking from Plato's republics overalls theory of justice philosophers who think about justice tend to go off to thinking about an ideal society now I guess in an ideal society we certainly wouldn't be trampling the rights of blocks\nBut we also wouldn't have at least undeserved privileges for individual rights and know privileges for for people because of their race but it is focusing on ideal society an ideal justice leading us to kind of\nBush to problems one of which is much more grave and serious than the other together [noise]\nYeah I mean you are self centered if we had an ideally just society we wouldn't have these discrepancies but we don't and if you actually look at real history not the history of philosophy but real history [noise] people don't care about justice what they care about is injustice\nSo you see that today you know the black lives matter movement ... didn't come out of a philosophy clubs wanting to perfect the chandelier of ideal justice hanging from the ceiling of the universe [laughter] I'm In that case\nTo to have blood on the street\nYou say you have quite a way with were to have to tell you that I Love your way with with what I'm going to ask you a question I Want to ask you a question though about what I mean I owe a ... we'll get back to the ideal versus a you know non ideal justice but I Want to I Want to focus on white people just for a little bit\nBecause there are lots of white people who will ah I don't like to generalize but there are lots of white people who will acknowledge white privilege and they they take it to be a sign of their bona fides\nAs an ally to marginalize people that they are willing to acknowledge their white privilege there are others who will deny vehemently deny a white privilege they will they will turn to their own individual for a Jew an effort and blah blah blah so I mean it's a complicated thing and how I Wonder\nWhether the you think that those who deny white privilege or those who who are willing to acknowledge white privilege or in any way morally different or the birds of a feather or the two sides of the same point or what\nWas political um it's political and I ... in several different levels I mean there are a number of whites who are pretty upset about issues of social injustice\nAnd they'll do more than just acknowledged it their privilege they may actually do some research of support some clauses that lead to legal reforms um and then there are whites who are sort of appalled who are constable who like to think of themselves as nice people\nAnd they suddenly become aware that their privileged because they're white and their response to social injustice\nIs to talk about how nice their privileges are\nAnd I think that's useless I think that energy could be much better directed and then in political terms\nAre there are a number of whites who are under educated or who believe that all the ills that befall minorities are their own fault and therefore they are in contrast or as hard working white people deserve all the good things that happened to them and they have no\nThe end to Wiley [laughter]\nAligning with not and that that's actually catch my eye and not on this plan our genes I\nFelt like that so I\nCan't stand down\n\nBeyond say in a song called formation what she's saying at the super bowl according to Saturday Night live white people all over America were shocked to find out that beyond say was black or any rate a person of color some people thought the performance was too focused on race and identity politics\nWith white singer have the privilege of avoiding that kind of criticism I John Perry this is philosophy talk program that questions everything\nExcept your intelligence I'm Ken Taylor I guess it ... from the University of Oregon and we're thinking about white privilege and black rights\nSo Naomi or we want to get a a little bit a practical here but let me give you a kind of a a different example in the ... we've been using if I I I'm kind of old and my started leaving us let's say if it ever existed is long in the past\nIf I Try to go to a hot club I'll be turned down a but by the guy at the door I feel bad about died I'll think young people have all these privileges they can they can read stuff and nine point fonts they can go to good clubs but then if I beat up by the\nPolice for complaining or I Would feel much more serious problem was there you know my rights had been violated whereas in the earlier case may be just there was kind of an unfairness involved a little less serious [noise] now\nHow should philosophers ah think about these things or\nIf we're not going to just do this kind of let's figure out the ideal society but let's figure out the basis for the difference this for the distinctions we made for things that are outrageous violations of justice and things that are just kind of sad facts about our society how should we get started doing that\nWell I think there is a priority for a agree just violations of justice if you're if you're talking if you're looking at the whole social political picture on the other hand if you're if you're a specialist in social philosophy and media studies or\nYou might not care that much and that's fine that's just not what you're working on but if you're looking at the society if you're looking at what's happening in contemporary times I think we have certain things that need to come first\nSo as as a practical example a lot of people think about how how should we think how do you think of affirmative action or in this context of privilege versus violation of rights\nSome people would think of affirmative action as breaking down barriers\nTo be admitted to there's not that the people people's rights are being violated but certain structures of privilege of being broken down [noise]\n[noise] yeah affirmative action is just ...\nIn that case I think that one one of the results of white advantage you could call white privileges that if people are in a position of power they're going to use it for people they know so if you can uh\nUh admit uh students or or hire a other faculty you're going to go to to people like you to children and friends to two people you already know and if you're white it's likely be on the white people\nAction and that's called cronyism\nNow affirmative action is a way of of a breaking into that and and creating more opportunities it's not\nIt's not just creating opportunities for people of color or for women it's it's creating opportunities in the structure it's it ain't going into that structure of cronyism which is lined up with white privilege\nSo that sounds like so you think there it sounds ... is that improving justice is if you cronyism as anti justice a ton of distributing I mean this is a kind of distribution of thing for him and he is in right who distribute this club memberships to it's kind of ... that sounds on us so it sounds like\n... even though you think a kind of justice is better served by the language of the pursuit of a kind of justice is better served by adopting the language of rights and protecting the right this is a sphere of justice in which\nA breaking down systems of privilege breaking down these distribution of systems is also a part of justice is is that right yes\nYeah there are different different forms of justice is immediate justice you do not want the police to be able to come up to you or your children and shoot them on site that's extremely unjust I mean that's an emergency or\nA situation of injustice but you know there are wider a structural forms of social justice you what you want if we if we have a democracy where to continue to work on having a democracy\nYou want everybody to have a a reasonable opportunity for the good luck than one of the ways that that can happen\nIs to break into systems that are closed because of tradition or because of racial hierarchy and affirmative action is a way of doing that\nOkay that's that's good Charles from Montclair is on the line welcome to philosophies on Charles\n[laughter] yes I have a different take on this and I think it's more of a matter of cloth that if you are but we can America or part of the ... ... ... ...\nYou get to differently than if you're a poor white or black coal pull anything\nYou put in the middle class and to give you an ... a former President George W book brought into Harvard Business school the coal you'll see difficult to get into the power of the people who the student that you know you could I Do this or do you do the\nSame thing you can tell you\nI I might have been able to earn a senior at Yale us bell I could've coop [laughter] I don't need to do that in both\nBut that was a long time ago it would be pretty hard to replicate George Bush's success don't advise young people coming up to rely on family connections to get them into Yale or however it doesn't work well\nLet me give you a different ... Kendall betray us you know he was caught ending as Mr ... okay until you paid for hundreds of thousands of fine\n... family whereas the whistle blower ... was put to sleep for the rest of the life by a foreign government\nNow is that going to do with\nA thanks for the government uh Charles I'm going to turn this over and ask a Naomi what she thinks\nWell I think class of ... so far and then you run into is just the status of for example Henry Louis Gates was I'm African American a professor at Harvard\nOr have had that incident a few years ago where he was stopped after returning trying to get into his own house who's got into an altercation with police was arrested [noise] um [noise]\nA President Obama has been treated with incredible disrespect or which after a while one can only conclude has a racial component it it it's not it's not class so yeah sure class\nAnd and you know classes not um [noise] one miner less a matter of income I mean it has to culture and has to do is um networks of social capital education\nClass and money ap classes important but it's not the whole story because um there have been studies on every level of class whites are better off than black on every socioeconomic yeah\nI Want to take you back to the distinction you made at the top but I I like but I Want to target it a little more uh you'd you distinguish white privilege or\nAs a system of perks from white supremacy as an ideology and all that and uh I get your distinction I think it's an important distinction are but I Want to push you a little bit because I was recently reading some stuff with Cornel West and the diagnosis the problem with a\nPresident Obama by saying President Obama refuses to address the fact\nHe's too afraid to address the fact that the U.S is still a white supremacist a society it's not legally so I mean the laws and at the same but the root problem\nIn the U.S is is white supremacy and used to you if you look at a critically he things you see it everywhere no one can Cornel West is I assume you Cornel West is wrong what do you think he's real ...

impunity uh and and when whites are mistreated they're usually isn't in well you're just really my point no I'm refuting your point the problem isn't the cops are wrong to respect the rights of whites\nThe point is that are wrong to disrespect the rights of black\nClaim wait a minute are you denying that there's such a thing as white privilege\nNo not at all but I'm saying that having your rights are respected is not an example of white ... book can you order eliminate racial injustice\nDon't focus on white privilege right closing the country clubs or a a won't help much focus on securing the too often trampled rights of people of color okay\nPerks are belonging to the country club but but uh uh I'm a white supremacy is a lot more serious I got just a fact of\n... that you're making a nice them nice distinction will have a dig more deeply more deeply into them they're important distinctions but right now I'm going to remind our audience you're listening to philosophy talk and today we're thinking about white privilege and racial injustice is eliminating white privilege to key to\nAchieving racial justice or is it really a matter of securing the rights of blacks\nDoesn't really matter whether we use the language of privilege or the language of rights to describe our racial situation can't we just try to fix it and forget about Samantha debates privileged writes injustice plus your calls and emails when philosophy talk continues\nYou can get a monthly e newsletter by taxing the word philosophy to two to eight to eight state current upcoming

do which they killed by the police each year our police shooting more black people and white people we don't know there's no national statistics on new and keeps accurate statistics on police shooting

if you wind the R I give you stick around as you\nIt by a\nReally a privilege to be white and All right or is there a deeper wrong to write I John Perry this is philosophy talk the program that questions everything\nIncluding your poetry but not your intelligence I'm Ken Taylor and we're thinking about white privilege and racial injustice is the key to achieving racial justice eliminating white privilege or is it inventing black rights or to those amounted to the same thing our guest is Naomi ...\nFrom the University of Oregon a author of a white privilege and black rights\nSo now I mean I think we can all agree on the existence of a certain phenomena and these are various dimensions black people are often treated with less respect than white people and many contacts have less ... less access on average to the good things of life and all that everybody can agree about that phenomena\nBut practically speaking I Wonder why doesn't matter whether we describe this phenomenon in terms of white privilege or black right what does it matter practically speaking\nFrom matters because there's been an erosion due to a couple or or more a U.S Supreme Court rulings of um constitutional rights so the Fourth Amendment is supposed to give us all a protection against unreasonable search and seizure and the fourteenth amendment\nOr it's supposed to give everyone equal protection under the law\nNow these amendments are seem to have been violated in these recent high profile cases and uh uh the violators the killers are are not punish you know there are there not indicted or else they're not convicted but\nAre you saying that if we I mean okay ... that's all sounds right to me but there you go yeah ... ... ... it sounds like you're suggesting and I'm just trying to make clear whether you are not\nYou sound like you're suggesting if we adopt this discourse of white privilege instead of the discourse of of of of violations of black right we're going to be blind to exactly what's wrong what's going wrong in a situation\nThat's right you know the problem with it ... it was white privileges not the reality is that why you're better off I mean that is a problem but that's not what I'm disputing I'm just saying the discourse of white privilege especially when white people engage in this discourse\nIs kind of ... you know what it's like it's like it's like food is talking about how wonderful their meal is in response to hearing about world hunger\n[laughter] [laughter] well you say gee that sounds\nThat sounds like a pretty darn ing can I say the word damning uh uh uh in in ... indictment of it just goes to fight for and it also sounds like you think it is mostly white people you think ooh engaging the discourse of of of of\nOf white privilege and and but I Know why\nIt may not be for self serving reason it just may be oblivious or oblivious reasons oblivion um I ... I think one has to at this point to be a little delicate in in distinguishing Hussein\nBlack people talking about see how why to better off and talk about white privilege\nThen if white people in answer to a stark injustices start talking about how privileged they are and we're hearing a lot of that from otherwise well meaning white people that's what I'm trying to ... ah make a little intervention or concerning\n... Sunday on me philosophically speaking from Plato's Republic two roles theory of justice philosophers who think about justice tend to go off to thinking about an ideal society now I guess in an ideal society we certainly wouldn't be trampling the rights of blocks\nBut we also wouldn't have at least undeserved privileges for individual rights and know privileges for for people because of their race but it is focusing on an ideal society an ideal justice leading us to kind of\nBush to problems one of which is much more grave and serious than the other together [noise]\nWell yeah I mean you are self centered if we had an ideally just society we wouldn't have these discrepancies but we don't and if you actually look at real history not the history of philosophy but real history [noise] people don't care about justice what they care about is injustice\nSo you see that today you know the black lives matter movement ... didn't come out of a\nPhilosophy clubs wanting to perfect the chandelier of ideal justice hanging from selling the universe [laughter] I mean that came that came from an impassioned gut reaction to to blood on the street\nYou say you have quite a way with words I have to tell you that I Love your way with with what I Want to ask you a question I Want to ask a question though about what I mean I owe a ... we'll get back to the ideal versus a you know non ideal justice but I Want to I Want to focus on white people just for a little bit\n'cause there are lots of white people who will uh I don't like to generalize but there are lots of people who will acknowledge white privilege and they they take it to be a sign of their bona fides\nAs an ally to marginalized people that they are willing to acknowledge their white privilege there are others who will deny vehemently deny a white privilege they well they will turn to their own individual for a joint effort and blah blah blah so I mean it's a complicated thing and how I Wonder\nWhether the you think that those who deny what religion are those who who are willing to acknowledge white privilege or in any way morally different or the birds of a feather or the two sides of the same going or what\nWas political um it's political and I ... in several different levels I mean there are a number of whites who are pretty upset about issues of social injustice\nAnd they'll do more than just acknowledge that their privilege they may actually do some research of support some clauses that lead to legal reforms um and then there are whites who are sort of appalled who are comfortable who like to think of themselves as nice people\nAnd they suddenly become aware that their privilege because they're white and their response to social injustice\nFull schedule at lift quake dot O. R. G. [noise]\n[laughter]\n... lining with them and not and that they catch my eye and not directly plan our ethos jak\nShelters that so I look back now to\nGet a lot more than a week down\n\n\nBeyonce and a song called formation what she's saying at the super bowl [noise]\nAccording to Saturday Night live white people all over America were shocked to find out that beyond say was black or any rate a person of color some people thought the performance was too focused on race and identity politics\nWith white singer have the privilege of avoiding that kind of criticism I John Perry this is philosophy talk the program that questions\nEverything except your intelligence I'm Ken Taylor our guest is ... from the University of Oregon and we're thinking about white privilege and black rights\nSo Naomi or we want to go to a little bit a practical here but let me give you a kind of a a different example in the ... we've been using if I I I'm kind of old and my studies\nI Try to go to a hot club I'll be turned down a but by the guy at the door I feel bad about that I'll think young people have all these privileges they can they can read stuff and nine point fond slick and go to good clubs\nBut then if I beat up by the police for complaining or I Would feel much more serious problem was there you know my rights had been violated whereas in the earlier case may be just there was kind of an unfairness involved a little less serious [noise] now\nHow should philosophers ah think about these things or you know if we're not going to just do this kind of let's figure out the ideal society but let's figure out the basis for the difference is for the distinctions we made for things that are outrageous violations\nOf justice and things that are just kind of sad facts about our society how should we get started doing that\nWell I think there is a priority for a agree just violations of justice or if you're if you're talking if you're looking at the whole social political picture on the other hand if you're if you're a specialist in social philosophy and media studies or\nYou might not care that much and that's fine that's just not what you're working on but if you're looking at the society if you're looking at what's happening in contemporary times I think we have certain things that need to come first\nSo as as a practical example a lot of people think about how how should we think how do you think of affirmative action or in this context of privilege versus violation of rights might some people would think of affirmative action as breaking down\nBarriers of white privilege right rather than I mean nobody has a right to be admitted to there's not that the people in people's rights are being violated but certain structures of privilege of being broken down [noise] [noise]\nYeah I ... in that case I I think that one one of the results of white advantage you could call white privileges that if people are in a position of power they're going to use it for people they know so if you can uh\nUh admit students or or hire a other faculty you're going to go to to people like you to children and friends to two people you already know and if you're white it's likely be on the white people affirmative action and\nThat's called cronyism now affirmative action is a way of of a breaking into that and and creating more opportunities it's not\nIt's not just creating opportunities for people of color or for women it's it's creating opportunities in the structure it's it ain't going into that structure of cronyism which\nIs lined up with white privilege so that\nSounds like so you think that it sounds like it is that improving justice that is if you cronyism as anti trust is a kind of distributing I mean this is a kind of distribution of thing cronyism right who knew like distribute this club memberships to it's kind of ... that sounds unjust so it sounds like\nEven though you think a kind of justice is better served by the language of the pursuit of a kind of justice is better served by adopting the language of rights and protecting the right this is a sphere of justice in which\nA breaking down systems of privilege breaking down these distribution of systems is also a part of justice is is that right yes\nYeah there are different there are different forms of justices immediate justice you do not want the police to be able to come up to you or your children and shoot them on site that's extremely unjust I mean that's an emergency or a situation of injustice but you know there are white\nYou what you want if we if we have a democracy where to continue to work on having a democracy\nYou want everybody to have a a reasonable opportunity for the goods more than one of the ways that that can happen is to break into systems that are closed because of tradition or because of racial hierarchy\nAnd affirmative action is a way of doing that\nOkay that's that's good Charles from Montclair is on the line welcome to philosophies on Charles\n[laughter] yes I have a different take on this and I think it's more of a matter of cloth that if you are but we shouldn't America or part of the ...\n... ... ... ... you get to differently than if you're a poor white or black coal pull anything you put in the middle class\nAnd to give you an ... a former President George W book brought into Harvard Business school the coal you'll see difficult to get into the policy in the ... the students like\nNo you know could I Do this or do you do this but the same thing is they tend to tell you I I might have been able to earn a senior at Yale yes well I Would have to [laughter] I don't need to do that in both\nBut that was a long time ago it would be pretty hard to replicate George Bush's success don't advise young people coming up to rely on family connections to get them into Yale or however it doesn't work well let\nMe give you a different ... for the general Petraeus you know he was caught handing dismissed the secret okay until he pays a hundred thousand dollar fine and and now he's in pro if we can do to stop the shirt might go to the facts and making ... ...\nWhereas the whistle blower phones ... was put to sleep for the rest of his life by a foreign government\nNow is that a lot of different\nAh thanks for the call a job I'm going to turn this over and ask a Naomi what she thinks\nWell I think class on ... so far and then you run into issues of status up for example Henry Louis Gates was I'm African American professor at Harvard\nOr have had that incident a few years ago where he was stopped after returning trying to get into his own house who's got into an altercation with police was arrested [noise]\nUm [noise] a President Obama has been treated with incredible just respect or which after a while one can only conclude has that racial component it it it's not it's not class so yeah sure class\nAnd and you know classes not um [noise] one model is a matter of income I mean it has to culture and has to do is um networks of social capital education\nClass and money add class is important but it's not the whole story because um there have been studies on every level of class whites are better off than black on every socioeconomic yeah\nTo take you back to the distinction you made at the top but I I like but I Want to target it a little more uh you'd you distinguish white privilege or\nAs a system of perks from white supremacy as an ideology and all that and uh I get your distinction I think it's an important distinction uh but I Want to push you a little bit because I was recently reading some stuff of Cornell west\nAnd he diagnosed as a problem with the\nPresident Obama by saying President Obama refuses to address the fact you stupid afraid to address the fact that the U.S is still a white supremacist a society it's not legally so I mean the laws and at the same but the root problem", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Philosophy Talk", "city": "San Francisco",

public policy at the University of California Berkeley He's the author of saving capitalism for the many not the few\nBob welcome to philosophy die\nA thank you very much Ken ...\nI Know you feel strongly about this topic that we want to talk to you about the influence of money in politics and I'm particularly concerned with the question of whether all this money in politics is really consistent with a thriving democracy I what I fear that it is not I I Wonder what you think\nIt definitely is not a and this is not a new issue uh years ago a really at the tail end of the first gilded age\nWhen economic power was concentrated and wealth is concentrated in a very few hands or the eminent jurists Louis Brandeis a said and I can only paraphrase him a we have a choice we can either have great wealth in the hands of the very few people or we can have a democracy we cannot have both\nSo let's distinguish a economic equality and inequality from political equality and inequality I mean\nI I Would think that democracy as part of its foundational thing\nIs committed to equal access to the means of political participation independently of well that's the principle of democracy equality of income that's a good thing but I don't know if that's a fun foundational some degree of equality of income equality of opportunity is foundational democracy but\nCan't you kind of at least conceptually can't you have\nAn equal access to the means of political participation through regulations of various kind without necessarily solving the distribution no problem about how should we distribute well\nWell theoretically you cat and the Supreme Court though in a series of decisions\nHas decided that number one money is the equivalent of speech\nNow that was in a case called Buckley against ... once you decide that money is the equivalent of speech and you have a free speech First Amendment part of the constitution then that almost by definition gives people with a lot of money\nAnd again we're not talking about just garden variety of inequality here we're talking about white inequality we're talking or you give people with a lot of money a special access it's no longer equal access to the means of political participation\nAnd then secondly the Supreme Court in Citizens United against the ... the federal election commission\nDecides that corporations are people under the first amendment\nSo put those two concepts together money is speech corporations are people out of the first amendment and it's no longer equal access to the media would have been participation\n... let me uh John roles are whom I admire her this what he called the difference principle to account for the inequality said it's OK for people to have more than others as long as they're having more contributes to the overall uh goodness of life for everyone\nSomething like that to the least well ah you know to the least\nWell off so I I Would I Would modify roles in terms of realism and say okay they're going to have twice as much as they need to contribute to the last well off has America ever come close to the different principle um\nWell it's interesting a rolls also get along with that difference principle positive veil of ignorance so that's in coming up with what we might think of as the best set of rules and the most\nA perfect system with regard to distribution of income uh we would just say well we don't know where it will come out uh we we have available ignorance over\nHow we would do under those rules but they appear to be fair to us not withstanding\nThat are of what would be good for the system as a whole so that in the Nineteen fifties and sixties as we move toward a more much more egalitarian society than we had before\nI think we came close to the rosy indifference principal or the veil of ignorance principle hot starting in the late Nineteen seventies early Nineteen eighties I think we diverge from that most people\nWhen asked for example in a variety of polls not just a single but actually this has been repeated over and over again what do you think the current distribution of wealth is in the United states and what should it be\nA they come up with a you know a fairly consistent ideas but then when they're shown what it actually is almost everybody is surprised because what it actually is is so much more concentrated than what they believe it is or what they think it should be\nI Gotcha and that's kind of depressing but since I'm a philosopher it I'm a little pernicious I mean the money is speech idea\nI get why some people especially when it's a political ridge I get why some people are question that but\nThis seems kind of reasonable thought there look if I Want to advocate for something\nMe Ken Taylor I Want to advocate for something I don't want an advocate for it on the ... on the public airwaves and all that sort of stuff and I by the time to advocate for it and the government were to come along and say no you can't do that can you can spend your money to advocate for I don't know\nUh the end of the prison industrial complex I'd say government where do you get off restrict telling me how much I can spend of my own hard earned money or to advocate for things that I Believe in isn't as a democracy so I mean is it an odd thought that money is speech\nI Know it's not an odd thought at all and you put your finger exactly on the Supreme Court's logic ... the problem is that when you have as much concentration of income and wealth as we now have\nWell I think there are few justices that or why is there are few centers are wise but mostly I'd say are attempting to get some philosopher kings and there hasn't been too well either\nYou're listening to philosophy dog it's our two thousand sixteen election special\nKen here's a rental for you what are these three people have in common Jill Stein Gary Johnson and Darryl castle\nJohnson and started running for president I don't know the other one\nHe's running for president to\nThese are just three of the so called third party candidates\nBoth wiring third parties represented elsewhere in our government what explains the overwhelming dominance of the two major parties in American politics\nQuestioning our two party system when philosophy talked to a continuous [noise]\nWelcome back it's our twenty sixteen election special I'm John Kerry this is for us we talk on the program that question everything\nExcept your intelligence I'm ... we're looking through a philosophical ends at some of the big issue and the two thousand sixteen presidential campaign right now a closer look at our two party system [noise]\nThe Republican I Want to run as the Republican nomination\nIs there anyone\nOn stage is unwilling tonight to pledge here support to the eventual nominee of the Republican Party and its latch to not run an independent campaign\nParty presumptive nominee jumped on said that the Democratic party elites have been\nHanded sabotaging a grassroots campaign that tried to bring some huge numbers of young people independent non voters into their party instead they've shown exactly why America needs a new major party\nYour\nStand your conscience for free [noise]\nWe're joined now by laying Kmart she's a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution she's author of primary politics everything you need to know about how America nominates presidential candidate Elaine welcome to below the dog well thank you for having me\nLane you written in thought a lot about the two party system\nUm I don't think it's good or bad\nBecause the way I party system evolves is a reflection of the underlying way a country chooses to organize this democracy I think it's neutral just as I think a multi party system is also neutral they each have their upsides and there are downsides\nAnd the fact is they come out of the structure of the Democratic system that a country or state chooses to use for itself\nSo but wait a minute let's go down a little bit of it comes out on the structure of assisted another country uses words though to use ... or ... which is our design for democracy right it was mentioned parties anywhere in a minute and then about not only did our founding fathers are a part of it would be the death of democracy and all that so\nWhat are the ... well what I'm Talking about is our constitution established a house of representatives and we establish single member districts and any country as other countries have that have single member districts\nIt means that you will lead to one person from the district if you'll elect one person from the district it is very hard to divide that person individual into four or five different parties down the vote that would be cruel and unusual punishment yes most certainly would and not to mention very confusing\nSo let's look up to today there are a lot of people not just a few a lot of people who express a deep dissatisfaction with the two party system they expressed deep resentment that they've got this limited choice\nAnd that they want a third part they they're hungry for a third party it sounds to me like you're saying you're methods to those people are not not to put too fine a point of it and it is to get over it [laughter] I mean\nWell let me put it this way there is nothing that keeps any American from forming a political party there are there has\nBeen third parties in American history but again going back to the structure of the system if you have a winner take all districts\nIt means that it is very hard for a third party to get traction because getting twenty or twenty five percent of the vote just doesn't do anything for you whereas in a multi\nParty system or a multi a candidate district you get twenty five percent of the vote and you win twenty five percent of the seats in the parliament\nI'm In those countries a small party can grow it can get some power in one election do a good job in office maybe become part of the majority governing coalition and grow into the next election right in our system in or in any one one pass the poster stump\nIt's really hard for a third party to get traction\nThat's why mostly what happens to third parties and American democracy is that they get they've gotten incorporated into one of the two major parties\nSo so when I was a growing up uh France was really in disarray they couldn't get anything done and we were told books because they had so many different political parties nobody really hilly power than the goal took over and they did\nDid better but now in America we seem to have just two parties but also nothing gets done Congress can't do anything or do we managed to have the best the worst of both worlds [laughter] we're\nIn a period of our history where not just the parties about the voters are highly polarized and the parties are simply reflecting the what the voters are telling them we we are in a very highly polarized time and at some point\nThe polarized times in our republic before maybe the most dramatic being of course the party system prior to the civil war where they never could resolve things and they actually went to work for\nUm we were also highly polarized at the end of the nineteenth century so we've been through a lot of periods of polarization in American politics and they usually end by one party\nActually capturing a working majority and that is strong enough to a get some things done and be caused an end to the polarization\nBut no one of the consequences of what you're talking about oh no let's think about the nature of these two parties in a in a in a first pass opposed the single representative system versus a\nMulti party system was proportional representation those parties are going to be it seems to me 'cause it's a big complicated country yep those parties are gonna seemed to me highly kind of coalition Owen somewhat ideologically ducked fuse right\nNow yeah ... absolutely I mean they have to be they are they are the proverbial big tent\nUm for many years southern Democrats were very different from northern Democrats and New England Republicans were\nLiberal and very different from western Republicans\nUm yeah if they've always been big tent eight but they are also always evolving in other words there's nothing static about American political parties they've always changed um and you know the party of Lincoln\nAh the Eighteenth sixty Republican Party that was that declared the Emancipation Proclamation\nA lot of people at the Republican convention were wondering what happened to the party of Lincoln okay so there are always changing\nBut but I still want to go back to the current dissatisfaction with the two parties\nI mean the Tea Party found the Republican Party of then constituted highly unsatisfactory the Sadrists people find the Democratic party highly unsatisfied many people call themselves independent though they still vote for one party or the other more or less\nConsider family I mean it sounds like a ... so you got these two parties are highly ... coalition oh but there's bound to be decided to function with them because of that\nBut it also sounds like your message to these folks who are highly dissatisfied is", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Philosophy Talk", "city": "San

I guess is Steven Pinker and we're asking whether reason and save us\nCan reason only tell us how to achieve our ultimate aims are kind of also tell us what ultimate aims are worth adopting join the conversation I raising your hand and the ... come around to\nSee so look philosophers have talked about the nature of reason for a long long time way Aristotle Plato or none of that's been was scientific and was like upper reorient intuitive I Want you to put your cognitive scientist Diana I'm from the perspective of cognitive science how should we think of\nOf reason in this in the twenty first century is it like single capacity was Descartes right with Plato right is it a bundle of distinct capacities tell us the most astounding thing that's probably the science is\nThe ... discovered about reason\nThere's systematic are discrepancies between reasoning that is how the human mind perceives left to its own devices and reason in a sense of our best understanding of what follows from what\nFor a long list of discrepancies between how we think and how we often like\nTo live like this normative uh ... how we ought to think what counts as good as friends lost his rebel and that stuff so that norms of rationality right and you're saying the striking thing to come and scientists discovered is that we don't live up to those norms a brain is not designed to live up to them so\nI'm ... now of course it can't be the case that were incapable of rationality otherwise we've never be able to make the argument that people are systematically irrational because we wouldn't have a benchmark of rationality against which to compare the human\nWho make that argument people like you know what that really [laughter] I mean you're the world right now the scientist you bought that argument what about the ordinary or\nWere you you the argument would be incoherent unless we had a standard of what rationality was you couldn't say people are irrational because there'd be no such thing as rationality and we wouldn't be able to have a conversation in the\nFirst place or a conversation about anything else for that matter you wouldn't be able to have this program if there wasn't a standard of rationality that you are exercising\nAnd things like ... I mean I agree and it seems like the question then is okay how do we get from one ... how do we get from our flawed everyday reasoning process is to this more normative standard reason\nYeah and that's where the norms and institutions of Greece and I come in principles like a free speech like open debate like the uh avoiding the fallacies like arguing ad hominem or Adrienne from the historical origin of an argument\nThat demand that is a claim isn't periodically be confronted against evidence or from the world all the things that aren't terribly natural to us but once we implemented them\nWe've seen that collectively they make a smarter than any one of us as individuals\nThat is what I was gonna say collectively cause some stuff you were talking about requires kind of collective structures but my vision\nRight is it gets ... in my brain I open my eyes I focus I see the clock I Need your help to see the clock but I'm a new job to see that it's a clock 'cause I Need the concept that I get that\nBut my hearing doesn't require your aid I mean sort of reason is some like capacity in my brain why do I need the help of all you guys do a sand trap\nWell in fact one of the fundamental on discovery for philosophy is that I that naive realism just opening your eyes and seeing the world as it is is false that there are you about their sexual illusions and just as there are cases what our eyes to see that there are cases where our minds to see us\nYou've got to show where your eyes to see you pull out a yardstick you um use better methods of a ... and the same thing for logical\nWell but there's something there was a capacity in my brain for vision this past Sunday in my brain for audition for sensing things up right from sensory motor recording\nThat there are illusions and like that but is there a capacity in my brain cause all that stuff you talk about about corruption and the norms that doesn't seem like it's just in my brain it somehow in on the chili electrical votes\nCan I mean so I mean I think the norms institutions was a really important in deep one right the collectively we can achieve much more uh in in the demand reason that we can and eventually\nBut you know you're encountering in one way to reach comments to say oh my God\nWe're all system on were all just blindly distinguished but you do you make a dance and wonder is this is right on so that has a has a thinking it's just a woman just sort of our our automatic kind of risk stick a very flawed way as a person the data from the world\nBut we also have system too which is our reasoning where we can we can actually reflect on and say oh\nWell boy or the straw my drink looks back\nBut I guess maybe it isn't actually yeah it's like an apartment there were you know I I tend to agree with Steve ... even as an individual level or not doomed because we've got our system to even as\nI mean I I mean do you like those are things because there are people who don't like the system one system to distinction but are you one who likes it or just like\nYeah I I I think it captures something about cognition and I would just add that the system to works not just because we can put on thinking caps and sit back and reflect and and Bob punter slowly\nBut also we have social institutions such as the fact that if we make a claim someone else can disagree with us and we have to defend that or if it's an empirical claim were called on to do I get evidence to do experiments to consult data so that was for social institutions\nThat our system to a recruits in the first place and insists on applying that makes for them to affect us\nSo if I were to try to ask well what actually is this capacity for a reason\nIt's partly in our psychology\nBut it's partly somehow distributed in our collective lives together because you're like you are like an instrument for your like part of my talking to the system 'cause I could it's like mill says you know anybody who just at those his own side of the\nWere coming to you from Kepler is books in Menlo Park California will take more questions from our live in lively and rational and they have an audio and enlightenment to

musical gas Tiffany often an Adam Sean I'm ... and this is philosophy talk program questions ever\nAccept your intelligence I'm Ken Taylor we're asking whether reason can save us with the speaker of the Harvard University\nYou might want to go back to that question okay even perfectly rational individual noises rationally going about it it doesn't necessarily add up to a rational collective decision I think this is one of the problems of the twenty first century so what do you think\nKnow we we obviously can't optimize uh everything I everyone's preferences hour or ... years even any criteria by which was preferences can be simultaneously yeah optimize the other hand you can't dispute whether or not rationality and progress knowledge\nIs possible of course it's possible we voted needed smallpox we said something to the moon we invented the Internet and the smartphone and acts like that but I gave something has the\nA problem like global warming which is a collective action problem right which I Can't just come up I suppose I could have the killer technology that's all that but that's you know if the tipping point gets too long ago to make people adopt and use that technology and all this stuff\nLike that we've got these collective action problems and the difference between now and before is that we have impacts on a global scale but we don't really have global institutions or at least not adequate global institution that tornadoes all so I don't know I think we could be headed for like deep disaster even if we're all a individually\nFor like an ad that just to try to make it a little worse [laughter] I mean I I'm a big fan of reason as you are\nBut I have a worry in this particular ... um that you know the worry would be well only the only other case you're talking about there isn't really a tension\nBetween um the kind of progress that comes out of these indictments ... an institution but here it seems as though the progress depend\nUpon technological advancement that is causing climate and so here it seems like we have ... ... is a real problem for the view we can't just say well let's let's sort of sick in Lightman values on the six progress on this program is a very thing that's been causing the problem in the first\nWell I Know because if it's causing the potential for disaster that that's not progress I mean I think we could we would all agree well but the thing about a recent as they can always stop back in ... and ... the problem is that the application of reasons in the past has caused so far\nAnd so we can I indeed frame the technological question as given that we have improved our physical standards of living so far the costs of the environment\nHow do we change that trade offs that we can enjoy the same benefit of energy capture of moving people around heating homeschooling homes making cement without a releasing massive amounts I feel too and I got I think you also mystic about that that ... what was the thing is I'm not making a\n... will succeed I'm challenging the idea that there's some inherent reason that we can\nYeah but I don't think of and then going back to the collection active right Bob uh once again I'm not but they make a prediction that pets that I Know that we're going to solve it maybe ... maybe that will be disaster however I don't think it's a problem it is the principal we cannot solve it because we know that collective action problems\nI have been solved on a global scale true global institutions again there's no I'm not guaranteeing this all day but there is a pathway by which everyone agrees to a sacrifice ...\nLike I like the ... let's get some more or less the rudest there there's not a guarantee that will take it just there's no in principle reason that we can't agree about that one of them have lobbied out there when I Am a good\nIdea I'm from Iran um I think it's a little bit unfair to judge a reason with advances in technology you know technology is something that reason is kind of the foundation but uh you know\nHow does the reason made us happy or like sending man to the moon is it something valuable you know\nThere's two parts of one of them is that there can be things that make us better off that don't necessarily make us happier\nBut in general the answer is we we have gotten happier on average a majority of countries to which we have data over the decades levels of happiness shows that the majority of those countries happiness has increased United States by the way he's not one of them [laughter]\nBut I'm a joy eighty eighty seven percent of countries for which we do have data show that they have gotten happy and says you have a\nI said well I think about this question is um Horatio reason her ready for science rent for progress but you know what about in China right so this is something I think a lot about my work about the you know as the the reach of science expands\nAnd in your book in ... shows up such things like ... which is in ... but I think\nIt's also like Sprite some ... some fairy godmother isn't you know when it's love art and things like that and so I I Want us to kind of rephrase that happiness question this way you know isn't doesn't happiness also depend on ... and where's the where's the it was the French I'm just gonna\nShrinking shrinking shrinking so he's intended by science\nAnd then I thought you know as I Am and chanted by by love and by art\nThat the strikes and ferries you can keep okay travel [laughter] they were metaphorical yeah this is I I I deal with this in in late ... now because I Know there is I Know there's the view that well we've eliminated famine and we've doubled human life spans and leave a reduced child mortality by a factor of a hundred and we've\nEliminated war for most of the plant but yeah I saw\nOne in order to you know [laughter] you know about a hit on a\nTreadmill you know you get more and more stuff and you say it will be settled there is [laughter] I mean that's part of it even though he didn't like what is the point what is the purpose what is my life for what do I give my life over too\nWell you know I really don't think that eliminating the disease and starvation and poverty and war is is all that boring and meeting [laughter] but even if you don't a segment war true and it turns out he said no it's not true that the studies that show that people are not happier after winning the lottery that veterans are to the wrong people really are happier\n[laughter]\nEven if that were true living to uh the age of eight is better than living to ... okay that's a that's a good question I but I I Do agree that we need to have a more heroic narrative of the fact that we are a limited in child mortality and we are reducing

on the Stanford campus\nThat for a country to Boston and I did for forty here\nToday it's a special edition of philosophy we are we looking beyond the horse race asking some of the philosophical questions raised by this year's presidential election\nTrump and Clinton dominate the headlines in part because the Republican and Democratic Party's dominate our government which leaves a lot of people wishing they had more viable third party options so why do we have the two party system where you know we'll talk with rolling Kmart from the Brookings Institution\nIn a democracy you end up with something that a lot of people don't like because you have to make a compromise\nDid your party nominees also stems from the influence of money on every aspect of the campaign and politics in general\nWill examine the role of money in politics with former secretary of labor Robert\nRegime if we're free and equal citizens we actually should have an equal opportunity to influence political debate\nNo water if you're so dissatisfied with the candidate that you wonder if you should vote at all\nWill you be in good company the U.S has some of the lowest voter participation in the

do you vote why should you\nNot everyone thinks voting is the way to go I Do know is so harshly they're living in California I figured\nThat President or this famous decided it's not like we're in a state\nI don't feel as voting is not going to have an impact\nOn people's hair fires I feel like if it would be more for my own sort of felt validation feeling like I was a way it probably will not get as\nMany argue there's no point in voting because we have a two party system that limits chances if any true democracy in\nOur founding father George Washington thought all political parties are not\nIn his farewell address Seventeen Ninety six he wrote\nThe alternate domination of one faction over another sharp and by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension or is it you know a frightful despotism\nAnd then there's money there's a lot of it and politics according to open secrets three months before the twenty sixteen presidential elections Hillary Clinton had received over four hundred and thirty million dollars in campaign contributions over half of them from corporations\nSo uh the first thing I Would do would be to make a election day a national holiday uh I think that not only lowered some of the barriers for participation but it also gives people a more positive reason to vote because it's sort of\nSuggests a this sort of public element of celebration around elections or rather than just thinking of it as something\nReally a private that you do a ... just like filling out any other kind of farm\nOkay that's the first thing you do you is there more we're going to be three things\nYeah so a voter registration making voter registration automatic and having a a consistent and and uh up to date and efficient method for\nA seeing who was on the voter rolls I think would be very important and that would be absolutely necessary for following through with the third thing I Would do which would be to make a voting compulsory with the system similar to

He's the author of saving capitalism for the many knocked a few\nBut welcome to philosophy died\nA thank you very much Ken and John\nI Know you feel strongly about this topic that we want to talk to you about the influence of money in politics and I'm particularly concerned with the question of whether all this money in politics is really consistent with a thriving democracy I what I fear that it is not I I Wonder what you think\nIt definitely is not a and this is not a new issue uh years ago a really at the tail end of the first gilded age\nWhen economic power was concentrated in wealth is concentrated in a very few hands uh the eminent jurists Louis Brandeis a shed and I can only paraphrase him a we have a choice we can either have great wealth in the hands of the very few people or we can have a democracy we cannot have both\nSo let's distinguish a economic equality and inequality from political equality and inequality I mean\nI I Would think that democracy as part of its foundational thing\nIs committed to equal access to the means of political participation independently of well that's a principle of democracy equality of income that's a good thing but I don't know if that's a fun foundational some degree of equality of income equality of opportunity is foundational democracy but\nCan't you kind of at least conceptually\nCan't you have a equal access to the means of political participation to regulations or various kind without necessarily solving the distribution no problem about how she'll be distributed wells\nWell theoretically you can the Supreme Court though in a series of decisions\nHas decided that number one money is the equivalent of speech\nNow that was in a case called Buckley against ... once you decide that money is the equivalent of speech and you have a free speech First Amendment part of the constitution then that almost by definition gives people with a lot of money\nAnd again we're not talking about just garden variety of inequality here we're talking about why the inequality we're talking or you give people with a lot of money a specialist\nParticipation and then secondly the Supreme Court in Citizens United against the ... of the federal election commission decides that corporations are people under the first amendment\nSo put those two concepts together money is speech corporations are people out of the first amendment and it's no longer equal access to the media would have been participation ...\nLet me uh John roles are whom I admire her this what he called the difference a principled to account for the inequality said it's OK for people to have more than others as long as they're having more contributes to the overall\nUh goodness of life for everyone something like that to the least well ah you know to the least well off so I I Would I Would modify roles in terms of realism and say okay we're going to have twice as much as they need to contribute to the last well off has America ever come close to the different principle um\nWell it's interesting a rolls also get along with that difference principle positive veil of ignorance so that's in coming up with what we might think of as the best set of rules and the most\nA perfect system with regard to distribution of income or we would just say well we don't know where it will come out uh we we have a veil of ignorance over\nHow we would do under those rules but they appear to be fair to us not withstanding that's fairness or is a kind of a matter of what would be good for the system as a whole\nShow that in the Nineteen fifties and sixties as we move toward a more much more egalitarian society than we had before\nI think we came close to the rosy indifference principal or the veil of ignorance principle\nHot starting in the late Nineteen seventies early Nineteen eighties I think we diverge from that most people\nWhen asked for example in a variety of polls not just a single but actually this has been repeated over and over again what do you think the current distribution of wealth is in the United states and what should it be\nA they come up with a you know a fairly consistent ideas but then when they're shown what it actually is almost everybody is surprised because what it actually is is so much more concentrated than what they believe it is or what they think it should be\nI Gotcha and that's kind of depressing but since I'm a philosopher and I'm a little pernicious I mean the money is speech idea\nI get why some people especially when it's a political British I get why some people are question that but it seems kind of reasonable thought there look if I Want to advocate for something\nMe Ken Taylor I Want to advocate for something I don't want an advocate for it on the ... on the public airwaves and all that sort of stuff and I by the time to advocate for it and the government were to come along and say no you can't do that can you can spend your money to advocate for I don't know uh\nThe end of the prison industrial complex I'd say government where do you get off\nRestrict telling me how much I can spend of my own hard earned money or to advocate for things that I Believe in isn't as a democracy so I mean is it an odd thought that money is speech\nKnow it's not an odd thought at all and you put your finger exactly on the Supreme Court's logic or the problem is that when you have as much concentration of income and wealth as we now have\nAnd the same for the Supreme Court [noise]\nWell I think there are a few justices or why is there are few centers are wise but mostly I Would say or attempt to get some philosopher kings and there hasn't been too will either\nYou're listening to philosophy dog gets are two thousand and sixteen election special\nCare here's a rental for you what are these three people have in common Jill Stein Gary Johnson and Darryl castle\nJohnson and started running for president I don't know the other one\nHe's running for president

onto the Democratic party elites have been caught red handed sabotaging a grassroots campaign that tried to bring your numbers of young people independents a non voters into their party instead they've shown exactly why American anything new major party\nYou\nStand and speak and vote your conscience for candidates up and down the ticket\nPrice [noise]\nWe're joined now by laying Kmart she's a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution she's author of primary politics everything you need to know about how America nominates presidential candidate Elaine welcome to below three dogs\nWell thank you for having me\nAway and you've written in part a lot about the two party system let's let's start with a final verdict good thing or bad thing\nUm I don't think it's good or bad because the way I party system evolves is a reflection of the underlying way a country chooses to organize this democracy I think it's neutral just as I think a multi party system is also neutral they each have their upsides in their downsides\nAnd the fact is they come out of the structure of the Democratic system that a country or state chooses to use for itself\nSo but wait a minute let's go down a little bit of it comes out of the structure of it was just another country uses words to use ... or ... which is are designed for democracy right it was mentioned parties anywhere to men than anybody not did our founding fathers are part of it would be the death of democracy and all that so we're not talking about the plight\nWell what I'm Talking about is our constitution established a house of representatives and we establish single member districts and any country as other countries have that have single member districts it means that you will lead to one person from the district\nIf you'll elect one person from the district it is very hard to divide that person individual into four or five different parties down\nThe vote that would be cruel and unusual punishment yes the motor certainly would and not to mention very confusing so let's let's jump ahead\nToday there are a lot of people not just a few a lot of people who\nExpress a deep dissatisfaction with the two party system they expressed deep resentment that they've got this limited choice\nAnd that they want a third part of the they're hungry for a third party it sounds to me like you're saying your message to those people and not to put too fine a point of it and it is get over it I mean is that right\nWell let me put it this way there is nothing that keep any American from forming a political party there are there has\nBeen third parties in American history but again going back to the structure of the system if you have a winner take all districts it means that it is very hard for a third party to get traction because getting twenty or twenty five percent of the vote just doesn't do anything for you\nParty system or a multi a candidate district you get twenty five percent of the vote and you wind twenty five percent of the seats in the parliament\nI'm In those countries a small party can grow it can get some power in one election do a good job in office maybe become part of the majority governing coalition and grow into the next election right\nIn our system in or in any one one pass the post system it's really hard for a third party to get traction\nThat's why mostly what happens to third parties and American democracy is that they get they have gotten incorporated into one of the two major parties\nSo so when I was a growing up uh France was really in disarray they couldn't get anything done and we were told that it's because they had so many different political parties nobody really heavily per than the goal took over and they did\nDid better but now in America we seem to have just two parties but also nothing gets done Congress can't do anything or do we managed to have the best the worst of both worlds\n[laughter] we're in a period of our history where not just the parties by the voters are highly polarized and the parties are simply reflecting the what the voters are telling them we we are in a very highly polarized time and at some point this will break\nBut remember we've been through highly polarized times in our republic before maybe the most dramatic being of course the party system prior to the civil war where they never could resolve things and they actually went to war over it\nUm we were also highly polarized at the end of the nineteenth century so we've been through a lot of periods of polarization in American politics and they usually end by one party\nActually capturing a working majority and that strong enough to a get some things done and be caused an end to the polarization\nBut no one of the consequences of what do you enjoy talking about oh no let's think about the nature of these two parties in a in a in a first I suppose the\nSingle representative system versus a multi party system was proportional representation those parties are going to be it seems to me 'cause it's a big complicated country yep those parties are going to seem to me highly kind of coalition Owen somewhat ideologically the fuse right\nNow yeah that's absolutely I mean they have to be they are they are the proverbial big tent\nUm for many years southern Democrats were very different from northern Democrats and New England Republicans were liberal and very different from western Republicans um yeah if they've always been big chance but they are also always evolving in other words there's nothing static\nAbout American political parties they've always changed um and you know the party of Lincoln or the Eighteenth sixty Republican Party that was that declare the Emancipation Proclamation\nA lot of people at the Republican convention were wondering what happened to the party of Lincoln okay so there are always changing\nBut let's see I don't want to go back to the current dissatisfaction with the two parties I mean the Tea Party found the Republican Party is then constituted highly unsatisfactory the Sanders people from the Democratic party highly unsatisfied many people call themselves independent though they still vote for one party or the other more or less\nConsidered family I mean it sounds like a ... so you got these two parties are highly ... coalition oh but there's bound to be dissatisfaction with them because of that but it also sounds like your message to the folks who are highly dissatisfied", "show_name": "Philosophy Talk", "year": "2018",
