I mean we could spend an hour on the educational system of this country's still just astonishing to me that you know you think of you know you you you had your education in the United states now you had your education in ... fifty different states that have entirely different educational standards for their children yeah going up yes\nAbsolutely well there's an interesting educational element in the play the S. S. general that you referenced\nUm provides a disquieting civics history lesson to the audience in one of the more provocative elements in the play he remind the audience\nUm how America's Jim Crow laws provided a model for the Nazi lawyers drafting the Nuremberg Laws\nWhich provided which proved to be the foundation for the final solution\nAnd ultimately the extermination of six million European Jews\nTo the United states and this isn't something that we're taught in school the role that we played a in providing that model there was an interesting book that just came out which I Want to mention too deeply into your your listeners by James Whitman is a Yale professor it's called Hitler's American model extensively research into and goes\nInto those are the particulars of how that\nWill then we can go spend another hour or an IBM and Texaco and all kinds of chase Manhattan standard earlier Jersey yeah things that are we just had blinders on about yeah yeah\nSo I mean the obligation where that word comes from a why I've chosen as as a as the title of the play has a lot to do it again the history that my mom\nAnd my aunt and other survivors have you know there have namely that they felt obliged they felt obligated to teach to to reach out to young people to make sure that what happened to them what happened to those who perished wouldn't be forgotten\nAnd in some anti feel responsibility and a privilege as my mother son to continue that I I'm not a survivor but I can leverage the power of the theater to touch people that's my intent\nPretty much when I got here ... yeah well it's a it's a compelling evening of theater uh Wednesdays through Saturdays at eight\nSunday at two Sundays at two through November fourth Roger Grunwald ...

I decided to put a program together to conduct Spanish works by Frenchman\nIncluding rebels sultry bone marrow WC use on the ...\nPostcard barrier and added to the program Spanish your piano virtuoso Harvey ... performing ... piano concerto number three I caught up with the maestro backstage should they be solved just the other day after arsenal there's that conversation\nMaestro such a pleasure to welcome you back to our program open air my pleasure and his goal was to come to ... to San Francisco and to talk with you well we talked a little bit in the hallway before this actual interview and is it true that this is really the first time that you've actually conducted the bowl narrow in concert\nThat is true there was a was keeping it like a secret that's a well this is something a very special for me the whole program and all these species have done it many times I've recorded name and the tour with them and even the video which is the ... the less familiar one but\nIt's funny that we bought it at all\nSo the context to program eats that I thought\nThis was a perfect location to two and such a great program them based on Spanish inspired music a foreclosure inspires me I say with this with this wonderful piece and ... and you know I'm very happy that is my first time is here in San Francisco with with these or casinos are well and they love so much ... well\nA piece like bone marrow it seems like you to almost let the orchestra go on auto pilot I mean they know what's so well you know what's so well what are you bringing to the podium that might be different or do you just kind of stay out of the way\nWell it's it's as with every piece of music of course I'm a ... a very complex and and sophisticated beast needs a lot of [noise] a lot of help from the conductor or a lot of work\nAnd this one are you are right I mean it was the the snare drum stars then it goes to the end Fifteen minutes and but then of course it's very important your presence there are with\nEach other ... each of the section especially when Dale ... grows and grows and and ah you know that your ... confidence to the orchestra and strength and to keep the reason sharp\nAnd proud and and and ... and the ... LA again to flow in when it gets a heavier and began to another uh it it said something very special you you have to be there and you have to control over those aspects met at the same time and you have to know your role and you have to know how to step back as well well\nEveryone gets to work out into space that's for sure but especially the snare drum or who are uniquely positioned in the middle of the orchestra have you seen that done before or did you just want to try that as something different\n[noise] um I haven't seen that before but I've I've seen in different positions in in different settings or\nIn some concerts I Pretend to with with these these bats ah [noise]\nI I thought it could be somehow like when you have in the rock workers for the gym but all are put in the middle of the orchestra which is like a it's it's keeping and holding the rhythm together when you put a lot of the hops court in in the middle of in a row can assemble and uh you know it's like the\nLike the the the center point when and that keeps everything to gather that three them it's a kind of also conductor someone who leads the big army of musicians have has behind him and it works I spoke with a\nWith a with a ... player and he was very happy to try and and and it works very very well and everyone was very happy then also you thoughts\nOf visual um elements that he's also very effective and and you know very very very nice to see\nWell I'm sure it's always exciting to conduct a new orchestra that you haven't had as much familiar time with I'm sure it's also very rewarding to come back to an orchestra that you have such a nice relationship with and you know some of the musicians and you know what they can produce\nThe course this is a this for me it's such a\nSuch a gift I mean every every time every occasion I come back to San Francisco\nI Am just counting the days to to to come back here or because it really I cannot think of any other orchestra and the world I believed such a relation with um I've conducted\nPractically all over the top of his resume in the world in in in the past Fifteen Years and I keep going back to [noise]\n... and sometimes even coming a couple of times a year we made even some festival of two consecutive weeks on the theme we've explored viscerally\nAs we kind of possible repertoire from early but rock\nFrench grown up to two commissions to to a a word from years to come every possible style every possible configurations and then it sort of built a strong religion with players with the place would also with the city\nAnd uh I mean on state but also offstage or I can count so many times that I've\nGone with the players to sailing debate\nWith some of the musicians and and so it's a it's something really I I it pressure very match this religion and and this is why also every time I come here there is all every ... is it's absolutely unconventional at least challenging\nIt's it's a it's a new chance to explore new ideas and new aspects of this orchestra\nAnd every time is a it's a he's a great surprise and a great a music celebration for me well\nThat's a good time to renew those ties and those relationships because uh you know there's an opening here and a couple of years\nYeah I I Know that I Know that and then and precisely because I mean it's an orchestra I I Am ... and I think\nIt's it's still in this ... in this moment\nWhen the every everyone used to say that well more or less now there's the globalization and every orcas which tends to sound more as the same and there's not so much personality and they're just replay\nThing these orchestra keeps a very strong personality types to and you know uh it seemed Twenty years with the same music director and still going on and they're still making really an interesting problem in ... in challenging the audience and and and keeping everyone\nYou know excited and engaged and and and this is unique and is it out of the DNA of the orchestra\nAnd uh that's\n... you know this is a quality that Michael she sometimes has has a\nHe knows he's you know how to\nKeep she's enough to see some of the onus on these shows and and the and the audience as well and and the thing he's heritage is it's fantastic that uh [noise] you know you never know now the next ... to ... and um\nYou know it will be a very curious who who is taking over for for the next generation the next street over the circus right which is a it looks really very very exciting and and that would be very happy and then\nMargaret also teaches so low performance and as a tenured artist in residence at bravo theater in San Francisco her twelfth and apparently final show Latin standards\nExplores the loving funny and true story of perseverance and creative addiction passed down\nFrom immigrant father to his lesbian daughter she describes life as the blustery child of a child of a blustery Cuban job and that is both blessed I'm sure livid portrayals of characters from the sixties\nIn Manhattan to present day San Francisco such a pleasure to welcome market back to our our stage of open air [laughter]\nSo glad to be here I Love the show Oh thank you for doing it for ...\nWell last time we had you on it was a for a an appearance um in July with my guest host Peter Robinson to talk about a king of Cuba and they'll say it ain't so twelve than final\nWhere's that what's that all about [noise] you know um\nIt well okay to be perfectly honest I Am not retiring no way I'm just getting started baby but I have written twelve one person shows and a lot of the shows are about ... ah my parents and in fact that's how I started I'm\nEnjoying suddenly at the marsh where I Am now a in Nineteen Ninety One I wrote a piece about my mother called memory tricks\nAnd since then um I've written a new solo show every couple of years about something that is\nSomething that just really appears to me something that is obvious that I Want to write about this I Want to figure it out and explore it I think that it would have relevance to people and I've done that uh since Ninety One and well I pretty much um talked about everything I Need to\nUm as one person so now I Want to you know I Want to explore the things I'm a standup comic I Want to go back to that I Want to um\nPerhaps strike for more than one character but you know worse more lines for me [laughter] out is that\nMore than one character meaning more than one actual person because you often inherited many\nThe habit major changes issue I could take players are bad and you know just divvied up a little um but the the premise of the show is that it is my final farewell concert and um\nAnd it's also my first concert so um but it is my last one in of course I've got like twelve more coming in Berkeley will tell us about the the concert end of this that and I go\nThe um again out of the twelve pieces some of them just happened accidentally some of them happened because I'm offered a commission\nThis show started because of that I wasn't sure what my next solo show was going to be but I knew that I wanted to kind of wrap it up at twelve just numerology ugly speaking [noise]\nAnd I was offered a commission from a theater that I won't mention but it was in LA and they were going to um have all this money for a mixed media a performance and they said well Margie just can't go and tell the story you gotta do something else and I thought\nI thought well if I if I talked about these songs that my father wrote because my father really in my mind in the mind of his fans was a comedian or producer but he also wrote a couple of successful songs in Spanish that went up on the charts in um Spanish billboards\nSo I thought if I bring in these songs which I actually have like\nThe original um envelopes that he would mail to themself in lieu of actually going through the trouble of getting the copyright people thought back then if you send something to yourself registered then nobody can steal steal it so I had these envelopes I had the songs I had the actual recordings and I thought\nI'm going to do something with this so my first thought was I'm gonna I'm deconstruct them and I'm going to rock 'em out and like and then the money didn't come through the commission was actually sort of pie in the sky but it was already starting to write about my father as a songwriter\nAnd and other parts of his life that were just cool and happy and I started writing\nUm sometimes I get down be but I decided to write about all the best memories with my father and all the all the memories that made me go into this business in the way that he did which is kind of versatile in micro managing and all that and\nI happened to mention this to mark Russell who was presenting a under the radar festival off Broadway at the public theater [noise]\nAnd my director of many shows David Schweitzer and all of a sudden Latin standards was the thing and ... and it opened in twenty Seventeen that the the public theater and\nUh the times was there I had laryngitis that night I was ready to be killed I was ready but really for sure it's my last show but it I I made it\nTo us but yeah so tell us about what it was like growing up with a Willie ... you're done well is that our we citizenship earlier you know a ... jacket jak Reddit chip I read but he took it from ... a new is\nMy ... my parents were both like Latino Franco files for I guess it was part of their generation like France was the coolest thing to me and so\nYeah he just lifted shovel you from from worries and it was wonderful I mean I uh [noise]\n... my relationship with my mother is fraught um she didn't she wanted a girly she was actually more than a girly girl she wanted a little drag queen I think I read about you know like you know mom and she made me where these dresses but I really just\nThe equivalent for tiger mom and Latin culture I don't know [noise] ... taco momma momma off ... ...\nMy dad um you know he just he made me feel like I could do anything he made me feel\nUm loved and that I was completely perfect and so although they both loved me and my parents have their reason for being knocked the parents my father even though everything was\nHe was going to put me in a TV show where I played a child detective the purple girl but it was wonderful to grow up that way with just an imaginative father and the problem is you know a promise maker or even if they didn't come through because well we have is hope\nI'm so it was it was really great it gave me a really great sense of myself and uh [noise]\nAnd then through the years of course I you know a battle to keep that\nYeah that eagle go and um he was ah my parents were both um in show business and he ran these variety show so I always had these very flamboyant\nLatino singers and ah I had we also have female impersonators they were very popular even in the shows back then mid century people just\nChristine Jorgensen worked with in my father's show you know Christine Jorgensen the world's first trans woman celebrity\nUm so she you know she was one of his biggest draws I mean this was always appreciated by the Latino culture and picked up when I worked with with my father all of these people so it was a pretty awesome\nWay to grow up while could we hear just a really brief excerpt from the show\n[laughter] a really brief okay just um get the hook out and I'm\nBringing up some music underneath you just so you know\nOh okay well um and so on the show that I'm I'm doing at the Martian Berkeley is is um is is in the form of a concert and so I introduce these songs and I introduced some because my concert is for people who never want the song introduction to and\nSo I say this is my father's song and it'll do most Scott alone [noise]\nUm it's sad like all will each have all your songs and follows his usual arc the woman is cruel the man is good and all his sons were inspired by my mom he's\nAlways the victim and she's the dream and then it moves to meet a speaking the song over the music\nAnd then my father says that I never knew that and I wrote him off scot

dance luminaries performs the world premiere of spirit and bones by Sarah Bush dance project [noise]\nJoining me in Studio ... is the bottom is Sarah Bush as well as three members of skip the needle composer bassist Vicki Randall guitarist\nWelcome to you all to our studios thanks saving quite a quite a gang we had heard about this let's start with Sarah what was the inspiration for spirit and ball\n[noise] um well it's an idea I had for a while about when to make a work about this time of year the time of year when the\nDays are getting shorter the nights are getting longer there's more darkness and ... and I'm an opportunity to look at everything that is beautiful and the rich and powerful about darkness so celebrating the time of year and then after the last presidential election\nI felt um once I got off the couch and Netflix um [laughter]\nI felt really moved to make work that I'm was honoring women very explicitly and honoring women in every age in stage of their life and experience um so it was really clear to me I Want it to make intergenerational work\nAnd I've had the opportunity to work with a couple of the dancers who are in the show before and last year um worked with Joan Lazarus and sewage you and had the um\nThe the gift of working with them and seeing that their years of experience in as dancers and ask performers I'm was so moving and powerful onstage so I was excited to just brought not experienced that much more so yeah we've got the answer is who are incredible at age twenty three up to Seventy one all of them just outstanding and I feel\nIs going to ask how you felt some of these dancers and I know that my own fifty six year old body does not perform like one twenty third year old body as much as I Am denial about that what it is what is it like as a dancer aging knowing that you could do some things but you can do some things to before\nYeah I've exactly in the middle I'm forty two and so I feel like I'm I'm at that exact crossroads where I Am so aware of the things that my body isn't as good at doing anymore but I'm also really aware of the things I Am better at doing and I think that's what we're all looking at in this show\nThat um there's things your body can do when you're twenty three and there's things that your performance quality and your life experience the way you carry yourself on stage that actually deepens and um I think becomes more rich as you age so\nYeah there is an interesting analogy as a musician the flu this you know I I I play Mozart a little bit differently than I thought I was a twenty three year old I've ever been a little bit of experience that makes up for maybe the facility\nBut I think everyone can probably relate to it and they're in their own feel that there's things that we let go of that there's things that we continue to deepen our um expertise that\nWell I'm hoping that this is as much as the election than the current occupant is served as some sort of inspiration for this but it's becoming a positive about the that's coming out of this\nVery much so um I feel like we're all already feeling it in the theater that I'm with everything that's going on in the world with our personal lives um there is always so much loss and so much hard news and so much struggle that to come together and feel like we are I'm bringing together our energy to shift that too um\nIt's spirit and bones it feels like we are on pushing out with this the spirit spirit of power of hope on of optimism of another way of looking at how we're all relating in the world and that's hopefully just flooding right out of that beautiful season\nTickets are that's going to be at the uh the world Trade Center for opera and the ... the great space for them to her just yes or we need to involve some of the wonderful musicians that are involved in this production of basis composer Vicki riddle formerly the Tonight Show and currently backing or maybe the staples\nOr an outside player composer pianist Julie wolf guitarist Katie cash all part of the group ah skip the needle Vicki told me a little bit about the group\nRight so uh so named because um each one of us in this band when we started out come from a really different musical tradition and um each had our own band for years um and uh Katie is\nKatie said resident shredder\n[laughter]\nUm I think I don't know you can speak for yourself about your background yeah I'm a law firm right away\nAnd the plane um you know I primarily have uh fronted rock bands or been part of of a more traditional a rock bands I'm so this was a different experience for me definitely a yeah a very wrenching experience but you know we\nBrought we brought in a I mean we were bringing in a coffee brown from the country brown ban a who is a a and M.\nC. and is like an R. and B. and funk truths and show it already has also a shredder just slightly\nDifferent shredding I'm a a trajectory coming from the gym banned the land you know uh and\nJulie wolf who is like comic um as a composer in a in a player um\nI'm not I'm not going to talk to you\n[laughter] um well I'm well I'll talk about my background a little bit and how it uh\nFolds into this piece um I come from an improvisational background I came up as a jazz musician [noise] um I ah was on the road with Sarah songwriters for\nOver Twenty years and now I'm off the road and producing music um and and the improvisation background is really serving me and I think our group as we hold space for Sarah's dancers there Vicky did the lion's share of the\nComposing for this peace and so there are structured pieces and some improvisational moments with in the structure pieces but they're also ... pieces that are completely improvised and\nThink so actually I mean and I'm the first to revise my work sort of obsessively but I'm really happy and I it's a lot of that is just because the orchestra is so amazing and and Christian ... muscle Lara who's conducting the\nUm who I have not worked with before has become a great friend of composers and he really knows how it works you know how to how to premier a piece in the kind of things that we need to adjust and I feel

Jenkins and about girl her evening legs collaboration between her drag queen persona phoney and her ... life has been an electronic composer mark Kate\nPlus open there's regular contributor and critic

war veteran John Wesley Powell\nAnd has brought me in a collected band of men soldiers ... adventures who explored Wyoming's waterways it's a story that was inspired by his actual travel log from Eighteen sixty nine\nBut uh this ingenious script by Jacqueline Bach house contains neither men or women or men boats court rivers here to talk about men on boats is director ...\n... is a a cofounder of pop up theatrics an artistic director of the five boroughs one city initiative at working theater Catherine Romans is a uh in the program MSA program at ACT who's credits also include\nThe Livermore Shakespeare festivals production of the importance of being Ernest welcome Catherine welcome time I'm Glad to be here well this is ah\nA ... ... when did you first come across a this this incredible story of ... of the scripted jak on John ... off the ...\nHave made a big splash in New York I'm just a couple of seasons ago called them and um everybody I Know it was talking about it [laughter]\nAnd then I I'm just uh got a call from um panicking and who's that new ours is director here at ACT that asked if I Would be interested in talking about this play and I was sort of like I Love that place would be very interested in that way [noise]\nSo I'm I'm I've known about the play itself since I guess it it began and have been a fan of it and just really feel very lucky to be able to get my hands on it so you're giving your own spin I'm given it\nWell I'm I'm you know we are as an ensemble the company given it a good spin yes [laughter] for sure [laughter]\nGo through this was recording experience for you coming on board the show as well\nYeah definitely ah being an MSA student we got the opportunity and our second year to audition for the shows and the next season ah\nAnd if we are fortunate enough to get cast we get to do it so it is incredibly exciting for me to get to work alongside these very talented seasoned a San Francisco actors posts a little bit about your character and then will dissect the story a little bit short I am saying George Young Bradley the youngest member of the expedition\nHe is Nineteen years old and a very enthusiastic a and excited to be brought along the journey not unlike how I feel in this process [laughter] typecast things [laughter] yes very much of a different gender [noise] yeah it is that is definitely true\nSo a tunnel that this is an old woman production of a of a historic event but how how is the history incorporated into are offering it to the public in a slightly different way well a Jacqueline\nHas ingenious laid taken this um Journal of John Wesley Powell which is actually quite I'm exciting [laughter] I've ever read 'em and he's a little poetic and his description of the the perils of the journey and the um\nThe successes or along the way and she has um\nWoven together a tale that exist between the rivers and the campsite\nUm where we follow these uh this company um of people who are I think ultimately hoping to make history you know\nUm they're charging an uncharted lamb they are um endorsed by the government it is just post civil war there's a kind of putting back togetherness of the country and I'm a I'm an opportunity to re investigate the identity of the\nOf the country and um and who you are as a citizen of that\nUm and I think Jacqueline has put forward a very pure adventure I'm at a where there are people who are entering into a landscape into a frontier hoping to discover something new not just about the land around them about themselves also ... then it's\nA a structure particularly contemporary record or having an all female cashed\nYeah yeah I think the point a or the invitation to the audience is to say you know the story of adventure belongs to all of us\nAnd um [noise] it's not a it's on a trick it's not a a kind of like crafty thing it is a way of opening up the narrative\n'em to show I think are to demonstrate or to invite people to see that the space can be occupied in other ways and that the\nA um remains in some ways I think is even more eliminated\nAnd it goes beyond a particular gender absolutely it does so what we if we're not going to be seeing rivers are both what will we we'd be seeing onstage well we won't put the rivers of the boats but I think you'll see the rivers on the boats by the time we're finished with you [laughter]\nWe're inviting people back to their active imagination than you know I think that the theater is one of the few places left where\nUm all the things that are possible or not right in front of you where you yourself have to lean into the story and uh you know you can you can bring back that five year old who\nCan you know who could fly that five year old who absolutely saw the tooth fairy back five year old [laughter]\nYou know who ... who's imagination was hampered by sort of being the socialized world and that's that's what we get to do in the theater all the types of this play absolutely\nDoes that show you obviously are very familiar with the players were you did you go to some of the source material of\nPaul yeah I Do all the way in and of Alamos rabbit holes [laughter] not only did I read um LBJ journals but I also read the the the journals that have now been recovered bus from some of the other\nPeople who are on the expedition and it's just it's so interesting because one of the things that the play does very well is helps us understand that the the story that's being told is the point of view of the storyteller\nYou know it's not a it's not a story that represents all of these men's experiences though Powell puts forth all of their experiences\nWhen I read the other journals the other uh um folks on the expedition have air we different points of view of how these events unfold and even of each other than Powell a put forth in his journals young\nBradley is not so young and not so eager and his own [laughter] sure know what's a ... he was an opportunity to be a mentor\nAnd well this is being billed as a whole new areas laugh out loud theater is that come in that sense of humor coming just from the the switching of of a ...\nSupport and love and they banned it together and giving presents and walk my dog and you know I felt like I it helped me through a very difficult personal time to have this community duck so I thought okay I'm In a meadow I'm outside and we're in mission fake I could do if he's with dogs in it\nSo [laughter] I'm a huge dog lover and I um I thought\nOkay how could I possibly do this as an homage to the the um the unconditional love of dogs and the support of a dog community so the pieces in two parts of risk probably takes place in a big hill that we call the mound that it does not have dogs in it it's called the wind at your back\nAnd that is really about using the heal as kind of a a metaphor getting through\nUm life continuing and then the second part is called canine comfort and that has to duck pieces one is um do wet for one of the dancers in the ... and her great Aussie Howard with the dancers in the background and then the last section\nIs using um teams of dogs that do chick it's geometric formations that walk through the LDC professional dancers as um they're doing a lot of dancing and so I tried to keep the the duck part fairly simple\nI'm I have three teams of dogs are Fifteen\n... there's only so much so many moves you can teach them very well I tried to get you know I wasn't looking for a circus trick trained dogs um I was really looking for for ... so they had to be able to sit on command they had to be able to walk on a leash um they had to be able to be a quiet and not work\nWith a lot of activity going around the ... no ... we had what we jokingly called the dog dish and where we had a dog show up at the park\nAnd we just put them through a lot of walking patterns and you know I didn't reject any of them actually [laughter] give us is the first time it animals have been involved with a new production\nYes I Believe so I'm so excited that is happening started the ... yeah I mean I Know there's been other people maybe I've done animals in theaters and whatnot but not in trolley dances\nWell I always say never performed with animals but you know it's been it's been really\nA wonderful thing there's something about the dogs that there is so in the present and then when they come to rehearsal they're just wanting to please and they you know they're with their owners and they um this is something very optimistic about them so it was a you know really a pleasure to have\n'em have that in rehearsal and also the fact that the the dog owners are some of them a couple of them are dancers\nBut most of them or not they're just people who I met at the dog park or you know who I\nNever heard about the peace and want to divvy it so there's that kind of everyday to Destin morality to let that I also\nYou know for me is just about what getting through everyday life is ...\n... ... are caught his work is going to be performed up the mission Creek Park as part of San Francisco trolleys after ... obviously some Greek cares to begin with this spots that you chose yeah for each of these routes what what particular spot stands out do you think oh my gosh I've got to do something in this ... this week from tomorrow\n[noise] was more\nHow do I carve it from where I began and we're\nWhat do I find of interest in that neighborhood so that's when I I've been to the park mission creek a few times and I always said oh this is so beautiful right in the water because it's very hard to get sites on the water\nVery usually very expensive permits along the Embarcadero [noise] um so I worked at the park and we figured it out and it would just I thought oh people will love this they can hang out in the part they could see dads it's a beautiful place to begin\nSo once I knew I had that then I find the other things that um I think of er of interest in that area\nLike mercy housing [noise] um they're all over the city working with seniors have nice places to live\nUm so and then on the other side of the ... there was a potential for having a site and then I go and I say well what's a good route where do I want to land\nSo I wanted to go back to some sites the done before so Robert Moses kid is actually in a site that I did the first year of Troy dances and then just sullied Joe from steam roller is he was a native land that first year and this year he's in the ... on these\nSort of his mural and he's redoing of peace he had done about gay marriage\nAnd so he's translating that so I also thought about what can I bring that that would be interesting and how would it change and then what is the pathway and the least really amount of walking\nA because there's a two hour tour and it can be tiring and then once I knew I could get into a s F ... hour to get really excited about that my site and I'm working with Steven can't\nA where the Richard Sayre a sculpture is on the Howard street entrant though they're dancing on all those big wooden steps wow\nSo it's really just as sort of comes together um it's not necessary always easy I might get something to lose something along that journey because it's a lot for a sight to take on\nYou know us being in there dancing rehearsing bringing audiences insurance [laughter] sure [laughter]\nYou've used the word that I Want to focus on a landing of ... because a lot of these ... or at least some of the works that are being done are practically search to salute quality I mean there's an aerial\nA component of them are there in terms of space yeah using not just the ground you know\nWe use everything that's for sure I always say if my sneakers could talk\nYou know how to really get in and meet meet a neighborhood and that's a big part of it is meeting the people that live there and then what art groups are there\nSo I'm really excited for everybody come

whose work engages experimental forms and political context his book about aids archives and cultural memory the Nancy Reagan collection is forthcoming\nAnd he currently teaches feminist gender and sexuality studies at Stanford max welcome to you thanks\nSo first of all hope how did you first meet max\nMax wants to tell her first you know [laughter]\nWell I was joking when we were on our way over here that uh it was inevitable that we would meet because\nHope is a dancer who loves literature and I'm a writer who loves to dance so when I first moved to the bay about three years ago and I have attended a ton of programming that hopes Don shift so fabulous for the bay area and so it's been so great to now work together\nAnd the topic of south of how did that come up between you [noise]\nI Hope or I uh\nFound ... through the work of and Carson\nUm I'm a big fan of Carson's work and I cut her acted\nCarson's and taken ... twenty Fifteen for shock on players and really wanted to do another project that within conversation with her work\nSo um I read her translations of ... which came out in two thousand two if not winter and love them and ask cartoons commission to work with them to craft a multidisciplinary performance and happily she said yes\nMm nice um so for those of us not up on our great poets tell us a little bit about ... if you would\nShare um she is the first known a woman writer she lived in seventh century bc e ... on the island of Lesbos in Greece\nAnd she many credit her with um inventing the lyric I or poetic expression in the first person well and that was the contact that really intrigued me in addition to the fact that most of her work\nSurvive ... has been lost most of it now survives only and fragmentary form and I'm very interested in the fragment as a as a competition all idea\n\nMax um [noise] how are you into weaving the with the work of suffer with your own writing\nA I think that through\nBeen a really collaborative process and I myself have just been fascinated to meditate on south of use of the first person I her use of the lyric forearm\nAnd sue and thinking about how to update that for today we really I mean I and and the whole company have really taken\nSort of ... so we've been watching\nSome of the moves that she makes in in these lyrics and we've been thinking about what we can pull from them into today so one thing that I think as a writer it's been fascinating for me is is to look at that first person and see actually how unstable that voice is in South though how dependent it is on\nOther people on a public on other women that are in her world\nPolice hope something that and Carson talks about in relationship to ... um sapphires poetry is known for being a lot about ecstasy and desire but and Carson says that South I use is ecstasy as a means to an end um as a means to transcend the south\nSo paradoxically Saffo\nAnyway invented the south to get beyond the south and so Craig graphically I've been interested in how\nUm I for example I've been encouraging the dancers used form to get past the farm so how can they use set a dance material to to get past that into um an ecstatic state Mm interesting\nI I we didn't talk to about this beforehand but I see a will book marked till next to you where are you able to share a couple of passages\nYeah we love to read a couple of fragments IMAX generally the first one\nYeah great I'm going to read fragment Ninety four\nI simply want to be dead\nWeeping she left me with many tears and said this\nOh how badly things have turned out for us Saffo I Swear against my will I leave you\nAnd I answered her rejoice go and remember me for you know how we cherished you\nBut if not I want to remind you and beautiful times we had\nFor many crowns a violets and roses at my side you put on and many woven Garland made of flowers around your soft throat\nAnd with sweet oil costly\nYou annoying to yourself\nYou would let loose your longing\nAnd either any nor any holy\nPlace nor was there from which we were absent so I Hope the listeners have heard the sort of ... in the middle I'm about ... when I paused those are words that those silences represent words that were lost Mm\nCan I read a bit please so I'd like to read an excerpt from fragments thirty one and all this is a five minutes of the dancers and I have worked a lot with in terms of its redneck structure\nBefore you do that 'cause you could you tell us up these called you should start a fragment Ninety four or thirty one how were these phones in what condition where the in uh our our they know archived\nYeah they they're they've been found throughout the throughout the ages on crumbling pieces of Paris and often in very deteriorated a condition do you have anything to add to that mix\n'em they're found in the most unexpected ways uh there was two new homes were found in twenty fourteen um they're found in some some of the pirates with you\nStill found in ... within an elaborate process of identification that happens\nInteresting I'm interrupted you hope you were talking about the meter that you're trying to get your dancers to coordinate with\nYes we each a section of the dancers anchored in a particular fragment and a lot of times I use the redneck structure of the language\nI'm to inform the structure of the dance um and also I think this fragment really represents how ... palms invite 'em invite the listener into embodiment\nTongue breaks and thin fire is racing under skin and in ... site and drumming fills ears and cold sweat holds me and shaking grips me all greener than grass I Am in dead\nOr almost I seemed to me\nBut all is to be there to because even a person of poverty\nSay no you ... you bring up an interesting point the rhythm of this of of Paul [noise] but it's also the rhythm of the translation of your home so how do we know if it is or is it even necessary to know the rhythm of the original language\nThere's been many translations of ... and I think one of the reasons that Carson's translations have been so acclaimed is she really ... speak for herself\nMany translators have attempted to filling the gaps and guess what south I was saying and add flourishes in stanzas and Carson really just\nLet Saffo stand for itself um she doesn't embellish it at all see anything to add to that and\nI'm just that you know there's this awful on the page in translation and ... the translators are really attuned to the meter because it's thought that Sacco saying these songs right that the lyrics were always song in a ... in public um as a collective right with other people\nSo part of our process husband to go back to that stuff though the public's eye photos I suppose in collaboration\nOf hope what will we see the speed is being presented in the round of this was a conscious choice obviously yeah and why did you do that\nI wanted to create an intimate immersive experience for the audience\nUm so people will see a people entering the environment and there is a section of text and there's dance and the two are interwoven that's a very um cross disciplinary experience there's also force headed video projection designed by and winter's so there's a lot of different elements woven together\nAnd they talk over each other and yet you can't miss anything yeah that's true because there's so much of the exposition is layered in their very subtly\nAnd uh if if if the actors we had to be very careful that\nChristmas written the lines to specifically to overlap at certain points\nBut you've got to know who is the who is where the volume is up [laughter] you know it's like in a in a symphony if you're if the flu is playing solo we need to bring the strengths down right in order to hear the flu so it's kind of like it was constantly are constantly\nOrchestrating that that first scene because we knew if we didn't get that first scene right\nThe audience would never be able to follow the rest of the play\nAnd this this set design is is really ingenious as well I understand that you've decided not to necessarily\nInduced paranoia but adding to the sense of a Cold War asked feel to it you're getting the impression that you may be seen and observed from angles you're not aware of the chances are you're being watched\nI think that was the whole idea um the set was not by me it was by and ... and when she and I talked about it we knew we wanted to do something a little surreal\nBecause the play itself is are real and may or may not be happening on on on different a sort of parallel universes some of the scenes don't seem to really be happening in ordinary temporal reality\nUh and so we one of the way to sort of stress that so\nWe had this um mirrors overhead that reflect the characters back to themselves but distorted a little bit in the mirrors and it was a lot of fun and then of course there's the two\nGiant horizontally hung read with logs or the back of the set which creative very ominous quality as if\nThey're precariously hung their on um you know and fishing line and worth data come undone they would most certainly roll over the actors and out into the audience so it creates this wonderful sense of danger [noise]\nOne of the cast members as original to the sandbox series of that's a ... little little row row also features Cassidy brown Katie Ruben and Joe Maher talk
