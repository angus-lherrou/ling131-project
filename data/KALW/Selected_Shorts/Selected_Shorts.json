result of course they had to wait intermittently up the station and what was to have been a charming early stage to reunion this family embracing husband and father became it last and ill timed and

over emphasize the extent of his delight in seeing them again\nHis wife had an odd sense of last time\nStanding now on the platform with the baby in her arms and small John beside her she could not for a minute remember clearly whether he was coming home or whether they were yet standing here to say goodbye to him they had been correlating when he left\nAnd she had spent the week of his absence determining to forget that in his presence she had been frightened\nAnd hurt this will be a good time to get things straight she had been telling herself while John is gone I can try to get hold of myself again now\nOn shore at last whether this was an a rival or a departure\nFelt afraid again straining to me it's an ... in durable attention\nThis will not do it she thought believing that she

not afford such a delicate pretty things and put a cold finish to the idea of but with the stranger she said we'd have to look for them\nNot everything would be right I saw a little creature once he said like a little tiny man only colored old purple and blue\nAnd gold\nShe remembered this conversation it contained the truth like a jewel set in the evening\nMuch later she wants to tell herself that it was true John could not have said these things she was happy she was raised yet she had no conscience\nHe went to be the lead to his office the next morning saying goodbye at the door with a room full smile that seemed to mock the president the subsidy for doing the things that John always did and she walked him go down the walk she reflected that this will surely not\nGoing to be permanent she could not indoor having him go on for so long every day although she had felt a little about parting from John moreover if he kept doing John's things he might grow imperceptibly more like\nJohn we will simply have to go away she thought she was\nPleased seeing him get into the car she would gladly share with him indeed gave him out right old that had been John's so long as he stayed\nHer stranger\nShe laugh while she did her housework and dress the baby she took satisfaction in on packing his suitcase which he had abandoned and forgotten in a corner of the bedroom as though prepared to take it up and leave again if she had not been as he thought her\nHad not wanted him to stay she put away his clothes so disarming Li like Johns and wondered for a minute left a closet would there be a kind of a delicacy in him about John's things\nThen she told herself no not so long as he had been with John's wife and she left again the baby was cross all day but\nWhen small John came home from nursery school his first question was looking up eagerly whereas daddy\nDaddy has gone to the office and again she left at the moments quick sly picture of the insult to Jong\n[noise] half a dozen times during the day she went upstairs to look at his suitcase and touched the leather softly she glanced\nAs she passed through the dining room into the corner where the small shelves would be some day and told her self that they would find a tiny little man all purple and blue and gold to stand\nWhen the children awaken from their naps she took them for a walk and then away from the house and returned violently to her former lonely pattern\nWalk the children talk meaning Leslie of daddy long for someone to talk to in the evening ahead restrain herself from hurrying home\nHe might have telephoned she began to feel frightened again suppose she had been wrong\nIt could not be possible that she was mistaken it would be on a true believer cruel for John to come home tonight\n[noise] then she heard the car stop and when she opened the door and looked up she thought now\nIt is not my husband with the return of blackness she was aware from his smile that he had perceived her doubts and yet he was so clearly a stranger that seeing him she had no need of speaking\nShe asked him instead almost meaningless questions during that evening and his answers were important\nOnly because she was storing them away to reassure herself while he was a way she asked him what was the name of their Shakespeare professor in college and who was that girl he likes so before he met Margaret when he smiled and said that he had no idea\nThat he would not recognize the name if she told him she was in the light he had not bother to master all of the past that and he had learned enough of the names of the children the location of the house\nHow she liked her ... tales to get to her and after that it was not important because either she would want him to stay or she would calling upon John send him away again\nWhat is your favorite food she asked him are you on to fishing did you ever have a\nDog someone told me today he said once\nThat he had heard that I was back from Boston and I distinctly thought he said that he heard that I was dead\nIn Boston ... he was lonely too she thought was sadness\nAnd this is why he came bringing a destiny with him now I Will see him come every evening through the door and think this is not my husband and wait for him remembering that I Am waiting for a stranger\nAt any rate she said you are not dead in Boston and nothing else matters\nShe saw him leave in the morning with a warm pride and she did her housework and dressed the baby when small John came home from nursery school he did not ask ... looked with quick searching eyes\nAnd inside while the children were taking their naps she thought that she might take them to the park this afternoon and then the thought of\nAnother such afternoon another long afternoon with no one but the children another afternoon of we do hood was more than she could submit to\nI have done this too much she thought I must see some thing today beyond the faces of my children\nNo one should be so much alone moving quickly she dressed and set the house strikes she called the high school girl and\nThey don't seem to get elected the thousand small\nOrders regarding the proper jacket for the baby whether small John might have popcorn when to bring them home she fled thinking I must be with people\nShe took a taxi into town because it seemed to her that the only possible thing to do with seek out a gift for him or her first gift for him and she thought she would find him perhaps a little creature old blue and purple and gold\nShe wandered through the strange shops in the town choosing small lovely things to stand on the news shelves\nLooking long and critically at ... at small statues at brightly colored demeaning less expensive toys suitable for giving to a stranger\nIt was almost dark when she started home carrying her packages\nShe looked from the window of the taxi into the dark streets\nAnd bought with pleasure adopt a stranger would be home before her and look from the window to see her hurrying to him he would think this is a stranger I Am waiting for a stranger as he saw her coming\nHere she said tapping on the glass right here driver she got out of the taxi and pay the driver and smiled as he drove away I must look well she thought the drivers smiled back at me\nShe turned and started for the house and then hesitated\nSurely she had come too far this is not possible she thought this cannot be surely our house was wiped\n\nThe evening was very dark\nAnd she could see only the house is going in rows\nWith more rose beyond them and more rose beyond that and somewhere a house which was worse with the beautiful stranger inside and she lost out here\n[noise]\n\nI told you she got pregnant just when he was about to ask her for the divorce\nI shake the next coat and to cafeteria tickets thought of the pocket one for spaghetti with meat balls and one for a cream soda I bet she did it on purpose part of evil scheme\nShe's looking at me but she doesn't seem to be writing in the register anymore either she's usually such a perfectionist but she can get pretty sloppy if she's thinking about her doctor\nWhen I asked him if he'd even told her he got defensive and came up with all these excuses [laughter] they're worried about the boy getting into the right to elementary school his wife could go into premature labor he's got some experiment running at the lab and can't be distracted the train got stuck in the snow load of crap\nShe stopped for a moment and I read the label on the next coat she writes that down in the register I think\nThe coasts or in a pretty sorry state all wrinkled and stained blood spit urine tears you can tell by the color and the smell it's amazing all the stuff that can use out of a body\nOne lie leads to another I say she should know\nHe finally showed up past ten last night dog tired for being stuck on the train for five hours he said but I was the one who was tired tired of waiting all that time of running to the door at every little noise watching the dinner I'd made get cold\nShe runs her hand through your hair looks down again\nHer skin is so white her shoulders really beautiful the pen rolls across the desk do you know what he told me\nHe said he had a lot of time to think on the train that he felt like some invisible forest was holding him back that it wasn't the right time and that was why it had snowed\nHe said he wanted me to be patient to wait just a little longer just a little longer\nAnd then we screwed just like we always do that's all we have left\nI imagine her naked\nThe doctors fingers running over her skin her hair\nThe wet places I picture her tongue licking the edge of the blue envelope who wouldn't want her\nGastrointestinal med too long up the allergy one short neurology one long pediatrics for short I pick up the pace trying to distract her but she's not paying attention anymore depends still on the desk\nHow could he be so cruel how could you tell me to wait\nI couldn't wait any longer not one more day not one more second I take the\nShe is that's why I killed him she says her voice is low and cold\nI feel a scream rising out of me but somehow I stop it hold it back\nAnd instead I calmly imagine the scene the knife and her pretty hand the blades slicing into him again and again skin ripping blood spurting
