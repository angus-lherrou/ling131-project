some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael friends who teaches political science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political at these days it's not negative it might just watching the wrong spaces\n[laughter] well it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pit\nThe policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those together you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition yeah\nUh have you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\n[noise] you know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV [noise]\nThat are negative is roughly that's consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ads on line\n[noise] yes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tends to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content online\nThere's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative a campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter so just the season on through [laughter]\nUh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as a centrally being\nConnected to terrorist organizations and that kind of explicit attack\nIs not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people and and questions are being raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric in public discourse these days do you draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nYeah this is a tough one to um decipher it because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is at an all time high political advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say it as a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television have to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes\nTo a middle the set of voters moderates independents are swing voters and you can't be too vitriolic in those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael Franz boating college who is co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure and Tamara weekend edition

bottom of the Eighteenth Tom Goldman joined us Tom are you there man are you there your weight\nYeah now I'm here I'm here oh my word what a game\nUnbelievable I I watched all of it well kind of all of that I I watched um [noise] you know there were some times maybe from innings fourteen to Seventeen when I took a little does here and there but uh in general it was an absolutely riveting and in stunning\nEighteen pitchers used including by by the way Clayton Kurdish arguably the best picture on the field although not last night as a pinch hitter he didn't even throw the ball or does is anybody left to throw the game tonight\n[laughter] well the Dodgers have named starting pitcher rich hill after the game Red Sox manager Alex Cora still haven't decided who he's starting later today in game for he had used up pretty much everyone is part of his when now philosophy and that includes\nNathan you've all these Scott six innings and relief he threw just shy of a hundred pitches\nHe was brilliant and of course max Muncie ruined it for him and the Dodgers Walker bealer we got a healer dealer [laughter] if I thought he was a brilliant this was two games you know literally was tonight any games\nAnd for the first game Walker Mueller was the star or he threw seven innings he was given the ball and has to basically save\nThe Dodgers season because if the Dodgers had gone down three oh no teams ever come back in the world series from a three oh deficit Walker below goes at Heathrow seven innings holds the mighty Red Sox line up to two hits he was fantastic he turned the ball over after the seventh inning\nTo can lead chance and they're great reliever and had he not given up a home run to Boston it would have been just kind of a normal\nWhen with Walker bealer being the start of the night does not LA now have anything left in the tank to win ... that's a good question to ask either of these teams Scott because they both put absolutely everything and more into this game\nLA one and so they're they're feeling really good about that but you know going into games for but\nBoth teams are stocked with professional baseball players they'll figure out a way to you know to win for their teams and if we predict something now it will inevitably be wrong so the one thing we can say we've got a series now and uh it's fun\nTom Goldman thanks so much You're

federal prosecutors unsealed a criminal complaint which described effort by the Russian backed\nInternet research agency to use Twitter box to influence Americans in a wide variety of controversial topics including\nIssues raised in sports Andrew ... sports reporter for the wall Street Journal is written about the impact rushing trolls have had on the controversy over players who kneel during the plane of the national anthem street and joins us from New York Thanks so much for being with us\nThanks so much for having me on why was this Internet research agency interested in whether football players took her new you're not during the playing of the anthem well\nAt first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at\nWe're sowing discord this issue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets but it's not just\nPeople that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain\nWhat did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency well\nWhat we found was these tweets head be gone all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement\nThen we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen President Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then\nAnd so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data is which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University who helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA sailing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that breakdown wonder how that influenced the conversation\nMm So it it it wasn't directed achieving a certain result just to to stir things up apparently\nYeah and the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraud\nContentious issue and also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to try to track to this debate\nAh I gather a lot of these accounts have been closed right\nYeah so the accounts from this study have been close but you know what we see with the is it sometimes seems to be a game of whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up and one of the interesting notes that the ... and professors had was that these are closed but they're monitor new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations\nAnd they're continuing to weigh in on controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charge moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue to weigh in\nAndrew beaten in the wall Street Journal thanks so much for being with us thanks so much for having me on\nTwenty years is not a lot of time if you're say Betty

able to do obviously again to can compare and contrast your job and the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues of the day their positions that are inside\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human beings\nAnd I take some pride in that if we can get somebody like more recently John Case it for example and we can show the audience that he's actually very funny guy can tell a story then sure people will go on and they'll think what they think about John Case it but they might also have those opinions but now they apply them to a human

suspicious packages sent prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump seizure say I was arrested friday morning in Florida and faces federal charges\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas joins Ryan thanks so much for being with us from I ... a what a week a chaotic and concerning\nNow how the FBI cracked the case\nIt was really a clue pulled off of ah one of the packages that did it remember when when these packages started showing up the authorities took a took charge of them sent them to the FBI lab in Quantico in Virginia\nAnd folks there than rent tests on them analyze them and they were able to pull a fingerprint off of one of the these bubble light manila envelopes that fingerprint matched say ox\nAuthorities say there's also possible DNA connection from two of the homemade pipe bombs that were sent it\nMatch because he was in that it was in the system\nRight exactly be the because of previous legal trouble a DNA connection or appears to ... as well and then there's a third bit of evidence here which is from the digital world and that is a the FBI identified a Twitter account that it says belongs to say or some of the words that were misspelled on the packages and a match the wrong spellings on his Twitter account\nAnd what more we learned about this uh this man in the white van in a parking\nLot is fifty six years old resident of South Florida registered as a Republican in March of ... of twenty sixteen there is a pretty a long trail and public records of his legal troubles he's face felony theft fraud drug charges was arrested over a bomb threat back in two thousand two as well\nHe's clearly had financial difficulties over the years he filed for bankruptcy for example in two thousand twelve and then that filing he said that he lived with his mother that he didn't own any furniture or we know that he spent a lot of time at the gym and he also worked at a at a strip club\nOr a lot of public attention of course has been put on this white van that you mentioned a that authorities say belonged to say oc this of course is the one uh that was plastered with pro Trump stickers anti Democrat anti CNN stickers we've all seen a lot of photos of that for the next steps\nWell he's been charged in federal court in New York with five counts those include illegally mailing explosives threatening former presidents\nHe's currently being held at the federal detention center in Miami is expected to be in court on Monday\nOr not to key questions after his arrest for authorities are one whether he was acting alone or had accomplices\nIn to whether there were any other package is still out there and that's something that yesterday FBI Director Christopher Wray cautioned the public about he said there may still be more out there are as things stand the FBI has confirmed at least fourteen homemade explosive devices\nEach one had a six inch piece of PVC pipe small clock batteries wiring and potential explosive material folks at the FBI lab are still examining needs to see whether they are indeed functional bombs but rate was explicit about this he said be sure these were not hoax devices\nAnd of course the the the packages were sent to prominent Democrats and uh and critics of President Trump um is there a political angle that seems to have motivated these actions [noise] ... attorney general Jeff Sessions was\nAsked that exact question uh yesterday and all that he would say is that say appears to be politically partisan part is in fact that's what he said\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the financial

and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political ed these days it's not negative it might just\nWell it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pit\nThe policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those together you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition yeah\nHave you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\n[noise] you know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV\nThat are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ads on line\n[noise] yes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tends to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content on line\nAnd there's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter singer of the season aren't you [laughter]\nUh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as essentially being\nConnected to terrorist organizations and that kind of explicit attack\nIs not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people and and questions being raised about the tone of political rhetoric and public discourse these days do you draw any link between the\nTone set by some of these ads and fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more main\nWell yeah this is a tough one to um decipher because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is at an all time high political advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say it has a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television have to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes and so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle but you are also speaking to a middle vote set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic in those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael Franz boat in college who is co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure and tomorrow and weekend edition Sunday Lulu looks at our political rhetoric and language may affect us in how we speak to each other you can listen to that story tomorrow morning by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your station by name\n[noise]\nAnd it's time for sports\n\nThe harder it is by the time I really began to get up for\nThere the longest Damon World Series history and we're still going on [noise] Eighteen innings seven hours ... minutes is longer than the playing time of the entire Nineteen thirty nine World Series and the Los Angeles Dodgers one three to walk home or by max Muncie\nIn the bottom of the Eighteenth Tom Goldman joined us Tom are you there man are you there your weight\nYeah now I'm here I'm here oh my word what a game unbelievable I I watched all of it well kind of all of that I watched um [noise] you know there were some times maybe from innings fourteen through Seventeen when I took a little does here and there but uh in general it was an absolutely riveting and and stunning\nEighteen pictures used including by by the way Clayton Kurdish arguably the best pitcher on the field although not last night as a pinch hitter it didn't even throw the ball or does it is anybody left to throw the game tonight\n[laughter] well the Dodgers have named the starting pitcher rich hill after the game Red Sox manager Alex Cora still hadn't decided who he's starting later today and game for he had used up pretty much everyone is part of his when now philosophy and that includes\nNathan you've all these Scott six innings and relief he threw just shy of a hundred pitches he was brilliant and of course max Muncie ruined it for him and uh the Dodgers Walker bealer we got a dealer dealers [laughter] if I was a brilliant this was two games you know literally was tonight any games\nAnd for the first game Walker Mueller was the star or he threw seven innings he was given the ball and has to basically save\nThe ... season because if the Dodgers had gone down three oh no team has ever come back in the world series from a three oh deficit Walker below goes at Heathrow seven innings holds the mighty Red Sox line up to two hits he was fantastic he turned the ball over after the seventh inning\nTo can lead chance and they're great reliever and had he not given up a home run to Boston it would have been just kind of a normal when with Walker ... started\nThe night does not LA now have anything left in the tank to win\n... that's a good question to ask a either of these teams Scott because they both put up sully everything and more into this game\nLA one and so they're they're feeling really good about that but you know going into game for but\nBoth teams are stocked with professional baseball players they'll figure out a way to you know to win for their teams and if we predict something now it will inevitably be wrong so the one thing we can say we've got a series now and uh it's fun Tom Goldman thanks so much You're welcome\nThe dual Bob Cousy and bill Russell was one of the greatest they were\nThe Tracy and Hepburn the rocky and Apollo of the basketball court they could anticipate each other's play they could put themselves into each other's minded movements as they won six championships for the Boston Celtics and the Nineteen fifties and sixties and but just a dynasty that would win eight in a row [noise]\nBob Cousy was the point guard listed is six foot one doesn't sound basketball toll today\nA white man who grew up the son of poor French immigrants in Manhattan bill Russell was the senator six foot ten black men born in segregated Louisiana they became teammates in Nineteen fifty seven just after Martin Luther king's Montgomery bus boycott\nAnd they play together through turbulent times of the civil rights movement and into Boston roiled by bigotry Gary ... the historian journalist has written a book about the cousy Russell partnership and the regrets one of them has about plays that maybe he didn't make\nIt's the last past cousy Russell Celtics in what matters in the end Gary ... joins us from

enough to confirm him for the lifetime position yesterday protesters filled the halls of the capital and all eyes were on a few senators who hadn't reached their final judgment\nDecision for\nThe Republican Jeff Flake of Arizona will bring about a week long delay in the confirmation process to allow for additional investigation by the FBI and accusations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh fellow Republicans reluctantly agreed that the delay\nInhale the FBI secret report as an exoneration Democrats called the investigation incomplete and unfair\nLet the confirmation process for judge Kavanaugh\nBe recorded as a sorry epilogue\nOf Justice Scalia's seat\nThat was Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer of New York who helped lead the fight against the nominee\nNo matter a pivotal vote by Senator Flake turned the tide he announced that barring some major new development he'll vote to confirm Kavanaugh today\nSo we'll Senator Susan Collins of Maine she took the Senate floor for more than forty minutes to explain why she'll vote for him even though she found Christine gloves before a debate believable\nI only\nThat she is says buy her a sexual assault and that fits

done deal\nThere have been a lot of twists in the story so I'm not going to say anything is a hundred percent certain but yes we know that Brett Kavanaugh has the votes to be such a confirmed to the Supreme Court today we had been tracking for key undecided senators all along\nAnd yesterday three of them said they would in the end vote for Kavanaugh that's Jeff Flake Susan Collins and Joe Manchin who's the only Democrats supporting I'm Lisa Murkowski ended up being the lone Republican opposing Kavanaugh's nomination\nIs I don't have to tell you or anyone at this point this confirmation has been so a contentious you were in the rooms where it happened to twist a line from ah from Hamilton uh what was your reaction like all over the capital when Susan Collins a Republican Joe Manchin a

Hill a Wilson is one of those protesters results way west Virginian and founder of the women's activist group\nBoss babes in that state as Wilson thanks so much for being with us\nThanks for having me\nAnd what's your immediate reaction to senator Manchin Cheney intends to vote for judge capital\nIt's devastating but it's honestly not the first uprising\nYeah well yeah it's been indicated\nAlso I mean Donald Trump got sixty eight point five percent of the presidential vote in West Virginia in twenty sixteen can the argument being made that senator Manchin is just reflecting the Democratic we'll expressed by the people of West Virginia\nI I Do think that he is the poll showed that cabinet people mostly most people at the party Kavanaugh here however um\nUp for reelection and thirty days and he he is under fifty percent of the polls right now so I think I think he did it to play the Republican base\nYeah well but when you choose a politician to being a politician is though that's not much of a surprise visit there I mean he's running for reelection yeah\nOf course and I did do that to him yesterday on Thursday\nWill tell tell us about those meetings because you were you you met with him I guess for two hours on Thursday right\nYeah we did so we had a group of women who sat in his office on Sunday and they were actually arrested a\nHit about nine women arrested they sat there for like ten hours listening to him they had a conference call with him on Monday that didn't really go well on Thursday we had a group of about fifty go up to D.C and we met with him on a two separate occasions the first one we had\nProbably about twenty twenty women there and twenty women men and teenagers and we told stories of sexual assault and\nAsk them how they plan to vote and he their way he he was very engaging the conversation he had to step out of the room but I got back from like ... you you feel like\nYou were hurt and received with respect\nAbsolutely yeah he was extremely engaged she has got a question um I Do believe that Joe mansion cares for West Virginia I just don't think that's reflected in this decision\nDoes you're probably continue if the judge Kavanaugh is confirmed brothers and two\nAre fight does continue to sell uh as far as the Senate go he ... he kind of knew that he had us he kind of had a because at the other option Patrick Morrisey has done terrible thing for West Virginia he's a big proponent of\nThe opioid crisis and so he kinda surely doesn't believe in opioid addiction\nHe doesn't but he was a lobbyist for big pharmaceutical in West Virginia I he's our current attorney general and he's just terrible he's got Trump's endorsement and uh he's just a bad guy and I think he knows\nHis old camp though this is your opinion with me underscore is my ...\nOf course this is my opinion yes of course um\nSo yeah I think he believes that that he's still going to have the Democrat though and that he wants to get the Republicans as well well it does continue yeah so we're working on I'm working at a statewide to change things we've got a constitutional amendment on the ballot to ban abortion and Joe Manchin that we all have to get out and vote against that which we are doing\nWell if if your Jones is if you have accepted senator mansions vote for what it is and and still support among the great many issues and I got to tell you this this sounds very civilized and democratic to me\nAnd I'm trying to play the long game I reluctantly as support has because I think the I think Morsi's worst choice mansion does still support

reports that come in only a fraction get funded for legal help\nSome people are coming to us you know two years after this has happened to them for five years after this has happened to ten years after this has happened to them\nBecause they never felt comfortable coming forward before and the way the law is you have to report or bring a case within a certain amount of time so some of those women are out of time\nSome of those women who are coming forward are independent contractors and unless you live in certain states you're not covered by discrimination law and so it's a matter of

miraculous comeback coming back from three games down and obviously the red Sox and the Yankees for the first time in their history both when a hundred games in the same season and\nLast night was a battle that I was there and it was it was one of those types of games where it looked like a blow out the red Sox are up five nothing and then all of a sudden here come the Yankees simply because this is exactly what these teams are the red Sox have the better starting pitching the\nYankees have the better relief pitching the red Sox relief pitching really almost gave it up to ... Yankees had chances in sixth inning bases loaded basis lives in the seventh thing and if this is what it's going to be for the next four games I think we're in for a classic ...\nA Houston Astros but the crunch on Cleveland's seven to two court club or a great pitcher got clue or club [laughter] why you like this grows a lot\nYeah I think the Astros a but my my motto Scott and all of this is that okay the red Sox won a hundred and eight games the Yankees won a hundred games but the actual still won a hundred hundred and two hundred and three games and they're still the defending champions and to me you're the champs until somebody beat you and I think they're the best team top to bottom of the best team in the line of the best team\nWith the best combination of relief pitching and starting pitching and they're scary and all of a sudden they're starting to look like\nChampions again even though for a lot of ... about a lot of a lot of the season they weren't quite into it but they're that good that they can sort of flip the switch and they seem to have done that\nBut what about the Dodgers they too straight shut up against the Atlanta Braves\nYeah this is interesting because nobody seemed to be any good in the national league this year nobody seemed to really take control let's not forget your cubs why pick to go to the world series had the best record in the national league on Sunday and they were out of the playoffs by Tuesday night\nAnd you won't let me forget that but now I'm just saying that it's it's a crazy ear and and we're talking about the brewers as well suddenly the brewers got shut out last night so all of a sudden\nYou're starting to see all these teams begin to really play their best baseball\nAnd let's not forget we talk about the champs being champs until you knock them out while the Dodgers have the national league champs they went to\nThe seventh game of the world series last year losing to the Astros so maybe the Dodgers are the team that's going to start getting warm\nAt the right time as well but I can tell you one thing Scott you may not want to hear this although maybe not I don't think you have a problem with that I kinda like with the Milwaukee Brewers are doing and they've got the rocks already on the road yeah mirror to another and maybe you go to Colorado and things change but I\nI really like Milwaukee and the

official announcements and from a procedural vote yesterday Senate Republicans have secured the votes they need to confirm it at is expected just a metric conservative majority on the court\nNPR's Ron Elving joined just run thanks so much for being with us good morning Scott now we could both name conservative justices Souter Stevens black men Kennedy who issued who joined a liberal and progressive is on the court\nBut uh this confirmation Brett Kavanaugh could have impact for generations good\nOh yes we assumed the current lineup of five justices who were appointed by three Republican presidents do named to Bush and out to by Donald Trump will be around for some time\nAnd this will be the first time that the court has five members were alumni of the federalist society who has been which has been growing for some of the court for years and a swelling presence on the federal bench with its lower levels and with the Trump Administration and White House counsel Don McGahn a they have truly come into their own\n... what do we need to know about the federalist society ... years they're going to be um more prominent but never in us life\nOf the group got started at a couple of law schools in the early Nineteen eighties it was a pushback by students and Google's legal scholars\nOf people who are convinced that the court had become too liberal to inclined to read the constitution to accommodate the outlook and philosophy of a few justices with big ideas about social and political justice\nMembers of the society of indicated a desire to revisit some of the landmark decisions of the past two judges generations asking the question of whether or not\nThe basis for those decisions was in the constitution or whether it was being supplied by somebody\nIs nothing remotely secretive about this right\nNot a secret society at all and they've been quite public about their campaign and about their influence within the Republican Party\nAnd about their desire to revisit things like the privacy concept in roe versus Wade that legalized abortion or even the one person one vote concept that required state legislative districts to have equal population [noise] um\nIf Kavanaugh's confirmation is the the the combination of of decades of organizing um are Republicans energized get up to the polls about a month from now or do many feel mission accomplished\nThere could be both a feeling of accomplishment ended up feeling of opportunity to press further and some resentment over the confirmation process than some of the accusations that were raised in the way they were raised against Brett Kavanaugh\nBut Mitt terms are more often driven by anger than satisfaction and right now polls show a lot of women and younger voters are unhappy with Kavanaugh and even many Republican women are unhappy with their party and that could also be a big factor in the midterms I'm\nNow it's interesting to me you point to anger and that certainly reflected in in the surveys you mentioned unemployment is at a three point seven percent are historically low about a forty year low a and yet polls say about fifty five percent of citizens in this

the battle is become a flashpoint following allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school Meghan ... column for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views [laughter] which we welcome and she joined just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian bussing forward now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] uh what was that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes\nI don't think so I think well I mean yes and now right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do\nThe right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like um I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with the as it than looks possible that they should confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote\nYou know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it\nTo the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate this did did the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal and people say it wasn't\nA I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true and they had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative\nBy not providing she had basically two pieces of crowds I wasn't aware of that because she was in well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she told and sort of two thousand Seventeen two dozen Eighteen ... should\nPeople they're basically two days of cooperation were her therapist notes which would seem to say look she talked about this all they're not we have another name and two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee\n'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear but the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those

thousand Eighteen\nFoot ... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's ... Christian bushy Ford a sincere a book that she couldn't let a church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support right a judge\nNow the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it it's often committed without witnesses and they feel\nNot to be believe you know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and there's an inherently difficult crime because you know ... some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated to content you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible [noise] um and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in this ... neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy in being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews for Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved\nFrom people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth [noise] um it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it it's way worse than what ...\nMaking the colonel thanks so much thank you [noise] ... [noise] to\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from thousands of pages of financial documents president called the article quote a hit piece\nWith us now to talk about some of the allegations jumbo Bryan who's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course you suggested bitter Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat easily the head or of this one I don't think that's a news though\nI think the nuts and bolts of that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious and possibly fraudulent\nTo protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so and in wealth\nTo keep it in the family\nTo keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump\nTasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid inheritance and gift taxes or in other words\nThe trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred and instead they they paid around fifty million or so\n... when when Donald ... over the years I've built with I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people\nAnd uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that the times really flashed that out with a lot of\nNew numbers and the scale of his dependent\nSo that's another important theme of the story which is the president has said on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] ... is there anything that you that you can recognize and that maybe people are going over the story now can recognize is distinctly illegal\n[noise] [noise] yeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when Fred Trump and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they use and appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests that that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called\nAn odd little company was essentially a shell company called all county that the Trump family used to inflate how much they were spending on equipment and supplies for their\nArmada of buildings so they could then pocket the differential themselves rather than pay income tax on it all of that stuff is possibly highly fraudulent the trick is the statute of limitations has passed on much of it\nSo it most they may may end up with civil penalties on this but I I suspect that's not what bothers the president the most about what I think really will get under his skin about this is that it it knocks down this idea that he pulled himself up by his own bootstraps and he he earned his living on his own\nRather than being someone who was born on third base and said he hit a triple which is essentially the story he's been putting out there for a long time\nJim O'Brian of Bloomberg opinion thanks so much thank you Scott\nThis week a report by Bloomberg said the Chinese government operative spotted microchips especially Mike Rowe microchips into service created by an American company called super micro\nI'm joyous later with these headlines President Trump has another campaign

it's been indicated\nAlso I mean Donald Trump got sixty eight point five percent of the presidential vote in West Virginia in twenty sixteen can the argument being made the senator mentioned is just reflecting the Democratic we'll express for other people of West Virginia\nI I Do think that he is the poll showed that mostly most people at the party Kevin here however um I think he did it entirely politically because he's up for reelection and thirty days and he he has under fifty percent of the polls right now so I think I think he did it to play the Republican base\nYeah well but when you use a politician to being a politician or the that's not much of a surprise visit I mean he's running for reelection\nYeah of course and I did get to him yesterday on\nThursday well tell tell us about those meetings because you were you you met with him I guess for two hours on Thursday right\nYeah we get so we had a group of women who sat in his office I day and they were actually arrested a\nHit about nine women arrested they sat there for ten hours listening to him they had a conference call it that my Monday that didn't really go out\nOn Thursday we had a group of about fifty go up to D.C and we met with him on my two separate occasions the first one we had probably about twenty twenty women there and twenty women men and teenagers and we told stories of sexual\nThat are way he he was very engaged in the conversation you had to step out of the room but did it affect ... you you feel like you were hurt and received with respect\nAbsolutely yeah he was extremely gauge she has got a question um I Do believe that Joe mansion cares for West Virginia I just don't think that's reflected in this decision\nDoes your wife continue if a judge Kavanaugh is confirmed brothers are doing\nOur fight that continues so I as far as the Senate go he ... he kind of knew that he had us he kind of had it because at the other option Patrick Morrisey has done a terrible thing for West Virginia he's a big proponent of\nThe opioid crisis and so he kind of nearly a dozen believe an opioid addiction\nHe doesn't but he was a lobbyist for big pharmaceutical and West Virginia I he's our current attorney general and he's just terrible he's got Trump's endorsement and that he's just a bad guy and I think he knows\nThat but I ... can't though this is old your opinion with me underscore this is my\n... now of course this is my opinion yes of course um\nSo yeah I think he believes that that he's still going to have the Democrat though and that he wants to get the Republican as well well it does continue yeah so we're working on I'm working at a statewide to change things just got a constitutional amendment on the ballot set ban abortion and Joe Manchin that we all have to get out and vote against that which we are doing\nWell if you're Jones is if you have accepted senator mansions vote for what it is and I'm Still support among the grid many issues and I got to tell you this this sounds very civilized in democratic to me\nI'm trying to play the long game I reluctantly as support has because I think the I think Morsi's worst choice mansion does still support us on the

after this has happened to them\nBecause they never felt comfortable coming forward before and the way the law is you have to report or bring a case within a certain amount of time so some of those

Sox the miraculous comeback coming back from three games down and obviously the red Sox and the Yankees for the first time in their history both when a hundred games in the same season and\nLast night was a battle I was there and it was it was one of those types of games where it looked like a blow out the red Sox are up five nothing and then all of a sudden here come the Yankees simply because this is exactly what these teams are the red Sox have the better starting pitching\nThe Yankees have the better relief pitching the red Sox relief pitching really almost gave it up to ...

but the crunch on Cleveland seven to two court club or a great pitcher got clue or club at you like this grows a lot\nYeah I think the Astros a but my my motto Scott and all of this is that okay the red Sox won a hundred and eight games the Yankees won a hundred games\nBut the actual still won a hundred hundred and two hundred and three games and they're still the defending champions and to me you're the champs until somebody beat you and I think they're the best team top to bottom of the best team in the line of the best team\nWith the best combination of relief pitching and starting pitching and they're scary and all of a sudden they're starting to look like\nChampions again even though for a lot of ... that a lot of a lot of the season they weren't quite into it but they're that good that they can sort of flip the switch and they seem to have done that\nBut what about the Dodgers they too straight shut up against the Atlanta Braves and\nYeah this is interesting because nobody seemed to be any good in the national league this year nobody seemed to really take control let's not forget your cubs who I picked to go to the world series had the best record in the national league

knock them out well the Dodgers have a nationally champs they went to\nThe seventh game of the world series last year losing to the Astros so maybe the Dodgers are the team that's going to start getting warm at the right time as well but I can tell you one thing Scott you may not want to hear this although maybe not I don't think you have a problem with it I kinda like what the Milwaukee Brewers are doing\nAnd they've got the rocks already on the road merit\nTo another and maybe you go to Colorado and things change but I I really like Milwaukee and the Dodgers I think this is just going to be great all of it's really good\nFind that we need to mention a twenty games suspension or in hockey Tom Wilson other cap shit Oscar sunkist or the blues on his blindsided and yeah and it just seems to be reacting to to head concussion more\nNo they're not reacting or they don't seem to be reacting they're reacting in there essentially sending the message that Tom Wilson to dirty player it's not just the fact that he had some 'cause in in drilled them in the head it's also that this is his\nFifth is his fourth suspension and the last hundred and five games so they have concluded that this guy when he gets on the ice is out there to hurt people and one of the things we always talk about with football is the danger but the thing we don't talk about is that hockey is just as dangerous and the guys that come in at a pretty high rate of speed\nAnd when you look at at the suspension now they're they're not playing around in their concluding this guy does not belong on the ice\nOr Brian thanks so much thank you he's part ... machine oh cop but\nGrief Nineteen Ninety seven's robocop there's a cult movie classic setting a dystopian Detroit\nBefore dystopian became a word used by seventh graders Peter ... flat robo cop and today Peter Weller acts direction producers but over the years has also become a PHD in Italian Renaissance art history\nNext week he will return to Detroit to be a featured speaker at the annual conference culture lab Detroit\nDr Peter ... joins us now from Hawaii Public radio in Honolulu thanks so much for being with us thank you very much desert [noise] so what made you go back to school to study or to the age of fifty seven you you could have been making a lot of money well you sat in the classroom\nOr all goes back to her dear friends Ali McGraw most people know as big star in the seventies sixties and seventies and she's versus it took me by the hand when the grand echo was going back to Spain because because I wanted to go back to Spain and she walked me through Picasso from his early days of realism all the way through his wife Cuba's ... what have you\nSo when you read about the costs so you can walk to yourself back in time through western art when you get to the renaissance it's politics and it's economics and its poetry and it's a change of\nThe look at the way the world looked at Roman classics a matter of fact the renaissance starts with the reinvention of classical literature Cicero Marshall living who talked what have you so I have to take classes in that so now I'm reading hooked\nAs I understand it your talk is titled the ... of tomorrow can you give us a preview\nWell I don't know who title it that I was just talking about the crisis of beauty mhm because Detroit is really in a city that's was hitting the skids and is really turning around its downtown area dramatically\nAnd the crisis of beauty or addressed by the culture left Detroit is what who and how we define is beautiful and\nIf it's put in the power of the wrong hands beautiful things I eat art will be destroyed or curse or ... blackened by somebody's opinion I mean someone can make some of those categories pronouncement or judgment on what he or she thinks is beautiful that's a crisis to me\n[noise] what will it be like for you to be back in Detroit\n[noise] it'll be fun man for someone to Detroit and I have to say you know I went to New York in Ninety Seventy one and it was dangerous and it was bad it was lethal and I raised that and it was gorgeous and it was exciting\nOr for someone with the Detroit I saw it and I think Nineteen eighty two or three something like that and it was the same way uh you couldn't go out in a hotel at night and I thought oh my God get me outta here man and then it went back and I saw the progression of improvement of it I Can't believe\nThe transformation of what the downtown is because what I see is what I get right away and when I see a beautiful city I see the restructuring of\nThe life downtown that people walk in the street that can happen in Chicago and New York it's happening Detroit I feel I don't know joined did they hit the Detroit simply because of robocop we didn't even shooting robocop but because we talk Detroit\nAnd Detroit is so like the ground of being of America in so many ways that I feel connected to it and then\nI'm told there's a robocop statue and it's going to be unveiled\nI keep hearing about it I don't want to get into it if they do it it's fantastic I Know I have a huge even though I'm In a fragile when did that but I certainly don't want to endorse like the statue or you have my own images\nBut I've certainly indoors like Martha Reeves of their manner you know or have Aretha Aretha for crying out loud I mean Europe statue of a

NPR's Ron Elving can tell us Ron thanks so much for being with us\nGood to be with you Scott let's begin to of course with the president's reaction to the Saudi explanation as it stands now it's been in several different places for the past couple of weeks for the death of ... uh the president calls it credible lots in Congress don't\nThe Saudis say he was killed in a fist fight with Fifteen men\nAny child in any school yard in the world could see through that story Scott but it wasn't concocted to be believed any more than the earlier versions of the story the Saudis have now abandoned\nIts intended simply to be told and accepted as a pretext for continuing business as usual\nAnd that's less about oil these days and it's about billions of dollars in arms sales\nPresident Trump made that clear this week while he was seated with executives from a number of us arms makers who are selling those weapons to Saudi Arabia the president has made it clear this journalist was not a U.S citizen and that this is not the president's focus right now what is folks\nThe president made that clear this week by spelling out his agenda like a shopping list he said this election this fall is about cabinet on the care of and law and order and common sense\nAnd the president and other Republicans have been treating Brett Kavanaugh\nAs a martyr even though he was in fact confirmed and is in fact on the Supreme Court now\nThe caravan is that group of several thousand refugees from Central America who have been stopped at the border of Guatemala and Mexico far from the United

policy and much more and which so far he has not\nBeen able to build all be noted uh it does seem those at the polls have tightened in recent days haven't thing\nSome of the polls have tightened and

early fall in October that lead shrinks sometimes that means a close election\nSometimes it doesn't but the more lightly attached voters in either party tend to come home in October and that's been

million dollars worth of things and a hundred and ten million dollars worth of military [noise] those are the biggest orders in the history of this country\nTrump exaggerates those dollar figures but

God well visiting the Saudi conflict in Turkey on October second\nAfter weeks of denials they say some kind of fight broke out shortly after Mr ... who lived in Virginia and wrote columns for the Washington Post arrived at the embassy that day to complete paperwork for his marriage President Trump reacted yesterday and called it a very sad thing\nHe did not criticized the Saudis and beer down ... was with the president on the campaign swing out west and joins us now Don thanks for being with us my pleasure and let's begin with the president's first comments or after Saturday's the Saudis announced a confirmed\nThe obvious that Mr show jihad died or in their custody he at the at the embassy and I stumbled\nThe president was asked about it will turn an air force base\nWell I think it's a good first step into big said it's a lot of people a lot of people involved that I think it's a great first step\n[noise] um a lot of people\nFrom different at Eighteen arrested related to uh to the fight that the Saudis say resulted in ... what else did you say on the topic\nWell he he took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called the showed used at the unacceptable but also right away scot he pivoted to the contracts\nThe Saudis have with U.S companies like Boeing and General Dynamics and and as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment\nWhereas a hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response bought\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution\nCancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work\nWhich means six hundred thousand jobs\nIt's got just briefly the president uses those numbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to facts are facts are as is the number of jobs and we'll say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that your mouth ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting a given given up quickly in the past he has leveled very blunt criticism of other us allies are closer allies Canada Germany over trade and the like a not so with the Saudis now\nAll of this comes up as the president is campaigning for Republicans in a number of Senate races that are considered too close to call in Montana Arizona he'll be in Nevada later today what does the president talked about how does he present his argument at his rallies he\nIs really trying to get the base his hardest core supporters to make sure they turn out so he's talking about still the battle to confirm justice Brett Kavanaugh calls Democrats who protested cabinet Kavanaugh in unhinged angry mob and I can tell you the rally crowds love that language\nUh and and he talks about the that that caravan that large group of refugees mostly from Honduras at currently heading north toward the U.S border and lots of TV coverage of it and the president clearly sees it as a political gift just before the election this is from his rally in Arizona last night\nDemocratic victory in November\nBe a bright flashing invitation every traffickers\nEli in on the planet come on and come on and uh so that's the vibe at these rallies in in Trump's orbit even on a day when the news is about the confirmation of death but your mouth ...\nAnd here is Don Gonyea thanks very much for being with us then you've got\nThe Trump Administration has had a muted response so far to the death of your mouth showed gee\nWe turn now to evil do there he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now head of the Chicago Council on global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey as\nThe ... the throne America's abdication of global leadership ... thanks so much for being with us glad to be here based on all of your experience just to Saudi explanation of how Mr Grisham you died recruiting you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damaged limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a pump pale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president\nUh how much of this damage limiting exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both\nWashington and ... we're trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in in in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to\nSuspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is the is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid an foreign society\nWell yes the exports of a democracy to foreign countries on to a\nPoint of value and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept the Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed and in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections are and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president of the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests\nAnd we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in\nThe rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and\nUh it's not just to expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be take\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments of that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy and\nMake clear that the kind of behavior we named\nTop two weeks it's unacceptable ... thank you thank you\nInstead of

few years the opioid crisis that the face of addiction can be just about any face an obituary that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touch many readers this week\nIt included a photo of smiling face of metal Lynch in there with her toddler son Hayden was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo shoot a good day from it\nBut she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old and production cotton at a high school party a drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son metal in lynching near died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her\nSister Kato needles wrote that obituary and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Burlington thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me first we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be\nAn actress and starring Broadway musicals and she really had the voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs that it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew in lived and then there was that a Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with says spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\n[noise] we've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did she tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it\nTake opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Maddie this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of\nUm disappeared again drove more than one program are gathered yeah she tried many\nWhat made you sure all of this and you're aerobics or\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lived and to to not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry that hope for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know [noise]\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronouncing there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications to help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing\nI also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier to recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with her son and her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nUnderstand there's going to be a service from ... there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWell through song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a a video of Matty singing a Bonnie rate song she was just sitting at the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of support and solidarity\nFor our family right now and I think we'll have more of that kind of sharing on Sunday what bunny rich on man [noise] I Can't make you love me\n\n\nCater O'Neill

correspondent NPR's Ron Elving can tell us Ron thanks so much for being with us good to be with you\nShouldn't to the Saudi explanation as it stands now it's been in several different places for the past couple of weeks for the death of Jamal ... or the president calls it credible lots in Congress don't\nThe Saudis say he was killed in a fist fight with Fifteen men\nAny child in any school yard in the world could see through that story Scott but it wasn't concocted to be believed any more than the earlier versions of this story the Saudis have now abandoned\nIts intended simply to be told and accepted as a pretext for continuing business as usual and that's less about oil these days and it's about billions of dollars in arms sales President Trump made that clear this week\nHe was seated with executives from a number of us arms makers who are selling those weapons to Saudi Arabia the president has made it clear this journalist was not a U.S citizen and that this is not the president's focus right now what is folks\nThe president made that clear this week by spelling out is gender like a shopping list he said this election this fall is about Kavanaugh the caravan law and order and common sense\nAnd a president and other Republicans have been treating Brett Kavanaugh as a martyr even though he was in fact confirmed and is in fact on the Supreme Court now\nThe caravan is that group of several thousand refugees from Central America who have been stopped at the border of Guatemala and Mexico far from the United states but they wanted to be coming to the United states so the president is using them to symbolize the immigration he wants to stop\nAs for law and order that's the phrase is older states rights and of course we all want the rule of law applied equally to all but the phrase has also been used\nAs code for resistance to social change and common sense is another familiar phrase a recently used as a political cultural\nBy the Tea Party as you mentioned round the care of and it's been a feature of the the rallies that President Trump has been addressing but\nHe's also threatened to withhold some foreign aid over it has me\nYes the stopping the caravan and the threat of withheld assistance is substituting right now for the border wall which the president has made the symbol of his immigration policy and much more and which so far he has not been able to build\nAll be noted uh it does seem those of the polls have tightened in recent days I haven't they\nYes some of the polls have tightened and for a variety of reasons among them that this is October and that's what the polls usually do in the month before an election especially if we've seen one party or the other getting well ahead in the early fall in October that lead shrinks sometimes that means a close election\nSometimes it doesn't but the more lightly attached voters in either party tend to come home in October and that's been especially true of Republicans in recent

administration's appeared reluctant to do anything that could jeopardize its close ties with the kingdom NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nIt took the Saudis two and a half weeks to craft their account of

embarrassed and have it to speak about\nAll this week when the president was asked about ... case he emphasized Saudi Arabia Israel not only as an ally but as a customer\nWhat I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty million dollars worth of things and a hundred and ten million dollars worth of military those are the biggest orders in the history of this country\nTrump exaggerates those dollar figures but the Saudis are big spenders especially in the United states\nBank roll tech companies like ... than lucid motors Saudi money also flows to American universities such as Harvard and Georgetown and foreign policy think tank here in Washington\nEven before the ... death some recipients were trying to distance themselves from the kingdom's money but it's not easy

of our high tech companies they're investing and institutions and art museums they have a lot of money to spread around\nFor decades bras and says both us and the Saudis encourage those commercials

doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects shows a change in no way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know

uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries\nI see no there's not many other names for them or the N. word definitely works\nHired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the

sources told us even when he was doing this\nVery strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know [noise] I guess I Am among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal that us citizens couldn't do that\nThere are laws that govern whether the U.S whether us individuals can service officers can enlist in foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nOr you've seen how Americans have served in the French uh I've I've mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces\nAnd these are not in love with a lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during world ... sure right yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries\nBut I I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you're then join a foreign military just for the money now and and by the way this doesn't apply to people who join ISIS or the Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or a U.S ally that really is against the law that has all this is a buzzfeed\nStory not an NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it um is this an

other Americans\nOf and the ones who enter other Americans who believe you've uncovered yeah right is this happening in in theaters around the world I'm gonna keep on looking at it and I've had the

work\nWell there are several reasons why does and there's a lot of money involved but they also argue they believe this is part of the war on terror but their argument is look the way he is close to the United states the UAE he is doing U.S policy the U.S has not spoken out against the war in Yemen we fuel airplanes we sell them bombs we sell them guns we train them we can do to train them\nTheir

till it does happen so you can take another\nUnnecessary barrier and and and put it away because I think that the NBA NBA has been the progressive lead the NBA's been the one that has been better run on protests the NBA's been better in terms of having female referees the NBA's been better with my colleague Doris work on the broadcast\nAnd so the next step is to have a female head coach and it's really not that big a deal for the rest of us because if you actually live in society we've all had female bosses at some point but in\nThat we do here I Want to know yes [laughter] I Know\nAnd in in that sport it's a big deal in professional sports in the the male dominated game and also let's not forget that that ESPN actually put the you know we have two women on the broadcast now for football

three times the average and the child was getting really sick had been admitted to ICU have needed to be ventilated and we were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV\nWhat if the parents children\n[noise] so the parents were saying to us why ... where well controlled well HIV positive people we take a medication every day\nWhy when you consider us so that was said to me that wish from the parents and the ... particularly who was the dar now that she could be a diner\nAnd we had to consider that very carefully 'cause we have to make sure that we promotion and Hans the autonomy of our patients as far as possible so it was interesting that in this case it was very much motivated by a request from this very brave says parents who wanted to save the life of their child\n[noise] talk records do think this uh this case the more people know about it will love contribute something to lifting the stigma that they try to be in so many countries around the world\nI Would like to hope so you know HIV stigma is an extremely complicated thing and it's it's a multifaceted\nSays the U.S and South Africa although we have this very well integrated national aids treatment program HIV is still very stigmatized\nAnd one of the things we would really hope to show to what we've done here is that if you're an HIV positive person and you're on your medication you living in normal life\nThen that should preclude you from being an organ donor it shouldn't stop you from having those options that HIV negative people would have and we hope that by showing that HIV positive people can do this\nThat that would help to reduce the stigma to some extent but this is just one case and it's going to take a lot more than one case to make a serious dent in HIV stigma\nTalked harried Etheridge medical bioethicist to bitch Donald Gordon medical center in Johannesburg thanks so much for being with us thank you very much\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nJoan of

kidnapping are killing ... show the burden of proof is on them\nIf that certified I'll throw up some possibility should the U.S close that big embassy in Riyadh or should they closed the big building

journalists as enemies of the people but we need to stand up\nFor journalists everywhere Jamal ... Virginia resident and you're right there are a number of things that we could do I'll tell you what I focus on the first thing the Senate did this week the members of the Foreign Relations committee on which I said is we sent a letter to the president to trigger\nIs a review of whether this\nTreatment of mock show you violate something called the Magnitsky Act Magnitsky Act\nAllows the White House to put sanctions on individuals if they engage in human rights abuses when we send a letter it triggers a hundred and twenty day investigative period where the administration has to report back to Congress as to whether there have been a human rights violation and what they're going to do about it that's number one\nNumber two um we have been in the Senate increasingly concerned about Saudi Arabia and working to potentially these arms sales to them we had a vote a few months ago were forty seven of us\nVoted to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia because of their mishandling of the civil war in Yemen and the massive humanitarian crisis there so a second thing that you are likely to see I think Senator Paul and Murphy have talked about this is\nAdditional action to block arms sales President Trump reacted very negatively that the other day but you'll see that and then the final one is us support for the\nFor the Saudis and the ... the war in Yemen and I think there is increasingly a desire to just\nA cease us support for the war in Yemen which is a massive humanitarian disaster so I think before we get into embassy diplomatic relations we've had a long standing relationship with Saudi Arabia but I think there are there are Magnitsky arms sales and support for the war in Yemen are\nProbably the three areas where Congress has now most focused and and it is a dramatic change in attitude about Saudi Arabia as a result of this action\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the alliance for lifetime income a nonprofit composed a financial services

three weeks before election day the vast majority of those applications are from African American voters\nGroups are showing Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp who runs voting in that state campus also they Republican nominee for governor reporter Johnny Kauffman of member station WAMC in Atlanta joined just Johnny thanks so much for being with us\nNo problem what are the reason or reasons these applications are being held up\nSo these are applications Georgia's system has flagged for airs there's this controversial process here called exact match which compares voter registration applications to other government databases so basically works like this right you have\nThere's just like one letter off on your application maybe it's missing a high Finn or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker inputs the information wrong if something like that happens\nThen the application is frozen and people are not put on the voter registration list but I Want to make something really clear and all of this if the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote or you can clear up to\nBe and then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting\nYeah and of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about not just conventional vote fraud as we've known it in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow invading the voters roles and uh we we we've certainly been concerned about that what is it a complaint that show rights groups are making\nWell the group's point out that the vast majority of potential voters on the list or people of color meaning that the process is disproportionately affecting people of color and they say that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this under camps office they made similar complaints\nAnd there was a settlement they ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law\nThat was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy ... he's actually following state law and his office says you know this exact match protocol it's really important to help fight voter fraud\nAnd of course he winds up being the Republican candidate for governor against a Stacey Adams Abrams the Democrats first African American candidate in Georgia nominated for governor by a major party this has become a huge issue in the race has meant\nYeah she is really going after a camp for this um\nShe said everyone who can vote should vote on behalf of those who cannot boosting turnout for people of color is really key to her campaign strategy I'm On the other side Kemp campaign says this is just a manufactured crisis\nBut for both candidates motivating the bases really key in this race because the polls show it's really close and there are very few undecided voters so not all about

a credible model and like most Americans she just had a rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patch she ... she was a sophomore at Jackson State university\nAnd she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty and Jackson was home\nAnd books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life I think her from a writer Lee practice that I still have now\nBut that rarely practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps in a lot of the chair that I think she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nAnd we do have to get to that don't we face up\nTo the outside world your mother a progression of voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television is on a political prognostications\nMake much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like shards of abuse and you know when I was around nine or ten she started to 'em with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I was faced with police or why people would be even a harsher\nAnd those meetings just I think started to give progressive Lee worse\nAnd I think that the beating my mother was taken from life\nFrom our town from her partner also started to get progressive way worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was joined us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the ... from your mother the ...

big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding\n'em [noise] and he knew virtually I started to start as a way of attempting to hide and attempting to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between of which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something right\nNow the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours a night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like I can just push my body and pushing my body and pushing my body I could disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police as I get kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be okay with people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how did that Andrew your life\nOh man I'm by the time my body broke my body literally wrote from overuse wrote from not sleeping and brought from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I may from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about they're harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I've talked about in that book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely the perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much in Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame\nWhen we show people into people that the money that we are able to make\nWe are unable to cheap right\nAnd especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and

Virginia resident and you're right there are a number of things that we could do I'll tell you what I focus on the first thing the Senate did this week the members of the Foreign Relations committee

House to put sanctions on individuals if they engage in human rights abuses when we send the letter it triggers a hundred and twenty day investigative period where the administration has to report back to Congress as to whether they're going to human rights violation and what they're going to do about it that's number one\nNumber two um we have been in the Senate increasingly concerned about Saudi Arabia\nAnd working to potentially these arms sales to them we had a vote a few months ago were forty seven of us\nVoted to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia because of their mishandling of the civil war in Yemen and the massive humanitarian crisis there so a second thing that you are likely to see I think Senator Paul and Murphy have talked about this\nIs additional action to block arms sales President Trump reacted very negatively that the other day you'll see that and then the final one is us support for the for the Saudis and the UAE and the war in Yemen and I think there is increasingly a desire to just a cease us support\nFor the war in Yemen which is a massive humanitarian disaster so I think before we get into embassy diplomatic relations we've had a longstanding relationship with Saudi Arabia\nBut I think there are there Magnitsky arms sales and support for the war in Yemen are probably the three areas where Congress has now most focused and and it is a dramatic change in attitude about Saudi Arabia as a result of this action\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the alliance for lifetime income a nonprofit composed of financial

showing over tens of thousands of other applications that have been held up but\nJust over three weeks before election day the vast majority of those applications are from African American voters\nGroups are showing Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp who runs voting in that state campus also they Republican nominee for governor reporter Johnny Kauffman with member station WAMC in Atlanta joined us Johnny thanks so much for being with us\nNo problem what are the reason or reasons these applications are being held up\nSo these are applications Georgia's system has flagged for airs there's this controversial process here called exact match which compares voter registration applications to other government databases so basically works like this right you have\nThere's just like one letter off on your application maybe it's missing a hyphen or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker inputs the information wrong if something like that happens\nThen the application is frozen and people are not put on the voter registration list but I Want to make something really clear and all of this if the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote or you can clear up their problem by going to the polling place with your photo ID\nAnd then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting yeah\nAnd of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about uh not just conventional ... vote fraud as we've noted in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow invading the voters roles and uh we we we've certainly been concerned about that what is the complaint that show rights groups are making\nThe group's point out that the vast majority of potential voters on the list or people of color meaning that the process is disproportionately affecting people of color and they said that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this under ... office\nEnding the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law that was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy undercount he's actually following state law and his office says you know this exact match protocol it's really important to help fight voter fraud\nAnd of course he winds up being the Republican candidate for governor against a Stacey Adams Abrams the Democrats first African American candidate in Georgia nominated for governor by a major party this has become a huge issue in the race has meant\nYeah she is really going after a camp for this um she said everyone who can vote should vote on behalf of those who cannot boosting turnout for people of color is really key to her campaign strategy\nI'm On the other side Kemp campaign says this is just a manufactured crisis but for both candidates motivating debates is really key in this race because the polls show it's really close and there are very few undecided voters so not all about who's going to actually show up\nJohnny Kauffman of member station WAMC thanks so much thank you\n[noise]\nBut David Sheff

and the boat shocks Boston as the most wins of any team the season and make quick work of the gangs but the Astros could be even stronger than they were last year couldn't ...\nYou know but by virtue of of how they are playing right now I liked the defending champion Astros Scott they pounded Cleveland in the American league division series three games to none by combine score of Twenty one to six\nUh and the red Sox beat the Yankees as you mentioned but to the winds were kind of nervous one run when so I'm like in Houston in this series\nUh American women soccer team a place Trinidad and Tobago this week and the qualifying tournament for the world cup Trinidad and Tobago where they were the ones responsible for knocking the U. S. men out last year right\nYes that's right the bombs or to bring that up [laughter]\nIt it was a sad moment for the U.S men but we're talking about the U.S women are nearly always happy story the the game against Trinidad Tobago already happened it was seven a win for the Americans they dominated the round Robin portion\nOf the conquer calf tournament that's disqualifying tournament for the world cup the U.S had three straight victory spy combine score of Eighteen to nailed\nUm but the U.S is ranked number one in the world Scott and and most of the conflict calf competition not as keen and as it will be in the world cup next year\nIn France tomorrow the U.S plays number sixty four rank Jamaica in the semi finals of the conquer kept tournament in a wind will guarantee a World Cup spot even with a stunning loss there would be other avenues to get to the world cup so\nIt's looking good for the U.S which is the defending World Cup champion from twenty Fifteen\nYeah and uh and something that ah that every American should be proud of them they're doing a great job NPR's Tom Goldman so to you by the way thanks so much good to be with you good to be with you [noise]\nFor the Saturday Night live the onion or John Stewart there was mad magazine parodies jokes and cartoons that a lot of investors of those other enterprises grew\nIt's often considered less edgy than other avenues of satire but then the current issue there is a four page comic strip drawn by mark palm written by Matt Cohen that spells out the alphabet with names of children who were or would soon be the victims of the school shooting\nThe piece is called the ... trying to reach a take on the original ghastly ... was drawn by Edward gory in the Nineteen sixties mad magazines executive editors bill Martian who joins us from their offices in Burbank, California thanks so much for being with us Hi Scott thanks for having me\nLet me give people some idea a begins\nAge for Alice the young science ... little girl is holding looks to be a science experiment beers for Brian cramming for a quiz\nThen you begin to understand what's going on and as for Nathan who's caught\nIn the path she is from Paula protecting clash Mitch this very\nPowerful I Know and that's that's the reaction we've gotten from a lot of fans um you know one of the comments was I'm writing this day and my calendar because it's the first time I've ever cried reading mad magazine\n[noise] we'll meet two um\nWhatever gory to the er the original alphabet that also was talking about bad things happening little kids and now it's something else isn't it it's like a clear and present danger\nYeah I mean Nick ... who is one of my predecessors as editor of mad\nUsed to always refer to mad as a fun house mirror sort of held up to our society\nAnd you know for the most part you look at that reflection than you laugh but sometimes you look at that reflection than yours are horrified that's kind of the situation we have here where you know we don't want to ignore this or we don't want to take a pass and say well this is one thing\nThat you know ... it's not going to comment on but we have to do it in a different way more sober serious way\nYeah I I Can't get over the fact that a lot of kids as you know we'll be reading mad magazine I mean you an idea about the same time\nYeah I was about eleven eleven or twelve when I started reading mad\nAnd are there was one piece that I really recall it depicted a soldier in a a welcome home parade in his home town and he's coming down the street dressed in his uniform instead of carrying a rifle he's got a big hype of Germany needle\nAnd it was commentary on how soldiers were getting you know addicted to heroin and other drugs and you know there was nothing at all funny about it but as a kid you know you see that and it sticks with you and that sort of I mean for me anyway it really shaped the way I thought about things\nWhat would you hope youngsters would do or how they would react at reading this today\nUm my hope would be that this would just open up conversations\nOn the very last panel of a peace\nHas a little girl going back to school\nShe's passing the tombstones\nOther friends who were killed at the\nAt the previous school shooting and it says yes for Zoe who won't be the last [noise]\nAnd that's something that kids are thinking about\nSo hopefully this will just keeps a\nConversation going or\nTrying to figure out what we can do about it\n[noise] bill more as soon as the executive editor of mad magazine\nThanks so much for being with us\nThank you Scott's been my pleasure\n[noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "13", "locations": [["Virginia", 38.34982, -81.63262],
