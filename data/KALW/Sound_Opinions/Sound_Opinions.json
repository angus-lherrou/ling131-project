this week we're going to share some of our favorite music the flying under the radar\nThey can\nUse\nPlus we remember audio engineer Jeff camera worked with the Beatles I'm revolver and sergeant peppers we're going to revisit our conversation with changing\nGears June or job training\nThat's all coming up on Mount opinion\nSound opinions they supported by this island beer company breweries have good IP a fourth ... there'll be farmhouse ale and bourbon county branched out more active silent dot com we do need to be the only very drink we just want to be the bacteria\nDrink\nYou're listening sound opinions and later in the show Jim we're going to pay tribute to the late Jeff am record a name that may not be a household name uh but uh certainly a legendary a audio engineer\nEspecially for his work with the Beatles classics like revolver sergeant peppers lonely hearts club band and he wrote among other class for it [noise]\n\nBut now it's time for another round of buried treasures Gregg is one of my favorite shows right indeed indeed what's buried treasure it this was a recording the we define as something that's probably under the mainstream radar you probably haven't heard of it\nOr a week collect bees we try to do the show every once in a while and turn you want to great music that deserves a wider audience Greg you get to go first job I'm going to start\nOff with a an exploration of garage rock one of our favorite genres ever since the sixties right every band that wanted to be you know we just talked about the Beatles while there was a lot of bands cropping up all over America that want it to be the Beatles play music in garages are in that tradition has carried on a long and glorious history in Chicago\nOr the last decade we've ... we've had a a ton of these really great garage rock combo in other words these are veterans from that seem that are forming this band eaters\nAre two things that make either as stand out from the pack one is the songwriting bone Hansen in particular he is writing a\nDeeper more introspective ally lyrical than you would expect from the typical garage rock band\nThe a a suicide an older brother ah has really informed a number of the lyrics on this I mean it's impossible to miss a bad vibe that melancholy tragic by that that courses through a number of these suction but it's not a downer at all this is a great band\nAnd I think the or the other distinctive feature of this band is the um a keyboard smearing McCain uh she plays one of those ... is\nThere a mirror yeah you're a reverse there for you to play with my band I don't know why and what I like about it is\nA Easter is does not use the uh the far fees as just sort of a little accent that its own over driven now lead instrument in this band and some of the heavier rock or is it really blast into the forefront\nThe sugar I'm going to play though is is more on the contemplative side it's just got a haunting melody two at a ... you hear the the bans gift\nFor a hawks are as well as that sort of the underlying tone of melancholy it's something from the band Peters unsound opinion\n\n\nThat is either it's with a song called something would have my buried treasures\nI'm loving to Greg does what ... supposed to do you just turn me on to them I Would say that they are more of the late era a garage where it's not just tear it up fake are and be a ... right I mean there's a lot of psychedelic mushrooms me up the psychedelic feeds\nI'm going to go all the way to New Zealand for my first buried treasure a band called the bats\nUm you know I my favorite bad for me dealing since why do the Concorde moved\nThis is a wonderful I'm really a energetic pop punk band\nWith a sort of in the uh you know shiny a psychedelic almost at times by think of the great Courtney Barnett renting the chills or the cleaning or other great kiwi bans ripe um and I don't make that Courtney Barnett comparison lightly\nThe leader of this group Elizabeth stokes is really smart or almost not ballistic songwriter uh sometimes I think I'm doing fine I think I'm pretty smart\nThan the walls become then somebody gets in I'm defenseless I Love that line from a song called future me hates me and I love that whole concept\nOf you as as as someone a young person trying to find your way in the world and you're looking ahead and thinking someday maybe I'll get it together and that person's gonna hate the person I Am now wow\nThat is a lot to pack into\nA this explosive guitar driven you know for an ethically drummed a punk song I just I just love it the bats from New Zealand future meat hates me [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThat is the bats with the title track from their new album just came out in August future me eight to ... car park record that is a great title or if you're already a story of my life\nSophistication of relative sophistication of what the answers were doing the same thing with the best that those counterpoint harmonies really got me yeah I kind of a cut above\nOn this record up the next thing I Want to go to is our girl from the u._k. bright and to be specific a coed trio led by a woman named Sophie Nathan she's also a member of a band called big moon but our girl her other band sounds nothing like the big moon is kind of more of\nA down beach and more ah atmosphere or a girl is a is a trio in which a Nathan's guitar is right up front a lover sort of under state of very conversational the vocal style but she's got a real feel for hooks as a guitar player not only hooks\nBut also the ability to crank it up you know you get\nFrom these kind of eerie mood pieces it that just sort of explode you know when you least expect it so that dynamic plays itself out this is a really really good a debut album is called strangers today and here's a track from it it's called in my head from our girl unsound opinion [noise]\nHuge production in in the case of the new album that uh is so compelling to me is uh unusual and unusual for the scene that that came out of to me it's a this record is symbolic of advantage\nAt the edge of something that could just break up tomorrow and are just starting to just throw every idea\nOr maybe they could become a Twenty one pilot either way higher if you've got to pick a of an album that we really need to hear your call\nFind us on Facebook or Twitter after break rank and file dig up some more buried treasures plus lead or has one more picked you that's all coming up on sound opinions from WB easy Chicago NPR ...\nI felt

Hammond organ to record a vocal which just wasn't done right the jumped\nNo no of course it wasn't done and I know I also had you know certain sounds in my head because I I'd be listening to a lot of American records while I was most most string records and I don't want you to try and improve\nOr get get more more sort of adventurous sounds out of the studio the ... the we were basically getting and the other thing I was going in full was his closest sound honoring drum kit and not to move the ... closer to get ... from skin off and go into trouble or you know for moving ... closer than than two feet and\nEventually ended up with a written letters to giving me permission to be able to do that\nTell us about these backward tape loops which were obviously a big part of tomorrow never knows and the whole album how did you guys happened upon using this\nYou know we went to our own little ... and pull in particular I used to go go home and an expert in like in these little little crazy type loose on on his\n... machine but they'd be back which things started when John actually on the ... the on his reel to reel because you know read we didn't have ... and and the only way you could take attract how to listen to it was a play by wacko I'm\nA which meant watching for an up till the next stage and get together so Jonah he's reel to reel tape machine and been completely known technical took the type of of of a rough mix\n'em and like stood up backwards on the machine and came back the next day and said there was something wrong with the mix\nAnd not realizing that you've been playing it back to [laughter] ... ... off after that we you know we you know that that's how the backwoods things started you know we used to listen to everything backwards that we we we recorded you know even as as just as it as well not really a joke because ... and\nWe we we saw the Russian language was was actually English backwards and we do some Russian\nUh spoken word and played it backwards to see if it was actually English when it was played back was also [laughter] [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn't get the impression from here there and everywhere your book yet but there was a stranger moments been Lehman deciding that he had to sound as if\nHe was singing underwater for yellow submarine and in fact he wanted you to record him singing underwater\nIn well what exactly I mean that was you know what I mean I'm running around the studio false will turn on the air out you know there's all there's all the all the people that you know as a sign in the end of someone you to join you can't do that I mean it'd be blowing singing singing into ... knows what else\nThe so I so will the next best thing is just this out of desperation was to try and put a more profound in in in a in a bottle of water and growing up just ... to the to the Gulf Gulf milk both will but we have to protect the slim convince the microphone\nWhich had you know two hundred and full developed running through it a\nElectricity I don't know much about recording engineer and electricity and water don't mix right ...\nExactly yeah so I was thinking well what what can we put in a ... you know produce through the uh the ... of his wallet and ... the market now and in San ... in the middle of possible so on and that's what we did when I called a dose declined it up using it it was just a dull yeah sort of sort of sound to Joan Joan\nYour gender you if you had that use condoms today or I Am a man you'd be set for next year I'm your\nFear right he couldn't understand why you couldn't directly inject he's vocal but you could have vice guitar or get a guitar like lights are on ... and you know ... or ... ... ... and explain to your doctor of an operation another ... to their needs met but that was on the shutters a joke you know he so he can run up stuff like that you know\nOne of the things that I think you you sort of pioneered with this record revolver a Jeff was just simply where you place to the microphones inside ring goes bass drum and close to my you know the the string section on an al ... did you have any idea how these experiments were going to turn out before you tempted them\nBut they do all the other and everybody thinks string sound was was a sound that you know to discuss with pool and we want to disclose shining because when I went in very close onto the string plans with those microphones which was a ... a double ... so there was a player is there\nA but they'd never be marked as close as opposed to some of the guys as we would find the bank to ask who weren't as good as good a player does the guys in the front desk you know used to sort of saw ditches away from the ... but but you know I Wish you could hear what was going on I just keep going downstairs\nAnd I'm just getting them to move back you know maybe you're more close to an end the ... not to tell them to stop doing it in the ... because we were off to particular sound [noise]",

easy Chicago NPR actually this is sound opinions I'm Jim ...\nAnd I'm Greg caught this week our guest is Wayne Kramer musician and lead guitarist for the legendary Detroit rock band MC five it was just the lows of addiction in prison and the high performing live if\nMusicians are tuned into each other and have a fundamental agreement about what they're\nThe fleet will also reviewed new music from hip hop artist NO NAME and pay tribute to late Chicago blues legend\nOtis Rush that's all coming up unsound opinions\nFound opinions as supportive I guess that was their company Chicago craft or if that works to innovate new ways to brew an age they're more apt to silence dot com you don't need to be the only theory drank we just want to be the best theory drink\nYou're listening to sound opinions and later on we'll talk with musician Wayne Kramer legendary guitarist for the Detroit banned the MC five currently on tour celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of that band signature debut kick out the jams\nWill talk to wane about his new memoir is struggles with drug and alcohol addiction and his time in prison and how that helped turned his life around but first we have to pay tribute to the late great Otis Rush [laughter]\n\nLet his oldest Russia with I Can't quit you baby his first single in Nineteen fifty six oldest rushed died recently the age of eighty four Jim not as well known as some of the great a Chicago these icons you know Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon even touting guy Howlin' Wolf [noise]\nBut I Would say as influential as any of them are really important a figure in the Chicago blues in beginning in the fifties in fact if you'd only recorded those sites that he did with Kobe records here in the fifties for over a two year period\nOf fifty six through fifty eight he would be a legendary guitars you had a long career after that suffered a stroke and the two thousand and three that you're centrally kept him off stage or for the last Fifteen\nYears of his life but his legacy is huge you just need to talk to people like Eric Clapton or Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac Carlos Santana Stevie Ray Vaughan his style was intense corrosive\nYou know he was he was a you know that noise melody kind of merger\nThat was so hip Twenty years later\nOr or or a decade later started with people like Hendricks oldest sort of had that style down in the fifties bar scene in Chicago and you can hear it in his guitar playing he was one of the architects of the so called west side sound there is a lot of debate in Chicago like what's the difference between the west side lose\nIn the south side lose some people say it was as simple as the fact that oldest rush used the horn section instead of a harmonica player in his bands\nBut there was also an intensity to the sound that old is a rush brought to his guitar playing that I think was truly truly distinctive the one thing about oldest rush is that you got a sense of you know people talk about the blues being kind of sad music yeah with Otis there was pain there was an English at the heart of it\nWell and there were protests music yeah you know I I hate you quote him again but the late great Lester Bangs at toward the end of his life the last great piece he wrote\nThe great guitarist Robert Klein who's also gone said you need to listen to Otis Rashid Lester was depressed he was down in the dumps he wrote this incredible piece that I have all my students in college read oldest rush mugged by an iceberg and it's about that intensity that searing pain\nAnguish anger there's no way you can listen to his guitar playing and not be moved\nA you know he'd always be smiling on those album covers yeah if you ever saw him perform there was that face was so serious and he was a very soft spoken guy when you did interviewing I remember once you know he was talking to me and he says you know I don't know\nDamn hard times and bills and this guy was a you know he worked at a steel mill packing house he's driving a truck\nYou know these guys didn't make a lot of money they had they had to make ends meet he was still worried about paying rent even though he was worldwide famous at that time there was a sense of that English and pain in every note he played his guitar player was extraordinary but it was also a great singer I think that probably the most underrated facet\nOf this as a performer was not only could he play the guitar but man that guy could sing as well here's one of his most famous tracks double trouble from a from the fifties when it first recordings he made just a kid in his early twenties\nAnd listen to the intensity beat the very adult nature of the English in this man's voice double trouble from Otis Rush on sound opinions\n\n\n\nThat is a great Otis Rush dead at the age of eighty four\nAnd\nRight that's a little bit of a track called window from room to twenty five the first proper album by an artist who goes by NO NAME she does have a name when he Warner grew up here in the Brownsville neighborhood of Chicago\nOr mom ran a bookstore well respected in the African American community\nUm now based in Los Angeles making a big splash with room twenty five although she first appeared on the hip hop scene a collaborating with a lot of Chicago hip hop talent this whole new generation Greg Mick Jenkins chance the rapper Donny Trump at the social experiment\nMeal of woods uh twenty sixteen got a lot of notice for her first mix tape as a solo artist telephone now comes a full album\nThe name comes from the fact she was twenty five when working on most of this album and also living in one hotel room after another dealing with drug addiction a turbulent relationship all of it goes into this record this is a song\nCalled NO NAME by hip hop artist NO NAME from room twenty five on sound opinions\n[noise]\n\nFor the small town in ... and you see that happening and I felt that my cancer none of the\n... with Canada\nJust from my\nIs on the right thing\nAnd he didn't and going from a camp there\n[noise] I mean and I have is lying\nOn the on that at that\n\nThat is NO NAME with a track called NO NAME from her new record room twenty five gym a lot of discussion about you know the name the meaning of that name NO NAME what he called herself known as the questions you get asked a lot of interviews\nAnd you know I think she's trying to addressing that in this record um the whole idea of identity what does it mean uh I think it's the subtext of almost every track on this record is that society\nTries to a race African American people tried to make them invisible women's I've been especially yes and you know stripping of your pride your dignity your identity that's that's the essence of life or so she becomes known him and embraces this reality\nOr you're you're on a rock band that does make some noise out of the mid west and suddenly you're on the radar or the vice president United States what was it was a feeling within the band at that time\nFelt like we were um\nServing the power structure but clearly used everything they held against us and we ultimately\nWent to court with the Justice Department over the issue of illegal wiretaps they said that they could tap our phones because it was a matter of domestic security\nAnd we held that we we're a nation of laws and not have men and that you needed a warrant signed by a judge to tap ones phones\nAnd the Supreme Court of the United states agreed with us\nAnd the day before a court decision was released the plumbers were caught taking the bugs out of democratic headquarters in the Watergate ... so our white panther wiretapped case led to the downfall of Richard Nixon\nI basically inserted my strata caster where the sun doesn't shine Richard Nixon [laughter] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nTo me was interesting when you talk very openly in the book you've heard of openly admitting you know hey I just wanted to not do a regular job I I didn't want to work\nI wanted to have sex I wanted to play in a rock and roll band and yet you become these sort of Abe ... hours of this radicalized you know left wing revolution how did that transition really occur what was the catalyst for that for that occurring\nWell it it wasn't that I didn't want to work\nI just didn't want to do certain kinds of work were you know I'm being a Detroit or we hold hard labor in high esteem there's no ability and working hard so I wanted to work hard but I wanted to work hard it's something that I taught mattered and I didn't think\nThat a ... a job on the line at the Chrysler was going to amount to much but the radicalization was ... that I was part of an entire generation that just could not\nStomach the hypocrisy and the corruption of American ideals you know my core I always saw myself as a Patriot Act you know democracy is participatory it's not just the word that we throw around it's actually something that we do\nAnd my understanding of the way our country function was if you didn't like the way the government was doing something that you could protest it and I protested with everything that I had\nAnd I was part of an entire generation that protested the war in Vietnam civil rights outdated fifty sexual morality\nMarijuana laws and host of other uh you know the environment [laughter] there there was a lot to protest\nAgainst and [noise] and um [noise] I was one of those people that smoke out [noise]\n\n[noise]\nRight in the middle of the sixty eight Democratic National convention when things got ugly you were the only against the where the number of bands were invited play you were the only band that actually did play at the convention a sort of a as a part of uh\nOf what was going out of the convention downtown Chicago you set up and Lincoln Park um what were your memories of that day in sixty eight or because of the riots started to flow downhill pretty much as soon as you got dumped playing right [noise]\nYeah it wasn't like other outdoor live music events\nThat we all have been to\nWhere people are happy and smiling and there was a good vibe it was very heavy vibes the Chicago police were driving there a Harley Davidson trace it goes\nThrough the crowd knocking them kids over there were undercover police are starting fist fights with kids a roughing people up\nSo the atmosphere was very tense and uh you know a number of uh the young people came prepared to fight and so once the ban once we finished our set and the crowd didn't have anything to focus on they focus their attention on the Chicago police and they were\nThey welcomed them with the ... swinging batons and and you had had busting and arrests and\nAnd it was the first time that a mom and pop America saw happening on the nightly news you know they had never seen a policeman beat kids before like a beat reporters like that and\n\nIt plain that after the MC five such intensity of blaze so bright for a short period of time you go into the recording is check it out and\nAnd it's a real super intense studio experience and you seem to have mixed feelings about that I'm Still you know you were you is something that you guys we're we're striving for was just sort of out of reach\n[noise] well we had no experience working in a recording studio it takes time\nTo learn how to be comfortable with the recording process we had only made a couple of singles before kickoff ... and check out the germs was recorded lives\nSo I'm back in the usa the MC five second album that was really our our education and how to record and we were going through a lot of changes in the band trying to trying to ratchet up our approach in order to be better musicians to be a better\n[noise]\nI have mixed feelings but [noise] um\nI I Know each album intimately I Know\nWhat their strengths and what their weaknesses were and in that records case I think we we did overreact to the criticism\nThat we were so undisciplined and so irresponsible [laughter] musically irresponsible idiosyncratic that that we that we really put a lot of emphasis on that the temples war solid and that the guitars we're in tune and that the singing\nWe're very ... in fact the lyrics are more overtly political on the second album than they were on the first album\nBut you know each of these albums as they're like my kids you know they got a special place in my heart and the great ... records of what we were trying to accomplish\nAnd yet those who who were there who saw the five in their heyday or who've seen you since in your quite excellent solo career you know will always say the records or break but it's live\n... what happens live I mean that's where I think if some day when I grow up I'm going to come to terms with jazz when I'm more mature but I as I understand as I understand what you guys took from jazz\nAnd and what you as a as a as a musician and a person of taken from jazz is that spontaneity unique a thing that can happen only in the moment mhm\n[noise] yeah there's a there's a time\nIf musicians are tuned into each other and have a fundamental agreement about what they're trying to do\nWhere everything works beautifully that you are human beings doing a most human activity of performing and creating music spontaneously and it actually never gets any better than that there's a lot and I've I've had my share of\nOf great nights of music where you're you're up on the stand and and everybody is just playing at the at the peak of their ability and the crowd is right there with you and\nThen the lights are writer and everyone looks good and we sound good\nAnd that's as good as it gets this those moments I I Try to grab a kiss from joy as it passes by\nOf all time um uh so yeah of course if or when Danny Fields\nSaid does or any other bands around here like the MC five I said no there's no more bands like the MC five which really just seemed like\nThe [noise]\nYou know we were all best friends and we all listened to the same coal train them sunrise and we're all smoked the same passion we always have the same bologna sandwiches and brown rice and\nIf you think about the characters you know coming through that scene again I guess I don't know if you knew Alice Cooper the time but you wouldn't even just a little bit later I guess a Seeger Bob Seeger measure writer all your characters I mean we're was it a close knit community in terms of the people who are making this kind of music which wasn't\nPrecisely mainstream certainly at that time\nYeah yeah it was it we all knew each other I mean we had all been together with all known each other\nGoing back to the record hop days where we're all show up at a at a church hall where one of the local DJ's would uh be spinning records and there'd be packed with teenagers dancing and and uh your band could get up and play a Fifteen or twenty minutes set in between\nLaw the a Motown artist that were coming by the lip sync their their latest release it was very exciting time I mean Detroit was thriving it was a bustling industrial city with the you know good paying jobs and everything seemed possible and\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nOne of the um hottest thing I've found to have a good buddy whose name is ... she\nAnd I know you and Ted Nugent came up in the same place at the same time All right\nUm but my God\nYou know he wants to go out and shoot Buffalo's and shoot anybody who wouldn't let him shoot a buffalo and and just just ... I mean he's about he's about a hundred and eighty degrees opposite everything you stay in Fort Wayne\nYeah it's it's it's pretty it's pretty weird yeah\nYou know he he never had any political interest in the sixties and he didn't really take it up until I'm thinking you know once a solo career kind of work and they were he was looking for something new to\nTo ah to keep him in the discussion and I think he discovered that through his uh his hunting and outdoorsman\nHobby that was a an entree into the world of radical right wing extremists the viewpoint\nYou know I I we remained friends or I could call them up today and we could have a pleasant conversation um but we have not we have yet to have a real substance of political shape and I and I I'm open to it\nGood in the world you know he works with kids he under writes programs for young people and I know he's a Family Guy and ... and I and I kinda worry about him you know he invited Tom Burrell and I\nTo one of his gigs and in LA and we went over to the house of blues where he was playing and were hanging out backstage\nAnd it's getting to be time for him to go on and he turns around and bends over to pick up his guitar and we see he strapped\n... you know he's got this this pillow in the back\nOf his ... ... it\nJust struck me like oh gosh what must a man's life be like that he has to go through it armed you know what world does he live and how much how much fear is got to be going on there\n[noise]\n\n\nLet me ask you a broader question I'm sure it seemed like even when people had political differences and that most turbulent time of\nThe sixties we could unite around certain things the music could bring people together do you think Wayne that still the case today I mean you playing a lot of different guys as you play in the indie rock punk rock underground and you play jazz and you play with prisoners behind bars and you just you know um it does it still have that power do you believe in yeah\nSure does our our ... will always have the power to make a connection between people\nTo to bridge the gap between people if I Do something in music\nIf I tell the truth about how I feel about something chances are there's somebody else out there that felt the same way that reminds me that I'm not the only nut case now out here you know somebody else's deals where because ultimately\nArt confirms our humanity and tells us we're not alone\n... and we're all in this together we are all in this together actually\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] I'm reading\nOne when the MC five fell apart and then you go down your passive of drug abuse crimes wind up in prison [noise] it seems like there was a distance there\nBetween you and and Fred sonic Smith and un Rob Steiner you you you say like ... I mean you deal with each passing in a couple of sentences and say you know we hadn't been close when he passed but it hit me hard well\nBecause we never were able to reconnect after the break up a band nothing was ever resolved or we never got to know each other as grown ups and it it's just left as open wound or star a and [noise]\nThere's there you know there is no closure or resolution to to ah\nPeople leave before their time even if even if it is a natural I mean what what is a natural death for me yeah right you know desire to die that's about as natural as it gets 'em but you know we never got to ... we never got a chance to to\nThrough together I I think we probably none of us really survived having been in the MC five it was too much for a bunch of young guys to walk through the fire and and all the the ultra highs and devastating Lowe's and the\nPressure and say that friendships and the camaraderie the undermining of all that and\nSee at one day all go away\nIt was it was rough so yeah I mean it was hard\n...\nVan [noise] boom [noise] ... do\nTell us about a ... you have the second career now is well a scoring films and doing film where you've been in LA for a long time now based on on the west coast um what is what does that world like how did you get into it\nWell I knew I knew that day was coming when I Would not be quite so enthusiastic about getting in the van again\nYeah yeah there is a great paragraph towards the end of the book about everybody romanticize it but it's leaving how sleeping on the floor night after night if yeah it's it's hard work\nAnd and uh you know I I thought I could\nDo some music for film it always seemed like a possibility I I Would listen to the under score on television and and uh and in movies and saw my could do some of that I could do something like that I Know a little bit about this\nBut when I finally moved to LA and started to pursue it seriously are just got a few jobs and then I discovered I Need to go back to school so I started taking a scoring classes at UCLA\nAnd the union has some good orchestrating classes running at the time\n'cause I had to learn the same thing that all composers have to learn the language of the orchestra having been in a rock band all my life didn't really prepare me for where did the violins go and where did the French horn goal and you know what the articulation that you

age beer more at ... dot com we don't need to\nBe the only beer he drank we just want to be the best very dry and\nYou're listening to sound opinions and a leader in the show Jim we're going to talk with Susan Jacobs she's an Emmy winning music supervisor\nThat means she's the person that picks the songs you hear in shows like a sharp objects and big little lies she's also been the music supervisor for a number of movies working with people like Spike Lee David all Russell\nOn and on she'll talk with us about how she decides what's the perfect song for every scene and how she got Led Zeppelin of all people to agree to their music being used\nThat's coming up later in the show Greg but first we've got some new music [noise]\nMet the man oh\nOn the you\nWho\nThat is a snippet of purple rain everybody knows that right oh yeah the great prince as you can tell very sparse a stripped down version or in its initial stages a purple rain\nThese are demo recordings are done in Prince his house before there was a Paisley Park even yeah\nA sitting at a piano with a microphone and working out songs and that's the name of the new ... prince album piano and the microphone Nineteen eighty three what a career he's had a since his death in two thousand sixteen the vaults have become a although yeah to the public will see\nUh what this producers because in the past we've seen some uh some vaults or projects or the Jimmy Hendrix as state or the doors et cetera ... where there's been a ton of recordings coming out a Pashtun asleep\nOr that is starting to happen now with prince's music as well we're gonna valley way or the the merits of this project but first let's play a track from it\nIt's a track called Mary don't you weep a the great uh nineteenth century spirit who's been in the gospel cannon for centuries as performed by prince from piano in a microphone Nineteen eighty three unsound opinions [noise]\n\n\n[laughter]\nFriends with a piano in a microphone in Nineteen eighty three covering Mary\nDon't you weep a I don't think he tops retail Franklin version on amazing grace but it is an extraordinary a version of that song Greg neglected to say it was recorded by an engineer this out and piano when a microphone Nineteen eighty three ... sat in\nOne point here prince talking about you got to flip that over our right cassette ... was an antiquated a technology I'll never mind I'm you know\nI Am saddened by what is certain\nTo be forty or fifty years of posthumous grave robbing of princes volts would he have released this I don't know is their interest there for people who love prince absolutely and you know the stakes are not high he's playing for the joy of playing you can see songs develop\nA you can see sides of his personality as with Mary don't you weep I also really love the ... song cold coffee and cocaine\nYou know I'm In Maine\nA prince heads talk about his Jamie start caring or like you know the street hustler the why they're you know All right you know Mary and and and cold coffee and cocaine or the only revelations here\nThis is not a great last prints album like say the blackout\nThe hard funk record he had to shell in Nineteen eighty seven we all scoffed it up on bootleg didn't come out officially till Nineteen Ninety four are their equivalent like that in in these ball I don't know there are revelations here\nI just don't know if I'll ever listen to it again\n[noise] you know I disagree with the I'll never listen to it again remark I mean that's your taste my initial reaction to this record was that it was a\nIt was kind of a throwaway okay what's what's this all about why is this even coming out and the more I listen to it as sort of got pulled into the idea\nThat we're getting a window into process here and we so seldom got that was French I'm you know he was very big on releasing finished records in fact there's tons of finished records in his vaults there I haven't come out\nSo why this one you had made purple rain get you know he's on the cusp of something really extraordinary\nBut we're seeing how his mind works and what I loved most about hearing this is his virtual city as a pianist a first of all a and the joy he brings to the performance is the fact that he seems to be so unfiltered and realizing hey I'm just sort of messing around here just following my mind letting it wonder\nIs pretty bad thing I mean there's basically a a a thirty minutes string of unbroken music you're where he's just getting on one\nEnd to the next you know a snippet of purple rain a snippet of Joni Mitchell\nUm\nThat great gospel track that we just play which by the way he totally reinvention it going to be that way yeah yeah it's it out of church is no big deal just Saturday Night local scripture is there any more than ... now a real person who yet you're lovers are going to come home ... married don't you weep you know he was\nTalking about some other subjects there he's blending the sacred and the and the propane\n\nYoung man up so I Love that aspect and I and I'm Glad you mentioned cold coffee and cocaine\nYou know a Jamie stars just another way saying I'm ripping on James Brown here now I'm not going to recommend this to everybody a but man if your prince man\nThis is that this was manner from Avon is a man like yeah but if somebody spent two years and went through what is alleged to be you know a treasure trove and the volt and just found those Mary don't you we're\nUm and and give us a whole outlook that\nYou know instead this is going to be no he's going to be putting out records you no longer than he was no doubt about it there's gonna be hundreds of prince records before we're we're all God's oh\nAnd worked very closely with Spike Lee's father who\nDid the score for that album when I was working at Arlen records\nAre girls that I once knew who all of them had\nOh thank God but they're all day to show their low and the which one which the ...\nAnd then I went on to management I kind of circled around this for a long time in different directions and by the time that I actually knew there was such a job is to music supervision which came from a recommendation to ... for ... that was the first\nFilm I ever did on my own you know I ... just like this is what my artist once Julian doesn't for the Washington I'm going to figure out a way to go [noise]\n\n\nYou know\nYour job essentially didn't exist for a long time it was one of those things that sort of ... music and movies built to sort of\nSynergistic relationship it used to be that are orchestral scores made for these movies right and then the job also became not only these original scores\nBut then the idea of a policing songs from the pop music Rome where whatever genre into the movie to sort of help develop character tone and plot where you kind of a fan of this art form before you actually started doing it\nYeah I actually played soundtrack albums I was a dictator to the swimmer the trauma swimmer that had the most beautiful American families theme\n\nYou know and Spartacus in I think my record collection had almost equally soundtrack final soundtrack visited bam you have always found that interesting and I can never in a million years thought about it\nAs a job and didn't know that it was a job and\nEven when I came in really a lot of supervisors were working directly with record labels and then putting\nTheir music into movies were record labels are actually paying for ... for supervisors and the music in the movies you know I'm just such a control freak in the fact that I don't want to be dictated backwards but I really just always one of the freedom to\nYou know go wherever the movie and the director wanted to go and then end up having people on the soundtrack after that and not kind of work at ... in the other way because I just that being dictated to from that direction with never interesting to me\nI think where it's evolved to is that it's become a much more important factor in television and now that you've got these mini series that are sort of viewed as art forms on the level of a of a great movie\nYou've got this increasingly important role the music is playing in them what intrigued you about these mini series\nWell my only experience I followed my director shock value and I had worked on a couple of feature films and he says okay we're going here and all that was my deep dive and came away with so much appreciation for that work\n... [noise]\nChanged [noise]\nMuch [laughter]\nIt's something I really liked about the two HBO series you worked on big little lies and sharp objects\nWas that they both featured female music which you know I think too often in movies and TV milk characters are the ones who are the messengers or the cool music you know the ones whose lives are saved by rock and roll\nUp first I Want to talk about Chloe from big little lies who's this little six year old girl who loves music and we're not talking about these me so you know she's listening to some pretty great stone PJ Harvey Charles Bradley\nShe's amazing him including her her precocious little\nI pilot you know telling her dad you know which Elvis song he needs to play no no no dog you've got to do this one\nYou know she's a she's a already hanging out with the old Seventy stopping and then you know introducing Leon Bridges to her mom and yo yo you know she's like she's an incredibly precocious young young girls [noise]\nI don't want to\n[noise]\n[noise]\nOh\n\nWhich you know it's very much on mark planted it because he doesn't use composer than we are having to tell our a motive story through the license tracks which is\nVery unusual for any director to kind of knows that going through that I'm not going to use a composer we're going to handle all these emotional ...\nThrough our you know through these characters that I mean clearly you know we really she's the one that sort of was helping everybody narrative believe through her iPod [noise] tell that story\nWell there's also a character and sharp objects Alice who helps tell the narrative with music on her iPod she's a fellow patient in the hospital a with Comey oldest shows protagonist they were both dealing with problems with ...\nHours teachers Camille to use music particularly Led Zeppelin as a way to escape the internal distress the pain that she's experiencing\nWhat I loved about Camille with it she didn't know anything about music she gets into the hospital and she there with this young girl that you know kind of looks at her and says we're kind of music do you\nPlay or do you listen to and she's like I don't I don't like music I never really listen to music and the girls like job just to follow the law that she's she's like what no wonder you're on your girl and she and her two girls and she goes but I can get out of here\nAnd that I Love that so much that she could teach somebody older than her\nShe's a teenager looking at some in her mid twenties and saying I can teach you how to fly out of here you don't even have to be an hair and teaching the power of music to escape your situation\n[laughter]\n\n\n\nKnow really signed on to\nThan just some background than a restaurant\nOr some pop after some video if you actually important role in\nIn so many large and if you're not familiar with it in that way and don't have that relationship I'm hoping that Camille character encourages everybody to kind of sit back and go wait\nI'm In this mood I'm going to put on this record into what happened and you can fly off and it will totally change your mood I think that's the importance of it\n\n\nWell you know I got to ask you though Susan you so did you ever have a conversation with the character and say why do you have such expensive taste good licensing Led Zeppelin songs ain't cheap I Wonder how that worked out because they're notoriously difficult to uh you know extract music for him or allow their music to be used in films or or or TV shows\nYou know when some mark news that Led Zeppelin with his fantasy to be able to use it I don't know if we ever thought this would really happen but he put it in my hands and said if I could find anything for Allison Camille this would be what it was\nAnd I started working on that way before we started shooting and we started but really early conversations and working with a wonderful woman over Warner chop all you know we just kept shaping the letters and the communication until it became really clear\nWe met at an ice rink where I was ... when you sit down and try and jump in Asia you you're right you don't have some more stuff that goes with the show and it doesn't really started with such a first picture as always for what's going to serve the pitcher\nAnd so those songs ended up really being something about it was so important Illinois Tanya that that music stayed warm and that she said that we could have power because otherwise you wouldn't like her\nAnd if I tried a couple of Ninety things I tried a couple of things and it was totally film didn't want it and it made her an older\nSo we really how we worked really hard so I already he already had you know his arrow pointed in I Want seventies music and then we just worked really really hard to get what we wanted and to put things in there and you're always to serving narrative and serving pitcher\nBut the most difficult thing of like Tania was getting people to understand\nThat this was a really important story to be told\nAnd you know we mark ... was so gracious because he had turned down\nThe dire straits from Romeo and Juliet several times saying no way that that was before I came on board and then I reached out but for hours writing the right letter and sent him the first real instead I'm just asking you to take a look and if you want to see the rest of it\nLet me know and then I got a call for management can spend the rest and I knew\nThat he would understand that that was actually a really beautiful use of Romeo and Juliet so I [noise]\nWhat do you like like me [noise]\n\n[noise] mystery shows [noise]\nAnd it was really great but it was getting him and then he wrote\nThe sweetest note and said thank you Susan Jacobs I would've never know that was it and he was so happy to be part of that film and I think it's really about\nCommunication are just an artist you know more Craig's turned to do why it's important and why that music belongs there\nIs a lot of it and you know the same thing working on American Hustle are silver linings playbook which we how do you know really early Alabama Shakes and very very early O. J. O. J. was just a baby ban that point\nIt's it's so great when you realize that you're getting this great marriage of\nA visual artist and then also to to see that I was saying and I went to see the most amazing elope concert they are out there playing Joplin is playing the most amazing shows right now and to see the ... three eight overtures lie just blew\nNational had a lot to do when you're not talking the pilots cars that guy's got one his calling after another as you're not like she you know but I that that that same ... the film and you know you're kind of think I bet that gave a lot of new life to that time because the crowd went crazy over crazy\nIt wasn't one of those uh you know top twenty below you know greatest hits you know and he's got\nHe's got a top forty there I mean every song he plays she can't believe like oh my God he wrote that too and you know that too and he brought that to a it's kind of amazing\nOr I got one question for you so you're the\nMusic geek like gosh in terms of you know how does how does music work in the world and obviously you're a big fan of music working in film and TV besides your own projects what if you had to say to anybody\nGive me an example of how music and audio and video can work together to create something sort of a third thing that's the greater than the sum of the parts what's what's your best example of that\nBecause the Easy Rider go see it go see the graduate [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter] I mean those are the things that all of us strive to make the garage of again midnight cowboy my goodness I mean ...\nYou know when you have that especially midnight cowboy when you have that collaboration between composer and then\nAn artist by carry I mean all of us are trying to keep making that\nKnow\nOn channel\nI think about midnight cowboy and how\nLane to\nMake that dark and deeper and more [noise]\nYeah that's amazing and you can't even look at the graduate without thinking about the\nSoundtrack to them you know we're all trying to do that I mean we you know should I have anything that ever comes close to that kind of cooperation with a solo artist being able but also the industry was braver\nThan I think people just took the music played a looser roll it was more you know things weren't as managed as they are now\nYou know I don't know I think there's some young kid falling in love with your work now who's thinking the same\nSunday Morning and I think you're inspiring a new generation there shall I Hope so I Hope so we've been talking with Susan Jacobs one of our favorite music supervisors it's a it's been a real pleasure Susan thanks for coming on sound opinion I'm great thank you all\nWraps up our interview with music supervisor Susan Jacobs and now we want to hear from you what's your film and television show that you think uses music really well give us a call at eight eight eight eight five nine Eighteen hundred and leave your ants\n\n[noise] [noise]\nBut he was he was rich

Jim this week it's your turn\nWell Greg obviously after that ... we had with Susan or movies and music and the perfect pairing of the two were on my mind I'm usually two or three years ahead of you on

first or a gym I've got a perfect lead us down for us it's from the band the cure\nFrom the u._k. debut album Nineteen Seventy nine three imaginary boys and it is a song that I think typically buys this whole notion of the theater of imagination you talk about this a lot of movies where a guy like Alfred Hitchcock was terrific building suspense and building anticipation\nYou wouldn't show you what is happening but what might happen and planting the seeds of doubt in the viewer's mind about what is about to happen to these characters\nAnd I think this cure song subway song does that perfectly basically only eight lines averse I great I'm In a baseline in this song\nThese little terse finger snaps about midway through and then a surprise ending I'm not going to give away completely but just be a notice that something terrible is going to happen\nTo this person that is depicted coming home late at night on a subway train we've all been there we've all heard the footsteps in the back of us wondering is that somebody following me am I the only person in here or am I being stalked by someone\nSo the anticipation is is really nicely played out in the song it is

got it like the pre makeup Robert Smith but his head was definitely in a dark place when he wrote subway song that's the cure from Nineteen Seventy nine\nOr ... what have you got for a great Halloween sock well Greg\nYour reserve scary rock songs is seemingly a boundless but you know we've done the show a bunch of times and I wanted to not be so obvious that I wanted to kind of take some left turns today so I turned to some of our listeners for some inspiration some I chose myself\nSome came in by email people were working with guns all about the show they just were given a great suggestions\nKevin in ... park out here in Illinois he said\nOne of my favorite songs spooky or not is ghost town by the specials from the ghoulish bones to the high pitch whales from the scary image painted the empty streets and closed down clubs to Stengel cover artwork skeletons playing the piano he\nLoves the creepy by above this all he does know in in a joking better that even scarier was that no doubt once covered well we're going to the original version by the special one ghost town came out in Nineteen eighty one it was talking about\nShuttered streets unemployment urban unrest on the streets of London it was a heavy time and there were riots that erupted just as this song was coming out and making to the top of the chart\nAnd I think that's the scary thing about this song a city losing it so a city in an uproar here it is by the special ghost town on sound [noise]\n\n\n[noise] are being killed or\nAnything [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nGhost town by the specials on sound opinions one of our scary expertise is Halloween which got your next what he got to show a good one gym one of the scariest aspects of this song is the fact that the singer Scott\nWalker once used to be in a group called the Walker brother seeing music was completely unlike when I'm about to play\nThe Walker brothers had a huge hit in the sixties called the sunny kind of shy anymore you can YouTube and find out what that is all about and played that song and then play this next one is about to lay on you in the Gulf that's the same guy Scott Walker using that flush baritone crew in his voice in a more sinister fashion\nOn this song it's from his two thousand six something called the drift\nAnd in this song he starts I was kind of this post nine eleven scenario and then it morphs into this meditation or Elvis Presley in the womb\nOf his mother lying next to his dad twin Jesse people don't realize this but maybe that Elvis Presley did actually have a twin was stillborn\nAnd he's imagining this conversation it's actually at one way conversation Elvis talking to this this dead person lying next to him in the world\n\nWelcome back to ... with Jimmy regardless and this is our annual Halloween and special we've been hearing from some of our listeners about some of their scariest songs of all the time the gym and I are going back and forth with some of our selection and uh right now is Jim stern Greg I'm going to throw in other\nAnd one was so good maybe go instantly told how come I never thought of it before Shelby Peterson from Chicago said hard choice but I have to go with pirate Jenny by Nina Simone her voice has a haunting cast to it and when she gets out near the end that alert yet it sends shivers down my spine Shelby is absolutely right\nEunice waymen need it smells real name\nIs singing a song by ... Brecht and Curt Vile from three pending opera if I look at it as just the two that those guys wrote pirate Jenny is about a woman who is perhaps captured by one ship and then the pirates that she was part up are coming to rescue her\nThe black chip on the horizon and that these people who've been mistreating are making her scrub the decks and who knows what else are going to get there\nThe way Nina Simone plays it now she was a civil rights activists\nShe changes a very few words and does it skillfully\nIt's suddenly a southern hotel but she is cleaning and she's being mistreated by the white patrons in a racist society and\nThe black ship suddenly becomes something else if it's going to become justice when societies equalized you're gonna get yours and you know the anger in her voice is amazing but it's so subtly underplayed that that's what's\nCreepy about it as a powerful tune\nA scary tune pirate Jenny by Nina Simone unsound opinions [noise]\nYou can watch these from spreading the loss while you're gone [noise]\nMaybe once you get to me and it makes you feel well\nBut you'll never guess into [noise]\nNo [noise] is that ... you know\nThen one night they as a scream in the night and you wonder what\nBeen [noise] and you see me granny imams\nWhat she got to clean out terrier and\n[noise]\nWith the no on it smack\nDead we'll be common\n\nYou gentleman can\nFrom

Jenny from Nina Simone from Jim do you regard as one of his great Halloween songs of all time I loved that choice Gemini ties in a really nicely with what I'm going to play next that sort of macro view of the world the sense of evil in the world looked like a fiasco addressed that on his song puts you on game from his two thousand seven out of the cool\nIt was a concept album about this title character and the choices he has to make in this world fraught with evil I mean look at it was coming up a really hard time and it's like when he made this album his father and a good friend had just died his longtime manager just gone to prison so he's investigating this topic of\nYou know temptation evil sinister forces at work in the world\nThe narrator in this song is a really creepy character the guy runs this place and we're talking about from the White House to the crack house and you have those those violins kind of escalating in the background the crack of gunshots you've got this ominous ... let me put you on game\nThe game is that is hostile to you know the ... game the con game the gangster game\nAnd the song just keeps escalating intensity until the very end when ... almost revealed his identity or the identity of the narrator in this song he\nDoesn't really tell you who it is because it's on cuts off just in time but you can get I mean this is sympathy for the devil this is the Rolling Stones sudden you know everywhere there's some mayhem happening I'm the guy at the heart of it all to pay fiasco put you on game unsound opinion [noise]\nSome you know that I'm running this place and not become this must be run visit then it's become this way instead of ... with is the reason I have become\nMuch dominant made them all and then they have become among [noise]

that\nAnother fine Halloween choice put you on game by loop a fiasco nice when Greg I uh am ever got nobody to blame except myself for this one and you make Scott initially at this choice but I'm going with ten cc's I'm not in love\nWatch creepy about it for one thing the production Kevin godly and allow cream the driving forces in this early seventies English rock band are now much better known as an award winning video production team back then\nThey were just as in ... in the recording studio guess initially started out as a falling out of love song with a bossa nova beat nothing too extraordinary they decided to take out the drums and to build\nA wall of rhythm from voices the former members of the band each one and then over dubbed at an ... an over dumped it until they were two hundred and fifty six voices singing the same note which gives this kind of robbing sensation it seems pretty at first but it gets creepy your as the song goes on\nThen they really dropped the bomb with this apparently they turned to the studios receptionist and had her give that spoken word interest in the middle\nOf the big question cry big but it's just crazy he said he's not in love I don't think you're going to be breathing much longer either it's kind of in the spirit of that song Timothy that you'd be in a couple of years ago which was actually about cannibalism make little pop sort

musician Wayne Kramer legendary guitarist for the Detroit banned the MC five currently on tour celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of that bans signature debut kick out the jams\nWill talk to weigh in about his new memoir is struggles with drug and alcohol addiction and his time in prison and how that helped turn his life around but first we have to pay tribute to the late great Otis Rush [laughter]\n\nThat his oldest rush with I Can't quit you baby his first single in Nineteen fifty six oldest rushed died recently the age of eighty four Jim not as well known and some of the great Chicago these icons you know Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon even touting guy Howlin' Wolf [noise]\nBut I Would say as influential as any of them are really important a figure in Chicago blue scene beginning in the fifties in fact if you'd only recorded those sites that he did with Kobe records here in the fifties for over a two year period\nOf fifty six fifty eight he would be a legendary guitars he had a long career after that suffered a stroke and the two thousand and three that just centrally kept him off stage or for the last Fifteen Years of his life but his legacy\nIs huge you just need to talk to people like Eric Clapton or Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac Carlos Santana Stevie Ray Vaughan his style was intense corrosive\nYou know he was he was a you know that noise melody kind of merger\nThat was so hip Twenty years later\nOr or or a decade later we started with people like Hendricks oldest sort of had that style down in the fifties bar scene in Chicago and you can hear it in his guitar playing he was one of the architects of the so called west side sound there is a lot of debate in Chicago like what's the difference between the west side blues\nAnd the south side lose some people say it was as simple as the fact that our oldest rush used the horn section instead of a harmonica player in his bands\nBut there was also an intensity to the sound that old is a rush brought to his guitar playing that I think it was truly truly distinctive the one thing about oldest rush is that you got a sense of you know people talk about the blues being kind of sad music yeah with Otis there was pain there was an English at the heart of it\nWell and there was a protest music yeah you know I I hate you quote him again but the late great Lester Bangs at toward the end of his life the last great piece he wrote\nThe great guitarist Robert Klein who's also gone said you need to listen to Otis Rashid Lester was depressed he was down in the dumps he wrote this incredible piece that I have all my students in college read oldest rush mugged by an iceberg and it's about that intensity that searing pain\nAnguish anger there's no way you can listen to his guitar playing and not be moved\nA you know he'd always be smiling and those album covers yeah if you ever saw him perform there was that face was so serious and he was a very soft spoken guy when you did interviewing I remember once you know he was talking to me and he says you know I don't do anything but worry that's about\nI mean this guy was a you know he worked at a steel mill packing house he's driving a truck\nYou know these guys didn't make a lot of money they had they had to make ends meet he was still worried about paying rent even though he was worldwide famous at that time there was a sense of that English and pain in every note he played his guitar player was extraordinary but he was also a great singer I think that probably the most underrated facet\nOf this as a performer was not only could he play the guitar but man that guy could sing as well here's one of his most famous tracks double trouble from a from the fifties when it first recordings he made just a kid in his early twenties and listen to the intensity beat the very adult nature of the anguish in this man's voice\nDouble trouble from Otis Rush unsound opinions\n\n\n\nThat is a great Otis Rush dead at the age of eighty four\nRight that's a little bit of a track called window from room to twenty five the first proper album by an artist who goes by NO NAME she does have a name when Warner grew up here in the Brownsville neighborhood of Chicago\nOr mom ran a bookstore well respected in the African American community\nUm now based in Los Angeles making a big splash with room twenty five although she

woods or twenty sixteen got a lot of notice for her first mix tape as a solo artist telephone now comes a photo album\nThe name comes from the fact she was twenty five when working on most of this album and also living in one hotel room after another dealing with drug addiction a turbulent relationship all of it goes into this record this is a song\nCalled NO NAME by hip hop artist NO NAME from

about you know the name the meaning of that name NO NAME what he called herself known as the question she gets asked\nA lot of interviews and you know I think she's trying to addressing that in this record um the whole idea of identity what does it mean uh I think it's the subtext of almost every track on this record is that society\nTries to a race African American people tried to make them invisible women's I've been especially yes\nAgnew was the vice president of our country at that time commission on terrorism and the and the new left says the band is part of a communist conspiracy to corrupt the youth of America [laughter] way and you're a young guy you're seeing all this stuff getting piled on your head\nOr you're you're on a rock band that's that's making some noise out of the mid west and suddenly you're on the radar of the vice president states what was it was a ...\nBeing fairly effective in disturbing the power structure but clearly used everything they held against us and we ultimately\nWent to court with the Justice Department over the issue of illegal wiretaps they said that they could tap our phones because it was a matter of domestic security\nAnd we held that we we're a nation of laws and not have men and that you needed a warrant signed by a judge to tap ones phones\nAnd the Supreme Court of the United states agreed with us\nAnd the day before a court decision was released the plumbers were caught taking the bugs out of democratic headquarters in the Watergate mhm so our white panther wiretapped case led to the downfall of Richard\nNixon I basically inserted my strata caster where the sun doesn't shine Richard Nixon [laughter] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nTo me it was interesting when you talk very openly in the book you could've openly admitting hey I just wanted to not do a regular job I didn't want to work\nI wanted to have sex I wanted to play in a rock and roll band and yet you become these ... of this radicalized you know left wing revolution how did the transition really occur what was the catalyst for that for that occurring\nWell it it wasn't that I didn't want to work\nI just didn't want to do certain kinds of work were you know I'm being a Detroit or we hold hard labor in high esteem there's no ability and working hard so I Want it to work hard but I wanted to work hard as something that I taught mattered and I didn't think\nThat a ... a job on the line at Chrysler was going to amount to much but the radicalization was that I was part of an entire generation that just could not\nStomach the hypocrisy and the corruption of American ideals you know at my core I always saw myself as a Patriot Act in a democracy is participatory it's not just a word that we throw around it's actually something that we do\nAnd my understanding of the way our country function was if you didn't like the way the government was doing something that you could protest it\nAnd I protested with everything that I had and I was part of an entire generation that protested the war in Vietnam civil rights outdated fifties sexual morality\nMarijuana laws and host of other uh you know the environment [laughter] there there was a lot to protest\nAgainst and [noise] and ah I was one of those people that smoke out [noise]\n\n[noise]\nRight in the middle of the sixty eight Democratic National convention when things got ugly you were the only against the war the number of bands that were invited to play you were the only man that actually did play\nUh this that the student movement that was occurring in protest it what was going out of the convention downtown Chicago you set up and Lincoln Park um what were your memories of that day in sixty eight to because of the riots started to flow downhill pretty much as soon as you've got dumped playing right [noise]\nYeah it wasn't like other outdoor live music events\nThat we all have been to\nWhere people are happy and smiling and there's a good vibe it was very heavy vibes the Chicago police were driving there a Harley Davidson trace it goes through the crowd\nKnocking them kids over there were undercover police are starting fist fights with kids a roughing people up\nSo the atmosphere was very tense and uh you know a number of uh the young people came prepared to fight and so once the ban once we finished our sat and the crowd didn't have anything to focus on they focus their attention on the Chicago police and they were\nThey welcomed them with the ... swinging batons and and you had had busting and arrests and\nAnd it was the first time that a mom and pop America saw happening on the nightly news you know they've never seen a policeman beat kids before like a beat reporters like that and\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nIt plain that after the MC five such intensity blaze so bright for a short period of time\nYou go into the recording of the check it out and Penn it's a real super intense studio experience and you seem to have mixed feelings about that album still you know you were you is something that you guys we're we're striving for was just sort of out of reach\nWhat we had no experience working in a recording studio it takes time to learn how to be comfortable with the recording process we had only made a couple of singles before kickoff ... and check out the germs was recorded lives\nSo on a back in the usa the MC five second album that was really our our education and how to record and we were going through a lot of changes in the band trying to trying to ratchet up our\nApproach in order to be better musicians to\n[noise]\nHave mixed feelings but [noise] um I I Know each albums intimately I Know\nWhat their strengths and what their weaknesses were and in that records case I think we we did overreact to the criticism that we were so undisciplined\nIn so irresponsible musically irresponsible idiosyncratic that that we that we really put a lot of emphasis on that the temples war solid\nSinging melodies were on pitch and and the lyrics were were very ... in fact the lyrics are more overtly political on the second album than they were on the first album\nBut you know each of these albums as they're like my kids you know they got a special place in my heart and the great ... records of what we were trying to accomplish\nAnd yet those who who were there who saw the five in their heyday or who've seen you since in your quite excellent solo career you know will always say the records are great but it's live\nIt's allowed what happens live I mean that's where I think is some day when I grow up I'm going to come to terms with jazz when I'm more mature but I as I understand as I understand what you guys took from jazz and and what you as a as a as a musician and a person I've taken from jazz is that spontaneity\nUnique a thing that can happen only in the moment mhm\nYeah there's a there's a time\nIf musicians are tuned into each other and have a fundamental agreement about what they're trying to do where everything works beautifully that Europe human beings doing\nA most human activity of performing and creating music spontaneously and it actually never get any better than that there's a lot and I've I've had my share of of great nights of music where you're you're up on the stand and\nAnd everybody is just playing at the at the peak of their ability and the crowd is right there with you and\nThen the lights are writer and everyone looks good and we sound good\nTo find his way you\nKnow he's become obviously you're getting used to be an iconic character you guys saw something in that band that you liked obviously\nOh yeah I mean you couldn't deny it he had a complete vision and it was very clear about I mean there were no performers danced with the abandoned and the rhythm that a pop danced with are still dances with I mean he's one of the great front men of all time um\nUh so yeah of course if or when Danny Fields or\nDoes or any other bands around here like the MC five I said no there's no more than likely MC five which are he just seemed like\nThe [noise]\nYou know we were all best friends and we all listened to the same coal train them\nSunrise and we all smoked with same passion we always saying bologna sandwiches and brown rice and\nDo you think about the characters you know coming through that again I guess I don't know if you knew Alice Cooper at a time but he wouldn't name just a little bit later I guess a Seeger Bob Seeger measure writer all these characters I mean where was it a close knit community in terms of the people who are making this kind of music which wasn't\nPrecisely mainstream certainly at that time\nYeah yeah it was it we all knew each other I mean we've all been together with all known each other\nGoing back to the record hop days where we're all\nShow up at a at a church hall where one of the local DJ's would uh be spinning records and there'd be packed with teenagers dancing and\nAnd uh your band could get up and play a Fifteen or twenty minutes set in between all the uh Motown artist that were coming by the lip sync their their latest release it was very exciting time in Detroit was\nDriving it was a bustling industrial city with the you know good paying jobs and everything seemed possible and\n[noise]\n\n\n\nOne of the\nUm hottest things I found all you have a good buddy whose name is Ted [noise] she\n[laughter] and I know you and Ted Nugent came up in the same place under the same time All right\nUm but my God\nYou know he wants to go out and shoot Buffalo's and shoot anybody who wouldn't let him shoot a buffalo and and just just about I mean he's about ... about a hundred and eighty degrees opposite everything you stay in Fort Wayne\nYeah it's it's it's pretty it's pretty weird yeah\nYou know he he never had any political interest in the sixties and he didn't really take it up until I'm thinking you know once a solo career kind of are and they were he was looking for something new to\nTo uh to keep him in the discussion and I think he discovered that through his uh his hunting an outdoorsman hobby that there was a an entree into the world of radical right wing extremists the viewpoint\nYou know I we remain friends or I could call them up today and we can have a pleasant Congress\nReal substantive political young and Iran I I'm open to it I Would yeah I'd like to fish because I Know he does a lot of good in the world you know he works with kids he under writes programs for young people\nAnd I know he's a Family Guy and ... and I and I kinda worry about him you know he invited Tom Burrell and I\nTo one of his gigs and in LA and we went over to the house of blues where he was playing and were hanging out backstage\nAnd it's getting to be time for him to go on and he turns around and bends over to pick up his guitar and we see he strapped ... you know\nHe's got this this pillow in the back of his trial of us but I ... it\nJust struck me like oh gosh what must a man's life be like that he has to go through it armed you know what world does he live and how much how much fear is got to be going on there\n[noise]\n\n\nLet me ask you a broader question I'm sure it seemed like even when people had political differences and that most turbulent times\nOf the sixties we could unite around certain things the music could bring people together do you think Wayne\nThat still the case today I mean you play in a lot of different sizes you play in the indie rock punk rock underground and you play jazz and you play with prisoners behind bars and you ... you know um it does it still have that power you believe in yeah\nSure does our our ... will always have the power to make a connection between people\nTo to bridge the gap between people if I Do something in music\nIf I tell the truth about how I feel about something chances are there's somebody else out there that felt the same way that reminds me that I'm not the only nut case now out here you know somebody else's fields where because ultimately\nArt confirms our humanity and tells us we're not alone\n... and we're all in this together we are all in this together ...\n[noise] [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter] [noise] I'm\nWhen the MC five fell apart and then you go down your passive of drug abuse crimes wind up in prison [noise] it seems like there was a distance there between you and and Fred sonic Smith and un Rob Steiner [noise]\nYou you you say like ... I mean you deal with each of their passing in a couple of sentences and say you know we hadn't been close when he passed but it hit me hard well\nBecause we never were able to reconnect after the breakup of the band nothing was ever resolved or we never got to know each other as grown ups and it is just left as an open wound a scar a and\nThere's there you know there is no closure or resolution to to ah when people leave before their time even if even if it is a natural herbs\nWell you know desire to die that's about as natural as it gets 'em but you know we never got its we never got a chance to to be friends and it kind of review what we went through together I think we probably none of us\nReally survived having been in the MC five it was too much for a bunch of young guys to\nTo walk through the fire and and all the the ultra highs and devastating Lowe's and the\nPressure and say that friendships and the camaraderie and the undermining of all that and\nSee it one day all go away\nIt was it was rough so yeah I mean it was hard [laughter]\nMhm [noise]\n... van ... [noise] boom [noise] may do\nTell us about a ... you have this second career now is well a scoring films and doing film where you've been in LA for a long time now based on on the west coast um what is what does that world like how did you get into it\nWell I knew I knew the day was coming when I Would not be quite so enthusiastic about getting in the van again [laughter]\nYeah yeah there was a great paragraph towards the end of the book about everybody romanticize it but it's flaming house sleeping on the floor night after night yeah it's it's hard work\nAnd and uh you know I I thought I could\nDo some music for film it always seemed like a possibility I I Would listen to the under score on television and and uh I'm In movies and thought I could do some of that I could do something like that I Know a little bit about this\nBut when I finally moved to LA and started to pursue it seriously argues got a few jobs and then I discovered I Need to go back to school so I started taking a scoring classes at UCLA\nAnd the union has some good orchestrating classes running at the time", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Sound Opinions", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "11", "locations": [["Chicago", 41.85003, -87.65005], ["Detroit", 42.33143, -83.04575], ["Chicago", 41.85003, -87.65005], ["Chicago", 41.85003, -87.65005], ["Detroit", 42.33143, -83.04575], ["Chicago", 41.85003, -87.65005], ["Chicago", 41.85003, -87.65005], ["Kobe", 34.6913, 135.183], ["Chicago", 41.85003, -87.65005], ["Chicago", 41.85003, -87.65005], ["Chicago", 41.85003, -87.65005], ["Los Angeles", 34.05223, -118.24368], ["Chicago", 41.85003, -87.65005], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Detroit", 42.33143, -83.04575], ["Vietnam", 16.16667, 107.83333], ["Marijuana", 32.39988, -107.11626], ["Chicago", 41.85003, -87.65005], ["Chicago", 41.85003, -87.65005], ["Chicago", 41.85003, -87.65005], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["MC", 48.69096, 9.14062], ["Motown", 42.33143, -83.04575], ["Detroit", 42.33143, -83.04575], ["Fort Wayne", 41.1306, -85.12886], ["Iran", 32.0, 53.0], ["LA", 34.052235, -118.243683], ["LA", 34.052235, -118.243683], ["LA", 34.052235, -118.243683]], "not_found": [], "ep_coords": ["San Francisco, CA", 37.77493, -122.41942], "in_country": ["Chicago", "Detroit", "Chicago", "Chicago", "Detroit", "Chicago", "Chicago", "Chicago", "Chicago", "Chicago", "Los Angeles", "Chicago", "America", "Detroit", "Marijuana", "Chicago", "Chicago", "Chicago", "America", "Motown", "Detroit", "Fort Wayne", "LA", "LA", "LA"], "out_country": ["Kobe", "Vietnam", "MC", "Iran"], "in_state": ["Los Angeles", "LA", "LA", "LA"], "out_state": ["Chicago", "Detroit", "Chicago", "Chicago", "Detroit", "Chicago", "Chicago", "Kobe", "Chicago", "Chicago", "Chicago", "Chicago", "America", "Detroit", "Vietnam", "Marijuana", "Chicago", "Chicago", "Chicago", "America", "MC", "Motown", "Detroit", "Fort Wayne", "Iran"]}]
