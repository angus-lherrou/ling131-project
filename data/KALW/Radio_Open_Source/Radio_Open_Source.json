Pinker around his book enlightenment no secret thinkers better angels of our nature Chris Hedges is drawn to bad news [noise]\nThe way Steve Pinker is drawn to the good\nChris Hedges got hooked on

nothing is in our world today\nThat's a culture\nWhich we've created a commercial culture\nWhich orchestrate alienation loneliness unhappiness a sense of inadequacy and promises us that if we invest in that culture\nBoth financially him personally which is a culture that at its core is about the cult of the self\nWe can find the happiness that they have destroyed ... but of course as proof understood every time we buy their experience whether just commercially or emotionally or their product\nIs only the starting point for new desires ...\nAnd what in biblical terms it is\nIs a culture of our dollar tree\nAnd the writers of the Bible understood that idols demand in the beginning the sacrifice of others but in the end like more luck [noise] they always demand your sacrifice you you are sacrificed on that alter\nAnd I think that spiritual malaise that cult of the self\nHas created tremendous depression and unhappiness which is fed by this never ending cycle I mean what is Facebook\nOr Instagram or any of these other social media platforms\nThere many forms of the self presentation that obsesses a figure like Trump\nIt's what Neal Gabler called life the movie and you know we all have our own versions of it it's about posturing it's not about truth and it's certainly the opposite of friendship\nAt the cost of his job\nHe's our guest or the Cambridge forum and the first parents church in Harvard Square his new book is America the farewell tour\nYou're leaving one huge zone my favorite zone out which is George Bush and the Iraq War to my mind the light in line

the United states chose war Joe's torture\nIgnited terrorism and body ... literally killed a country in front of our eyes corrupted the Democratic opposition including our print John Kerry and destroyed the media I mean\nThe war began and went to its end with the cheerleading of those institutions including infringe on treatment Williams half hour ago David every rocks and they're still working I mean anyway\nThe point is only that to see Trump he is symptomatic of\nAll that the trail of the working class at the same time he's the most\nI must say viable person who ever tip the tables on Jeb Bush and then on the Clintons I don't want to give them any credit for it exactly that here's a question for my friend Chris Hedges\nDo you find your heart really rooting for the record is the Trump or his so to speak or you certainly don't root for the establishment where where's your heart Chris Hedges\nMy heart is with at this point the sixty or Seventy percent of Americans who are being pushed towards a modern form of serfdom in the ... system and you bring up the war\nSo and as you know I had a very contentious relationship with the New York times I'd been in the middle east bureau chief for the New York times was denouncing the war was booed off of a commencement stage and of course I actually knew the middle east and knew the instrumental war unlike banker\nAnd\nAnd I was given a formal written reprimand and told I was no longer be allowed to speak publicly about criticizing the war and I left the paper over that issue so when you talk about all those people who are wrong being still in power but that's misleading because\nThey may have been wrong but they played their role and the role of this was ... the ...\nDiscredit and you can read the review of this book in the New York times the Washington Post because that's exactly what they do to discredit\nThe critics on the left because they set the moral parameters and they are essentially given their place in a capital is democracy\nBecause they make sure nobody crosses those parameters nobody actually questions the system of capitalism nobody questions the intentions of going into Iraq they make concede afterwards that it didn't go quite as it should so they played their role perfectly which is why they're still they're not they're all\nKnow we can't talk about leaders I mean this has come a complete misreading of what's happened in this country it's far more serious than that\nAnd I think one of the things that inform this book was the two years I spent reading a book on the Christian right\nBecause the Christian right is really the amnesty but before that let me just respond one more thing on the war so in in and you know from the book in and this was from a court but late empire\nHim according to historian McCoy who wrote a very good book called shadows in the American century which I recommend he writes that empires that they're beginning actually use military force very carefully and very judiciously empires at the end in decline\nEngage in catastrophic military adventure ism\nFuels the decline in an attempt to restore last greatness so you look at for instance the end of the scene an empire\nThey invade Sicily the entire ... most of the soldiers and kill the umpires over you look at the Suez Crisis the British Empire is in decline from the end of World War one until Nineteen fifty six Nasser nationalize the Suez Canal the British invade with a French\nAnd have to retreat and humiliation\nThe pound sterling is dropped ... as the world's reserve currency and the British economy goes into a tailspin that's the death of will coy actually gives it a day which I Would never do twenty thirty but the so we have Seventeen years of warfare\nThere was a front page story about the debt did you read those I read the times tonight\nI just read that what may soon exceed the cost of the U.S military interest on us debt\nWithin a decade more than nine hundred billion in interest payments will be do annually\nThis is what happens at the end of empire you extend yourself militarily beyond your ability to sustain it financially\nAnd the cost in order to carry out this military adventure ... this is ... ... is to just hollow out the country from the inside\n... writes that the charity that Athens imposed on others and it finally imposed on itself why because the military adventure ism is so costly your roads are not maintained your public libraries are school you're you know the crown jewel of American democracy or is our public school system\nAnd we are watching it be destroyed ...\nAnd so as you follow the country out from the inside\nYou use the harsher forms of control which I spent Twenty years reporting on on the outer reaches of empire militarized police suspension of civil liberties wholesale surveillance revoking basic rights like due process\nMilitarized drones\nHow near you\nAnd and that's how empires go down so yes the military adventure ism is important but it's just a piece\nAnd we've got to stop personalizing this issue around Trump we've got to stop thinking that the Democratic party is going to cough up some magic Kennedy and the Christian right my study of the Christian right was called American Fascists the Christian right in the war in America\nI was trying to reach out to them and I'm\nBill Moyers did not want me to use the word fascist and I actually when I finished the two years of reporting I sat down with Robert ... wrote anatomy and fascism and Fritz Stern who wrote the politics of cultural despair and left Germany as an Eighteen year old two of our greatest scholars on fascism and I was with them for several hours\nAnd I just threw everything I had found and I wanted them to\nBe able to argue me out of using that word\nAnd I at least to my mind they could not\nTell me what's wrong with this sort of idiot definition of fascism fascism the ... in a binding of cheese in stands for the unification\nOf war making power police power opinion making power that the electoral\nMachinery churches media the\nWhole thing in one to my mind God Knows what's ahead but in the this way go back to the Iraq War\nThat was all of\nThose institutions bound together unanimously that was pretty bad and still\nYeah but Chris ... it was different so as bad as it was and we can't divorce the war\nFrom the re configuration of the society into a corporate oligarchy we have the largest social inequality\nIn American history worse than the gilded age ...\nAnd so the war is part of a peace I mean why are we still at war in Afghanistan the Taliban controls more territory in Afghanistan then when we went in Seventeen years ago why because north of Grumman Raytheon Halliburton they're making a fortune\nIt's propelled forward\nBy the primacy of profit\nAt the expense of everything else why are we expanding NATO which doesn't make any sense why are we expanding NATO to the Ukraine\nWell because and and let's not forget that Reagan had promised Gorbachev that NATO would not be expanded beyond the German borders after the unification of Germany why because it's a billion dollar industry\nI was just in Poland I got up the airport there's a giant billboard from ...\n... because if you have to re can figure the old Soviet Bloc military machine to make a compatible with NATO\nSo over and over and over it is about the primacy of profit over what's rational over and and we haven't even spoken about climate change these people are driving us closer and closer\nAnd we're pretty close to the extinction of the human species because of the mania for profit and this is ... I mean the great transformation which was a book on unregulated capitalism let me just on the Christian right so\nRight what happens is the moment the dollar is no longer the reserve currency because it has an artificial value in essence because of that\nThe moment that it has dropped than the empire has to contract because we can't pay for it nobody wants to buy treasury bonds the value of the dollar drops imports become extremely expensive\nAnd what I worry and you know I Would add the fact that our financial system is once again being grossly mismanaged by Citibank and Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo and everyone else what they've done since the two thousand a crash is\nBen handed by the fed out of electronic ether according the University of Missouri their estimate twenty six trillion dollars truly\nAnd what have they done with it they haven't as China did rebuild the infrastructure and create jobs invest in the real economy\nThey have taken that money and\nUh use it to buy back their own stock that's why the whole idea of the overheated stock market as a sign of economic health is nuts\nThey hoard it or they've gambled with it so the times had a story I guess a couple of weeks ago about the next\nDot com bubble being the fracking industry because like the dot com industry the fracking industry is based on projected profits not actual fracking in fact there's a huge money loser\nThe two hundred and eighty billion have been invested in fracking so the money was given to them it virtually zero percent interest but it has to be repaid\nSo what have they done they've gone to the beleaguered population and impose harsher harsher forms of debt peonage it's why even if you have medical insurance you're getting all these new costs and co pays and that's why we have one point five trillion in student debt is why we have Thirteen trillion in personal household that\nUm and it's why cities and I open the book in Scranton are facing insolvency and so I open the book there where they're selling off municipal assets their pension funds have dropped forty percent because of the crash of two thousand and eight\nHe's in a desperate effort to stay solvent but then they don't have anything left to sell so my fear is that the system the Malay the enemy is so widespread the pathologies of self destruction\nIncluding suicide aren't epidemic but we live in a period of relative stability but with a financial\nWhich is coming it's going to come I don't know when but it's coming and with the dropping of the dollar as the world's reserve currency\nThat financial crisis\nAnd all of totalitarian movements rise to full fluid and out of a crisis because our movements have been destroyed our press has been quoted or democratic institutions don't work then I worry that the monsters are really come out thank you I Want to\nGo deeper into a sort of the last point you were making\nOn uh from Detroit and you know you're always kicking someone out there in from an area where nine out of tune young black men end up in prison and I was the one who didn't like them so we went to college and University of Michigan or start a company and so as long as the social and some of my endeavors I've noticed that I'm often the only young black guy in the room and especially from a neighborhood like minds\nI feel like in some ways Austin and the social justice through says we frame will system as if it's more powerful than the people on one of those people who's always ... you know you can\nCome you know through your circumstances so I'm trying to put the power into the people in their potential and not necessarily in the system but I I Would just say for sort of marginalized communities members and service was of the so the problem in\nMarginalized communities is\nA structural problem and\nAs they carried out the kind of corporate coup d'etat which\nReally began in earnest under factor and Reagan they've changed the whole paradigm started hall writes about this you didn't look to government anymore governance of the famous Reagan line you know government is not the solution is part of the problem and ... hall writes quite stupidly they told the beleaguered white working\nClass that there was an assault on their national identity and the Clintons rose to power on this people forget but\nJesse Jackson's rainbow coalition was dismantled by the Clintons who are using coded racist language and wanted to out law and order the Republicans Biden\nWas a big factor in this so it was actually the Democrats that accelerated mass incarceration from about seven hundred thousand under Clinton to by the time he was out two million now half of the people in our prison system were never charged with physically harming another person\nThe other thing Clinton did they destroyed the courts Ninety four percent of the people in prison never had a jury trial and the students I teach with the longest sentences are the ones who went to trial unfortunately they trusted the system but the system makes an example of them because as Michelle Alexander points out if\nEveryone went to trial the system would crash it's built on plea deals\nSo one of the things that always breaks my heart in the prison is and and it's one of the reasons I teach in the prison is that the structural racism\nWhich is so pronounced as to\nMake it as you know from Detroit almost impossible to make a living in the legal economy\nHas effectively\nSold a lot of these people this idea that it's your fault you made mistakes you know August Wilson had a great line he said all the great black warriors in this country are in jail because when the society denied them the ability to get what they needed for their family they just found another way to get it\nPart of the corporate state to deny they always talk about stem you know it's all vocational to deny what I Would call an education to the oppressed\nTo hide the fact that these structures of power are designed to destroy their lives you know from Detroit you lock up\nThe men and you visit the women and children and that's what happens on why because if if you ... are a victim in on the average is every six months in a poor community you finally the third or fourth time you're a victim you don't talk to your neighbors because you know you're going to be a victim\nIt's why they make it so unpleasant when you visit a prison and\nThe children are terrorized I mean there's no other word for it and people stand out in the rain for hours without bathroom facilities 'cause they don't want their terrified of any unity the most stew political class in America\nAre African American they are the one class that tends to actually understand what their interests are which is why they're all being raised from the voter rolls including by the Democratic party so my feeling is\nAnd this comes out of Rosa ... why like very much lemons only intellectual equal and which Lenin would admit she was right where Lenin was wrong luck someone would say yes you have to do what you do we have to address hunger we have to address despair but at the same\nTime we have to educate and so I Would say yes what you're doing is fantastic unimportant but at the same time consciousness consciousness consciousness and you know there was nobody better to start with Malcolm\nHi [noise] when I was in grammar school we went through drills for what we would do if there was a nuclear Holocaust and some of us in the room probably remember we\nUsed to joke about it and say you sit down and you put your head between your knees and you can you're asked to buy and there is a certain aspect of all of this that made me remember that\nWhat would you suggest is already happening now or that we could start that you personally find promising in addition to overthrowing corporate\nWell I write about it at the end the last chapter is called freedom and\nI was at Standing Rock\nI actually gave a talk in Boston a couple of years ago and all of the activists because there was a pipeline running through Boston and they said you know we've gone to our elected officials we've done petitions I said no what you have to do is go out and buy junk cars\nAnd when the construction equipment comes in to build a pipeline you've got to drive all the drunk cars to block everything and take the batteries out and walk away\nThat's the kind of stuff we got to do it's the activists who got on the railroad tracks in the north west to stop the bit of an tar sands fuel that's what we got to do\nAnd they will be vicious as they weren't Standing Rock mean Standing Rock was an important event for me because it had the spiritual element that Chris is bringing out that I think is key and it's what Reinhold ... madness sublime madness of the soul\nHave to stop asking ourselves if we will succeed we have to enter into the realm of faith that what we're doing is right\nThis society is wonderful about you know internal you are but we have

the Nineteen fifties on men well thank you BBC News\nBy Christian from writing this is on the shores [noise] you could think of the ... district to show the killing\nAnd its unresolved aftermath of the sort of experiment is about what the houses soured can get away with in rubbing out dissent\nAnd what the house says Trump will allow from its Buddhism friend in the Gulf of what they are trying out together\nLooks like a version of non transparent family rule in the middle east and elsewhere [noise] working in the near background is the intention in the extended family of Trump's son in law Jared Kushner prince Mohammed didn't saw him on and Israel's reading at Yahoo\nTo spring a military attack on Iran\nIn some convenient provocation\nAs the meddlesome robes state in the region is getting overshadowed now by the spotlight on Saturday history\nContacts and consequences of the show veep\nMuslim populace\nLike turkey against the princes of the Gulf like Saudi Arabia and the Emirates [noise] could even get a reset of American thinking we begin with Steve ... who covered both turkey\nAnd Iran for the New York times and escaped into book journalism with his independent mind intact welcome back Steve tens of you wrote a book that I loved most of the ten years ago called reset about rearranging our our friends in the middle east is this the moment\nWell that book ... you're right might have been a little ill timed it seems now it'd be more relevant even than it was when I wrote it my idea in that book was to posit the thesis that actually\nSaudi Arabia doesn't make a good fit as a partner for the United states Iran makes a good fit this is so contrary to ah the stab list wisdom in the United states that I think it's difficult for some people do a similar but the fact is first of all\nWhat do you look for when you are looking for a country with which you on a partner you want a country whose society is somewhat like your own\nAnd you'd like a society whose government is pursuing geo strategic goals that are more or less in a ... in coalition with yours ... there were similar to your own so that does not fit\nFor Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabian society of nothing like American society we all know this is a place where women can't drive or vote a it's a giant prison as my Saudi Arabian interpreter\nTold me one day as we were walking around Riyadh um so the society is totally different from ours Iranian society on the other end is very much similar to the United states highly educated very mobile middle class Internet penetration a very sophisticated culture going back many many centuries\nNumber two when it comes to geo political interests\nSaudi Arabia has been the principal promoter of all the terrorists forces of the United states has been facing for the last quarter century\nWe know that even American leaders are aware of this we have a famous telegram from ah the wiki leaks a trove from Hillary Clinton saying most of the money that supporting al ... and all those similar groups it's coming from Saudi Arabia\nMeanwhile Iran is even more against al Qaida and ISIS and that jihadist ideology than we are because those people want to kill every Iranian\nSee we gotta we gotta deal with this cognitive dissonance or just makes no sense and are being a\nSecretary of state Pompeo is just out in ... magazine for you know ... is useful old cheat saying that ah it's called confronting Iran\n[noise] [noise] oh I think a shuffle is definitely going on what is most notable is the central absence of the United states\nFor many of these equations I'm a turkey and Iran are finding common cause in the Turkish needed for energy as Iran has squeezed by American sanctions\nTurkey and Saudi Arabia or back to their old rivalry within for leadership within the Islamic world turkey aligned more or less with the Muslim Brotherhood and Saudi Arabia against it in the region fishers between\nNeighbors like Saudi Arabia and cut her have now become deep rift um be hard to repair and of course the Saudi Iranian rivalry has reached that level they never did before and author Israel is now for the first time\nAn overt partner with a major Arab country\nOn a foreign policy project namely regime change in Iran if you look for an external actor you will find Russia or not the United states as the dominant diplomatic influence ... vote in the region Mr protein has a weak hand but he has played it very very skillfully\nSo the Reshef what was going on is basically are without much if any American strategic control or input and that means that the region is quite unpredictable\nYou talked about the possibility earlier of a a war with Iran yes that's what I learned that war would\nBe spearheaded by Israel which would act in such a ways to drag the United states into it and the Saudis would probably cooperate in it but the main driver would be Mr Netanyahu and his his military\nWrote Mr Bolton dumped on side\nJohn Bolton has never were met a war he didn't like and um and he has been passionate against Iran and his passionately for Israel so there you have the connection to the White House\nThe allows actors in the region whether Israeli or Saudi 'em to manipulate American policy\nSo it's going to happen ...\nThere's a great answer and Arabic to that ... God Knows\nJust bringing makes it plain for us as\nSara Lee which is the human rights watch I on the middle east and North Africa for the last decade and more you know ... he says Mohammed ... is a scary departure from the Saudi royalty he used to know what's your view of envious\n[laughter] well I think ... are accurate and describing him as scary everything that I'm ... Mann is doing domestically inside the country are generally a and a extra territorially far away from the country's borders is very very scary\nUm and I think that in um several generations of Saudi leaders uh Mohammed bin Salman is uniquely scary because he has concentrated power in a way that we've never seen before in Saudi Arabia\n[noise] you know how did he get the reformer tired I mean so women ... to drive cars they might even go to the movies on a weekend or when I see is repositioning real labeling Saudi Saudi ... under the age of oil in the age of\nNew new industry in high technology ah\nRedeem him in their eyes after all this [noise] and somebody else to do that rule\nWell I I mean there's no doubt the decision to allow women to drive was very positive one and one that I think has extremely broad support in Saudi Arabia where more than fifty percent of the population is under the age of thirty and\nSo he was right to know that the er aggressive policy the kingdom a you know from a ... of the kingdom banning women on driving for example\nI'm a ... an ending that would meet with much support\nOr however he has very deliberately taken that measure and other uh liberalizing measures let's say like a a reopening movie theaters\nOr in the country in a way that makes clear that he decides and nobody else has a say in fact he's very liberally jailed a activists including women's rights activists who campaigned for the women's rights\nTo drive sure and that's because he wants them to have a very clear message that only he gets to decide what changes in the country\nAre envious so made a sort of still visit the United states including\nHarvard and MIT and that their presidents or what not many\nDoesn't key billionaires in this country as well as on drum how did he get that notion and how did he get the assignment in to be part of this alliance anti Iran alliance with Trump with Israel\n[noise] well when you look at and Samantha such a from deputy crown prince as the favorite son of king ... non uh to basically carrying out a coup against Mohammed bin Nayef the man who was crown prince\nUh in Saudi Arabia but also interior minister in Saudi Arabia for many decades and who had extremely close ties with the Pentagon and the CIA and the state department for many decades\nUm habit than men was able to come in and elbow a cousin out of office at the gate and acceptance and approval or in the Washington establishment establishment because he was deliberately marketed as such a and and\nMy home to be accepted by the way he and by Israel uh men do I should say\nThe supporters of Israel and the very very strong support that he received the partnership a he had with leading voices and leading figures particularly from the ... but also from Israel um led to his emergence as a force\nUh in the United states and and the quid pro quo I think has been very clear\nAh in that he has been very much a all aligned and and for the first time publicly aligned with Israel are talking about having a relationship with Israel that has never before it happened um but also are not coming out against\nA Jared Kushner's so called now dead of course peace plan a as well just remain silent on the move of the embassy to Jerusalem\nWho who was the only who's gonna who has a say now from the CIA to Israel to the royal family as to whether he stays or goes after this this\nAwful to show the murder\nWell it's it's it's I ... you know it's a known who can make a change um the problem is that even if king says nine and a wanted\nTo change his son from power he is widely reported to have dementia and have very limited moments that city so whether he\nIs wearing off of the crisis that his son his thoughts of the country into a\nAnd has the capacity to move him out of office and replace him that's a big question mark on the next capacity for change might come from other royal prince says other other power centers in the country who Mohammed bin Salman has alienated in his ... is\nA central location of power and ruthless a attacks jailing a defunding of everyone else\nIn the country who might be a threat to him um for all those who might want to change and if there's some kind of an internal Saturday cool a it may well succeed if it has the support of the United states\nCertainly but since then by Steve Simon joins us from Amherst College among Middle East policy wonks you're known Steve is the real one with the deep back on and the religious cultures in the region\nThe time it was the rock Obama's Middle East men on the national Security Council last I heard you were working on a book titled the long goodbye United\nStates in the middle east from Islamic Revolution to the Arab Spring where are we now\n[noise] [laughter] well [laughter] you know I I think is as far as the one who lives keep going well and\nI have a perspective since the prospect of British as a was saying before I think quite quite rightly the United States isn't much of a presence here in this equation\nUh and uh I think that's part of a boy or a general trend of the United states distancing itself from the region because um\nYou know American presidents she a less of a payoff for American intervention were involved than uh than had been the case and not only that for us you know once I think is is less welcome has been in the past\nBut you know American removal yes and no I mean Donald Trump does it his way he's in his daughter to the relocation in the U.S embassy he sent his son in law to have who knows what kind of discussion with these people that's not quite abandoning the field you know what I Know\nOh no no and I don't mean to say that the United states\nDescribe this war and I have to say we're all embarrassed not to know more about it there's an embarrassment to our journalism right there but tell us what you know who's\nWell think well thank you for having me on the show and also thank you for recognizing not because it's been a really a long struggle for us for the last three and a half years to try to shed light on this issue given its um you know incredible told that it's taken on so many millions of human beings lives in Yemen\nAre about Yemen is um you know Saudi Arabia southern at Saudi Arabia southern border it is um the middle east poorest country and um has seen a lot of upheaval especially after the twenty eleven uprisings that took over in various parts of the Arab world including him and\nUm and unfortunately we are here today because some of the Saudi intervention that began in twenty Fifteen and has now lead to creating the world's worst humanitarian crisis in Yemen\nUm two going a picture what kinds of people what livelihoods no oil I take it I'm\nNo oil which is why you don't hear about it very much um but the previous president of a thirty three years in Yemen was a strong ally of the U. S. and I'm a you know under the Obama administration the drone wars began in Yemen extensively to to read the country of ...\nUm and after the President Assad to step down I'm following the twenty love in protest\nUm has vice president was placed as interim president for two years his term expired and he was given an extra year and after that expired as well\nIt was a lot of people in the country they were still calls for our constitution injury drafting the constitution Yemen unlike its neighbors is not a salt in it it's not a a kingdom it's not a\nAn ... um you know there's it's fair to have a democracy in Yemen\nAnd unfortunately that was some co-opted from the people and a civil war began um largely you know people trying to vie for power seeing a I'm a ... a power shift was taking place in Yemen but you know all of this ... we we hear about Yemenis\nHow is it a civil war and\nNow she's also there's also pictured as a\nAn Iranian adventure to and then what has to be confronted is it or isn't it\nAbsolutely not this is what's how to review has been saying about Yemen to says what they've told Americans and apparently the Americans seem to still believe it I just said you your guest Steve Simon talk about their interventionist policy in Iran and how\nThey were the Obama administration was convinced that this was a a good way of dealing with Iran in Yemen and we know that Iran is not in Yemen\nYemen is located at a strategic location which is the point I'm at the streets of ... where about four million barrels of oil traveling every single day of course there is a strategic importance there for the Obama administration to protect\nAnd frankly the Saudis told them that this was going to be a very quick war they called a decisive storm they expected it to and within a couple of weeks maybe a month or so at most they didn't expect any kind of resistance in the country they didn't expect that this country that this conflict to John for so long\nBut you know here we are three and a half years later the Saudis have blockaded the country Lansing area which is why millions of people are literally starving to death yet we're expected were expected to believe that the Iranians are somehow\nManaging to smuggle weapons there's no evidence of that um there's no Iranian presence on the ground is is not Syria um and like your first guest Stephen I'm ginger mentioned this is a very much a one sided war\nSurely wants to return I'm Wondering for you at human rights watch somebody has made the construction suggestion that the least\nThe crown princes do as parents would have to stop that war tomorrow what could stop it actually\nWell absolutely I mean Saudi Arabia could stop the war Saudi Arabia is the primary aggressor in this war though it hides behind a coalition and Saudi Arabia started this war in Yemen\nUm agree completely with the commentator a previously that this was a fantasy that would be a war of a couple of weeks\nAnd the only real reason that this war we started was so that young crown prince could justify his new title is minister of defense or someone who actually had an experience fighting and winning a war in fact he's shown and proven himself to be the opposite of qualified for that\nWar and it read that resume were absolutely except if anything this is the resume that prove\nWhy not only he should be fired but he should be jailed I mean Saudi Arabia has been carrying out\nThe most atrocious war crimes\nOr in a a Yemen a bombarding uh schools universities hospitals are using cluster munitions littering the the the the country uh and I must also emphasize it primarily using American and British weapons\nAnd the role of America in this war is not just to sell weapons or or even to you know generally vaguely support a Saudi Arabia in the war the United states is the party to this war the United states is actively providing refueling assistance\nHas actively provided targeting assistance obviously very bad targeting assistance and so whatever is happening in this war the United states is a party to it a complicit in it and is responsible for\nThe uh of violations little love and war the war crimes that are taking place and and and just to go back to to to your commentator Mr Simon's comments\nUnfortunately uh the the support for the war in Yemen is by far the greatest foreign policy failing\nOf the Obama administration and it's it's really quite ...\nWas signed by the Yemeni people\nSee Simon strange until the Republicans in Congress who who hate this war against Yemen um what what's the possibility of mobilizing American opinion and government opinion and government power against it\nI think that there's this looming possibility that a ... a murder\nOr will prompt\nCongress or injured bean and and and do something to bring a U.S assistance to the ... war effort to an end and at the same time to put diplomatic pressure\nOn the show to use in the ... to support a un brokered peace process in Yemen there's a slim chance of that I'm\nA I'm skeptical that the Republicans are will be able to mobilize a coalition on the hill a really to make that\nWork and it's not something that can be done quickly either because it would probably panic or some kind of legislation so um you know it it it wouldn't be a miracle cure even if it happened and I think the chances are slim but there is a chance\nTo hinder um get us out of that war somehow\nI think it's true as you heard earlier that the United states wants to be less involved in some ways in the middle east and we don't have a ambassadors there that's a perfect example but let's not take from that phrase the idea that we're somehow disconnected from this war I Want to emphasize what you just heard\nWithout the United states this war couldn't be going on we are providing the targeting assistance on the refueling\nSo we are involved in some ways in a worse and more and a deeper way than we have been in the past because we're involved through others over home not only we have no control but we over we desire to exercise and no control the worst piece of this is that this war really is not about Yemen\nNobody cares about Yemen it's just the battle ground and and having lived through other wars like the one in Nicaragua which had nothing to do with Nicaragua just required Nicaragua's to supply the dead people so outside forces could make their point that's what's happening in Libya and in a in Yemen\nUp and asked for the fact that a Yemen was the worst foreign policy disaster of the Obama administration it certainly looks that way now but if you're from Libya or Sudan or Syria you could see that there's a lot of competition the\nSeason and it's not about you know what is it about\nThen I think it's about Saudi Arabia's desire to show that it can crush\nEvery she uh influenced movement which will then described as being pro Iran Saudi Arabia has tapped into an obsession in America with Iran\nJust like the way so many dictators tapped into our obsession against communism and they use that obsession as a way to get themselves permission to do whatever they want we have convinced ourselves to such a degree about the evil of Iran\nThat were able to look away from even the kinds of horrific crimes that are unfolding in Yemen\nBecause we've developed this idea that this as this force of Iran at so evil we have to ... we have to get out of that obsession before we can begin to look at its manifestations\nCheering on any speaking for him and it begins to sound from the outside like ... a genocide of war we're just going to wipe out the population by starvation if nothing else um what do they what did the Yemeni need most relief from the from from bombing from attack",

like this is over ...\nTranscend next layer rhetoric Douglas\nThere's been paired in statesmanship we're\nNew biography sets Douglas in parallel also\nThe literary giant Herman Melville his novel in questionable quail\nAnd Melville turned out to be exact contemporaries consumed in their twenties and thirties\nA moral crisis slavery\nRecord data to Bedford, Massachusetts is where the patch process whether they noticed one another or not it's where young Frederick dropped his slave named Bailey and took Douglas instead it's we're Ishmael ...\nQuick read Moby Dick\nWell ship they fail to pay for it and it's true\nVery like Douglass is ideal of\nPosit nation\nDavid bites accounted Douglas use the word man like Melville\nA storyteller who keeps rewriting his autobiography re composing here's an ethic\nOf American identity of tragedy of evil\nThe character Douglas is creating let's say in the narrative the first autobiography and even more ritually in the second is a self willed horrific individual ... always working and striving against the odds and he had great up\nHe is a courageous young man who sees is upon words ... language I'm literacy as his weapon as his only weapon but I think he's also creating a character who seizes on the weapon of character of\nA strong personality and even the young man who would use physical violence to regenerate himself\n[noise] we could do this hour in just personal relationships but the first one that grabbed me was we would call the yeah slave break or you know they were on on the eastern shore of Maryland He had been born into slavery\nGets farmed out to Thomas All right who finds them a little too rough and ready and he packs a monster movie\nAnd they end up in a fight which is all differently in different autobiographies but it's critical\nYeah it is critical critical Douglas the self creation but Douglas tells the story that one day on a Sunday when he had returned from temporarily running away to the woods he stood up to Kobe and according to the dog was they fought for two hours now I don't believe it lasted two hours a day to kill each other\nBut Dugas stands up with his fist and fight them off\nAt the age of Seventeen\nNow in any other circumstances a slave who resisted as master and such a way would be prosecuted or hang a or at least sold south\nBut at this point co via kept quiet according to Douglas because Kobe's pride was at stake and at the end of this year with Coby ...\nHis owner Tom his old hired him out again to another master a different farms just some five miles away that man's name was William Friedland\nAnd when you first read Douglas you think he's making up these names that sounds like Toni Morrison characters and but that was ... his name and Freeman's farm in fact the farmhouse on freelance farm is still there but it was on ... as far as the year after standing up to ... with his fists\nUh he wasn't even in his mid twenties and he could hold an audience for an hour and a half and half I'm laughing and crying\nThat was power\nThe only power he had\nSpeaking about that gays [laughter] I feel that gays\nAnd so many pictures every one of them striking storytelling expressions\nYeah they are everywhere he went\nDivers one and wanted him to sit for photographs he also cultivated these photographs over and over he liked doing this and uh if you didn't like the profile the photographer took in the morning and go back in the afternoon and get it done right [laughter]\nUm Douglas headed visit she had a president she had an incredible charisma\nAnd one of the things I found many many many\nAccounts of more people in the press or in letters describing\nThe first time they saw the first time they heard Douglas speak or or the second time they heard Douglas and comparing it to the first there are many descriptions of the sounds of his voice his mannerisms style and so forth\nAnd this was we need to remember the golden age of oratory or if they're photography and the birth of photography\nAnd Douglas love mode during the day by the way you love the things that ... and it's worth ...\nKind of remembering that he is born Eighteen Eighteen before steamboats the railroad\nThe rotary press which he will use of course to great extent\nThe telegraph all of the these these elements of Nineteen century mowed down to the which made possible a massive and you know reform movement like anti slavery that was born before that even happens but he lives all the way to electric light bulbs\nDid it might come to Eighteen fifty two and a speech\nThat is now sort of classic and a lotta young kids know that the fourth of July speech\nMaybe his great masterpiece maybe his popular masterpiece for all the time\nThe fourth of July speech Douglas gives an Eighteen fifty two is in my opinion the rhetorical master piece of American abolition and uh one of the great speeches in American history it's now canonized in lots of collections of oratory and speeches and even literature\nAnd read it street corners on red is already corners of the state of\nVermont has a ... as a statewide policy on the fourth every town is supposed to read it but the speech itself the context is\nIn part everything [noise] it's summer of Eighteen fifty two times\nIt's a presidential election year it's two years into the attempted enforcement of the fugitive slave act they're rescues going on around the country several of them already Kirk Douglas has participated in two or three of them [noise]\nThe crisis over slavery is beginning to break apart the political parties and Douglas gets indicted by his friends in Rochester the ladies anti slavery society of Rochester New York\nTo give a speech in Corinthian hall which was this big beautiful new hall in Rochester\nSet about six hundred people [noise] place was packed\nAnd ... there's a letter and which Douglas tells us he worked harder on that speech than anything else you'd ever written except\nPerhaps the narrative I said he spent three weeks but the speech is I call it a symphony in three movement is an opening\nUp six pages or so or he sets his audience cities in a calm voice she talks about the founding fathers as geniuses to declaration of independence is the ring ... says of your independence is a celebration for six pages or so\nAnd then the pronouns rain down on your you you you\nYou're dresses his audience the audience in that room that day but this piece was addressed the nation he already headed printed up ready to take on the road\nTo sell for probably fifty cents a copy the second\nMovement of speech which is the whole middle of the space for the longest part of the speech comes after he says but pardon me why have you invited me here to speak on your fourth of July the fourth of July as yours you may rejoice I'm much more than\nYou you you you you do not meaning white America does not include me and my people\nIn this celebration what ... uh well those I represent to do with your national independence\nYou're high independents only reviews and miserable distance between us the blessings in which you this day rejoice\nOr not enjoyed in common\nThe rich inheritance of justice liberty prosperity and independents decreased by your father's is shared by you\nNot to buy me\nSomething like that ... life in the evening to you as broad stripes and death to me this fourth of July is was\nKnocked my you may rejoice a much more than\nTwo drug a man in factors into the grand Newman needed temple of liberty and call upon him to join and Julius and things were human mockery and sacrilegious I really\nDo you mean citizens to mock me by asking me to speak today\nAnd in the middle part of the speech he takes them through the historical Whitney of the slave trade\nThe whole of a slave ship he makes he appeals to their senses\nHe tells them what it smelled like he tells them what it sounded like and then he makes them listen and hear the sounds of the chains on a slave and the sounds of a whip he tells him to see the blood dripping off the back of a of a slave being savagely beat and it's like a hailstorm\nThrough the whole middle\nOf the speech for twelve pages\nThat section comes to an end with the passage that is one step better than John\nYeah he ends with the image of a terrible reptile colonial up at the nation's heart and the boat to eat out you're hurt\nUnless you were pent you reform you change and then comes to slash short part of the speech\nIt's calmer it's as though he's handed out towels and let everybody dry off\nAnd he says but your country is still ... still young and male ... it is still possible to save ourselves by ending slavery destroying the system and recreating the nation\nAnd of course the speech ends so richly ironic\nWay of uh the verses of a song palm written by when lord garrison go sound the jubilee and the fact that he would do that in Eighteen fifty two right after he just had this horrible personal breakup with garrison\nIs ritually ironic so it's a speech that is full of the terror of of the great puritan Jeremiah by with the possibility of redemption at the end of it\nI suspect it's read today and used today so much partly just because of the power and beauty of the language but also it's used in places where people want\nAudiences they want their neighbors they want their friends to think about the fourth of July of something other than just fireworks and hamburgers and celebration they want to think think about its history I think about where Americans have come from I think about what we had to overcome\nTo have a peaceful republic such as it is and no one ever put it better than Douglas did by saying your country will be destroyed by slavery unless you repentance save it now and it might even be destroyed anyway\nNow that comes out of Douglas's deep intellectual moral emotional ties to the Old Testament store right that's where that comes from and in fact the language Douglas employs especially in his oratory\nBut also in a lot of his writing is really right out of the king James language [noise] David Wright cutting to the great relationship of perfect drug laws and\nAbraham Lincoln mhm historic ... obviously and endlessly\nReview of all they had studied one or the carefully warily at multiple levels of politics and character and strategy before they met and then you I didn't know that he met Lincoln\nVirtually by by urging into the White House to the favorite seekers yeah mine Lincoln receipts him though he was uninvited and according to ... percent\nMr Douglas I Know you [laughter] I have read about you are not seen that they're going to be that you want to think that Lincoln was on an equal pay for the black soldiers in the union army right take us there and these two men\nSure when we went to the White House as you suggest on his own elbow to Israel up the stairs got in line with us away andme gave is card and said please let man and Lincoln apparently did get the message that said send him in the head of a bunch of white people\nWell first of all Douglas was in every way of women's rights man you're and wrote an essay by that title I am a women's rights man\nHe was the only black at the Santa Claus convention and aging forty a he was the only primary males speaker at to Seneca Falls convention he signed a declaration of rights he put a new mass started on this paper which said rages of no color nor sex\nAnd he had a very strong relationship with the leaders of the ones suffered movement and his neighbors who isn't being ... in Rochester right whether neighbors now for the purpose of tourism\nAnd they weren't really neighbors they live their uh their neighbors and a statue even know the truth is he was very close to lots of women's rights activists he traveled with him he spoke with them because some of them with the same suffer just an abolitionist\nAnd during the civil war as many people know the women's suffrage movement by and large folded their tense and fought for black freedom Stanton in fact wrote one of the greatest eulogies all ... she's the one who\nSaid he was quote majestic in as raff which is great phrase Anthony was what Doug was a day died Dugas attended a women's rights convention in the last day of his life in Washington DC and he sat on the stage and he sat next to Susan answered and then he took care of ... dropped dead of a heart attack and six PM\nBut he had far more women friends among these reform movements then he actually did male friends\nIn some ways it most delicious piece in the relationship with Lincoln and Douglas comes ten years later when mhm Douglas dedicates rush free men's monument in Washington DC\nIt's a statue and we have one like it or a flicker right here in Boston standing Lincoln his left arm raised over the new black man and taking a knee if I may say I mean a man it's not quite kneeling but Douglas recoiled at that image if you wanted to call it A People's\nMonument right and he began his\nPre eminently the white man's president right and then the speech tension amazing term pores over\nI often say that That's Douglas is sucking the greatest speech\nFor an eye opener for greatness because it just seemed like a moment to place the story right there toward the end of reconstruction was everything at stake that had been in one in the war that speech is really about reconstruction yes and the retreat from reconstruction and know the audience you hit\nThe entire government was their president grant members of the president's cabinet congressman senators members of the Supreme Court ... it's everybody that would be at at a state event that inauguration\nNo black person had ever address that group of lots ... and no black person ever did again into Brock Obama was inaugurated ...\nI have said that President Lincoln was a white man and should the prejudices common to his countrymen tool words the color race viewed from the genuine abolition ground\nMr Lincoln seemed tardy code do and in different but measuring him by the symptom of his country a sentiment that he was about as a statesman to consult he was with cell is radical and determine\nThough Mr Lincoln shared the prejudices of his white fellow countrymen against the negro is hardly necessary\nTo say that in his heart of hearts the lows and hated slavery the man who could say they do we hope fervently do we pray that this might teach school of war should soon pass away yet if God Knows\nIt could take you to all the wealth powered by two hundred years of bondage\nSo have been wasted in each drop of blood drawn by the last show have been paid for by one drawn by the ... the judgments of the lord true and righteous all together gives all needed proof\nOf his feeling on the subject of ...\nIt's an honor speech he says look and this is by the way election year Eighteen Seventy six it's the centennial year year of the American centennial is reconstruction\nGonna last or die is right on the table and it comes in the wake of so much brutal use of violence and terror across the south now for years\nDouglas as Abraham Lincoln was permanently the white man's president he was your president not our you my white fellow Americans were his children I and my people only his step children when he repeats like a ...\nYou read that first part of the speech and you do a kind of an ouch what is the white man's president him being black nationalist diatribe against Lincoln and the country\nNo it's not what he does then he's shifts and he says but\nUnder his rule and in due time and he makes that are refrain three or four times and under his Lincoln's rule and in due time we were liberated\nWe became free we became\nEqual before the law and the fourteenth amendment we got the right to vote in lifting amendment under his rule and in due time which was Douglas's way I Believe\nOf saying the United states freed us the United states gave us our rights and the United states is bound to enforce and protect that and who's sitting in front of him\nAnd it ends with a sort of ...\nAbout reconstruction and about whether this will be saved or not and of course it's also laced beautifully with all that civil religion he talks about\nThe deadline and yonder Arlington he talks about the majestic dome of the Capitol I mean it's full of the sort of beauty of patriotism I see it as a great reconstruction speech because it comes right as reconstruction is falling apart on the evil that presidential election which is of course when\nThe bargain is struck that in effect does bring a kind of political ended least reconstruction is Douglas his attempt at the last two Iran to try to rally his own party now which is still in power\nTo whole reconstruction together\nThe lynching speech was the last of the great ones ... mhm [noise] yeah he's confronted by the issue of lynching from really the late Eighteen eighties on but especially in the early nineties\nI to be well had some influence on that because of her great activism about lynching and they became quite close he became a kind of mentor to her\nBut he first fashion the speech while he was in Chicago representing the nation of Haiti to Chicago world's fair and he took a version of it on the road called the lessons of the hour also sometimes called why as the negro Lynch\nIt's actually a very good analysis of how this came out of the culture out of the society\n[noise] and it's no holds barred it's in Bedford speech it's an ugly speech\nA difficult speech even read at times because he uses examples from the press of of actual lynchings\nHe talks about the white audience celebrating which we've now learned much much more about adult lynching\nBut in essence that speech given in the last years of his life is Douglas saying\nAll that we fought for all the way one the great triumphs and rebirth of the United states is possibly being destroyed now by this phenomena\nHe has a very difficult time in that speech doing what he usually did through his life which is to find some kind of way to end\nOn hope ... but\nHe does it [laughter]\nLike it or not he hands on this faith that still some how the ... of the constitution will prevail ... ... where I was going to go but to the fourteenth fifteenth amendments where else can you go but\nTo these creeds of natural rights which is worried always gone in way back forty years earlier when arguing for the destruction of slavery\nBut it is remarkable that in the end of his life he doesn't in his life an unhappy man by any means a he had a a very rich domestic situation by the end of his life and he was comfortable but what's happening out\nIn society was the cause of great despair and its vividly illustrated in that speech ... lessons of the hour he didn't need to share as\nMuch about his private life is married life first year and a slave woman who did not grow intellectually the way he did or his lady friends or his second marriage all the many children to who had been in the civil war and for over the legacy I mean do we need to know\nYes we do because I think in any biography

Lula da dum de unhealthy and they need a major read\nLong history\nThan this game and what what the what are the insiders inside line and this report\nI I think it's an important report which are sort of surprising report in the surprise is\nHow we keep getting surprised about the same thing again and again and again uh I don't think it's a more frightening report in previous ones are as you are interested we've been sleeping so we haven't been hitting what the BCC has been saying we haven't been hitting what nature has been telling us all around us not just in Florida\nI all over south ... south east Asia all over Europe [noise] and uh so so in in some ways you know uh it's it's like you\nDid seem to think it should be tried again and again and again\nWhat what's new in these cascading feedback loops for example\nSo I I think what's new here is this one point five degree sort of which has become the new uh ... give a dog get that off to the world is going to somehow become a is reverse simply different\nPoint is that the voters or maybe it was simply different that for hundreds of millions of people in the world the Buddhist people in the what some of the ... the word to climate change is not something you talk about the future tests\nYou find that change is something that has hit that is happening at this happening now and my um issue but the report if any is that it's maybe not fighting enough it's it's trying to fight in the ... about the future\n... really fully telling us about the president I can see why they're doing it because they want this book author mostly you and meet people people who are affluent into action and this is one more tempted saying he'll guard please do something and do it now I\nThink that's the that's a good message but there's another message and the messages that climate change is happening now it's happening in ... it's happening in Pakistan it's happening in Haiti it's happening and malicious it's happening\nIn in in revenue to and it's happening and this is the key point it is happening mostly not most is happening with Greivis consequences in places which had been nice to do with causing the problem\nSo those who had nice to do with making the mess on at the front forefront of having to deal with that that is why I think climate is a justice issue and this report as well as previous IPC seat reports I don't think I've done justice to climate as a justice of ...\n[noise] yeah we can get ahead around so many aspects would stick with justice for the ... one of the blocks in our understanding or just our humanity\nI have this storm say how many other\nPlace I think it does the humanity um that is at best here I think I just had has not science like we I was just keeps coming up in ... I'm a fan of fight BCC I mean part of it but this is no longer a question of science the big thing is the big challenges knocked\nWhether we have enough science or not the big challenges whether we have enough action or not and why is that not happening that just eat a question of odd of humanity as you point that I eat of ethics and within ... as a species are fully evolve to look at ourselves and I said why religious speeches and I'm not sure we are\nAnd the second thing is I think this is they just enough technology there's enough science there's enough knowledge for us to make a difference\nI Am not convinced anymore but there is enough visited him in a species to act in time and to act\nFor the benefit of the entire species or if I can say something rather harsh or with your permission I think in some ways all of us who saved the climate change sheet asleep do not actually take it seriously enough\nBecause we've all figured out that we probably will shrimp\nIt's kind of like a ... that was that was about to go down we all taught me to go down with it and now suddenly realize\nOh maybe not maybe some of us will make it to the fight and at that point your challenges are you going to lend a hand to those who will go down and the fact of the matter is we have not been doing that\nYou know politicians take a lot of heat and they should for being unwilling to risk their jobs but I mean every one of us I think is is is afraid to doing something serious would risk their own jobs\nSo yes oh yes I I think that is vi V. have kind of made made the fact that somehow the guards of technology\nAnd the guards off the free market ... village somehow find a solution and time for us to be saved and maybe we are right but the problem is that not all of us and we'll be saved and as I said it is those who had released to do with causing the mess that are having to face the consequences\nThere are limits here on our humanity and shame on us but there's also years and years along like butter conditioning we're told over and over again that it's it's great to be rich anybody can strive for it\n... degrees of mechanism mechanization but of privilege of leisure of fun that we have defined as human would be very hard to get up at this point [laughter]\nYes and Frank ... see that you know it's a it's a question of justice here's here's the thing of why does natured dog get deport what does nature to have to ... what does nature have against the ... people in the woods and the fact of the matter is that if you are\nFor you will end up living in the most fun ...\nAnd if you are the Buddhist living in the most ... bases you it is most likely that you do not have the ability to deal with those disasters ... so the disaster comes to Florida and the disaster comes to cut Archie oeuvre Mumbai\nBut if you are on the edge in Mumbai you're much less likely to have the resources to deal with it and and the point I'm making about you know this is no longer the future to shoot this this report and we still talk about climate as if it's something fought in the distance or maybe not that far in the distance but still something in the future\nBut to cross the world it is not the future to look at the heat waves going around ... ... a look at floods my country Pakistan there is no for the last six seven years\nBut of debts at the same time that are dropped ... at the same time there are a heat wave sticking more life encouraging this summer at that time more people died in the heat wave then through terrorism\nIn the ... right right and this is a violent place anyhow so the point I'm making just the nature of this telling us that the norm of the new normal is the climactic change not move\nFor a lot of places and who's paying the price is the Buddhist the those who are least able to do something about this those who were released responsible for causing the mess\nAnd we still talk down\nAnd the great minds of the west including that one of them and Martin rays are going to tell\nThe world or how to how to deal with the problem that we\nIn the west graded so many sort of uh\nWe we meet ourselves coming and going west produced the industrial revolution that created the problem and divided the world and still somehow we expect that those geniuses and we all know and love how I'm going to solve this problem I think I Want it I maybe you can tell us oh\nWhat do the light footprint people the world\nIn in Pakistan in Africa in China um has to offer this conversation that we're not hearing\nI did the did they do have to offer an idea of an ideal of life that is not as driven by the ideal of growth as a model is but here's the thing that we should also be concerned about the light footprint people as you as you put it\nI've seen the same word you and I\nAnd they're saying that these heavy for ... ... ... ... people\nAre taking too many resources away from me and maybe I Need to be in the same place I so we're not Martin Greece was exactly right on his you cannot you can not wind defended to the Buddhist people of the world and say why do you want to drive a car why do you want to use a French\nLike if we are not able to change our lifestyle we can not\nA adamantly Dell the oldest of the world you know you used to being great so we have to live like this but you you must save the planet for our future generation that cannot work and it's evident that it is not what can\nI Do know Joe I Want you to review your own history in this\nIn this battle or you go back to Rio and Nineteen Ninety to President George W. Bush one of his better weekends and maybe the last moment of sort of reassurance that we could we could think our way out of this box\n... you know I was a veal Nineteen Ninety two was a turning point for many of us including myself I was young I was in ... I was I was idealistic we talked we could change the world and had to do things that I remember from that one\nWhat you are probably referring to this possibly the most on a statement made by any politician ever\nAbout climate change or George Bush gum studio and says and I quote the American lifestyle is not open to negotiation and this wasn't just George Bush this is not about Trump everyone in between you and me included have essentially said\nIt's that his whole suit is on fire\nActually seeing ... wrote the piece and he joins us by phone using executive director of the Brooklyn Institute for social research is book in progress on politics and the age of the and through the scene the manmade Iran actually welcome\nI'm not trying to get ...\nYou said in that article is the goal of containing heat rise is on its face impossible President Trump says the same but he's not bothered by explaining that\nUm well it's not that it's not\nPossible um it's that the ... like June yet with in the systems that we have right so\nI'm the most frequently gesture to is the you know Paris climate accord um\nWhich are sort of a contradictory in and out themselves um they want to achieve that it's a nice state it targets of you know less than one point five and ... and probably you know topping out around too but they want to do it with our\nExisting social economic and political systems and I'm actually a lot of what I'm Talking to Jon just as\nI Would I Would just agree with so much of it\nUm I Would spin it ever so slightly differently though and I emphasize some different things which is that there's a word that it seems to be missing 'em from these conversations which is capitalism um it's not that humanity in is in fact\nDoing all the fangs um she managed doesn't stand in a way of um some of the mitigation adaptation efforts that could be done\nUm it's that we have a socio economic system that is predicated on the kind of extractive um fuel sources and general extractive regimes right whether we're talking about social systems\nUm economic systems and of course a fossil fuels and planetary boundaries that keep it going in the way that we now are\nYou speaking in your article is high carbon economic growth and profits too of course a and I I Wonder if I'm hearing your definition\nCapitalism in the modern world\nI mean it it's funny I'm In that same article I get into this question of of definitions to sort of obliquely at the end\nCan do that I listed a whole host of them the article um\nAnd and the\nThere's a lot of things we can do and whether or not what happens on the other side of that and I tend to agree absolutely would doctor and John but he was saying that the problem is not the future I cannot stress that enough um that that we are living through this you know right now\nUm and there's a lot that we can do and whether what what comes out of that you know what sort of springs sport is capitalism what we want to call it something else posts capitalism is it real like socialism like God Knows um but it is so dramatically different than the socio economic order we have now um and it's\nAnd it's fundamental to understand and so and that's why it's so hard to hear and I think for many people\nUm people who who you know do you propose these sort of small bore reforms whether it be you know like having a cap and trade system using market incentives when in fact we knew we need broad have a political transformation um\nAnd that the other thing I Would emphasize is uh uh I you know ... ... talking to John was correct in saying that you know this will hit\n'em hardest areas that have a ... that have contributed to lease um but that's not just sort of an iron right it's as you said it's not nature targeting people um the truth is the same system that whole that that I'm\nDr such extraordinary inequality in our world and such extraordinary I'm\nIn balance of power between global north in global south also drive and support and are necessary for the maintenance of capitalism as we know it does if we're going to have in mind that change seriously we have to take capitalism seriously\nWhen the world the capitalism created in some sense when come back to ... ... New York times you don't believe that he's not responded to this and they think he's stupid that it doesn't get it but you point out very phone scores on this problem\nAnd submitted the by the end of the century the heat rises will be not one point five it will be four degrees centigrade and there's a way I Want you to explain it in which he has incorporated this into his thinking\nAbout the world you call it and he might do right wing climate really isn't unpack\nSure happy to um you know I Do think that there's often a way in which we talk about these conversations again as if everyone like the world is going to end right it's the apocalypse like um everyone's going to die so this is that we're all gonna die right it's a\nQuote from by the ... on but the truth is actually on\nThere are a lot of people that blow a and we can sort of very easily or imagined in our minds but then the demographics um the wealth levels um the placement\nOf the people that are actually going to do pretty well through this period um and I do sort of think there is a ... you know whether a Trump actually believe it or not God Knows I'm not going to speculate about what he actually believes are not um but I Do think there was something in that um\n[noise] in that study that was so fascinating 'cause they were basically saying they were leaving that denialism behind oh there's no such thing oh it's a Chinese has a and going instead with yup it's going to happen and it's too late and there's nothing to do about it\nOn and what's so fascinating to me there is one that isn't on a statement or at least partially right they're saying the things that they were trying to overturn the fuel efficiency standards and the truth is\nLike just a couple of fuel efficiency standards that they're right that's not going to turn that's not going to turn the tide on air right when they say business as usual\nWell the ... or degree or more increase like if he knew nothing if you change now and that's what's gonna happen on those things are true and I think that that's something that um again it's sort of missing from this conversation which is that it's a political conflict um you know\nIt's strange because yeah the rising um the crisis is not going to be good for Trump's base it may be good for his ten best friends they have their minds they have their mountaintops they have their their um [noise]\nUh you know my law goes although that's going to be pretty soggy for the first five floors I Want to so do you um ideal weight is capitalism in your view figure among the obstacles to progress here or the owners of the problem\nI I think uh the the beliefs that come with the models that we have on a major part of the problem in the sense that it is this belief in the gospel of wrote a and of continues to grow old in the plan is that is a very serious levels not inflict\nA and and and everyone's growth right that's that's the thing that everyone has to constantly grew at some point nothing's going to meet involved in that one might be climate change but different people who made the border differently by my estimation it leads to a billion people in the world to date\nTwenty two thousand eighty at least a billion people in the winter do you live in what I call the age of ...\nThe the new non good in the mid ... would we have to do something to stop climate they have to actually adapt to climate that has changed for them and and that means that they have to\nKeep these these sources and use them to adapt to this ... my only issue might wonder don't issue but my only\nQuestion I think for Mr ... who I I also agree with this I Am not ask gone for doing the climate will force us to change the more you know unfortunately I think the more stronger and what do you mean\nBy the late shift of habit or privilege or these but does the balance of power\nAnd and and and ... and and the because ah I don't see the video to make the type of changes that need on\nWhat what is it political change that could work toward your dream\nTo me please uh yes and I mean ...\nStrangely uh I I there's a lot of hatred and uh I Do think you can see 'em a couple of things that it\nThat could be helpful for the political picture and I I Will say that that ... ah it's likely neither neither\nI don't even know like a fifty fifty which I think what I'm professor ... that um you know could even worse than that I'm\nNot sure example I think there's a growing awareness of of the problem I'm In a in the global north um which I think most people I've uh I've noticed is that sort of primary source of this problem um\nAnd then as you think that's all right go ahead you're asking an ideal oh no no no no no that was just I was just talking okay sorry I added to\nThat question of what people talk about just parents here [laughter] and what part media plays a we spoke with Allen West Virginia this week\nVery brave former editor of the guardian from London and he
