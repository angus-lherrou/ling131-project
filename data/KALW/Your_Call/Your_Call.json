Seventy Stevens halt\nAnd Dr ... joins us in Studio ... welcome back to the show and thanks for having me it's great to have you\nWell this is a fascinating book looking at the relationship and the choices that scientists make\nDuring the Cold War and we're still living with the consequences of a lot of their work including the atomic bomb\nWhat do you decide to write about this about the relationship between science and politics during the Cold War\nYou know I didn't know that I was writing a book about science and politics in the Cold War I thought I was writing a biography of a geneticist named in glass\nI'm Glad this was a civil libertarian he was the kinds of scientists to many historians of science uh said had really been marginalized during the Cold War because of their work on behalf of scientific freedom\nAnd as I researched the project I began to realize that that's not what was happening with Bentley Glass and some of these other scientist at all\nA while he might have had some trouble I'm On the domestic front with the FBI an a and McCarthy has them on the international front a Bentley Glass a very close relationships with the state department and other government agencies promoting the values of American science and brought\n'em and I began to realize that this was a much broader story about um how ideas about scientific freedom really the relationship between science and freedom and democracy were part of the global Cold War and ideas about um\nAbout the virtues of American Life\nWell I'm guessing that a lot of people have never heard of ... glass can you tell us a little bit more about him sure\nBeen glass who's a geneticist who was a base of Johns Hopkins university I he was famous almost as much for his role as an administrator as he was for his science but the thing is that he did a tended to be in the area of radio genetics so the effects of radiation on um on genetic inheritance\nUm and obviously this was a huge issue in the Nineteen fifties or\nThe ... the usage of the atomic bomb um and he became very outspoken about the dangers of fall out this was a period when atomic bombs are routinely tested in the atmosphere um a book the United states and the Soviet Union were doing this the u._k. was doing this\nSo there was a lot of radiation around the globe during this period of time and glass was one of the scientist who was trying to bring the public's attention to that and that's part of that he became very involved with um some international scientists groups that were working on disarmament like the public\nTheir series of stories on the CIA is vast network of private partners changed how the public understood the work\nOf the U. S. government and you open the chapter that's so interesting chapter eight I'm with is on February twelfth Nineteen sixty seven the White House received a deeply and welcome tap\nRampart radical west coast magazine plan to expose the CIA is long term involvement with the national student association a respected mainstream organization of collegiate leaders rumors of secret CIA funding channels had been calculus circulating for years\nBut the timing and content of the rampart article threatened to blow the lead off the CIA is entire network of private organizations\nTalk more about the importance of that kind of reporting in the late sixties and and what it did\nNice thing about the story was that it stayed secret for as long as it did at the structure of relying on private partners meant that thousands of people had access to secret information that they didn't necessarily want um these stories eventually broke because some of these secrets were being trusted in ... in in trusted with college students\nUm up until the period of Vietnam um many Americans were willing to keep those secrets in the broader um you know in in in terms of the broader work of of anti communism\nA but his public attitudes about communism and the ... the justice of the United states a war on communism as these concerns were getting stronger\nPeople were beginning to have more concerns about that for years journalists had been hearing rumors um in some cases they would report bits of it in Nineteen sixty five\nAh some of these fake foundations ended up in the in the newspapers or because of the hearing about tax law that was in Congress I'm In which someone realized that uh some of these foundations that we are tax exempt weren't quite what they seemed um so\nTo keep they were willing to not print them I'm In the broader national interest in my Nineteen sixty six and by Nineteen sixty seven that consensus was changing these journalists had decided that you know the time had come to talk about this\nIn part because of the stories we're going to break anyway it whether it was going to be a young people talking about it or whether the covers we're going to be blown by some other parties\nUm so the spring of Nineteen sixty seven and a became almost to a ratings were in in news and newspapers between ... and the New York times and the Washington Post there were a series of you know almost ... almost daily front page stories\nAbout this group was you know this labor group received money this arts group received money this group of intellectuals received money on and on and on and on\n'em and when you read those some of the conspiracy theories you can you can understand why some of those conspiracy theories came about\nBecause it looked like the CIA was involved and everything that's not quite the case that's not really what was happening here um but a certain amount of paranoia um it it's understandable when you read the newspaper reports and when you see kind of the the depths of the links\nWell so what was the fallout from these reports I ... when I read the section I was thinking a lot about surveillance and the New York Times' decision to withhold stories\nAnd I'm the reporter James rise and who left in New York Times and now works at the intercept wrote all about what happened at the New York times and said what was the fallout\n[noise] right well I should I should preface what I'm about to say a by saying that I don't have a clearance today and so I'm having a I I've never had a clearance um and so I'm having to assume that what I've learned is um you know an adequate at a reasonably accurate representation of what's being half of what was happening [noise]\nUh but the short version of this was in Nineteen sixty seven I'm senior foreign policy officials decided that the consequences the costs of having these\nPrivate partnerships was too great to be here\nUm and so in Nineteen sixty seven a President Johnson decided that the CIA was no longer is going to be funding these kinds of private groups that appeared to be a private independent groups that were really something else or the CIA really got out of the business of a cultural diplomacy in Nineteen sixty seven\nWhich isn't to say that the entire government got out of cultural diplomacy\nA but it became more of the province of overt agencies whether that might be the state department or the U.S uh information agency and obviously these groups had been doing that word all along um but the decision at that point was that the United states should only be conducting its culture diplomacy through overt groups\nToday we are speaking with science historian Audrey Wolff about her new book freedoms laboratory the Cold War struggle for the soul of science and if you have any questions for address about what she uncovered\nShe writes extensively about the role of science has played an American cultural diplomacy after World War two and uncovers the close relationship between the U.S government and private scientific groups\nAnd then she also explores what we're dealing with today today's war on science and she argues that scientists have to make a choice and the ongoing struggle for freedom\nAnd equality and you can give us a call at eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five\nEight six six seven nine eight eight to five five you can also email your call at K. A. L. W. dot O. R. G. if you're a scientist we'd love to hear from you how do you think history should judge scientists like Oppenheimer of the head of\nThe Los Alamos laboratory who's credited with being the father of the atomic bomb for his role and the Manhattan Project and then he later protested against us plans to build the hydrogen bombs what are your thoughts on that\nResearch about the Cold War when ... when the media started focusing on this and Nineteen sixty seven do you know how other countries respond to this especially affected countries [noise] um\nThe response is surprisingly muted the state department was absolutely worried that there would be a crisis and they sent out a series of circular as to you know international post about how they should respond\nA but surprisingly um there were very few repercussions one different one place where there were was in India so India decided that no us foundation could support worked there for a few years\nUm because you know one of the consequences of these low uncovers with that many people felt that it was now impossible to distinguish between legitimate\nI'm really you know a international groups that were genuinely independence um and those that had been a cover\n'em in the Indian government decided that they also could not make that decision and so they basically got a uh stopped working with American Foundation for a few years I'm In some other places some of the literary um some of the literary journals that had been funded by some of these friends were banned\nUh there was one called ... which was an an Arabic language a kind of arts and letters sort of literary magazine ah that became that was banned from certain parts of the Arab world after these covers were blown\nUm but for some insist the response was surprisingly muted the one exception was in the uh American anthropological association we're a mini anthropologist who had been doing the work that's ... realized how closely their work resembled intelligence gathering and many of them became deeply uncomfortable with doing this work\nUh we're working with the government in any way but I Would say on the whole of the international response was surprisingly muted under the circumstances I think one has to put us in the context of the\nA rising international opposition to the United states involvement in the Vietnam War I think by Nineteen sixty seven these revelations work particularly surprising to a lot of people and they were sort of in keeping with um what many nations were already beginning to think about the United states government so they weren't it wasn't a drastic change in that way\nIt did scientists from other countries like the United states and other countries did they travel to other countries to take part in conferences to talk about all of this um yes\nI Will not necessarily to talk about the revelations um but I Would say the phenomenon of international conferences\nIn an odd way absolutely related to these ideas about um a a Cold War that involves ideas about scientific freedom of the United states wanted to project itself is the opposite of how science was being conducted in the Soviet Union\nUm so the United states has really pushing the idea that science and the Soviet Union was intensely nationalistic intentionally uh you know intensely devoted to just national goals I'm In that it was close that you couldn't do science and the Soviet Union you know if you didn't have some kind of a you know communist affiliation\nAnd so the United states really wanted to protect us image of the opposite of that and so the United states absolutely I'm encouraged many that scientists to participate in international events\nEven sponsored some international events\nAs a way to um you know tell the rest of the world look the United states values open science um and you know for the record that's a lovely idea not all of these ideas are terrible ideas um but they're also not naturally occurring and so to talk about some of these ideas as kind of Cold War propaganda\nOr um you know ideas that had to be constructed in maintained these were choices about how science should be um and this is the idea that science should be international\n[noise] today we are speaking with Dr Audrey Wolff a science historian about her\nOf science she examined several scientists played an American cultural diplomacy after World War two and uncovers the close relationship between the U.S government and private scientific groups\nShe also explores today's war on science and argues that scientists have choices to make and the ongoing struggle for freedom and equality this is your call will be back after this\n'em and so the initial hogwash meeting was held in ... Nova Scotia in the name stuck um it had another name I think the committee on worldwide scientific affairs a but people generally call it puck wash\n[laughter] I'm looking at ... dot org and it says pug wash seeks a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction\nThrough our long standing tradition of dialogue across divides that also earned us the Nobel Peace prize in Nineteen Ninety five\nPug wash aims to develop and support the use of scientific evidence based policymaking focusing on areas where nuclear and W. M. D. risks are present how strong is this group now how active as this group today they're still around\nI I you know they're they're high point was really during the Cold War both I'm\nIn the early Nineteen sixties in the lead up to the a partial test and agreements and then again in the Nineteen eighties their their role and some of the disarmament negotiations um they are absolutely well intentioned people who do good work\nUm and they may not have been wrong in the idea that they could do this kind of work if they appear to be a a group of independent\nUm scientists but what's really interesting about the I I don't know much about their work in the Nineteen eighties but the period where I have studied in in the late Nineteen fifties or early Nineteen sixties what's interesting about that work with\nAs uniquely free from political considerations and they contrasted their ability to do that with their Soviet colleagues\nSo the idea was that if they were negotiating on a technical point that the Americans would be more trustworthy because they would be basing their opinions on scientific evidence on technical ability where's the Soviet ... uh where it's a Soviet participants might be basically political hacks\nI'm so they were trying to project this idea that the Americans would be better negotiators because they weren't affiliated with the government\nTechnically it is true they were not affiliated with the government\nBut they were absolutely doing uh what's now known as back channel negotiation or sometimes called track to diplomacy the state department was very interested in exploring this notion of track to diplomacy I'm basically when private citizens are working alongside or on a separate track from formal diplomatic negotiations\nSo the American participants in pug wash would have briefings at the state department at one particular meeting in Moscow um of hogwash meeting in Moscow in Nineteen sixty\nSome of the American participants were getting debriefed every night by the American ... uh by the American ambassador to the Soviet Union\nSo yes they were nominally a group of independent I'm kind of transnational scientists that they were working very closely to make sure that the positions that they were negotiating uh we're in keeping with what the United States wanted to see happen ...\nThere were some of the scientists that challenged us called war policies and its arms race with the Soviet Union\nIf we want to look at real oppositional stances like one of the best known for good reason his Linus Pauling\nAnd pilings a role in the story is quite interesting because it highlights some of the differences between a doing this kind of work um in cooperation with state power or separately Pauling was involved in the earliest days of the pug wash movement which started out really has a nuclear abolition movement a movement to free the world of bonds\nBut as a the test and go see you know as as um these these negotiations between the United states and the Soviet Union continued it became clear that the United states government would never go for that\nI'm so instead they would they might be open to the idea of a test and so a lot of the scientists involved with hogwash\nThey got on board with the idea of a test than it was a smaller bowl but it was an achievable goal\n'em and they thought there was something to be said for that Linus Pauling for his part really stayed committed to this idea that um we needed a world that did not have nuclear weapons and he quickly became sidelined uh from the pug washing movement because he seemed an outlier\nUm he was making arguments based on moral and ethical planes as opposed to scientific lanes and it became very difficult to fit him into um that kind of logic from where pug wash gets its expertise like the the excerpt that you read from the website if you're making a moral claim about nuclear weapons that's very different than an evidence base claim for nuclear weapon weapons\nIt's appalling is an interesting character to see what it looks like if you really do want to make a political claim Pauling was more than comfortable to say nuclear weapons are wrong and and\nYour section science for diplomacy right that by the summer of Nineteen sixty two calling us chemist had already won won Nobel Prize for his work on chemical bonds and was well on his way to picking up a rare second Nobel for his work on behalf of nuclear disarmament\nFrom Maine Nineteen fifty seven to July Nineteen fifty eight polling collected the signatures of more than eleven thousand scientists from around the world in support of a nuclear test ban\nThat's pretty impressive obviously that was before we had on line signature gathering and then you right over the next five years he wrote books gave hundreds of lectures and engaged and verbal fisticuffs with physicist Edward Teller director of Livermore National Lab the loudest advocate for ever bigger bombs\nAnd Pauline also faced repeated investigations by the U.S Senate\nYes um and the fight between polling and tell her is actually really telling because it was a moment for some of these other scientists are like Bentley Glass who I mentioned at the at the beginning of our interview 'em to\nKind of distinguish what they were doing such someone like mentally glass who was involved in pug watch who absolutely embraced these ideas that science could operate free from politics\nPilings I'm kinda screens against the bomb seemed to extreme they they didn't they seemed in temperate they seem to not objective um and even though\nGlass would say that he was more sympathetic to ... position he didn't like how Pauling was doing it\nUm and so he criticized both Pauling and tell her up for being emotional in their responses to how they talked about the bomb for bringing in their political attitudes about it\nUm now at the same time what's interesting about this you mentioned appalling had assembled these petitions of eleven thousand scientists Pauling was a more than willing to make a moral argument but he did think that scientists had a better standing to make that argument and other members of the public\nOn scientists weren't the only ones who are waiting a fight against the bomb and there were many thousands\nOr millions perhaps of people across the world many of whom weren't scientist at all who also were engaged in campaigns about the bomb who um you know took the slightly more radical position that you don't need scientific knowledge if you're if you're making a moral claim you don't need to sign you don't need scientific credentials to make that claim\n[noise] and you write that for a brief moment in Nineteen forty six it appeared that scientists advice might come help us to participate in some kind of international uranium authority with control\nOf Atomic Energy play squarely and civilian hands but by late Nineteen forty six the rise of anti communist sentiment and revelations of atomic espionage and the U. S.\nDiminished scientist influence over atomic policy\n[noise] great Nineteen forty six is a very interesting moment in American history for these ideas about uh whether it might be science or kind of international relations in general um you know the United states and Soviet Union were allies during during World War two they had a complicated relationship but they were on the same side against fascism\nUm and for a couple of years there are people talking about things like world governments you know what the UN was going to look like\nUm there was an interesting kind of global from it about the ideas of of how you would prevent a global catastrophe like World War two in the future\nUm and people were experimenting with all sorts of ideas including a kind of a more optimistic idea about a global control of a you know an Atomic Energy that ultimately didn't come to pass it with sidelined by a rising anti communism and then I think in Nineteen forty seven\nAnd a scientist become the target of the house un American activities committee and many were accused of being communists\nThe position of Nineteen forty seven if you were trying to understand what happened in World War two from a military perspective it seemed like science had one world war two for the allies\nUh whether that was about the atomic bomb or radar or about the proximity fuse it seemed the scientists had the the scientists were the thing that had made the difference\nUm and so the United states wanted to make sure that it was going to continue to have that advantage in the future\nIn the meantime they had been very concerned about the amount of Soviet espionage during World War two um and there was a Soviet espionage including in the Manhattan Project so the Soviet Union had 'em more information than the United states wanted it to have about the American nuclear program\nI'm so in Congress in particular several senators and congressmen were extremely concerned that scientists are going to be the weak link 'em\nOkay did for understanding and telling the story and twenty Eighteen is that it was both a witch hunt but some of the witches were real if you want to use that language of which ...\nAh there was an extremely fever search for communist and the government but we know in retrospect that there was a fairly elaborate Soviet espionage um effort that was fairly successful in getting secrets from the Manhattan Project which doesn't mean that the vast majority of American scientists untrustworthy in Nineteen forty seven\nUm but it's the story is a little more complicated than than many historians retelling it even Fifteen Years ago when it may have seen that a just a lot of you know that there was a lot of McCarthyism a unjustified attacks it has become clear that you know there were some real concerns about intelligence\nUm unfortunately these concerns were not handled any kind of thoughtful way but really a a blanket smear on American Scientist", "show_name": "Your Call", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "29", "locations": [["Redwood City", 37.48522, -122.23635], ["Germany", 51.5, 10.5], ["United States", -14.60485, -57.65625], ["China", 35.0, 105.0], ["Japan", 35.68536, 139.75309], ["Jakarta", -6.21462, 106.84513], ["Atlanta", 33.749, -84.38798], ["Britain", 41.66121, -72.77954], ["Gambia", 13.5, -15.5], ["Istanbul", 41.01384, 28.94966], ["Memphis State", 35.14953, -90.04898], ["Arthur", 29.88519, -93.94233], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["the Soviet Union", 38.90344, -77.03942], ["Vietnam", 16.16667, 107.83333], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["New York New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Los Alamos", 35.88808, -106.30697], ["India", 22.0, 79.0], ["India", 22.0, 79.0], ["United states", -14.60485, -57.65625], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["the Soviet Union", 38.90344, -77.03942], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["the Soviet Union", 38.90344, -77.03942], ["the Soviet Union", 38.90344, -77.03942], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["us", 45.99696, -118.49854], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Moscow", 55.75222, 37.61556], ["Moscow", 55.75222, 37.61556], ["the Soviet Union", 38.90344, -77.03942], ["the United States", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["the Soviet Union", 38.90344, -77.03942], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["the Soviet Union", 38.90344, -77.03942], ["United states", -14.60485, -57.65625], ["us", 45.99696, -118.49854], ["Maine", 45.50032, -69.24977], ["kinda", 58.01315, 15.73373], ["the U.

protests by University of Wisconsin students\nTo the students peaceful sit in against Dow Chemical in Nineteen sixty seven that turned violent the film does an incredible job of showing the power of resistance protest organizing and direct action\nIt also raises many questions about media coverage of the war back then and then war's today we're joined by Glenn Silber an award winning filmmaker and broadcast journalist who has produced Ninety prime time news magazine stories for various CBS News an ABC News broadcast\nAs well as ten independent documentaries primarily for PBS\nGlenn Silber was twice nominated for an Academy Award for best feature documentary for the war at home and El Salvador another Vietnam\nIf you're in the bay area the war at home is now playing Atlanta mark offer plaza in San Francisco and landmark ... in Berkeley and you can find more information about other screenings across the country at your call radio dot org and Glenn silver joins me in Studio Hi Glen welcome to the show how are you ... it's great to have you\nOh at such a critical time in this country because it just watching the film I just kept thinking about media coverage of all of these more is that the U.S is involved in today\nWell it's been very different because in Vietnam of course that became the TV were and that was a huge factor of stoking the anti war movement back home\nAnd then you flash forward to Iraq where everyone all of a sudden is imbedded right I was at ABC News and I declined to the offer to be imbedded that wasn't the way I Do business and I thought that was bullshit frankly\nWhat happened when he declined the offer\nOh it's a longer story they just put out they they put out a memo at twenty twenty where I was working that asking people if they wanted to get what they called special media training and they explained that meant it would be if you would sided to go over there how you might survive if you were captured\nAnd you know I got a call from a senior producer 'cause I was considered at that point I think maybe the most serious producer on twenty twenty there was always trying to do kind of aggressive things they thought I'd want to go\nBut of course I had two kids in college and I'd been down to El Salvador and I'd done things like that and the whole thing I was so against the war in Iraq for months and months I was actually making not friends by being so outspoken about it I thought it was bullshit from the beginning part of my be\nBut um anyway so I just didn't want any part of it ah I wound up doing some important work around the investigation and tonight eleven with John Miller and we were the ones who broke the story where the terrorists have been living in Paterson New Jersey\nAnd you know I felt like I Do plenty of good things on the ground back home I didn't have to go over there and be imbedded\n[noise] that that was really big one that came out is that still happening to you know I don't hear about in bed report\nWell forget the ramp up to him is so ridiculous to ramp up to the war in Iraq with this whole question of weapons of mass destruction and signaling to everyone over there that there's gonna be a shock and awe in a month or whatever it was\nThe only thing was strange and I just thought it was an incredible disaster and I could see it like a train wreck and so I didn't want to do it\nCalled the most dangerous man in America which I just love that's on Saturday evening and then lastly or another friend of mine ... field who made the film the life and times of Rosie the riveter and other other really great films she's going to be there on Sunday at four pm show I Love being able to have this dialogue with the audience afterwards and it's been\nIncredibly moving just to see people who haven't seen the film and thirty eight years or some young person who has never seen the film that is what we're really trying to figure out how to get the film it's time for us old guys like me to pass the torch\nBut to me this is like I said this is my contribution to the resistance to put this film back out there to look at how do you build a seven eight year resistance campaign what does that take when you're up against presidents like Lyndon Baines Johnson\nAnd war mongering presidents like Richard Nixon who don't even care remember when the film there's a guy says after the moratorium one of the few times we do go outside at Madison\nThe guy says well you could have two hundred and fifty thousand five hundred thousand people protest then you hear that Nixon was watching the football game ha ha\nThat's going to lead the frustration so all these the texture of this whole movement from start to finish you keep seeing the consciousness growing sheep seeing the resistance growing and it just charging ahead and not backing down\nSo I think the two types of ways of probably more is we've got to get organized gotta get informed you got to get organized and then you have to really decide if you're going to be which side are you are\nYou talking about and confident next and the choices they made out of thinking about an ad in the White House and you have these seminal events happening in the U.S and he got to play golf at mar a Lago ... look what's happening at that and then at\nIf you have any questions or comments for granted if you saw that with the war at home we'd like to hear from you if you'd like to ask glad I mean he's\nA long time journal asked when did you first start doing journalism\nWell at first I spent my first twelve years as an independent filmmaker making films like the war at home in El Salvador new set of Vietnam and you know my wife and I made the film on the San Francisco my trip here which is a fabulous film called troopers award winning film\nBecause we really was always in a way back then when I was still in my twenties early thirties I sort of looked at the mind troupe is doing what I was trying to do\nThey do it with theater I was trying to do with film which is create a radical culture and tell the truth and use a different form in this case they're very entertaining\nTo to capture people's attention\nAnd we just love that year we had so much fun and uh so there were other films and then it turned out my wife was pregnant the entire year we've made troopers so that was kind of the end of the world and I got very lucky I stumbled into the back door of CBS News an ABC for twenty three years uh doing\nReally great work because what my problems as an independent which every independent will say\nMoney for production and then how do you distribute it so when I was working for this prime time shows\nProblem solved and every piece I Would do would be at least maybe five six seven eight million people would say it was like the equivalent of having a hit movie at that that was before the Internet for twenty four seven cable at least for the first ten years\nSo I've had this incredible varied career that I don't know anyone else has actually gone from being kind of this radical filmmaker brand which I embraced\nThe forget radical doesn't just mean like I was out there extremists it means we're getting\nI Love that you can give us a call at eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five you can also email your call at K. A. L. W. dot L. are edgy\nAnd we have a comment on Facebook from Steve says I saw the war at home in Nineteen eighty it was powerful and life changing then I think it's so important for people to see it now to get a perspective on taking direct action for social and political change good jobs there\nThank you Steve we also have an email from Tim my brother was sent to Vietnam made it home okay I'll never quite the same he recommended that I not go I went to Canada when I was sixteen and registered as a conscientious objector makes thanks to the Quakers who helped me do the paperwork\nMight number with two hundred and fifty three so I never had to go to jail difference was back then everyone except wealthy and bone spur folks were subject to the draft now due to Reaganomics it's only poor people who have no choice but to a giant ... volunteer army is\nWell he's certainly right I'm a lot of the people who have come from some of the more depressed areas you know they they are the ones who wind up out of necessity\nGoing into the military and it's hard you know the draft is more equitable but or the other hand we saw when you have an unjust war like Vietnam you know when I came to the University of Wisconsin in Nineteen sixty eight as a freshman I didn't know anything about the war and I grew up in a little bubble suburb of New Jersey\nAnd the first day after my parents brought me off at the University of they were so impressed with the campus and everything they said well you're going to a great education I did start in the next day when someone from the from the Wisconsin draft resistance union slipped\nA we put under my door my dorm room door come you know to the next door tomorrow evening and we're gonna have a meeting about the war in Vietnam I never forget this on top of the leaflet it said\nCollege disorientation [laughter]\nAnd when you went over there there was a hundred and fifty people in a room all freshmen most of whom didn't do much of anything about the war and that began the process that changed my life getting educated about something what is happening ten thousand miles away but that actually does affect me\nAnd so over time certainly my freshman and sophomore years you're participating because\nI was just one of many thousands of people kind of in the in the movement so to speak because I wanted to be participating because this did affect my life and we did feel a moral responsibility for what our government was doing\nIt seems like a novel idea these days but it was so important and I was so lucky to go to Madison was not guaranteed which way I Would go with college I Would go to it's almost like what are called chaos Syria where you wind up\nAnd I'm so that was really my education was not so much in the classroom and it was more in in the movement in the streets coming to terms with there's a line in the film where the Nineteen sixty five president of STDs talks about\nHow if the U.S when they were one of the leaders have built though they were very very small at that time\nYou said we we never tried to talk people into things we knew we were right we would take an action and force people to confront the situation and that's how you learned enough to make a decision says you're becoming a real grownup\n[laughter] well thank you so much for the email temp thanks for sharing that story at let's hear from bill who is making a documentary called the boys who said no high bell walking to the shell\nHello road thank you for having me on\nHigh bail did you have a lot in our comment\nI'll just say first hello to land and I personally will the award home to the evening and look forward very much the thing that and all sorts of things that question and answer I'm I Am part of a group or making another doctor\nUh about the draft resistance and the Vietnam Era or Glenn mentioned written gold now will be doing to an eight tomorrow night with Daniel Ellsberg over in Berkeley art director is Judah Arabic uh who co directed and\nCo produced a film about Ellsberg so we have a very\nClose a connection here um our film is not yet a finished\nA and instead of focusing on one particular place we focus on one particular group that arose as the war began a and as the war went on the group uh at first\nA tendency to burn draft cards which was extremely controversial and\nBitterly opposed by media and politicians but\nThey felt that that was not enough that after the draft card with birth everything went on a high as it had before\nNow were honest that break you had a question for Glenn about his film and about media coverage I force\nA you know I Apologize you and I communicated Brinkley about email or by email this morning and\nI don't we had my he let us know when your film is Dan and then have you on the shell thank you All right thank you for calling in and let's take another quick call before the break let's go to William and Belvedere Hi William\nYes thank you very much I I think that the gas made a mistake or when he said that um\nWhen the big march is the places they would hold that Nixon was watching a football games and that that was depressing um indeed people written biographies subsequently say that he was pulling out his hair\nOff from being upset about the enormous demonstrations so I think for me the lesson is when you want to do something to do it don't but don't be too dependent upon how the authority figures react\nThey of course they're going to say that what you should have no meaning\nBut if something's right to do it then do it\nThanks and you know I wanted to make a comment about that I I mean the public statement was he was watching a football game but you may be right in fact but one of the things that's come out recently we know that Lyndon Johnson was one of the most powerful presidents ever and he was really great domestically and really awful and Vietnam\nAnd in Nineteen sixty eight at the time when he was getting ready to announce that he wasn't going to run again there were five hundred and eighty five thousand troops\nIn Vietnam five hundred and eighty five thousand troops and then we learned two weeks ago from the great historian Michael Beschloss something we never knew before that Westmoreland not only wanted more troops we knew that but he secretly sent a memo to Johnson asking to move nuclear weapons into South Vietnam\nIt's just heartbreaking you know especially after eight years of a President Obama I heard something that Michael Moore said recently when he was ... showing his film you said you know where the bad situation now we have to figure out how to get out of it and right now it's all about the vote but then he said you know a lot of people got really ... you know embrace hope\nHope and he said you know as far as I'm concerned I Can't use a dirty word on T. V. but he said hope really sucks it's passive I went to the action\nWere not hoping for things we'd have to make it happen and I think that the similar our T between the war at home and Michael's recent film Fahrenheit eleven night is that they're both kind of fight back films we've got to fight back we got to do it not violently we can be militant leader violent\nBut we can't ever get involved with that kind of violence again at least as as from our side because it would just unleash or wherever repression and\nYou know it's I have to say it's refreshing talking to someone like you who is a long time reporter journalists filmmaker whose just say honest about what we're dealing last and I wonder as someone who is a long time channel after what do you think the role of journalism at today because I still get very frustrated with this so called manufactured balance\nAnd ... frame this story we're going to talk about an immigrant frame poverty and violence in a minute he's definitely finding that story\nWell I think I think the when Trump cut in and people were so shocked at first they were saying oh we're left with right now is the late night comics and the courts but\nPretty quickly at least the inside the beltway a core of investigative reporters started coming up with what's really going on\nAnd I think that's important it's not the kind of work I Do you know having sources that the state department or someplace else but I really feel like they have stepped up big time and we can be proud of what the fourth estate has done as far as investigating calling out following the Russia investigation to where it's going to go\nAs far as this sort of so called even handedness that's one of my really a arguments or that I feel even Ken Burns falls into that trap he feels he has to be overly cautious not to be like telling it like it is or you know and and that's just not my style I mean it's hard when I've worked at the networks successfully for Twenty years I loved it\nBecause the story was what came first they didn't think of it as a right wing story a left wing story it was just what's the story what's the facts let's tell it like it is if we hold people accountable and I've done that quite a few times\nYou know that's the role of journalism it's not to be the you know the PR group for one side or another and I feel empowered by that I Love my years there um\nBut I just think that we still have to keep our eye on the ball were not the enemy the state where the defenders of democracy\nAnd that's how it is called the first amendment thank you very much\n[noise] camera speaking with Glenn celebrating award winning filmmaker and longtime broadcast journalist who has worked for\nAn Academy Award for best feature documentary for El Salvador another Vietnam and the war at home which has a newly restored\nIt is opening across the country you can find information at your call radio dot org if you're in the bay area it's planet landmark upper plaza in San Francisco landmark ... in Berkeley and he'll be at tonight the screening that you'll be out isn't Assaf writes\nIt how about the ... and I was a seven Thirty years ago and then tomorrow I'll be there for the two twenty ... show and then I'll race across the bridge and go to Berkeley for the seven o'clock show with Daniel Ellsberg joining us onstage afterwards and then on Sunday at four pm or county field will be there helping me with the queuing it is\nAnd I just love coming here because I mentioned earlier we made the film or other ... San Francisco my troops some years ago and we just fell in love with the city and the whole spirit of the counter culture here is still I think that's still lives on\nYou know we want the culture war a long time ago starting in Nineteen sixty eight fifty years but you can draw the line from that sixty eight period and this is one of the things I like to talk about because I think it's missing in a narrative about resistance today\nWe young people built the political culture off the seat of our parents we don't always know what we're doing in the sixty eight late sixties early seventies and I think in a way we planted the seeds of resistance\nThat are happening today I don't know that you could have had the women's marches on that scale or come to that conclusion so quickly those massive massive largest had had we not had well we had in the late sixties early seventies\nI think even this amazing response by the from the tragedy in Parkland with the kids against gun violence you know I don't know that those high school kids would have even thought of this type of thing how do we not build that kind of political culture back in the sixties\nAnd of course the real legacy of the sixties is the women's movement and feminism and we're seeing how that's playing out now too so I think I'd like to have that conversation\nBecause that's why it's important for these teenagers in Parkland to see the word home is important for everyone not to get too depressed about the things were going on now because we've been in dark times dark political times before and so I'm really pumped up and I'm always ready to hit the barricades one way or the other\nI just feel toward home has a new role to play today\nIt's got an act too and I just hope people can make it down to the ... because that's where it has to start we're going old school they'll get to let people do the syllabus back\nOf course with a try our best to get back on college campuses I'm trying to set up a screening right now a free screening for Parkland, Florida students which will be fast it great yeah I'm On it but it's it's hard you know we don't have any funding we did a Kickstarter campaign we're out of money now and we're just doing it because it's the right thing to do\nLet's get another caller Ari on in San Francisco Hi Arianna blocking the show\nAnd taking my call I just want to say when we asked why do these war continue even though most of the Mac hurt them\nWe have to recognize that for us to have a change in our our Congress we need to change our own attitudes and I will have to give up our life how\nBecause most of these wars are based on hate ... courage and destroying culture that very vulnerable because we want the thing I Want and that and we get a\nFree pass to the Congress and we would be much healthier than create the culture in our culture where when I can keep on antidepressants\nIf he actually understood that product that is something that sharing and ... including lover people in Iran is talking about understanding instead of facing an actor I airliner a request economic disparity is a little bit Kay thank you\nOn thank you for that call today we're joined by Glenn silver who is an award winning filmmaker and long time at broadcast journalist\nHe's been twice nominated for an Academy Award for best feature for El Salvador another Vietnam and the war at home and you can find information about the newly restored the war at home and where it's plain across the country\nYour call radio dot O. R. G.\nNow I Would like to welcome center cuff to the show Sandra is a freelance journalist based in Central America where she covers environmental indigenous and human rights issues\nYou can read Sandra's daily dispatches on the plight of Latin American refugees for al Jazeera at your call radio dot org\nHi Sandra welcome to the show\nHi thanks for having me thank you so much for joining us\nIn the movement of thousands of people from Latin America has been getting wall to wall coverage in the United states and so much of it is made in reaction to what Donald Trump says on his anti immigrant remarks\nYou had been reporting from Mexico and Guatemala can you can just the latest what is currently happening on the ground\n[noise] sure so I'm just to clarify thousands and thousands of hunger and so there are a few other Central American but I'm very specifically hunger and so they started wearing their country mainly due to violence and unemployment or some due to political persecution but largely people's by poverty unemployment and violence\nSo they left around October twelve and crossed into Guatemala throughout um all end up into Mexico so since then you know other people have been fleeing every single day hundreds and hundreds of hunger and so leaving a lot of people have caught up to the first group um so that's why I'm now in ...\nAnd there's sort of an estimated maybe seven thousand people here and a growing\nSeven and there are other\nUm yeah at least there are also other groups still making their way up through Guatemala and there will be a big Salvadoran caravan probably heading up the under this\nMonth you said that they left on October twelve today is October twenty six so we're talking two weeks here can you just talk about you know the grueling trek from Honduras to Mexico I mean what are you hearing from people how are they doing especially\nPeople with children and with multiple family members\nThat there are a lot of children are a lot of large families are a lot of single mothers um a lot of youth are also some people and children with special needs and health conditions\nSo because this group is so giants I'm\nYou know with the smaller groups coming up sometimes easier for them to find say you know or ride for like a significant the fence on the back of a flatbed truck but when you have seven thousand plus people that's not quite so possible so people it's also extremely hot here so people are setting out walking\n'em at around three in the morning these days\nAnd they'll walk all day people will find rides when they can some people will get up later um there are people getting ride for the head of the group\nSo there is there's a giant you know group of thousands and thousands of people um sometimes it's sort of little waves throat a day and you know there's little groups maybe ahead or a bit behind but um it's a mixture of walking and ride but it's definitely a lot of walking and a lot of walking in the hot sun so um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Your Call", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "27", "locations": [["Madison Wisconsin", 43.07305, -89.40123], ["Vietnam", 16.16667, 107.83333], ["Florida",

latest Pacific Standard cover story is entitled death on the Dakota access it's an investigation into the deadly business a building oil\nAnd gas pipelines for the first time you has has compiled detailed fatality rates for those who actually build us oil and gas pipelines and her findings tell a very disturbing story about worker safety of the lack of industry regulation\nAnd the environmental destruction that has followed the oil and gas boom here in the United states she goes back to twenty sixteen or when oil and gas pipeline construction workers were dying on the job on average more than three and a half times more often than the average American worker\nSo why is that she writes about the new plan for us global fossil fuel dominance and she pairs those findings with the current Trump policy that requires expanding and even fast tracking new drilling and pipeline construction and at the same time\nDecreasing regulation and oversight\nOr you houses predicting that at this rate the United states is destined to increase the number of these workers on oil and gas pipeline construction who are either injured or who die on the job\nSo how's this industry regulated and who takes care of these workers to look into these issues we're joined in Studio by Antonio you ... and she's a long time oil and energy investigative journalist in fact and I don't think anybody knows more about this industry\nA than Antonio she's author of three books most recently\n[noise] ah the title black tied\nAnd um it deals with the devastating impact of the Gulf Oil spill so so good to have you back Antonio thanks so much for having me Renee agreed to be with you yes indeed and again uh you've dedicated your career to looking at but the oil and gas industry\nAnd before we get into um the most recent research that you've done or you did and black tie\nIn two thousand ten that explosion and fire killed eleven people on that platform in the Gulf of Mexico and you said that you went into a submarine and uh actually took a look at the environmental damage and so what did you learn from from that experience [noise]\nYeah so um [noise] the Deepwater Horizon disaster happened in two thousand and ten or the initial explosion happened in April two thousand and ten\nAnd that was and remains the worst offshore drilling I'm I'm a explosion in history the worst offshore drilling oil and gas incident in in world history the largest amount of oil spilled\nAnd it included the death of eleven workers on the rig\nAnd there were many lessons that I learned from that or an ongoing investigation and not only did I write the book black tied but continued to return again and again reporting for magazines like Rolling Stone and Harper's Magazine and the nation um to continue to return and see what continues to happen in the Gulf\nAnd the impacts on the families of those who lost loved ones and workers who are on the rig at the time of the\nUm disaster and on the environment and on the economies of the Gulf of Mexico\nAnd there wasn't a prohibition on shipping gasoline which we were also increasingly exporting out of the United states during that period as well so um\nThe reason for the increase in production really had to do it began under the Bush administration and it was a combination of the Bush administration relax\nAnd under what conditions or they could drill a combination of that and\nNew technology making fracking easier and more affordable for companies fracking fracking extract natural gas from there it's also oil so fracking is just a technique\nBy which you blast using a giant water and chemicals cannon you go underground you blast using this cannon\nUm you blast rock in which oil is found so whereas traditionally most oil is found and what is not exactly the kind of equivalent to driven underground reservoir of oil and used a ... pipe into it and I'm making is much more simple than it actually is and that oil comes out very fairly simply\nOil or natural gas that is trapped with in rock formations under the ground has to be released from those rock formations and fracking is a way of hydraulic the hydraulic\nFracturing of the rock so had rallied means water so you're laughing it with water and chemicals okay water and chemical Costco and that technology combined with the deregulation of the Bush administration as well as the desire of the Bush administration to really help oil and gas companies make more money\nUm is what led to the beginning of the boom boom was then carried on from administration to administration to administration\nIt's always so helpful to get oil and gas one on one of us [laughter]\nBecause you know we tend to once again just to go to the pump or turn on the the pilot light and just assume that it's going to be there but um there are consequences environmental and in terms of worker health and safety if you're just joining us Antonio you has\nIs here and we're talking today about her most recent research into literally the human cost of the oil and gas\nIndustry so I'm In may have twenty sixteen of the construction on the pipeline the\nDakota Access pipeline a began its about twelve hundred miles long how unusual is this particular construction project\nI'm so this is this is the largest pipeline ever to be built out of North Dakota um we have seen a boom in oil and gas pipeline construction that coincided with the oil and gas\nProduction boom and rapid increase in pipeline construction\nSo wrap it in fact and again this is similar to where we started with BP Deepwater Horizon disaster where again I said that the judge's final ruling in the case was very clear that BP had put saving time and money over safety I'm In and she wanted to\nSay yeah go ahead exact words were BP was I'm guilty of gross negligence and willful misconduct and ah so but there was no real consequence so\nI mean there were many ... there was a there was the largest um judgment against any oil company ever for environmental bused in the case of BP um it was I don't have these numbers memorized in my head anymore right now but around sixty billion dollar judgment but it gives you a sense of how big these companies are that that was a drop in the bucket for BP so BP is is\nPerfectly financially healthy today after facing what was the largest environmental judgment by any um US court against ah against an oil company\nSome lessons learned in terms of the consequences if companies who are doing the construction on these pipelines they figure they just kind of break that into their financial cake\nWell I mean I I I think that there were many lessons learned and the Obama administration for example started putting in place new regulations on offshore drilling which the Trump Administration eliminated the Obama administration started putting in place new regulations for occupational safety and Health Administration OSHA which overseas\nIn place energy regulations and environmental regulations um Fifteen hundred of which the Trump Administration has removed three hundred just in the energy sector alone so there were a lot of lessons learned\nUm and they've been on learned with under the new administration not to say the Obama administration did or anything close to everything that could and should have been done but it learned a lot\nStudied a lot and put in place many good ah reforms\nI Would say almost all of which have been eviscerated under this administration but\nWhat is very similar for the pipeline companies is this speed the necessity for speed and saving time and saving money at the expense of worker environment on community health and safety so since two thousand and ten\nOil and natural gas pipelines and pipelines carrying all hazardous materials which oil is a part mhm are significantly more likely to fail than pipelines built at any time in the last century\nIn other words the new or the pipe line in the United states the more dangerous it is the more likely it is to explode to rupture to um have an incident during its construction or once it's done to put someone in the hospital either community member or a worker and that's because of\nThe um lack of appropriate regulations lack of appropriate oversight and the companies just moving for speed ah and and saving money without being held to appropriate regulatory account\nAnd that is ah what happened with the Dakota access pipeline which where we started this discussion the ... this was it\nWas an extremely unique pipelines for many reasons but also\nNot that unique oil pipelines are getting built across the United states but this was the one that got attention which is why I was there and the first place which is why I happened to notice when Troy Dolan died while the pipeline was being constructed which is then what led me to investigate and open an entirely unfortunately entirely new area\nOf investigation looking into that they ... of oil and gas pipeline construction workers because they're the bureau of Labor Statistics publishes fatality rate data\nFor almost all industries that's where we get a tally rate data for industries in the United states they have only occasionally done so for oil and gas production and they have never ever done so for oil and gas pipeline construction so I did that work myself\nIt's extraordinary you would think it would almost seem to follow that lessons would have been learned and that the uh the dangers would be lessened not increased going forward if you're just joining us we're talking to an Tony ...\nAnd her about her latest Pacific Standard cover story it's called death on the Dakota access\nThis is the pipeline that hit all of the headlines um where Native American tribes attempted to stop the construction on this twelve hundred mile pipeline\nUnsuccessfully as recently as last week when construction workers um were forced to stop by an\nActivist who were trying to kayak up to the work sites and\nDangle from trees and make a platforms to just stop the clear cutting for this thing but it appears to be to to no avail or is there any\nUh help for the workers who are actually facing dangerous circumstances eight six six seven eight eight to five five is the number if you have questions were Antonio so\nAgain this describe this pipeline that carries about more than a half million barrels of oil a day but it originates where and it goes where and it ends up\nHe's of pipelines that begins in North Dakota and it starts in the upper\nA tip of the of of North Dakota\nTraveling across most of the state it originates their Stanley North Dakota travels across the state than cuts into South Dakota than Iowa than Illinois\nAnd that pipeline is called the Dakota access pipeline it connects in Illinois with another pipeline called energy transfer crude oil pipeline or at co\nWhich then carries that oil to Texas from Texas\nThat pipeline is now there's one leg that still being built and that's what you were just referencing and that's the bayou bridge pipeline so what the bayou bridge pipeline does is where\nThe Dakota access pipeline combined with ... which is combined called the Bach and pipeline\nCarries that oil from North Dakota Texas the reason for carrying that oil from North Dakota to Texas is to export it that's the reason why where's it going it's going wherever the company's wished to send it it's also being refined they're\nInto gasoline and other products but increasingly into petrochemical products that have to be what's called both oil but even more so natural gas um our crack\nComponents that are uh then become the inputs into plastics and making plastics it's a lot of this is about increasing the plastics market\nBut back to this pipeline so this pipeline goes to Texas and to export this is oil primarily to export it out out of the United states then the bayou bridge pipeline what you just referenced is just as extra leg that cuts across this beautiful by you system and Louisiana\nHe should have been there's no question that he should have been sent home based on the interviews with people who were present at the time but uh you know time is money and he was kept on the job and he also died on the job now these this um\nThis checkerboard of companies\nMeans there's also a very difficult to know\nIf there were other deaths that happened I don't know under construction of the Dakota access pipeline it's possible that there were but there isn't enough public publicly accessible information to know for certain I also only know about injuries on the job and only one of the states\nBecause that's because North Dakota is the only state that public he publicly makes available this worker injury\nData associated with a particular job site so I Know that there were eleven workers who were injured on the job but I don't know there's no way to know\nIf there were other injuries and the other states which it passes you think that's on purpose oh for sure for sure to make it much more difficult to know deaths and injuries and that's also been made more difficult under the Trump Administration which has limited\nAnd restricted publicly available and reported data on injuries and fatalities of workers so while I was in the course of writing this article the information that I needed\nWas in some ways of disappearing from these public Web sites because I'm\nThe data that needed to be made available was being limited that I needed was being limited by the Trump Administration but what I then found after I identified these to death\nI then found as I mentioned earlier\nThat the bureau of Labor Statistics has not been presenting fatality rate data for the industry the with their guidance\nAnd with their help and trying to mimic as close as possible the way that they create fatality rate data I used publicly available data bureau of Labor Statistics data to create my own fatality rate and I found that just like oil and gas production\nThe building of oil and natural gas pipelines is among one of the deadliest jobs in the country\nIn fact you found something like three point six times more deadly than the average American workers job\nThat's right in two thousand and sixteen um but ... but that these ... tally rate reached highs of seven times the national average twice since since two thousand and three which is when the bureau of Labor Statistics only began providing\nThe numbers of workers who have died while in this job sector and that that seven that they tell the rate of seven times the average American worker is consistent also for oil and gas production which is also it turns out into the deadliest jobs\nIn America so producing the oil and natural gas and building the pipeline to carry it are among the deadliest jobs are in the nation\nWere you surprised by that but it's not just the the offshore drilling which we you know pick your being out in the middle of the ocean and and subject to the elements and and all kinds of other dangers so to what extent were you surprised that the actual pipeline construction itself is is so deadly\nYeah I think both for the onshore production and the pipelines I was very surprised at how Heidi said tell the rates were particularly because you know even as someone who spends a lot of my time investigating\nThat go wrong in this industry we all still live with in this um\nYou know sort of general understanding created by the oil and gas industries that day because they are so wealthy because they are so advanced\nThat they are you know spending every available dollars that they can to make their work sites as safe as possible and of course that's what energy transfer partners said when we saw um input from them in ...\nScary dangerous work sites is what one finds out and they are extremely lacking inappropriate regulatory oversight in some cases almost no regulatory oversight at all\nAnd they are extremely dangerous for their workers and extremely dangerous for uh the communities through which they pass and to me that was\nVery very surprising isn't even as someone who spent so much time studying what goes wrong um and that these dangers have increased for a number of reasons um\n[noise] one being a well it might be too much to go into the time that we have it's increase for a number of reasons including um because of the Trump Administration and even for additional push of deregulation that's happened but problems existed even before the Trump Administration came in and so you were taking what was already a dangerous\nJob and just making it even more dangerous\nUm as a result of this in the new administration so one of the things that happened for example on the Dakota access pipeline\nIs that prior to Nicholas John and such as death\nThe um OSHA office the occupational safety and Health Administration office in North Dakota had not visited a single work site along the Dakota access pipeline\nThat at all at all you know entire six months of its construction prior to his death why they weren't responsible for the oversight or it was an oversight on their part or why wouldn't they have is that it not once\nSo what's what's odd about oil and natural gas is it even though this is one of the deadliest job sectors in the country and even though it's considered part of the mining sector by the federal government it's not regulated in the same ways that the mining sector is it is\nUnder lesser regulatory standards and it's considered a quote unquote low hazard industry so that it faces lesser regulation and things like coal mining or other types of mining of which which is technically apart instead it's under the OSHA act\nUm which doesn't require mandatory job site inspections and OSHA is a tragically underfunded agency so in the entire state of North Dakota there are only eight OSHA\nInspectors for every single job site in the entire state so whether that's a grocery store or a factory or an oil pipeline there's only eight inspectors\nWent out of I just find that shock I agree you were shocked to but I mean that just seems impossible and that's what the F. L. C. A. O. estimate is that it would take one hundred years for each job site in North Dakota to be visited just once\nIn a in one hundred years by OSHA and that's typical across the country so um you have not enough inspectors you also have\nAreas of oil and gas and because of oil industry lobbying are are\nUm exempt from a number of requirements of oversight and regulation and then you have on top of that the Trump Administration coming in and rolling back regulations that had been tried to be put in place by the Obama administration\nAnd you have a budget that for example right now for the entire OSHA budget it's what it was in two thousand and ten\nAnd basically since Nineteen Seventy one OSHA was created it hasn't been\nA significant hasn't seen its budget significantly increased anyway\nAnd then now that budget is under attack 'em by the Trump Administration as well as a hiring freeze and then retirements that happened with a lot of people wanting to leave when the Trump Administration came into office I'm with a decline in investigators a decline in managers across the board across the country well\nBoth the workers that you profile ... Dolan were represented they were members of the uh\nThe pipeline workers including about eleven hundred of the Dakota access pipeline workers so why is the uh construction so fatal and I'm ... who's looking out for these workers and making sure that they're being taken care of\n'em is what you describe is happening who's looking out for the workers\nYou know you bring up a really important point which is one of the reasons why these this job these work uh these jobs are so dangerous\nIs how low of union representation they have\nSo oil and gas production is almost entirely non unionized are almost no unions at all representing oil and gas production workers the pipelines are somewhat more unionized um estimates of the amount of hard to come by maybe thirty percent\nAnd that's because unions like the labor's and I'm like international lane of North America you know which you mentioned\nUm these are unions that represent workers in otherwise traditionally more unionized sectors like construction these are laborers and they are constructing a pipeline so essentially where oil and gas work\nOverlaps with other sectors you see you some unionization so for example refinery workers or maybe about fifty percent potentially I'm represented by unions because they overlap with the United steelworkers unions the pipeline workers are somewhat represented because they overlap with construction work\nI'm On these union job sites and I I research this state holidays are about half\nOf our oil and gas pipeline construction on union representative job sites the non union represented workers and so\nDakota Access pipeline and I didn't have the the capacity to look at all pipelines in the U. S. um may in fact be unique that there were only two deaths because it was a union job site there were union ah companies the these these workers are represented by unions\nUm and and the job sites for union job sites that said um the unions only have so much influence obviously in this day and age and their influence is being is is quite under attack\nSo that also means that what they are able to push for each day is limited because they have so many obstacles that they're trying to overcome and less influence obviously than they have had in the past", "show_name": "Your Call", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "22", "locations": [["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Istanbul", 41.01384, 28.94966], ["North and", 12.21286, -68.29445], ["South Korea", 36.5, 127.75], ["Cameroon", 6.0, 12.5], ["Afghanistan", 33.0, 66.0], ["Ireland", 53.0, -8.0], ["Britain", 41.66121, -72.77954], ["Zimbabwe", -19.0, 29.75], ["South Africa", -29.0, 24.0], ["Dakota", 46.80833, -100.78374], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["North Dakota", 46.80833, -100.78374], ["US", 45.99696, -118.49854], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Dakota", 46.80833, -100.78374], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Dakota North Dakota North Dakota", 46.80833, -100.78374], ["Stanley North Dakota South Dakota", 44.41232, -100.73594], ["Iowa", 42.00027, -93.50049], ["Illinois", 41.85003, -87.65005], ["Dakota", 46.80833, -100.78374], ["Illinois", 41.85003, -87.65005], ["Texas", 31.25044, -99.25061], ["Texas", 31.25044, -99.25061], ["North Dakota", 46.80833, -100.78374], ["Texas", 31.25044, -99.25061], ["North Dakota", 46.80833, -100.78374], ["Texas", 31.25044, -99.25061], ["Texas", 31.25044, -99.25061], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Louisiana", 30.12595, -92.00939], ["North Dakota", 46.80833, -100.78374], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["North Dakota", 46.80833, -100.78374], ["Dakota North Dakota North Dakota", 46.80833, -100.78374], ["Dakota", 46.80833, -100.78374], ["the U.

G.\nAnd joining us today to talk about the festival our two guests and palm quest directed the documentary from Baghdad to the bay and it's her first feature length documentary she's also a producer and director of photography for the documentary short series Oakland originals and air and joined us in Studio\n... thank you for coming in and congratulations on the film Hi rose thanks so much for having me it's a pleasure to be here thank you\nWere also joined by ... by telling on executive director of the Arab some festival and the Arabs film and media Institute\nThe festival began back in Nineteen Ninety six and it's the longest running and largest showcase of Arabs films and filmmakers in the U.S Sarah was born and raised in Beirut before moving to the United states and he also joins us in Studio ... thank you for coming in ... great to have both of you\nLet's talk a little bit just generally about the Arab film festival\nAnd on your website a number of the founders say that you found that the media Institute the film and media Institute to fight bigotry and hate with powerful art and storytelling that fosters empathy and understanding of our common humanity and to also support Arab talent in the United states can you talk about that\n[noise] sure I mean I think there's a such a lack of um Arab voices and their representation in American culture American mass media and so are you from where I was really launched me would have been running the film festival for about point Twenty years\nUm but we wanted to go beyond just sort of the exhibition of films\nDuring server to undo or two week period and also develop young and new um storytellers within our communities to serve share their stories and and to serve portray their lives and\nAnd be sort of a be able to chose the stereotypes to use ... Americans or Muslim Americans on on the screen\nAnd I mean obviously so much happened after nine eleven and now so much more is happening under the Trump Administration when it comes to\nJust blatant racism and then that ugly stereotypes that you hear from this administration and they get repeated in the media what would you say concerns you most right now\nI'm going to be Frank I'm you know I'm I'm not a fan of either of the political parties or do stuff which means you know such racism towards your community and the Muslim community has been or mhm um\n[noise] [noise] just\nJust the quality just the quality across the board I mean I'm just saying that we have three submissions to the twenty Nineteen Academy Awards that's ... that's that's a hybrid or just that\nUm but it's the ... it really is I Can't stress that enough because one thing to watch a film that has a great story line good characters um but if it if it's visually pleasing if there's issues would sound or music or but to see just complete films films that\nYou know Hollywood should be screening Netflix should be picking up um TV stations should be\nShowcasing and they're they're they're not\nI think that's that's sort of our next challenge to to to take on\n... I Know it's a difficult process that lie I may\nYou know there's the you know we can always refer to ... and his work around um Arab representation in Hollywood particularly but I Do the more that we work especially with a firm I we are working with the industry more and more you know we launched last year but we're already sort of developing partnerships with\nA net flicks and some independent and organizations like that and I've been astonished to see that it's less there is\nIt would be wrong for me to say that there isn't racism and industry and but that's not it's not it really also comes down to just awareness\nUm you know I still get approached by people who work in the industry who want me to support sort of like films from Iran or turkey or Israel and sort of\nA ... kind of I have to take a step back and be like okay so we were still in that phase of all let him know what the Arab world is who you know Lebanon or Jordan and just certain demands and content that's coming out some I'm hoping that\nSo we'll see more ... or content on on the string Aaron and I would I Would also add to that that until we have more diversity and the decision makers that these um organizations companies um that's not going to change I'm fortunately because those are perspectives that are going to make that a that would change possible\nCivil would it take to try to get Netflix to carry from Baghdad to the bay\nI Wish I had an answer to that question I don't know if there's another word for it and said I Do but um it's\nYou know the one thing that I've heard recently and it's been a very interesting and making a film over the course of ten years because\nFor many years especially being a new film maker I Would hear okay finish the phone first and then we'll be there for to support you if if it's something we can get on board with and then we finished the film now and I'm hearing sorry acquisitions are dead [laughter] we want to get first and [laughter] so\nSo the market kind of shift it's very fickle it's really hard to keep up with and\nAnd that currently I as far as I Know I'm Netflix is doing mostly carrot contest these days with some high levels elections that may be coming out of the top festivals maybe just Sundance was point but these are just the rumors I've been hearing I'm not\nTotally clear Aaron ... directed the documentary from Baghdad to debate as her first feature length documentary and you can find show times at Arabs Film Institute dot O. R. G. Serge ... is executive director of the Arab some festival in the Arab film and media Institute\nAnd it runs through October twenty first again the website is Arab Film Institute dot O. R. G. and if you have any questions or comments for our guests\nIf you have seen any of the films of the Arab film festival either ... this year past years what really stood out for you and what are your thoughts about where we are right now we will talk about media stereotypes\nThroughout the show but here's one stat ... his search just talked about analyzed one thousand films that have Arab and Muslim characters one thousand\nAnd found only twelve positive depictions fifty two neutral nine hundred and thirty six negative portrayals of Arabs\nNine hundred and thirty six negative for trails out of one thousand films\nSo what stands out for you when you see films with Arabs and them\nAnd if you're a filmmaker what are your thoughts on these issues the toll free number is eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five five eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five and if you are Arab what do you think about the way that you are presented on the screen\nAaron what are your thoughts about that I mean that's that's the stats are amazing\nAnd then another one between two thousand two and twenty Thirteen only one point eight percent of directors whose film screen at the Sundance Film festival where Middle Eastern Arab American filmmakers are so underrepresented to often not even worth their own category and industry diversity reports\n[noise] ah well I had an interesting conversation with somebody recently that inspired the way I'm going to answer this and I think that um well it may sound shocking to many people for people of color and certainly women as well and the industry it's not surprising how this has been going on you know since the beginning [laughter] so um\nI did see some of these similar to statistics recently put up I'm against women and saw him as well and it is fascinating and really the big take away and the drive for change that has been recommended by many people who are doing this research is that people\nUm that that the decision makers need to me more representative so that's kind of the take away that I have from that and the hope that I have is that um this is coming to light and people are talking about this more and more and that's the the catalyst for change\nAnd surge we have a question from Jerry ... who says\nWell both right directed by women and when I read the program it stated that forty percent of the films are directed by women this is an impressive percentage how difficult was it to put together a festival that has a higher percentage of film directed by women than we are accustomed to\n[noise] well thank you Jerry for attendance festival a nut and difficult at all um\nWe Jones and I say this over and over again you know we we definitely are proud of the forty percent or we want it to make sure it's higher but it's not something that we go into programming meeting a decision say let's make sure we have a you know at least half\nOf our films directed by what it just happens that women in the Arab world and outside of the Arab world ... working on their content are making brilliant films so it's not again it's not a [noise]\nYou know I always I'm proud of that number ... ... I Would say it's still a bit low um but it's not something that we go into and say this is what we want to do it just happens at the films or or just excellent films\nYou didn't need to go digging through binders as women [laughter] you know and and and\nOn the ground in the Arab world and this is something that you know with the way Arab and ... women are portrayed on camera\nIn shows and movies and you have this representations herb women are somehow submissive and uh you know the I have no voice of their own and yet when you not not just with the filmmakers but when you see the change makers on the ground\nIn the west bank and Gaza in across the Arab world oftentimes it's led by women in Tunisia you know when you were just speaking about the Arab Spring and its uh you're you're not seeing those women on\nI'm On the news for example ...\nAnd ... it was just wonderful that in the when it comes to the filmmaking space that women have really exert themselves in it and and rightfully so\n[noise] you know you just reminded me of all the gothic killings and I I've been wanting to do a show about this just because so much is happening\nAnd you know we're guilty and we'd barely even touched on it and because it happened we did have I think we can if media roundtable on it and then we just haven't revisited it and we really need to what what'd you say what kinds of sounds are coming out right now of the west bank and Gaza\nAre Palestinian futures are ... very political but we also have a film like reports on certain selenium that's a that's a love primarily love story with sort of the political tension as as a backdrop so I Love films like that as well that sort of a it's a story that\nAnyone in the world can sort of relate to or touch on and just happens there there is sort of a political context to it\nAnd what about the political film [noise]\nYou know we definitely have you know film like ... from under the rubble I'm sort of touching on certain laws the atrocities that happened and are happening this as a [noise] um\nWe have a nine eleven the uprising that believes showing again this weekend in Oakland so\nI'd have to ... I Know the festival has had to deal with protests and things in the past ... have have has anything like that happened this year\nThis year I mean we've definitely I'm not [noise] not may be too big but we've definitely had some conflicts with you know I've definitely show more um\n[noise] how'd you do content since I've come on which um with with some of our funders hasn't talking about a ... you know we've also shown films that sort of well I'll say this one of the wonderful things but when I say about experimentation and our ... filmmakers I'm\nOne of the things is ...\nIn in New ways it was with new ones with with approaching a using storytelling very creatively and it's it's not always you know folks worse or the very linear documentary about occupation\nA political uh um office to Iraq at the time\nAnd you also have a few of us retired army colonel in the film at that basically saying that guy's ones saved their lives and saved many American lives because of his translations skills and he was so dedicated to what he was dealing yeah I think you know I I Want a trail off\nJust a little bit on this because something about goes on as always had an impact on me is that he is this kind of very unique cultural liaison so in every community that he exists and he's always an outsider on some level and yet at the same time\nBecause of his kind of gregarious outgoing personality he's not only able to kind of find a sense of belonging and each of these communities but also kind of um breakdown any kind of walls that people may have or or or just to kind of um\nDisarm them in a way that allows them to see perspective as you know change their perspective is about community is that they may not interface with normally\nIn the film ... says I gave my soul to them speaking about the U.S military ... can you talk about I mean I guess because one could answer this better and maybe we can have him on in the future if you're listening\nYou're listening later after work did the climate of suspicion that let the military to suspect him as being a spy after they credited him with saving so many lives what was that about\nWell you know instead of an answering for goes on and I was not there at the time and we've done the best we can and to do research we've we did submit freedom of information um acts\nAnd through a a a few lawyers that we're working with us we got some documents back so we feel confident in the story that we're telling also and the people that are presented in the film and their versions of the story\nBut I don't think we're ever going to know exactly why\nIt goes one was arrested we could not get those documents and what I think when my my opinion would be that he really was caught up in the pinot paranoia of the time I I Would imagine I suspect that racism was a part of it\nUm but the one thing that I think it's important to acknowledge is that he was not alone in us and I read an article a couple of weeks back about a father who still looking for his son who has a very similar story took us one who\nMay have been cited recently and could potentially still be alive and in detention so I don't think this is a one story I think this has happened to many people and how was it not for the um height at which I'm a colonel Nicholson sat\nI'm not sure that goes one would have been released so I think that the system is incredibly disorganized at the same time as being highly organized in a really dysfunctional way um and and you know calls to what's happening with the children these days as well\nAnd and the documentary from back that to the bad guys one el Sharif says that the military police took him they put him in handcuffs and a three foot square cell he was not allowed to talk in front of other Iraqi detainees he said the U.S accused him of being a spy a double agent a traitor and a terrorist and and the film\nHere is ... al Sharif describing what happened next [noise]\nThey put me in\nThe room or\nSee around me feeling [noise]\n\nAnd I'm not a lot\nJust signing\n... I Know it's a long time until your body like new muscles\nEverything you can feel the more\nI was blindfolded and there were and they don't have all kinds of things coming on me\nThey asked me was that was\nDone\n\nThey move me from the jail to another place where there were this time for people and they are not military there are civilians [noise] ... happen over there they haven't\nSo far all over again this time it was the bags on top of your head\nThey drew water on top of me so I feel I'm drawing\nYou're hiding something I Know you hiding something you know you need to tell them even to telling me every day every day every day and I was like why don't you guys believe me this is my story I have nothing to tell you you know my body was hired a wall was tortured and then one day he pushed me to a level I\nI'm gay [noise]\nThat was my first time ever I didn't have that chance previously ...\nTo keep it inside of in gun slung\nChange to Hawaii\nThat is a clip from Baghdad to the bad guys on al Sharif who worked as a translator for the U.S military and then he was falsely accused of being a spy he was arrested tortured in prison for Seventy five days\nI mean that is that was so amazing Erin Erin punk quest is director of the film is the first time he ever said he's gay is when he's\nBeing tortured in jail by the United states [noise]\nYeah you know and when he actually this was one of the last interviews that we did with him where this came out a\nAnd I think in having this memory we talked a lot about who goes on is today and in many ways um it sounds strange to say but he's thankful for this experience that he had because\nHe would describe himself before if anybody knows cars on they'll think this is very unusual but if he would describe himself before\nComing here before what happened to Iraq as being very Meek and timid and doing whatever his family would want for him to do and if you met him today you would see a very very different person and so this open the door for God's one too\nI guess you know honor the strength that he had to be able to survive that and in doing so really believe that he could do anything\n[noise] surge what really struck you about this film from Baghdad to the bay I mean there's so many layers to it\n[noise] I'm into personal story you know in the context of not just the war the occupation in Iraq\nHis sexuality um it's his story it's a very personal story than again not the deliver the point you're not seeing stories like this or anywhere else and if it's not for air and it's not for or filmmakers from your you won't see so\nI I'd like to also add that the really interesting thing about because he is not um\nTypical person he's quite unusual person in wondrous ways and\nThe incredible thing about that and his story is that as I was mentioning before he was often an outsider in these communities that he exits and so this film and his life intersects with\nUm communities that don't generally come together or might not typically come together um so it's really this amazing meeting ground for conversation to be had\nAcross the algae beauty community the Arab community immigrant community even the military community and then for people who who are\nIn other communities coming to the conversation they may be challenged by any number of 'em and misunderstandings or a stigmatization stigmas that they might cast on any any of these different communities so it's really kind of a an\nAn incredible convergence of um topics especially with everything that's happening today\nIt it kind of I mean it brought up so many emotions including some anger because\nThis is one story of of so many and you think about all the lives that have been lost not only in Iraq Afghanistan Syria young men right now\nAnd you know here we get I mean there's good journalism that's happening but in passing you hear about the bombing and then it's the the move on and then two days later there's another bombing but all of these lives obviously have a story I mean it sounds so silly to even have to say that\nBut we just had the surgery\nHaving shot there's a face to it yeah I think that's where so incredibly incredibly powerful because you see the ...\nUm you see him ... there was a visual there you know when we think of as many of the atrocities of happened in Gaza for decades and it was until you know unfortunately as heartbreaking as was to seeing a child on the beach the provoke anger so um [noise]\nTo be able to see the hugging the visual is again the hope is bill ... or something and and people to start challenging I'm not just the journals but the politicians the the actions we take the way we vote everything right into\nThe difficult thing is for us in

A.\nRetested Jones is co artistic director of the San Francisco based performance company cultural odyssey which is celebrating its forty if here and she directs them adapt project a performance workshop committed to incarcerated women's social and personal transformation\nAnd ... joins us in Studio ... thank you so much for coming in good morning thank you for having ... amazing about your work is you have been doing me too deep deep work for decades\nYes don't going so far you know I just want to share a personal story when I first moved here and I think it was Ninety five I saw one of them adapt projects performances at the year but when a Center for the arts it completely changed me\nCandlelight you must have seen candlelight yes it\nWould say you have you but you bring women who are incarcerated onstage to tell their own stories and I'll never forget looking at the prison guards who were in front of the stage and they told the audience please leave right up after the performance and so these women can have a little bit of time with their families\nYes and uh God Bless 'em my Tennessee who was the chef at that point you know and uh we had great conversations he and I and I would just be I Would I Would get an idea in the shower I tell people them with their project kind of came to me in the shower\nAnd I said I'm going to go down and talk to the sheriff and he was very open about art and he really understood and believed that art cars save lives and so he I I Would tell him what I wanted to do and he's a ... ... okay well you know he said well how can we do it and I said well you know because that was there were also deputies\nThat we're really interested in the process because I was out of San Bruno for a long time and they were just going to come by and watch the process of people crying you know in the ... the beach you know [laughter] you know you know you've got to come with the real you tell the truth and shame the devil yeah\nWhat are your thoughts about this moment we're in right now given all of the work that you have done I sometimes wonder about people like you when you go to bed at night and you think about where we're at an all the work you've done how are you making sense of this well\nI watch new I watch all the news on television and of course it gets to be repetitive and it's not always you know pick up people will criticized social media but I feel like\nThe the larger news of a a productions on television either all talking about the same thing and they're not talking about things that we are you know we know about this as activists and as artists\nAnd at the same time I can't look away and so then I'll I'll use it kind of a drift off to sleep and then I have to watch some comedy after watch David Chapelle I Love David spell and that's how I kind of get off to sleep but I it's we're in a freefall where the freefall and\n[noise] ... and ... the ... story is that these women sharing the prisons are sell heavy talking about the seven year olds who wanted to protect her newborn sister from their grandfather and this is just one story can you can you also talk about\nWhat happens to us society like ours that that tries not to go there that you're you're pressured under the rug as a society\n[noise] because when we heard from these women talking about the teacher the boyfriend partner or whoever it was that assaulted them it's almost like it's in on the surface yeah and we we tend not to really go deep into that trauma in this country\nAnd we and what we will realize eventually is that we're only we only encouraging people to bring half of themselves you know uh to do as we're talking about the the freefall\nWhat's gonna happen in twenty Thirty years you know what's gonna happen politically if people are holding on to these horrible memories and all but I don't think it's going to I think that the doors open up being in South Africa you know I work in South Africa and um\n[noise] I met a young woman who was when I met her she was like Fifteen\nAnd uh she had already been in prison for three or four years\nAnd she and her brother this is ... she and her brother had found out from their younger cousin\nThat this doctor who was a veil well known in their particular community was assaulting this nine year old girl and she told everybody nobody would listen this girl and she had a brother were twins it's very mythical he was also in in jail you know\nWhich they had dug a hole\nThey really really they actually pushed him into the hole and set it on fire\n[laughter] and and she said well nobody else was doing anything and he shouldn't even be allowed to live and walk around and I'm looking at our babies these are our cubs you know and ah she said well nobody was doing anything\nAnd still they had to do time but she said but at least he won't be out they're hurting other kids you know and it's like\nOkay ... what what you warned about is don't judge me you know we have lived too long\nWith everybody holding onto these horrible secret and really they're not secrets right like you're describing people calling in to your show and that's what we've got to realize they're not secretly\nAnd I just want to acknowledge Laura winter is our producer just wrote me and said several men called end but most of them are not even able to speak\nYeah\nAnd you know the shows are so intense that I kind of forgot to even talk about that because it it was just so intense these stories but we were so I guess grateful that we can have this place that space where people feel comfortable to call in and share their stories\nBut you know for an also for guys males and this is something\nI'm Still working on with young women who uh Rome shakers get paid bling\nAnd I say you know do you really think about the guy you\nKnow because he has to play style which is a play the man he has to be a even a ... a bit larger than life so that gives him the right to punch you to get you to abuse you at the same time\nWhat do we bring to a relationship when it's really about pay my phone bill buy me a car you know and and and and guys have been taught\nThat if they can they do you know and you think about the men who couldn't even talk about the shame so intense because they can't even talk about being insulted 'cause it's too much like ... ... excuse my French but uh they treat you like to pitch\nAnd what does that mean for me you know it's like they treat you like a woman you know so that's why you can't is that what we're talking about you know but I really believe that bitch dance for being in total control of herself\nThat's what I that's what I Believe you know yeah I Know and I'm trying to do that I don't work as much of young men anymore but when I Do\nOne of my main questions for them as the do you want to live with do you want to die because they don't know they don't do any more that you fall fall\nAnd then don't forget the police riding up in there and you know they're scared you know and also they have the guns they're an organized legalized game you know so they and the wars on you know even if a boy runs away or a man runs away it's on you know\nToday we're speaking with her death at Johns co artistic director of the San Francisco based performance company cultural odyssey they're celebrating their forty F here she also directs them a dam project a performance workshop committed to incarcerated women's\nSocial and personal transformation and ... says latest piece is called when did your hands become a weapon\nAnd it's a project that she created with him adapt project and the women's HIV center at UC SF it explores the trauma and realities of domestic violence and sexual assault and it offers a pathway to healing and also to prevent further trauma\nIf you're in the bay area you can see when did your hands become a weapon from October ... to November fourth at the ... theater in San Francisco and if you'd like to join us you know if you'd like to talk about the time that we're in what you're thinking about right now if\nSeven nine eight eight to five five if you've seen where does this work and want to talk about just how powerful it is to see these women share their stories onstage weak lead lead left to hear from you you can also email your call at K. A. L. W. dot O. R. G.\n[noise] ... ... talk about the process involved of these women sharing their stories with complete strangers putting it all out there how does it affect them\nBecause you know I I'm I've senior stuff for years and you have some at the same women working with him how they've been on how have they been affected by that process\nAt first I think it would I realize happens is\nThat when we speak myself 'cause I I anybody to ask me how do you do it you've got to be willing to put your stuff on the table\nYou you can't play teacher director and sit back you've got that's how you lay a path\nYou talk about where you've been and I see that now that my company my company what they're probably just a Thirty Years' older so many people in the group they know that it's about a spring bringing our stuff out and then the prisoner the uh women living with HIV um the ex offenders\nThey realize that there is that there is a voice to be found and I do a lot of theater games you know just the warming up the voice moving around opening the body you know our jumping rolling teaching women how to get mad\nGet mad but what does that look like we used to have a ... we used to have a a ... um the no of course it was all little girls and it was just them how can you say no and I remember my\nParents and grandparents coming in and being freaked out why are you telling them about this stuff I said trust me they already know they just don't know what to do and so your question it's it's a theatrical process but it's also the first thing that I found happens if I start to speak my own truth is that\nIt gives women a platform to to voice their concerns you know and we and the other night\nInside one of the women who are who say Chevy positive but you just been through it she was talking about I'm\nJust you know being a junkie on the street and I saw the women's side\nThey start to look at her and look at us differently like well this is real you know because they realize this woman was telling tales that they already knew and ... and she Deborah she gets to expound\nAnd share and teach so as you're back to your question I think it makes everybody a bit a bit stronger and a bit more focused as to what you can do with your life\nAs a just a wise woman I mean if if we can be all activists wonderful but it's like back to my little neighbor\nI mean it's my I Am an elder I Am as as a I think Maya Angelou said you know\nI Am the mother to all bringing them all to me and that's kind of large but I Love that it's like I Love the vets where I Am now you know I mean I feel like the kids just love the little bit but I sure like to sit around and make a good cake and drink some tea or some wine and\nPass this jealous of truth around and everybody gets to even feel it or sick from it yeah\n[laughter] [noise] retested Jones is co artistic director of San Francisco based performance company cultural odyssey\nAnd if you're in the bay area I Hope you get a chance to see her newest performance when did your hands become a weapon and explores the trauma and realities of domestic violence and sexual assault and also offers a pathway to healing and really focuses on what it will take to prevent further\nAt the ... theater in San Francisco and if you're not in the bay area we have a lot of listeners who are outside of the area if you go online you can search for a desperate Jones and watch some of these incredible performances a number of the pieces\nInvolved with them and DAMP Project are online if you just search for a death and Jones find more information at your call radio dot org we'll be back after this\nIt isn't enough that some even side of the cat call out of a car but if you grab me you throw me down you know the trauma that comes with that you know it's a it's a and and I kept\nHearing all the stories and I thought how do I bring this to the forefront again because I'm limited probably has always talked about domestic violence and it it gets kind of scary because it's just part you know for women and jailed but when I when I have to jump up and down and ran and say you know but it's not okay\nIt's not okay to be handled to be mishandled to be misused and it's like we have to find ways to push back\nAnd it became exercises um when I was in South Africa year or two years ago um I talk to the women there about um about violence domestic violence\nAnd that was a woman who was Hindu who was in one of my workshops and she eventually it was in the performance because we make a big performance in the prisons in South Africa\nBut she told I I Do prompts as well I'll give a ... like love they'll love nobody right about it and this woman who wrote about\nHer uh her husband losing his job and then leaving\nAnd she and her three children were like really homeless they had no no for food no money\nThe man shows up and decides that he loves her and he wants to take care of her and he and he says your children will never be hungry\nWith me so she goes home with him [noise] and at first she said it was okay but he kind of\nGradually turned into the devil you know it was like everybody was too comfortable everybody was it she says that she noticed that he started to slap her around in the kitchen and she's feeding her children\nUh she's saying the children just eat eat eat eat and then he started to illegally rape her an assault or in the kitchen in front of her children you know I'm a trauma\nAnd she says she's on she says I'm screaming eat eat don't look eat and uh you know and this is the power of women though and she says one night\nWhen she couldn't take it anymore she ran into the bedroom where she was she slept with this man she said that I went to the pillow we always kept a loaded pistol and she said I threw it at him\nAnd went off into bullets hit him and he died two days later\nAnd she said to the audience ladies and gentleman that is why I Am in prison and the the therapist at a natural Rena prison they gave it to me and they said okay we need so your nose me I said there really are no notes other than that I told her to be right about love don't love nobody\nAnd the atmosphere was such that she trusted and our children were there they were there to bear witness to their mother's story and I was and I felt\nI felt like such a part of it and that all of a sudden\nThey are it is not just did this this dark secret of a terrible mother it was like they got to see their mother live it again and they lifted again and ah they were standing in the back of the theater at the end of the evening\nTears you know and what they were thinking you mean they were thinking the other women for helping their mother given their mother a I'm a platform and which to tell the story they lived it wow\nHow much time to this woman get in jail\n[noise] ah she was doing a seven to ten wow yeah for\nFor murder and you reminded me there's a documentary called sin by silence and it's about women in California who are in jail for murder and are trying to murder they're abusive partners and these women are\nMost of them are over sixty a lot of them look like your next door grandma yeah yeah I mean this is well you know we'd only across the country but that particular talk is about California well you know the culture back to um you know\nI'm ... ... women are voting for Kavanaugh back to women loving Trump or\nIs just a piece of it but it's like how dare you as a bad girl and how dare you act out being a bad girl you know oh and I'm fighting back\nI grew up in the house and my dad was my dad was my hero and he loved to me but I remember I got to a couple of fights with my brother's over real stuff and my father was so done with me\nHe said what are you trying to do you know you're you're you're a girl you're not supposed to be fighting your brothers and he said you know don't be so hard at it I had a one woman show and title big but girls harder that women my father used to say to me go such a big butt down don't be so hard at it\nAnd it was like this whole thing of like he flipped on me it was like no no you cross the line and that's where these women are dealing with they cross the line you know it's like you did what you fought back it's insane we're back to South Africa\nThey got time taken off their sentences for completing my project wow yes that's different because it's already said that her these stories then that hurts them you know and it was wonderful to be like in a situation where the women were going to you know sometimes a bunch of the year\nYou know it gets us because you finished this project which they saw as difficult the authorities saw it as being\nBut they love the idea of this American you know coming in and saying this is what we've got to do we're going to like open up and we got to share with the community with our families without children why we're in prison and and what that would tell there's a lot of things and we'll do a lot of things yeah have\nYou ever proposed that tell authorities and the U.S [noise]\nNo I ... you know as we're talking about it but you know uh even that at the jails and lord knows I'm grateful that I get to come in with my crew but this law and order time and yeah\nIt's law and order time and they put in and I don't know where when the decrees coming from but it is not what it was it not this is this a environment and that it was\nYou know we do a lot of shows about ... spent a lot of time with women and presidents have you noticed any changes in the last couple of decades in terms of how they're treated the kind of food they eat that relationships with the guards I mean I'm sure things probably change when you leave ... but have you seen any changes\nI well I tell you the change that's most abrupt some strange that they're getting some ... they're getting much younger oh\nYeah uh and um I think that's back to South Africa the wardens as they're called\nThey came to me and said we want to do this we want you to help us to tell our stories because they had to live on the prison grounds they were dealing with abuse and violence but there was like this was their take on that versus here in our country\nI think that uh we're still you're locked down and you're you are like um [noise] a guilty until\nAnd we don't know how we don't know how to embrace a different kind of reform now that people in and out of the system yeah but overall\nThere's like a right now I'm dealing with um a reentry program where culture as he's been funded but as a part of the jail thing here but it's about where these women gonna go holiday how are you preparing them to to embrace the workforce\nAnd that same time I'm saying I can do so much but that they've got to have medical psychiatric\nAttention you know to deal with trauma to deal with addiction you know all these things have to be um [noise] have to be in place and we're not ready to hear that or\nYou know we we're you know this is how do you say it you you get yours like I got mine you know you get a buffer you need to stop whining and complaining and it's the American away right\nAnd and the ... you might have a bus ticket to get out of here and the middle of the night the than the jails\nA women leave oh they put they release women at four in the morning before in the morning why and I have talked to women whose they know where the bathrooms are in the mission in the service stations where they can sleep until morning if they get that far not been working with trans women\nAnd they are like you know they'll get busted in the summer with the summer dress since flip flops on for prostitution or whatever and then they're they dropped in the middle of the ... early morning middle of the night and they left out in front of the jails with no money no where to go because their families have already\nIf they're out the lousy their families and not before them and one a young woman was telling me a trans woman was saying well I was standing out in front of the jails and uh and I had to do with that\nAnd uh she said and I went down on my knees and I was crying and this man looked at me and he said what's wrong and she said\nI just got out of jail and I'm going to and I got I'm gonna start doing this and to do this I've got to get back on methamphetamine I've got to and he gave her twenty five dollars and he said and just take care of yourself just said you know it's okay [noise]\nYou know it's okay it's a it because you don't think like that about who this is you know what this is an animal you know that you can you buy a yeah but he ... he just like what she said he was like but it's still too much later she's back in jail anyways\nBecause just finding a place to live you know trying to get back to the life that you had before you came in and um [noise]\nI I'm just amazed that are in our country the least trans people have a larger platform and they're seeing now one young woman in in um that I met at the at the city jail she's saying Clinton she's a trans woman and they soon as the saying Clintons three years go
