San travels\nA\nLot on that\nOh in\nThe world song ensemble performing for us this afternoon live in the KLW studios ... is a music director what are we just hear about the well thank\nYou for having us ah we just heard standing that river this is a song by our friend Morris smiley singer and songwriter from Vermont and um it's an English we don't have to say an awful lot about it except that it's there are many iterations of it on some of her recordings and\nOther places we're going to move on to Argentina for a second song to sing told us ... which was popularized by Mercedes Sosa\nUm [noise] it's a ... person who yet she's already semi and it translates into such a gorgeous poetry I go for a walk\nBy the cosmic waste of the south I feel all the skin of America on my skin a river runs in my blood\nAll the voices all the hand thing with me free or hope with a shout\nSo before we have you launch into your second song that see I Want you to tell us a little about world song or this ensemble is a spinoff from the world harmony chorus which is a much larger ensemble\nYes so world harmony chorus was started by Daniel Steinberg in Nineteen Ninety nine he\nRan two branches of it one in Mountain View in one in the East Bay and has since started a third branch in Santa Cruz and hired me to direct the branch in Oakland so it's a marvelous community chorus that works with arrangements most of which\nHave either been enhanced by him or written by him and he's one of the foremost rangers about Apollo world music internationally\nSo we as a community chorus welcome singers of all levels it's um people can join now they just can Google world how many chorus and they can find one of the rehearsal\nLocations that's closest to them in the bay area\nWell so you have a lot of branches of the world harmony chorus route the bay area you must have probably a hundred members in the chorus by now\nProbably Oakland probably has thirty five forty singers Mountain Dew has about sixty Santa Cruz ... smaller mhm\n[noise] now I remember we had the world harmony chorus here in the L. W. studios I'm probably over ten years ago and I think this was before my time and I remember there were over thirty fingers came in so our space wasn't large enough to accommodate them so we took them across the hallway into the classroom and\nAh I remember it worked out surprisingly because a classroom usually has great acoustics [laughter]\nSo that's a you're still involved with the world harmony chorus and you were saying you direct or the classes in the East Bay and Daniel have classes in the south bay in Santa Cruz yes so I'm In the world harmony courses a community chorus and that means anybody can\nShow up like you know can we reverse Tuesday nights seven o'clock to nine and people just show up if they have a little Carl experience\nThey can join any time of the year if they're ranked beginners we like to join in September so they can progress slowly and we were first weekly and then after about four months we perform\nYeah\nSo world saw an officially started a few years ago as a subset of the world harmony for it did and it's an audition sub wasn't audition subset of world comedy chorus and is just recently separated from World harmony chorus and a has just christened itself\nWorld song it's your name and this will be our\nFirst public performance as this ... oh congratulations haven't sold the seniors who are part of world song are veterans are there more experience yes great [noise] okay well I'd like to have you I think that's another song\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nI'm so busy I Want to circle back to my question about the difference between the world harmony chorus and world song and you can correct me if I'm wrong I'm it it seems like the emphasis of the world harmony chorus is on spiritual and religious songs\n... and gospel and shake no sorry actually I'm both courses actually do very little religious material what we really aim for in our search for music is what makes for an interesting arrangements for an ...\nKaur is what will sound good in four parts but one of the big differences with\nWorld song is that it's in our cat so they're working in what you're what you're hearing today is that there were were working with a smaller number of voices so they are um [noise] more experience with working on the land which is what happens in a smaller I'm from ... in a larger community chorus\nBut I Would say the material that we've seen is very similar between the large ... how many cars and the smaller I check up world song I see so there is a lot of overlap a lot of overlap yes [noise] All right well let's continue with your next song um tell me where it's from and how you found it\nThe next song is full given the choice is a popular Iraqi folk song from the Nineteen thirties we've been singing it in our ensemble for several years\nAnd those of us would have traveled to Europe in the middle east to work with refugees four of us in this ensemble have traveled with expressive our for our refuge to volunteer with refugees\nAre we had the honor of singing this song and performing a song with musicians from that were refugees living in refugee camps\nAnd most notably\nCasper king who that is not ... uh Arabic name but who's he goes by Casper ... he's a rapper\nYou had to flee his home country Iraq because he was criticizing the government was his rap music and was targeted and we got a chance to perform the song with him in the ... the collie jungle a couple of summers ago ...\nAnd I just have one thing to add because I I think you can imagine that sit in a refugee camp there not a lot of common spaces because\nMost of the space it's allotted for a refugee camp is taken up by chance or ... or some very small\nI'm living situation so I'm ... we\nSang this our stage with a converted horse trailer we sang this on the ramp [laughter] of a horse trailer\n\n\n... a a\n... on\nAh\nThe the other um\nWith the\nWedding\nOf Bucky\n\nMm I and you can get done and\nAh\nThe ah I'm\nLogan in full full of ... in a mood\nAll\nThree of them ah\n... oh well good luck\nTo you know a ... a new bug oh\nOh\nYeah\nOh\nYeah\nOh I\nNeed a\n\nSlogan in\nLaw now that you know and\nOh\nMy God that you're not\nMy ball or was he\nA he was a\n\n\n\nLot of my\nKnees you well\nYeah well no no no\nNo no no no [laughter] [noise]\nAh\n[noise] we heard Bogle not held a traditional songs from Syria and Iraq performed\nBy members of world song logging McHale W studios this afternoon part of KLW on air folk festival\nAnd ... is world songs music director and she's also one of the music directors for the world harmony course so Betsy do direct other coral ensembles around the bay area\nNo these are the two that's that's a full enough played for [laughter] particularly since we're one of my loves is to make arrangements so I\nWrite many of the arrangements that you're hearing today or augment existing lines [noise]\nDon't get to see um have you also directed the courses overseas or in the Balkans Middle East yes I have um\nDuring the war in Bosnia in the Nineteen nineties I\nUm I started a an enrichment program for display internally displaced a Muslim children from the eastern part of ... who had been vanquished from there\nArea around the dream river and they landed in a city called ... which was one of two cities that took in a lot of displaced I\nPeople sorry that was the other\nSo I was based in Tucson went there for maybe five trips over a period of four years in the mid nineties and there I was directing a middle school a scene class but they did a little bit of performing\nAnd there was a summer camp that was started by Judas Ginia called global children's organization that broadcast\nOr against the armies of each other and we took them away from the war on to an island and they did all kinds of things together and rate which\nFostered friendship said did singing they did some performing they did sports are they learned a little about conflict resolution so there were a lot of different kinds of activities and music was uh one of them\n[noise] so it sounds like you have a special interest in a visiting a these trouble spots around the world\nAre you were mentioning I'm a visiting ah the refugee camp a Syrian refugees\nIn Calais, France a few minutes ago [noise]\nYeah we with expressive arts refuge which I formed to take singers to refugee camps and run music programs\nWe've gone to a Kelly jungle in two thousand six team which is in the north of France where there were refugees from twenty two countries and then in two thousand Seventeen we went to Athens where there was um\nA ... where there were as I mentioned earlier refugees from\nSyria they were Kurds there were some Afghans and Iraqis and then this summer we ... we just got home a couple of a month or two ago from running and put them in Lebanon for Palestinian\nRefugees and I and I think uh\nI don't know what to call it it's kind of the camp but it's been there for three generations and there were twenty three thousand people living in it\n... um were with in combination with the two other organizations we were running\nMusic classes as well in the\nLebanese camp [noise]\nSounds like this charitable work is keeping a very busy I understand why you're not taking any uh taking on any other off [laughter] so ... can I make a request have members of world songs sing also Balkan song\n\n[noise]\n\nYeah\nYeah oh yeah no no\nNo I don't follow\nIt till dawn [noise] oh man you know the\nLast few I'm a I'm a young ...

A. L. W. I've known them for a long time so carrying on the black family tradition and following in the footsteps of your mother Francis and your aunt Mary black was it just assume that music was going to be your destiny\nNot really John and I actually tried to to get a different job when I was in school I tried to I tried to go and get a real job and as I say in gigs I I Try to be the black sheep of the farm [laughter]\nAfter I got to be a judge to do my own thing and I worked effort in a job\nFor for a long period of time actually after college and I and I had ten years of working in in like an a normal real job and an after a while I just realized that and it didn't I I called it ... it was what I wanted to do with my life with\nThe music was calling me and I'm I have to get over maybe chip on my shoulder about the conflict in Parsons and also the fear of failure in in relation to my family how who successfully been and\nAnd I just have to really come to terms with that and then as I matured and I got a bit older it it it worked out and said okay I'm going to do it and\nI didn't change my lifestyle and be a poor musicians [laughter]\nIt sounded like a bit of you for rebellion on your part or you're a late bloomer and you came to music or\nLater in life um but you became a TV producer um after you graduated from college which was a well paid job so did you hear some hesitancy about going fulltime in very much so\nI mean designer you know to do is pretty comfortable and you know you are changing something you're starting from scratch like I had started in\nIn TV and as a runner other of people meet somebody may tea and then I work my way up when I was pretty successful we're winning awards and I was doing really well and I could have had a very comfortable life for myself and I had a nearly a permanent job in in in where I worked and I just really sad and\nI wasn't fulfilled in any way in on unless I was going to go on and at\nLook at being a singer because it was always something that was within me and I had switched it down thinking about it and I told myself I didn't want to be singer I told everybody else I didn't want to be ... but then when I read and listen to the place in the back of my head I had to have to really pull it out and realize that that's actually what I wanted to do\n[noise] so tell me about your ha ha moments when you decided to take the plunge and go full time in the music\nHow she's incredible I'm really proud that she's my mother I think she's amazing and that's I think all of those issues that you just mentioned there is the reason why she didn't Senate now trying to change things and and I think that she's incredible ... proud of her\n[noise] now when you decided to go full time into music uh what's your mother concerned about that I mean life on the road especially for women can be difficult and it can be easy to fall prey to these temptations on the road\nWhoa when tense question [laughter] um\nNo I mean my mother obviously the temptations of the road as it is a weird one what I mean\nAt a she was worried for me that I Would like to be a little bit too sensitive because I'm a sense of creature and it's hard thing to do and and you're being judged by people all the time like it's like a competition to to be a singer you know you have to some people like some people don't and and the only the only on management and I do my own kind of stuff like that like\nAs she does worry that mean in that sense you know because you're you're you're you're getting the rejection emails as long as I along with the good emails you know\nAnd so nothing she was a little bit worried about me but I think them when I showed her that I I really really wanted to do it\nAnd she definitely support me she's always for me and she she was actually one of the reasons why she didn't want me to waste my talent and when I went to get a job she was always saying you have to record and all she didn't want me knocked record an album because she felt that you know the ... or they don't want you to waste their time and so and like a promising for years and years and years I Would eventually do\nAn day she couldn't me on the sunlight blockage but I guess fear was a huge thing and a lack of confidence that for me were regards to not you know failing I suppose fear of failure is always a horrible thing and so she always supported me and I was pushing forward and make sure that he wants to do what I Want to do\nOh that's interesting that she wanted you to begin with all the insecurities around being a musician and yes she certainly been through it all [noise] if it's got is my guest today and are you guys ready with another song\nYeah we're going to sing a song that I wrote and\nOf about ... art

politicians we stand on the hit the tower with our ... and her hand we know where we stand so\nIt's kind of a little bit angry politicians at the time and but since my mother has gotten elected to kind of awkwardness [laughter]\nWould end ... she's only goes I think so and it's for I guess I'll sing for anybody who's feeling all press in any way and and how would they if they don't feel like their voices being handled things for them today this is how we know where we sent\nThem when ... when the ...\nSmall on the line and those who live on\nThe green and ... and ...\nBroken in the ...

L. definitely is are you are ready to play another song sure yeah but this is a song I just recorded\nOver a twenty fifth street studio in in Oakland\nJust the other day so I'm gonna try to play it clean air if I can [noise]\n[noise] uh no one can\nSee a wood is waiting around the necks\nBut it sure feels nice for\nLying you know\nNo one can see a if we can never\nReally be three Mm I've never seen any\nExcept in those ...\nFor the astro plenty\nAnd I don't know who live and we're all being treated the movie\nAnd I never failed\nDo we answer and ... and ... oh say and\nI'm just saying\nI'm Sorry that's\nThe only way to\nGary in\nDanger then the demon\nI don't know\nWe can never\nReally be happy\nI have never sell\n... just in time I talk down\nThat mom agrees\nI don't know if there is a play that who less the fray\nThen where we're living\nBut I ...\nTo\nJust saying and I'm Sorry that the way they as ... as he made me and\nI share of who\nTravelling or a girl or\nS\nNeal we ... the way to carry you know\nDuring the dangers then demons\n... and\n... and ... no one can say\nOr ... what is waiting around the next ...\n... ... ...\nIt shows the peaceful\n[noise] Tim bloom live in the K.

I'm pretty\nComfortable in hospitals now as I feel like I'm [laughter] I Know my way around [laughter] so many things have happened over these last several\nYears it's weird because I I never even really been to a doctor until I was until I got hurt so it was it was a very big change in my life you know\nI mean do you sometimes feel like the universe is putting you through this test you know to see if you're strong enough to rise to the occasion and come through these crises with grace and not fall apart\nIt certainly feels like that sometimes it definitely feels like a test although I suspect that it's probably something more like karma or just\nBad vibes or something I don't know but it I'll be fine I'm I've made it through so far I feel pretty good so I'm I'm like a few more good years in me\n[laughter] but I feel the big accident three years ago you were very active with mother hip and you had these collaborations going on with Jackie green and other musicians and then you have these separate projects that that he took on um\nThe ah high Sierra singer songwriter workshop and you're organizing the mother hips are and you will family hip Nick music festival that takes place in Big Sur yeah big\nSur yeah all those things still go on yeah I I I Do I'm Greg who's my partner and the mother hips he and I do a whitewater rafting trip every summer in Idaho and we bring some fans of the band along with us so I Do two of those this summer\nAnd I'm I'm playing a show with Jason Crosby who is a good friend of mine a fabulous musician piano player and violinist and and singer at ... crossroads tomorrow or no tomorrow on a Tuesday so that's that's really cool that's some pretty\nAmazing music that he's making these days\nAnd so yeah I stay busy I produce quite a few other artists every year I usually do three or four different records from other artists as well so I'm kind of making up for lost time now that I can get around a little easier\nSo it sounds like you're back in action you're almost fully recovered you're walking again you're back into music it's like you've been given a second chance", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Folk Music & Beyond", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "13", "locations": [["Haley", -71.49374, -61.9338], ["Vermont", 44.00034, -72.74983], ["Argentina", -34.0, -64.0], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Mountain View", 17.99186, -76.7607], ["Santa Cruz", -17.78629, -63.18117], ["Oakland", 37.80437, -122.2708], ["Oakland", 37.80437, -122.2708], ["Santa Cruz", -17.78629, -63.18117], ["Santa Cruz", -17.78629, -63.18117], ["Casper", 42.86663, -106.31308], ["Casper", 42.86663, -106.31308], ["Iraq", 33.0, 44.0], ["Syria", 35.0, 38.0], ["Iraq", 33.0, 44.0], ["Bosnia", 44.25, 17.83333], ["Tucson", 32.22174, -110.92648], ["Calais", 50.95194, 1.85635], ["France", 46.0, 2.0], ["France", 46.0, 2.0], ["Athens", 37.98376, 23.72784], ["Syria", 35.0, 38.0], ["Lebanon", 33.83333, 35.83333], ["Studio", -38.14644, 145.17931], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Cuba", 22.0, -79.5], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Ireland", 53.0, -8.0], ["Ireland", 53.0, -8.0], ["Parsons", 37.34034, -95.26108], ["Ireland", 53.0, -8.0], ["Ireland", 53.0, -8.0], ["Ireland", 53.0, -8.0], ["Sonya", 36.0482, 127.3668], ["Oakland", 37.80437, -122.2708], ["Nashville", 36.16589, -86.78444], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["Nashville", 36.16589, -86.78444], ["Nashville", 36.16589, -86.78444], ["Oakland", 37.80437, -122.2708], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Oregon", 44.00013, -120.50139], ["Idaho", 44.5002, -114.25118]], "not_found": [], "ep_coords": ["San Francisco, CA", 37.77493, -122.41942], "in_country": ["Vermont", "America", "Oakland", "Oakland", "Casper", "Casper", "Tucson", "San Francisco", "San Francisco", "Parsons", "Oakland", "Nashville", "California", "California", "Nashville", "Nashville", "Oakland", "Oregon", "Idaho"], "out_country": ["Haley", "Argentina", "Mountain View", "Santa Cruz", "Santa Cruz", "Santa Cruz", "Iraq", "Syria", "Iraq", "Bosnia", "Calais", "France", "France", "Athens", "Syria", "Lebanon", "Studio", "Mexico", "Cuba", "Mexico", "Ireland", "Ireland", "Ireland", "Ireland", "Ireland", "Sonya", "Mexico", "Mexico"], "in_state": ["Oakland", "Oakland", "San Francisco", "San Francisco", "Oakland", "California", "California", "Oakland"], "out_state": ["Haley", "Vermont", "Argentina", "America", "Mountain View", "Santa Cruz", "Santa Cruz", "Santa Cruz", "Casper", "Casper", "Iraq", "Syria", "Iraq", "Bosnia", "Tucson", "Calais", "France", "France", "Athens", "Syria", "Lebanon", "Studio", "Mexico", "Cuba", "Mexico", "Ireland", "Ireland", "Parsons", "Ireland", "Ireland", "Ireland", "Sonya", "Nashville", "Nashville", "Nashville", "Mexico", "Mexico", "Oregon", "Idaho"]}]
