moth radio hour I'm Sarah often Jeanette producing director of them off and I'll be your host this time\nAt the mall people tell true stories from their lives they stand on stage in bars and clubs in theaters and they tell these stories without to audiences all around the country\nThis hour we have three stories for you will hear from the writer Jamaican cave on her trip to visit her\nAs a nine year old as punishment journalist Sebastian younger remembers his final story from the front lines of war and Josh Axelrod a former professional card player tells our first story\nJosh spent years as a card countered with a team of blackjack players but the story you're about to hear it takes place well after that when Josh found himself alone in a tiny rundown casino desperately waiting for two lucky lady [noise] he told the story at a mosque night called sensors\n\nReady tidy okay [noise]\nTwo months ago I was in a casino in southern Washington state's feeling ill\nAre driven down from Seattle where I live now a friend of mine was visiting Portland, Oregon and ah so I've driven down to to see him um [noise] but I also brought along ten thousand dollars in cash with me because you never know\nAnd uh I saw just because you know on the way a gamble a little bit and then went to Portland hung out with him spent the night and I was back in the casino and I was hung over and ill in part because I was at a casino and uh casinos are a little bit sad\nAnd small casinos in impoverished rural areas are a little bit extra set [noise]\nAnd I was also concerned about my own gambling and my relationship to what I was doing at that moment I used to play blackjack for a living I was a card counter um which is card counting as a\nA legitimate um mathematically valid method for winning of the casino game blackjack and I I used to do that for a living and then uh and then my life took an unexpected\nCourse since I Am sitting at this table thinking about these things and suddenly the man next to me as adults a hand he gets a twenty as his hand but it's not an ordinary twenty it's made up of two cranes of ... screen of hearts on top of another queen of hearts and as soon as I saw that hand hit the table I thought maybe um everything's going to be All right\nNow I used to count cards for a living and I was taught to do that by a group of\nFriends mentors or who were some extraordinary people very brilliant very poised prosperous and sort of beautiful in a way and they are incorporated me into a blackjack team that they had been operating for some time and taught me how to go into casinos and when my\nAnd my job was to go in and when a and take the money out of the casino which you take in cash you take it to a new stuff it into your pockets you stuff it into money belts you put it into your breast pocket of your shirt or a jacket and you walk out with it and you feel physically enhanced with that happens\nIt's almost like a part of your body and you bring it back to your teammates we share our winnings and so you're distributed five thousand dollars strap here ten thousand dollars trapped there and everybody gathers around ecstatic and it's almost like they're feeding off your own flesh and [noise]\nAfter earning my living that way for several years I sold a book about the experience of memoir\nUm and I sat down to write it but I thought that I should procrastinate first and so I played a a sort of like a little bit of poker on the Internet which is ... like blackjack that one can when I've won acquires a certain skill set that I had never happened to acquire a ... who are badly and I managed to\nLose a couple of thousand dollars and I became upset\nThat I lost a couple of thousand dollars and so I proceeded to lose ten thousand dollars out of anger and that made me really furious and I spent the next year\nA sitting at the computer in a pathological stupor just pressing this button going broke by the end of\nThe year I'd vaporized fifty grand I was in debt\nAnd I was surrounded not by these extraordinary mentors or that I I used to have around me but by the ex these other people who were strangers ah who's last names I didn't even know who had these haunted eyes and these over gone expressions\nExpanded in this way as I said but also I felt this team in the sense of\nParanoia averaging on terror and I kept looking back in the rearview mirror examining\nThe headlines in the distance trying to into it if any of the cars back to their look menacing and I kept asking myself again and again is everything going to be All right\nThank you\n\nJosh kind of for the actual rich\nRock is unfairly dark men more I think life professional card counting blackjack prior ... sat down to talk to Josh that if history with them on here's Katharine remembering the first time she heard him tell a story at a party\nWas totally silent with everybody turn to you\nHolding their attention telling this unbelievably riveting story and thinking that at this party is actually what we want them off to be and he has to come do this at the players got it in front of two hundred and fifty people instead of twenty five and then blasted the bless your heart you did agree to do that and did it and were brilliant\nWell I think part of part of the whatever\nMight happen with with card counting story specifically in a room has a lot to do with the nature of the stories themselves because people when they're hearing them are I think struck with the possibility that they just can't decide if the person who is in fact a lunatic who thinks that he goes around winning casinos and has\nOr in fact a deft um you know genuine professional\nSo you so you had been telling stories like this two groups of friends at dinner parties for years and years clearly but what was it like the first time you actually stepped on stage with the purpose of telling a story to a crowd the stranger as\nIt was harrowing it's like a different body experience through there and the spotlight is on you you're not really aware of your limbs or the rest of your your body and the normal way that you would be\nWhen Josh Axelrod was on a new play list at casinos he was appearing on them off stage under an assumed name Lee Aaron Blair\nOr did it a under a pseudonym\nI'm In part because my name at that time still had some value\nTo sort of value of a card counters real name tends to deteriorate overtime as you know it's become increasingly aware of it but also because it's long been obvious to me that a card carrying reviewed legally changes his name should change it to three or more first names [laughter] present a piece of ID to a person the casino\nHe can claim that any one of the names is actually the first name\nAnd you know depending on how familiar the casino personality is with that particular form of id they're often you know there's the ideas from all over the country there are often confused I'm so that you can create from one legal name multiple aliases based on a genuine id\nTo hear the rest of this interview and for a bonus material related to all the stories you hear on the radio hour go to a mosque dot org\n[noise]\n\n\nIn a moment we'll be back with this story about a young girls effort to keep her mom all to herself [noise]\n\n\n\nMore radio was produced by Atlanta public media in Woods Hole

Burlington, Vermont editorial mosque shall we produce ph international and Vermont\nRadio seem wise\n[noise]\nWhat did I was hoping I Would have an accident and I wouldn't be able to come up here but uh\nTry as I said nothing worked a\nT didn't spell a\n[laughter] I'm\nLike most people in the word I had a mother and ah\nShe had a sister and uh they were very ah oh on like each other and so the court ruled all the time uh\nMy mother lived in on the ... and her six to where I was born and uh\nAnd grow up and uh her sister lived in Dominique her where she was born and where she\nGrew up they call rode a\nBike letters they wrote to each other\nA letters that they would see up in an envelope and post uh and uh the letters would be taken on a boat that would make weekly stopped from the island of the ... islands I think you would in Wynwood islands [noise] um [noise] and\nUh the letters a word that they send to each other was written in English proper English but the language they spoke the spoken language was French ... uh the letters um\n[noise] uh I never knew what the court was about because\nWhen they we received a letter in English they received each other's letters in English they then would respond to the left has verbally in French ... so I couldn't understand French ... and I was never shown the letters but only I knew\nA certainly from my mother's side the reaction of the letters um this was incredibly uh\nInteresting to me ah everything my mother did was interesting to me\nI I'm a door to her but mostly what I adored about tours that she adored me [noise]\nUh [noise] so I liked to see her angry or it was interesting to me to see her angry and speaking English language which I had no interest in learning at all\nUm because in any case it wasn't a proper language was just a broken language also we were told\n'em [noise]\nEventually uh well as I say I was very I adored this person a eventually when I was around nine years of age I should say I'm a my mother\nBecame pregnant I don't know how this happened\nShe I did have a stepfather her husband but still this pregnancy a\nWas a mystery to me and I had nothing to do with it I wanted nothing to do with it I quite in fact I ignored it um and so it was a surprise uh to me that\nShe gave birth to a ...\nSon her um other child um [noise]\nUm my parents tried very hard to you know make me like him I Would tell me to hold him and so on and\nA I must have done\nAh because one day when um they asked me to hold him he's slipped out of my arms and fell on his head\nThey were very angry at that I think because they made me eat my supper all by myself outside\nI spent my twenties or writing short stories and trying to wait tables\nAnd I got to thirty and I guess the best way to say it is I didn't feel like a man I didn't feel like I was a man that I felt war would be a exciting and intense and then it would transform me in some way\nUm\nAnd so I got a backpack and I put a sleeping bag in it and said no books and pens and a few thousand\nDollars and I went to Bosnia during the civil war is the story of all to try to learn to be a war reporter at war with all those things that I thought it would be I mean the thing about war as it does not disappoint but it's also way more than you bargained for\nUm for example this the first time I saw a dead body there wasn't a fighter\nMost of the people die and wars of civilians and it was in Kosovo during the civil war\nIt was a girl's sixteen Seventeen years old I always imagined that she was probably really beautiful um she'd been I'm taken\nBy surprise military forces\nAre and\nTook her up to a field above a talent goes to a record and they did whatever they did to her and then the\nIt was a couple of weeks later summer it was hot and\n... the only way you could tell she was a girl or really even the only way you could tell she was human or was that you could still see the red finger nail polish\nOn her fingernails and that girl stay with me for a while she was more than I bargained for\nUm [noise]\nI remember the first time I got ready to die to die prepared myself to die I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war and I've been out of the front lines and it was\nA goat getting pretty bad out there and I've tried to get back to Freetown and I got an a jeep with a few\nA ceremony and soldiers who really were good for much and then another couple of journalists and we're driving down this empty road back towards Freetown\nAnd these rebel ... stepped out of the jungle in front of us with their guns level at us and we came to a stop and we just staring straight ahead while they\nArgued about whether to kill us\nAnd ...\nI tried to get ready I was hollow I was numb\nAnd I didn't have any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt that's all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I can see the little black hole that the bullet comes out of you know one point a guy\n... his gun ... started to shoot another guy grab the barrel inject it up I mean it was like that for Fifteen minutes\nWell all these little black holes are staring at us I thought it was the attorney inside those holes and there are so small the thickness of a pencil\nAnd attorneys in there and I couldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look out for some reason they didn't kill us and we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back for more I kept going to more wars I felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it kept going back I remember the first time I froze in\nCombat you go to war you think you think you're going to be brave have you don't think that you probably don't go to war and sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd ...\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan outpost\nCalled Restrepo twenty man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and I'm like this day was really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against some sandbags\nAnd ... some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nAnd would you have to understand about voices that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoes that you so much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters\nThe first thing that happens is you you asked yourself am I getting shot at it gives the sound of bullets make when they go past you\nIs pretty subtle and then the gunfire arrives moment later yes I Am getting shot at and then as everything goes crazy well the boy\nThe boy a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face if that's what I felt what's the angles\nDeviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right\nNow what's the mass on that angle you don't even want to think about it um and then it's all you can think about\nEating the sandbags smacking and everything I was paralyzed those behind some sandbags and our gear was ripe right over there just a few feet away cameras bulletproof vest\nWe're getting attacked from three sides they're coming up into the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire and I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington photographer we're on assignment out there he finally jumps across that gap and he\nGrabs Sufi throws my camera to me it throws my bullet proof vest the grass and stuff it's throwing image of soldiers does the soldiers are pinned down too\nAnd he gets back and I have my camera in my hand and I start shooting I start working and then a fine I'm not scared anymore Tim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer and obviously very very brave\nA lot of braver than me um\nBut he was also really kind of thoughtful about war and I remember at one point he said to me you know war might be the only situation where young men\nAre free to love each other on reserve easily without it being mistaken for something else that was Tim and that's why we were working together we decided to make a documentary\nAbout this little outpost we were going to call every step up and we were going to spend as much of the deployment as possible at this in this little spot on this rigid in eastern Afghanistan so we were going to alternate trips and I ... I asked for my feelings on this trip\nSo I had to go home to kind of he left So Tim took the next trip\n\nHe was on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation up up in the mountains on foot very bad seen a lot of lot of guys got killed a lot of American Soldiers got killed and wounded\nAt one point um the American physicians got overrun they drag off of wounded American soldier at night in the middle of a firefight\nThey got him back but it was bad out there way worse than anyone back home really knew you know\nAnd in the middle of all that same broke his leg is it ten thousand feet up in the ... with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long and the medic examines his foot and says well as broken and we can't get a medivac and we have to be off this mountain by Don and we're going\nTo get hammered here's two Advil and Tim new Jim knew that\nIf you're not prepared to walk all night on a broken leg was for the sake of thirty men you shouldn't be out there\nAnd he did it I don't know how but he did it got down on that mountain so we finished up our deployment\nAnd um that's how we started to think of it are deployment I'm and I'm not you know the rest of it was okay the worst was in the beginning actually and uh and we started making our film Restrepo and um\n\nAnd if the the film did really well and started it started with this scene um that was very\nTook me a long time to be able to watch it actually I Would always close my eyes when it came\nUm the scene where I'm riding in a Humvee cause I took the next trip after Tim broke his leg\nI riding in a Humvee and all of a sudden everything goes orange and black and the Humvee got blown up he went off under the engine block though instead of under us so we live\nThat whole rest of the day I was just on this\nKilled to crank you up [noise] incredible and that night I just sank I spiraled down in this black hole war is a lot of things it's incredibly exciting and I hate to put it that way but I'm not up here to lie to you it's really exciting and it's really scary\nAnd it's really intense and it's really meaningful but it's also incredibly sad and sadness is a kind of delicate emotion that's easily\nEasily travel by other feelings\nAnd that night I got in touch with the sadness of the whole thing politics aside just the fact that people are doing this to each other it crushed me and that sadness lasted exactly until the next time we got shot at and I was back in the", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "29", "locations": [["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["Seattle", 47.60621, -122.33207], ["Seattle", 47.60621, -122.33207], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Louisiana", 30.12595, -92.00939], ["Tara", 45.66667, 25.66667], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Seattle", 47.60621, -122.33207], ["Portland", 18.13333, -76.53333], ["Oregon", 44.00013, -120.50139], ["Portland", 18.13333, -76.53333], ["Atlanta", 33.749, -84.38798], ["Woods Hole", 21.16667, 166.45], ["Massachusetts", 42.36565, -71.10832], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["Burlington Vermont Vermont", 44.47588, -73.21207], ["Dominique", 15.5, -61.33333], ["Bosnia", 44.25, 17.83333], ["Kosovo", 42.58333, 20.91667], ["Sierra Leone", 8.5, -11.5], ["Afghanistan", 33.0, 66.0], ["Afghanistan", 33.0, 66.0], ["Restrepo", 3.79593, -76.56736]], "not_found": [], "ep_coords": ["San Francisco, CA", 37.77493, -122.41942], "in_country": ["San Francisco", "Seattle", "Seattle", "New York", "Louisiana", "Washington", "Seattle", "Oregon", "Atlanta", "Massachusetts", "San Francisco", "Burlington Vermont Vermont"], "out_country": ["Tara", "Portland", "Portland", "Woods Hole", "Dominique", "Bosnia", "Kosovo", "Sierra Leone", "Afghanistan", "Afghanistan", "Restrepo"], "in_state": ["San Francisco", "San Francisco"], "out_state": ["Seattle", "Seattle", "New York", "Louisiana", "Tara", "Washington", "Seattle", "Portland", "Oregon", "Portland", "Atlanta", "Woods Hole", "Massachusetts", "Burlington Vermont Vermont", "Dominique", "Bosnia", "Kosovo", "Sierra Leone", "Afghanistan", "Afghanistan", "Restrepo"]}, {"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "But all the details by clicking the donate button at the top of our website K.

I was like yeah lady cool it I'm new here\nAnd there was a kid in front of a class with him as Brad hey turn around and looked at me and said she just say Osama bin Laden\nWas like no she didn't say

no I'm not not ... because like All right thank God we can be friends then [noise]\nI'm actually this could have been idiot that's all it took [noise]\nI can go to the FAA like that [noise]\nSo maybe it was starting to Missouri was a very very difficult but not everyone is bad actually made a best friend the first day his name is Brenda Brenda was great he had moved to my town from buffalo Missouri and he moved there because his dad was a preacher and he was going to take over the local church and brought it was great you would later become the captain of all the sports teams at high school and\nHe loved the town he said Omar you're going to love it here everyone is so nice and friendly like for example I just thought my hair cut at this guy named Troy and Troy is the best okay he talked to me about sports about church you got to go see\nSo then that day when my dad picked me up I was like dad\nLet's go to choice for haircuts so we went to Troy and Troy is is a mobile home\nWith like a barber chair in there and so we walk in and there's a Confederate flag hanging up\nAnd my dad like yeah I think we'd better leave\nNobody know down we're going to stay tries to best

we got back in the car and on the way home my dad didn't say anything\nAbout it and didn't need to we still haven't said anything about it to this day because he must have realized that he had taken us to a place where we didn't even feel safe getting her hair cut\nAnd it must have been especially taxing for him because there's a strong Pakistani man he cared about family more than everything\nAnd\nIt weighed heavily on him but over time we really started to feel like we were a part of Missouri people there are super friendly and ... even though they're pretty race us [noise]\nI live in San Francisco right now people there are All right\nLike ville protest for you but they're not going to like help you with your back you know what I mean like [noise]\nAnd so it really started

dresses I was basically the reason ... was invented and after all my deep dives I was ready to go they started the invitations I hand embroidered every one of my wedding invitation\nAnd I'm now than an envelope with vintage stamps I picked out to match the personalities of every person that I invited [noise] so my dad got a salute to the military stamp than I had to scour ... for a vintage WC Fields for funny friend ...\nI may have Still Alice is leftover if you're a fan of Presley but after those were sent off I started thinking about the reception [noise]\nI don't like the smell of flowers that give me a headache if I decided to make all of our center pieces I Would create flowers from buttons from his family and my family I made my weddings okay like created flowers from pieces of my grandmother's wedding dress and my mom's letting them\nAnd he went along with all of this [laughter]\nShe actually went with me that restores picking out all the Knicks snatched vintage plates we would use for the reception and tracking down all the little ... for the twelfth\nHe cared about to\nMostly the music he actually wrote a song for me to walk down the aisle he composed didn't orchestrated it and send it off to the band and we got prepared for our big day it's going to be so beautiful\nAn anthropology catalog threw up over everything but\nWe got married on April twenty fourth which was my grandparents wedding anniversary they had been married sixty four years in the day of my wedding and I thought by picking that day it would bring the same good luck\nAnd we were married outside St Louis Missouri in a town called ... core which is his home town and his sister's back yard\nSo on April twenty fourth we hung out let the twinkling lights and the trees decorative little stars put out tables in my beautiful center pieces and on every seat lay down a custom made played bill I had done for the event\nNow all of this preparation he failed to mention that April in Missouri is tornado season [noise]\nI was\nActually watching a YouTube learning how to fold napkins and to the shapes of swan when the tornado siren went off\nAnd then came the rain and then hail\nAnd wins and it knocked all of the table over and all of my beautiful center pieces into the mud six months of making them every night and they were destroyed\nNo one saw any of it\nNow luckily I was marrying a circus clown [laughter]\nThe only time that's lucky by the way\nWe had invited all of these ... people\nSo we had trapeze artists and jugglers and if there is anything they know how to do this pitch a tent so up with a big town\nAnd we cleared out the branches and threw away all of the handmade bunting I had made that my grandparents out of the tornado shelter that they had been trapped in I'm are ready to begin\nRabbit was supposed to be the ring bearer but she was not having it and she wouldn't give them a little cart I made so we just proceed without her\nUm [noise] I was looking forward to the song\nHadn't heard it and I realized oh they're not going to play it because the bandleader had a heart attack [noise] fine um but they didn't feel comfortable playing without him so instead I walked down the aisle to the theme song from the west wing [noise]\nFavorite show so um [noise]\nThe photographer had never shot a wedding before so she forgot to bring a flash 'em and some\nShowed up and apparently brought a stomach virus that I had not registered for um [noise] so throughout the day people kept getting sick and dropping like flies amongst all of this the worst part for me\nWas that my dad decided not to come\nI didn't ask him to walk me down the aisle and so he said I'm not going to be there and\nI had to step father that I've had since I was seven years old and I didn't want to get into the politics of which guy on which arm so I decided to walk myself\nBut he didn't like it and so he chose not to come\nTo my mom called them I called them and he said well I send a check\nAs if that's the same thing\nI'm is only daughter and he chose not to come to my wedding and that will always be true but I Can't do a father and daughter\nSo I I danced with his dad my grandfather and as we weighed beneath the big top he looked at me and said your dad should have been here\nAnd he should have been [noise] and then\nMaybe he would have seen the small fire we had in the kitchen [noise]\nAll of our hamburgers spiders just went up in flames [laughter]\nBut\nHe also missed the double rainbow that came out after the storm is finally passed\nI mean a star friends singing a song from ... to do and and also has to pay and jump around [noise]\nAnd\nSo after all it wasn't the details that made the day I had thought it would be my custom made crossword puzzle policemen and the specialty cocktail I have made which is just jak and coke but [noise]\nFact it was our friends and the family that showed up for us\nAfter all the details don't make the day and they don't make the marriage either\nBecause I'm not married anymore and I don't think a perfectly sunny day and matching escort cards would have changed that we shouldn't have gotten married there's some things even take can't fix\nMaybe if I hadn't been so caught up in all of the preparations I Would have realized that but there are no articles on interest on how to stay married and Martha Stewart doesn't really tell you what happens after the big day is over\nBut even though it began with the storm it didn't end with one we were married increased corps which literally translates to broken heart and my dad says now [noise] [noise] well it looks like I didn't miss anything anyway\nBut he did\nHe missed a part of my life\nAnd he also missed our friend and a meatloaf cover artist called pot roast um\nIt was also are videographer\nSinging karaoke in the garage well all of our friends stamps and the pedals\nSo he missed a lot\nYou would think that with all this I Would sort of be sick of weddings I mean they're people who think they are a scam but I Love wedding\nI Love the details and stuff and\nI became a wedding planner [laughter]\nI've married about twenty five couples and they've been no tornado that any of them they've all been beautiful had perfectly detailed days I've added more and more pins probably about six thousand now all of these ideas going through my head\nIs if I ever get married again I'm totally going to elope\nThat would\nIn addition to being a wedding planner\nKerry also runs an online store called the plumb fields shop\nHer dream to be a magician assistant I'm just putting that out there for you carrying all it takes is one big breaking to see some pictures from Kerry sweating all the MTV Neal visit them off dot org I keep meaning to ask Carrie if she include karaoke led by pot roast as part of her standard wedding package\nThat would be a big seller I think\nNext up is Donna Autor we first met her at the mosque doors slammed in Portland, Oregon [noise]\nShe told this story at a show in Albuquerque New Mexico where we partner with public radio station K. A. N. W. fears Donna auditor\n[noise]\nFor about a year after Twenty one year marriage [noise] and I'm getting ready to go to a time trick body painting party [noise]\nThat sounds tomorrow's one day you're wrong KLW you can make your voice heard any time at one age voice mail inbox five five three six twelve twelve you can also email one day at W. W. dot org or tweet after\n\nMy partner he's just ahead of me on the end just suddenly I Know that if\nThe question that's been building up between us for months now I guess\nSilence he turns around and I see that he is laughing at me this is the stupidest idea you've ever had\nNo I don't want to have a baby\nIn his defense or we had our hands full we were actually already parents a one year into our relationship his sister couldn't take care of her kids and they came to stay with us for a little while\nI'm well a little while became a long while became forever and our adoption of hail Ian Riley had just become final they were ages five and seven and we were just starting to get that taste of freedom that comes when you have big kids [noise]\nUh the second reason that he said no is because he knew that when I asked if we can have a baby I was asking if I could get pregnant and give birth\nOr this isn't some kind of a feat of modern science or I'm just transgender uh for me that means that I was born female [noise] um I was raised as a girl or the best way that I had when I was a teenager of explaining what was going on with me was I used to joke that I was a gay\nMan trapped in a woman's body um and as I got older um that's literal feeling the feeling trapped in the wrong body got more and more pervasive and painful until it became um literally unbearable and I wasn't sure I could keep going [noise] um and then I met a transgender person\nAnd I realized that it wasn't a joke at all actually was a gay man trapped in a woman's body a and this was great news um because it meant that there was a solution to this problem and there was a name for it and there was a community of people that I could go to um but most importantly it meant\nThat um I could stay alive a and I could transition and I could be happy um which is what I did [noise] um [noise]\n\nI I started taking testosterone and that made me look like I Do now like every other gay men in Portland [noise]\nAnd it turns out that I'm the kind of transgender person who was just like fine with just hormones I didn't have any other surgeries or anything which means that I have a fully functioning uterus and totally healthy eggs and this is not trans he's just a normal gay dude he's not normal he's special [noise]\nYou know what I mean so between the two of us even though we are two men we have everything we need to make our own baby\nA and we'd known dozens of other transgender men like me with beards and everything who have given birth to have the beautiful children we knew it was possible a but it had been hard for pretty much all of them and that was really worried about my safety um navigating the world as a pregnant ma'am\nI'm but I uh live in a world of rainbows and unicorns a and I just hoped that it was going to be okay and I also am not good at taking no for an answer\nI'm so eventually he did say yes and I went to a doctor and everything was in good working order I stopped my hormones um and we started trying a\nAnd a few months went by nothing happened um and I started this thing maybe it wasn't going to happen for us after all and just when I started to feel the peaceful about that I woke up one morning and I felt really gross [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd I had read all the pregnancy books you know everything about pregnancy and I've been tracking everything on the ... you know um but it wasn't the right\nTime for me to get to be pregnant and so I was using the pregnancy test and then just made me and I took it and there were two lines and it was pregnant\nAnd it was going to be a baby and I'm Still but also super scared because you have to do a lot of things to get ready for baby like pick a name and buy diapers and learn how to take care of a baby [noise]\nHaley unwind we'd been toddlers when they came to live with that so I did it\nTo change really quickly I'm an all of those ah markers of femininity in everything just got bigger everywhere and I had anticipated this um that it would be the worst part of being pregnant but it actually ended up being okay and\nI think it's because really early on in my transition I just had to like um accept the fact that my body is is going to be like different I Can't go back in time and be born with a body that's more like this are my dad than I could spend the rest of my life I'm obsessing over all the things I cannot do\nOr I could get excited about the things that I can do that their bodies can't which is to create life so that's what I did um I just went into that and then I just let everything else go oh and wait around this time we had a chance to tell her story publicly um and I don't know about\nYou all but basically every store I've ever heard about a transgender person has been um something terrible has happened to us um and that's I think why it had been I'm so scary for me to come out of trans um because our lives our misery says the media\nAnd I thought maybe we could tell a different kind of story um because yes there's hardship and and being transgender especially for trans people who are not like me I'm transgender women and trans people of color\nBut for all of us there is also joy and love and and resilience in and family and I wanted to tell that story and I and I hope the world was ready um\nAnd we didn't think it was a big deal for me to be a pregnant man everybody else did [noise]\nUm and I don't know if they still say let go viral um but that is what happened um to our story basically overnight I'm pregnant man was everywhere like Yahoo News if anyone's don't read that um CNN a Washington Post people magazine\nPregnant man and I thought maybe this is good you know maybe people are ready for this next evolution and what it could mean I'm to be transgender and I live in Portland and let me tell you people were ready\nFor my story in Portland I'm In Portland like maybe if you see a pregnant man at Starbucks that's not the weirdest thing you've seen that day [noise]\nThey were into it you know um\nAnd like trans kids would come up to me with their parents like in the grocery store\nUm and just say thank you for helping them understand that there is a little more than one way to be a man and and more than one way to be trams um a lady once told me that she adopted her knees too and she thought it was marvelous that my body could give me the life I deserve while also bringing new life into the world\nBut outside of the Portland bubble I'm not everyone was ready for this story um\nI became really good friends with the ... because I Would just get hundreds of messages on Facebook that was just that um people would tell me that I wasn't a man at all I'm just a really ugly\nHarry woman and that I was going to give birth to a monster and then one woman sent me a message that said as a Christian I Hope that you give birth to a dead baby\nBecause that maybe would be better off than a baby that has to be born to someone like you I was six months pregnant when I read that message now I have been trans for a long time Fifteen Years I'm\nActually at age thirty five I'm I Am past the point of average life expectancy for a trans person in America today [noise]\nAnd and powerful but the truth is I started to lose hope\nFor our country and and for trans people that we would ever be loved in the way we deserve and all of those stories started to seep in one night I had a really horrible nightmare where I was giving birth not not to a baby but to a monster\nWith two heads and a forked tongue and the tail and I woke up and I was climbing shaking and this was like what's wrong with that I couldn't tell him all I could say it was the U.S [noise]\nAnd I didn't really know that before that that people

consequential but sometimes our eyes real wide and we've euro in on a detail that changes everything\nHappened to our first story Taylor are Eric Thomas when he pulled focused on a small sign in a library\nOriginally told this story for us to his home town\nHere he is alive at the [noise]\n\nFirst time I went viral was in two thousand and two of you know what that means going viral slipping wherever we after I guess they mean to the article ah we're all talking to each other on the Internet at the same time I'm not having to leave\nThe Internet or there was no Twitter there was no YouTube very few people were on Facebook so it was really really hard to go viral back then uh and I say that so you'll be impressed [noise]\nTelling you that the two I was a college student at the University of Maryland and um it was really hard time in my life I was sad all the time uh and I was tired all the time and I didn't really make any friends on campus I just went to class and I didn't join in the activities I just\nOccasionally were right um movie reviews for the college newspaper and I did that mostly because I really like free things um\nThen we'll go home and I was a direct my parents' basement and for work I worked at the local the Baltimore Sun the local paper um in their subscription complaints department I'm\nLiving [noise]\nAnd so people would call me if they didn't get their paper delivered in the morning I'm sometimes he would call me if they had a complaint about a an editorial I couldn't really do much about that and sometimes people just called me because they were lonely um and so I Would go in and five and talk on the phone until noon and then I Would go to campus\nUm and then I Would go back home and that was my life\nSo I went viral in February um I was in the campus bookstore one afternoon I'm In February courses\nBlack history month until they had a display up for black history month that's faded from bondage to book\nAnd it had a picture of Harriet Tubman and the picture Colin Powell [noise]\nAnd that was bad\nAnd it looked up the side and I looked around the store like this [noise]\nAnd there was like nobody else in the store it's like look back\nAt the fine and I actually get heated\nAre staring at that time and I like to find the hurt my feelings um because it's said to me in those few words that are the history of black people or the history of my people in this country could be boiled down to the middle passage\nSlavery and whatever it is the Colin Powell means to you um [noise]\nWhich back then was complicated and now it's like interesting stuff [noise]\nFrom bondage to books you were a slave and now you can read congratulations [noise]\nI felt like I was in this like\nArguments with the spine that I was losing um [noise]\nAs I turned on my healing my lesson that I left I realized this time didn't have to have the last word so I walked across campus to the newspaper\nOffice because the campus newspaper office and I said I'm writing editorials and there were like I'm sure the movie review guy and I was like I've changed [noise]\nI wrote about the sign and I decided to frame it as a satire because I wanted to write about the idea behind the fine I'm as well as like my frustration about it and the sinus all through the whole thing um\nAnd I called it an idiots guy to black history month called Colin from bondage the books that have some type of\nAnd the effect the fans in ... um\nI don't know why I decided to write it as a satire I wasn't really sure what satire was to be honest I thought you just have to like really really sarcastically um\nAnd so that's what I did it begins like this it's a a another black history month has come and gone good riddance how long we pay for the penance of this country stands against black people and how much black history is there really we all know the drill slavery Middle Passage\nMy mom has a nickname for me uh bought\nIn Cantonese it means busy body curious\nAlways asking questions kind of gotten negative connotation and I had to suppress\nThat curiosity acting all of those\nQuestions because when you're born a kid of immigrants\nYou're taught a guiding set of principles on which to live on\nKeep your head down\nLearn English go to school get good grades go to college Mary yourself a nice Chinese husband have kids by a big house for yourself\nAnd keep quiet\nAnd so these are all the things I learned and everyone around me believe them because I was\nBorn and raised in Manhattan's Chinatown which has bustling with a Chinese immigrants and kids of immigrants like me my mom worked odd jobs and sweat shops and uh in Chinese bakeries my dad worked six days a week as a construction worker and when he'd come back on Sundays me and my brother's a take turns massaging his back\nWhile\nDoing all of this I'm also trying to grapple with being both Chinese and America American\nAnd so I'm In fifth grade watching a soccer match with my parents and if the U.S versus China\nWho every rooting for [noise]\nI don't go well of course China\nBut we're here in America I thought\nAsk that question though because when you're a growing up here you know that in that\nIt's going to cause the rockets right but I found my way to figure out this identity issue when I was Thirteen\nI was so excited to watch a PBS documentary becoming American the Chinese experience [noise]\nSeen three people who ever looked\nAt like me Jackie Chan\nTrainee the yellow power ranger [noise]\nAnd moon line a cartoon character [noise]\nSo I'm so excited to watch these last twenty minutes which talks about people marching and protesting people who look like me they're holding clever signs in English they're chanting in English I never even seen anyone in Chinatown march before for anything\nSo big that all these people will go on the street and risk their identities their life they were marching for this\nMan named Vincent Chin Vincent Chin in Nineteen eighty two was a Chinese American men who was beaten to death\nHe was being to death by two white laid off auto workers who assumed he was Japanese during the auto workers prices in Detroit\nWhere Japanese companies were booming and people thought\nThe Japanese were stealing their job they fought\nThe guys chased Vincent Chin and beat him to death with a baseball bat on his bachelor party\n\nInstead of going to um his wedding his wedding guest once his funeral and said the next week the two guys who killed Vincent Chin never served a day in jail and paid three thousand dollars for this man's death\nAnd so all of these groups of people Chinese people Korean people Japanese people Filipino people\nAre now saying if this happened to this guy Vincent Chin this could happen to any of us and so they began to rally together and for the first time for many of them they came together under the term Asian American\nAsian American I'd never heard that term before\nAnd Vincent Chin must have been so important if he had brought all of these groups together so my mom happens to walk into the room as I'm watching the documentary and I'm thinking she's about to yell at me for being lazy on the couch and she points to screen she looks ... photo and says\nThat your family\nWhat\nI have all these questions who is he how is he related to ... like a cousin of a cousin of the cousin\nHave I ever met him no I haven't met him because I wasn't born yet in Nineteen eighty two\nBut I'm Wondering like what happened I look up at my mom's face\nAnd there's just pain and anguish in her eyes\nThat she didn't look like she had wanted to tell me this much I think she felt she had to tell me how could I ask all these questions how can I ask\nA murder man in our family I had nothing to say at that moment and I just decided I'm not going to come from my mother about this I don't want to hurt her\nSo I decide to do research like I've done since I was a kid I start
