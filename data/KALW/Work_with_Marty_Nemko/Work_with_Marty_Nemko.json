[{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "Your work life all of our work lives welcome to work with Marty Nemko [noise]\n\nHave to start with an apology I announced last week that I'd be speaking about career change at UC Berkley extension alas all the seats are now sold out spoken for what the good news is there as a result\nThey're gonna be making a a pod cast doubt on and I will announce on the show what the link will be for that but those you hope to register it actually\nRock stars but any case it happens a lot of people wanting change careers I guess with the uh the good employment market people are feeling more confident they can afford to make a career change but any case to today's number one topic\nCareer do's and don'ts for parents of college students a couple of weeks ago I was honored to be speaker in a a Stanford distinguish speaker series was offering advice to Paris to Stanford students\nAnd I thought I Would share with your version abbreviated version of what I said but it's still take about Fifteen minutes but I think I decided it's worth your time\nOf course it's applicable not just a parents of college students let alone Stanford students but anyone who cares about them and a lot of the advice I'm certainly much of it that I Want to share with you that in the edited version I'm going to tell you\nIs um relevant whether you're Seventeen or Seventy seven anyway\n[noise] but I Want to start with how much should parents help the American societal norm is that after high school you're supposed to let your kid fly or crash pretty much solo but at least in my experience on average more parental involvement is wise\n[noise] and you might sort of common cause your kids going to be expecting you to lay off when they go off to college\nAh or is or if they're in college but you might start a conversation as a parent by saying something to your kid like of course I'm proud of what you've accomplished and and it's right now you get more autonomy but for what it's worth your only Nineteen so\nHaving been on this or is a bit longer than you have a may still have something to offer you so I Would like to continue being your advisor I mean you're the now the godfather but I Would welcome welcome remaining a constantly every\nWhat do you think and then the next thing you got to do is listen movie thoughtfully to your kids' response and really listen and then then adjust the extent of your involvement accordingly\nNow turned to ways that a parent might be helpful to the kid regarding their career first assault with a major\nHelping the kids choose the major contrary to conventional wisdom it's usually wise to tentatively choose a career early after only a modest amount of exploration for example you might have your child may be with you alongside\nPeru's his or her colleges list of majors and then click through to any majors of interest and examined the required courses elective courses and the descriptions of careers that major could lead to\nThat simple little thing is more thorough than most kids do because every college easily as a hundred majors or whatever\nAnd it's a fast way to um to screen all of them with some kids just they tend to think they think of two or three or four and they just do that but there are many that are less obvious a gang one of my main themes is always under the radar and that's a nice way\nTo get to some under the radar majors which could lead to under the radar careers which might not be so competitive to land a job now with regard to choosing a career\nI've simple in my judgment way to do this is to Peru's the categorize list a three hundred and forty careers and self employment ideas\nThat are profiled that my new book careers for dummies and then just read the you know half a dozen doesn't\nUh two dozen profiles of only just like a third of a page long or read the profiles of any of those careers that are interesting ah you might particularly call your kids' attention to again under the radar courage for example and give you some examples\nLet's say that your child is not particularly technical here or something they might consider program evaluated so many ... so much of our jet a general a domestic product\nIs um distributed by grants each one of them using needs and evaluate or it's a fun way to learn a little bit about a lot of careers on the other\nA man writing a grand to get some of that money again gets enables you to constantly be involved the innovation it's really fun\nAnother example of a nice under the radar career for an technical person his political campaign manager a lot of people think about being a politician\nBut boy is it interesting to be involved in a political campaign it's up people management it's data management it's the excitement it's exciting it's visionary um it's dealing with some unscrupulous behavior uh on the other part in ... and resisting the temptation of you to do the same I've been watching\nA particular race um I'm not going to tell you what it is because uh anyway uh in education as is something I Know about and it it's dispiriting to see how low they these educators who should be high minded I Will go but I digress a if your child is more technical\nHere's some under the radar careers they might consider forensic accounting that is seeing whether companies are stealing from another our employees is doing from the company and so on forensic accounting\nOr researching the biological basis of reasoning skills we using his prerequisite just so much success especially our information economy being an orthodontist a lot of people think about being a dentist but in North of John this is an unusually rewarding career and quite lucrative\nOr if you know so many people who are technical wanted develop apps well there's some areas that really could use some great apps when an ... an apt to improve your memory for normal people or people with Alzheimer's\nOr a better better out through reducing anxiety we live in the anxiety era\nThere are certainly mindfulness another kind of anxiety reducing apps but they're\nThey're you know they have their limitations\nSo developing better ones would have tremendous applicability or an app that would improve the quality of matches on dating websites a number of my clients for example use tinder or they'll use okcupid or coffee meets bagel or old match dot com or J. date\nAnd they're they're really quite limited in terms of the matching paradigms it seemed like there really is an opportunity do a really rigorous analysis of what makes a match really work\n[noise] and I want to share some other future resistant careers um and what I call future resistant as these careers that are unlikely to be automated or off shored\nThe aforementioned politician up to the campaign a politician and offshore and that being a nurse I'm not I'm less sanguine about being an empty because I really do believe we will have single payer within a few years and because of that if we're trying to cover everybody paid for by taxpayer dollars\nMost of the work is going to be have to be done by less costly practitioners than MDs and so I think the the market for for nurses going to be huge and the range of things I'll be able to do so they're not just under the thumb of a doctor or will be enormous [noise] um I also think some other future resistant careers will be\nBeing a manager who specializes in remote workforces\nThere were so much work that is going to be done offshore and somebody who can manage culturally diverse and geographically diverse uh workers and motivate them uh I think we'll be invaluable I also think any field specially in management related to genetics\nAnd to cyber security and biosecurity will be in great demand\nLarge equipment repair you can offshore the repair of an MRI machine to India\nUm so being if your hands on kind of person large equipment repair\n[noise] um I'm just on medical you know there are these printing presses including three D printing presses MIT is already built houses out of ... D printed freely printed walls\nSo I really think and you know that there will be a high maintenance required for these pretty ... because there's so much liquid being spewed out those jets are going to get clogged et cetera so\nBeing somebody who can do large equipment repair it will be in demand ah I also think that we're we're ever more graphically oriented\nArtist types but graphic design people who have business expertise who will know what they're pretty pretty graphics are actually going to result in people either buying more or donating more to the non profit or whatever [noise] um I think big ticket sales will be relatively future proof\nI'm Talking about everything from skyscrapers the airplane leases\nUm and also judges in hearing officers though they're not going to get off shored very rewarding and ... are a whole panoply of consultants counselors and coaches so those are some future resistant careers that as a parent if you are working with your child to encourage your child to consider under the radar careers\nI think that's a strong idea now there's so many people who say we might view askance to what I've just said there because they think that it's a mistake to specialize early I understand that remaining a generalist is comforting\nBut often it is worth committing to becoming excellent in one narrow area not only is that gonna make you in demand\nYou're going to gain confidence from knowing that narrow area cold and if you're tired of it it's often easier to branch out and be successful in a new niche because you've developed reputation in your first niche for example\nLet's say your kids a physics or chemistry major and decides to become expert in his watched a lot of CSI expert in you know blood splatter accident a brief flat it but then after a while gets bored with it\nI tried to remain calm and I made the case what libertarian policies may at least no guarantees but may be best for all people\nBecause I was statesman like the protests faded and the organization was allowed to continue so that's a ... story that was the ...\nA political organization the approach that she took very statesman like the positive result is that the protests diminished by the way while we're on interviews another useful Internet ... interview technique is when you get asked a question who's answer you could diagram\nYou might ask if you can go to the white board to show how you would structure approach to the problem that's very memorable it's assertive without being a noxious and it it it makes it makes your explanation clear and also you as you were writing and you can be clarifying your own thoughts to about the complex problem [noise]\nNext someone turned to what a parent can do to encourage their child to make the most him an internship your kid has worked hard already gotten the internship now when I'm going to say now may seem obvious because\nBut but because I've seen even some top students fail at this it can't hurt for me to remind your child for you to remind your child that your kids should treat even an unpaid internship as an audition for a job and an example may help here I was on the today show\nAnd in addition to the director and camera people\nThey was very large studio almost brings a football field\nAnd he was filled with two dozen a twenty to twenty two year old I guess around that women yeah and they're all women will leave to another day why that is and whether that's good or bad but anyway most of them were chatting with each other but one of the women was striding from guests to guest\nFrom the camera person to the director and to the host clearly trying to be helpful to every one of them well when my segment was over I told I walked over\nAnd I told her that I was impressed with her industrious and she said you know it's funny you should say that our summer internships just about over and I was the only one of the twenty three to be offered a job after graduation as a producer\nSo I'm your kid all students have got to think of their internship as an audition unfortunately it's an audition and which only a small percentage of the audition has get cast\nYou might want to also talk to get a little bit about particular extra curricula is it a career as a member of my talk is about career do's and don'ts for parents to college students\nYou might encourage extra curricula that are going to your profession and grow then personal growth here a few examples you might want to explore with your kid to start a club or an activist group or create content for a campus newspaper radio station TV station website\nOr get your kid to encourage your kids consider being a student member of the faculty Senate or the student government\nAgain depending on your kids preference you know it's perfectly appropriate to sprinkle their life with pure de stressors\nYou know I remember when I was in graduate school at Berkeley I went to lots of college basketball games and football games even joined the campuses intramural bowling league\nSo you know there's times sometimes have veggie out especially when you're in college not all about career and work but since my topic was about helping your child was career that was my main focus but I I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about the value of fun anytime and your life but especially\nWhen you're in college and um but speaking of what I Need to say and I did say this at Stanford to the parents I don't know how they felt about it but\nI I felt they needed to say a word about drugs\n[noise] the legalization of marijuana has created a certainly a second alcohol or worse\nAccording to the recent met a valuation by the national Academy of sciences of the one hundred most rigorous studies of marijuana's affects this is not right wing political reefer madness crap\nAs a result of that medical valuation of the hundred most rigorous studies of marijuana's affects its effects on mental health and physical health and in turn which affects career and personal life are much greater than the often big tobacco funded we'd advocates would have us believe\nYour kid either because your kid knows it maybe you're a user or because if your kid is a user\nIt can generate did make the kid very defensive so my best shot at it in as generic advice\nIs that you show your kid that summer there the summary section of that met as I can just Google it met evaluation National Academy of Sciences marijuana you'll find it and see showing the summary\nAnd then simply ask what do you think and then try maybe usually let it go unless you're really worried and of course you can have a similar discussion about alcohol or or or stronger substances\nAnd finally is where I ended my talk at Stanford is um [noise] I um I told people that I've had the privilege of having been career and personal cost fifty five hundred people including some of the most successful people on earth as well as some real stragglers\nAnd while intelligence and drive or the number one and number two differentiating factors\nNumber three is that successful ones are more likely to follow my Holocaust survivor dad's advice\nWhen I asked him why so rarely talked about the Holocaust he said Martin the Nazis took five years from my life I won't give them one minute more he said Martin stop looking back\nAlways take the next step forward\nAnd that's how I ended my talk or to stand for parents I like to think that maybe it was worth the the twenty five minutes I've just spent a sharing that with an abbreviated version with you um but now I'd like to go to the phones if you especially are the parent or somebody if you've got a college kid in your life somebody you care about\n[noise] and you would like to ask questions about their future career their existing ... if they're there they're existing\nWeren't anything related to career for a college student in graduate school student on how to help them launched their career better or already readjust um that's particularly a value of course you've got any career question I'm pleased to to answer the phone number here at work with Marty Nemko for that call them work overs is for one five\nEight four one for one three for that's for one five eight four one forty one thirty four\nAnd as well if you have any comments you know I'm like I I did it for securing a ah at my at Stanford talk and there were lots of good questions if you've got a question about what I said earlier comments that's also welcome the phone number again ... W and work with Marty Nemko four and five\nEight four one for one three for\n[noise] um those are viewer regular listeners to the show no that I uh I Believe in tweeting\nUm since two thousand nine I have posted five thousand one hundred and sixty tweets as of today and they and the reason I like doing it because they are ... my best ideas\nAnd um periodically on this show I share what I think the best and most relevant to career and I'm going to ... I'm going to share the best of the current\nCrop but as usual my priorities you might get a listener so I'll go up the phone number and they go right to the phones if you have a question about your career especially if you ah have a a question about a a college student or graduate school student who you care about who's in your life or you're one\nOf course if you're a college graduate student anything related to your career directly or indirectly fair game the phone number for one five eight four one for one three for what's that the number four cinema or for what I call that work over here in K O W N this show work with Marty Nemko for one five\nEight four one for one three four and now to the phones welcome to the show and it's your turn on the air what's on your mind\n[noise] um my name is Benjamin I have a daughter just started college or high school she was studying it attacked mostly [laughter]\nAnd listening to your discussion of future proved job and I kinda think that will work as kind of future pre position but but maybe you could share your your opinion there\nI'm agnostic or one of my axiom is is that any job where the work product can be sent over the Internet\nWill be sent to low cost countries and there is no especially as ever more information ever more what used to be you know printed documents or you know used to be microfiche locally you know so much is digitized now and the\nI mean are kind of short that that does include some things that are just like straight paper but there's there's other things that you might find in in in an archive that\nI'm an of borderline art objects and things like that\nThat or in the case of um my father who works at a museum where she's dealing with actual artifacts that are not really despite quality but are there for research purposes\nMuch of that again is did you can get digitize so if I Am running a museum in this case here in San Francisco that moment in the cause of hiring a or are convinced in America might be eighty thousand a year\nPlus benefits rights of trauma nation it sets et cetera and I can get a low level in turn to digitize all of those OJ dart\nAnd for a cat for character is for a categorization is creating systems for record keeping\nCertainly some of it of course some of it has to be done locally and understand that\nBut I worry that it to larger percentage could be digitized and off shored so I'm more nervous about that than a career that cannot as like for example as I mentioned things like program evaluation politician medical equipment repair\nBut right now I'm hearing a little echoing have you turn down your radio\nYes sir okay good please go ahead so you're an award winning writer I there is kind of was that can we can you please repeat\nThat I'm an award winning writer and author owner of a company called ... which is okay ... magazine called kind of this business cards I say I take great average and your advice as your caller regarding a tobacco or\nIn the middle of the opioid epidemic I I don't think that the younger generation the ... have you tell them out of this kind of us is set and ready to be probably the tech industry a multi billion dollar industry you all ... states ultimate countries have legalized\nAnd I'm going to interrupt you because it's all out back for the show the shows about careers I'm not going to hear a we're not going to get in a debate about cannabis thank you for the\nCall has all the lines of letter that let's go back to the phones welcome to work with Marty Nemko your turn on the air how can I help you\nOkay and it's at Miami it is you hello\nHi okay it's a sign of San Diego state taking civil engineer okay I was I was wondering if it's your turn out or is that going to go find a way computers or wherever\nI don't think so I mean it's ... for example some areas of civil engineers will likely to continue to be useful for civil engineers and woman who have done on very major construction project\nAnd I really don't do things that it's clear you know given the you know maybe it's because I sit and good luck to get takes me over an hour to get here are the ten miles from my home in Oakland to to the studio [laughter]\nNo no we're not building more freeways but there's clearly going to be a commitment to more mass transit because\nJust untenable people can't move people can't go anywhere they get to work I can see their friends they can't sing [laughter] right so I Believe that a civil engineer who specializes\nHe's in in in a vector victories the direction of vector that is clearly we're society's headed especially here in the bay area in California more broadly\nI Will do fine but I that's where I talk about early specialization I don't think there's anything wrong with civil engineering but I Would rather than thinking about civil engineers you know building you know I'm more bridges more roads more ah buildings I Would try to focus is specialize early she he or she can always change\nIf it doesn't work but I Would start by trying in his or her field work\nIn their term papers in their projects whatever to for example specializes in I'm In ... in mass transit like you know light rail or whatever it is that makes sense\nYeah it's great All right thanks a lot of people\nJust see where you know what's her background [laughter]\nWell so what you know of course every kid as I mentioned earlier every kid who's interested in ... say in a field as a civil engineering\nShould simply soured by ... on the on your column the kids' college website there is going to be a section for civil engineering and there's going to be usually a section and says careers that civil engineers can do\nBut that's the starting place but then after that there's no reason why he or she shouldn't simply put in quotes civil engineering and then careers and you will in the first Google Search results you will find both text\nAnd videos that are going to expose him or her to a wide range of options that go well beyond what what you might have thought of does that make sense\n... thanks so much You're welcome back to the phones welcome to work\nMarty Nemko it's your turn on the air how can I help you\nThank you um [noise] I've been a reluctance to call for a while now because I'm a little bit afraid of uh what you might\nSay okay I'll Try to be nice uh but I'll be happy to be honest one thing I have to do is beyond well saying that you're a straight\nShooter and I appreciate that I don't always agree with with what you say but I I think you're you're really I appreciate your honesty I Do draw um here's the situation I I'll be fifty in a few months mhm\nI'm looking at a career change mhm I'm and I'm realizing it's a lateral move and I'm financially being completely honest it doesn't make a lot of sense [laughter] um it's something that I find rewarding and I'm\nA I'm getting a lot of encroachment timing it feels like it could it could be very gratifying\nPeacefully they tell me what you're doing now and tell me what you're trying to ... I\nI work as an interpreter I've been working as an interpreter for a mere ... almost Twenty years now\nForeign language sign language what what kind of interpreted\nBy a court interpreting\nCorporate okay great\nYeah so you know it's it's given me you know pensions some security to the degree that that any job of securities based like you know um and the practical thing for me to do it would be to finish up my time with my court service than a retire if\nIt's a that's not entirely satisfying to me and I'm interested in speech pathology um\nI went back and I got a second degree in speech pathology I'm looking at grad school ...\nThe reality is that going back to grad school means going without an income for three years there's an opportunity costs to that yeah and once I'm done with that um even in the best case scenario I Am looking at um not increasingly earning potential over what I'm I'm currently pursuing\nDecreasing it perhaps yeah and you were fifty four year old ... speech therapy is competing with people in their twenties and thirties and much as we don't like to admit it is you know it's not respects against you but but being a newbie ... one strike\nAgainst you well I I should say that that I mean this when I was looking at what after things I might do it does feel like this is a field where my age might not count against me but it might be an asset\nIf you're dealing with the ... their speech therapist who work with stroke patients yeah an older people on your age and\nWe have our I'm doing volunteer hours in rehab center it's great I really liked the population in ... indigent care if it feels right okay I'm On that kind of social personal level\nHave you had done a thorough search to find if there are programs you could do depending on your economic situation how much you that opportunity costs lost income during those three years or their part time night a weekend or what are called a synchronous programs that can be done twenty four seven you could doom and you you know in your pajamas at midnight\nHave not and there were no search about whether the yeah ... and\nThey're they're really not the strongest programs and I think it's going to be pretty much a full time commitment for three years and then we'll be very little limited opportunity um for outside work\n... defining strongest\nNot to say they're not destroying these programs to find that for him because that could well different things\nOn it I I I question the academic rigor of some of the programs I think at the undergrad level perhaps there would be good on line programs available that what I Would pursue that if I were in that position but for the graduate work it doesn't really\nSeem to me that particularly with this kind of work with so much of it is about rapport building working directly with with clients\nUm I think it really needs to be in person\nMight come to an might tend to uh\nDismissed those so quickly as somebody very familiar with quote rigorous programs rigor is not necessarily defined by practical utility that ability if you say you and you're correct so much of what working with any patient is or any client is understanding the psychology getting them unstuck getting them motivated\nThat is something that is more likely to be taught well by a master practitioner then by somebody who would be a faculty member at a quote rigorous university at UC Berkeley or San Francisco state you know where to eat where research in theoretical work is so central to their hiring and promotion\nSome of these NO NAME places\nMight indeed have mastered practitioners places that crappy you know did don't like National University sounds terrible right but National University very often will hire and I don't know I don't know you know if they have a program on speech pathology\nBut they have um they hire master practitioners who may be better for training you on how to develop that report or in the day in the ins and outs than than professional ... um am I missing something here\nNo I think you might be ... generally speaking but I think and with with speech and particular um I don't doubt that the progress like have great faculty but I I don't think that I'm going to get what I'm looking for\nOkay because I Want push out looking for it even those online programs have plenty of field work in internships as supervised work where you're getting that in person work I'm just trying to avoid you're spending three years of no income\nAnd in classes that may in fact be more theoretical I Can't tell you how many people who have gone to Ivy League schools for let's say you know medical schools talking about something just really practical and how much they learned that his irrelevant to the day to day practice of being great with their patients\nI I get that completely I see that up so I guess the issue of practicality as if that's foremost on my mind because it's like I started out in art school [laughter] with my first study so I don't I don't mean to go to art school again\nThere's two kinds of practicality there is which career is likely to be your income and then there's the practicality of

work life all of our work lives welcome to work with Marty Nemko [noise]\n\nABC is twenty twenty did a feature on John chambers called the best boss in America maybe that's not surprising in that he grew Cisco Systems from four hundred employees to more than Seventy thousand more than ten thousand of whom became millionaires\nAnd Cisco wind from conducting a thousand devices to the Internet which is cool was formed to more than two hundred and thirty\nBillion today and\nInfrastructure for the both of the world's Internet traffic\nAnd then start up world quote we don't just make routers and\nSwitches were changing the way people work live play and lower end quote legendary cleaner Perkins chair Jon Dore gold that book quote a must read on best practices for any manager\nBut get this John chambers has been an adviser to Presidents Clinton and Bush\nFrench President a crumb Indian prime minister Narendra Modi Israeli president a Nobel Peace prize winner Shimon Peres\nAnd King Abdullah of Jordan so it's not surprising that he was named one of the time magazine's one hundred most influential people\nIn the world chambers now runs a company called Jaycee to that invest in what he believes are next big things from stopping drones from terrorizing us\nUsing crickets as a source of food protein what you believed on this show I Will dare to sample\nThem that much [laughter]\nI'll have with you [laughter] this is not just some fly in the night for the New York times recently touted but what can John chambers teach not just leaders but all of us about why he's working NY is living\nWith me in the studio is chairman of merit us of Cisco Systems and author of the just published connecting the dots John chambers walking to work with Marty Nemko\nMarty it's going to be found I can tell already we're going to have a great give and take\nI Know it off the air we were great [laughter] I was really do is really a ... it really is a privilege you know\n... All right here we go now whether it's a company or an individual that's had a downturn\nYour advice is to remain in the book you say you've got to assess how much of the problem is you and how much of the problem is external now in terms of your own introspection what would you say you've personally had to work on\n\nI think specifically answer your question ah what I had to work on is at times two thousand and one is an example I became too dependent upon the data\nAnd felt that the data had all the answers and so when you grow a company from dirty as you said earlier Seventy million in sales to forty seven billion dollars and you're good at sixty five percent a year in your accuracy of the forecast is amazing because you can get data in real time at a time than other people are just getting their data on facts\nAnd I was sure the data would tell me if there was a problem and it did not\nAnd in January of two thousand and even though our stock was dropping we were still growing it's Seventy percent in the first week of January [noise] by the third week we're dropping minus thirty we've never had negative growth ever [noise]\nAnd so uh what I learned is it's important to trust your data and your analytics if you will but it's also to constantly test and the market to see something if you're missing\nLesson learned for me the great recession of two thousand eight came we called up the summer of two thousand seven we said there's something wrong with the financial markets and everybody said no my numbers for the quarter really good\nAbove expectations but I said there's something wrong in the enterprise especially financial markets we could have a problem coming\nAnd they said no once again this is Cisco and and you're you're going to be wrong and sure enough within nine months we were in the greatest recession so I learned not just to trust my data but to be able when I got data to go out and listen to the customers about what makes sense\nSays listen to the customers and everybody says they do and reality most companies have the hubris to think maybe in the beginning will do a little bit of a market research and then the end they don't talk to customers very much first of all is my em influence accurate about that yeah it is I think\nBut he ... it took him seven years\nAnd he was amazing ah almost everything I Do I can tell you which customer recommended it which customers said square one of the I went under ... companies we did I can tell you which one said John you're you're quoting needs to be improved\nI can tell which ones they created a problem we help them through together so customer driven but the data that you're giving his right\nOn on the surveys have seen eighty percent of CEOs leave they delivered spirit customer service right yet when you contact their customers that consumers less than ten percent of the consumers later so\nThis is where you shouldn't believe your own marketing and it's so important as the c._e._o. especially in today's world to listen to all\nThe feedback to your company regardless of where it's a very small company are very big\nYou know there is so much of a tendency to BS the leaders whether it's your own employees who you know we say we where we want to hear people who disagree with us and if we got a big customer we ... we we say we really want to hear but most people like to be asked to\nHow do you what's the ... you come from West Virginia from a small with how do you get people to be really honest with you\nWell I think it has to do the leaders without realizing actually signal to their their teams whether they want candid exchange\nVery first time I met Jeff Welsh and many of your your viewers are we're not even listening or or maybe even born when Jack was such a great leader in Nineteen says on the show they were they when he was that he would basically any session with these people I went up to each one of the classes ... for him\nAnd he and his team were argument like I had not seen a line and and boy they went back and forth and back and forth and finally they agreed and they move forward\nAnd I said jak how do you do that he said that's the culture we have\nAnd then I said what's your biggest weakness watching to see how he would be with his team he said my biggest weakness is when I see somebody really super smart and good communicator I assume they could also be great and operations and let them go to long before I change if I looked at his team and they all said exactly\nSo I think leaders who are doing their jobs have to be secure in their jobs because the security issue and you've got to realize the only way you stay ahead as the market transitions write better than your counterparts\nSo the ability to listen and create what I call constructive friction actually like but once we're through the discussion there is no passive aggressive behavior we move toward a common goal and I think if you talk to people out of Cisco for the\nTwenty five years that I led the company or you would find that it was a family we didn't always agree or Indian I got to make the calls but it was an ability to have that healthy given taken before it and by the way that given takes safe you it isn't just a better writer in your company it saves you\nWant you to get specific with me and can you think of one example where someone of your employees or customer so John you're full of your dead wrong about this and we should do it this way and why and you actually change as a result in rather than fire the woman or man\nYeah well first I'd never raise my voice and I've heard that now by the way that does not mean that I don't have extremely high expectations that talk this six CEOs of start ups today that I'm coaching and the expectations were very high but I Believe that's not effective communications in fact a communications as you get the outcome that you want\nAnd don't be leaving ruined by fear right ah I Believe and ruined by logic and trust in India and I'll still make the call and say here's what we need to go\nBut an example would be very early on Nineteen Ninety three ah the first decision I make as I said we're not building routers we're building the Internet which are changed the way you work live learn and play\nAnd we have to change our position to that and even my marketing team didn't like that really didn't like it at all and then I said we can't be a router company we've got to go past switching company and then she read in the book I got some resistance especially on the company that I slacked than to go after yet those were two of the most fundamental moves that that we've ...\nTwo thousand they not only did we call it ahead of time and having gotten burned in two thousand one remember I wrote down two point five billion in him a twenty two thousand one [noise] ah and that's a lot of money even for the most valuable companies in the world most profitable or two thousand eight accident accredited automotive companies\nAnd several of my team including my board challenged me a little bit on that said John did you not learned from two thousand one I said yes I did this time I saw it coming\nThis time my peers are pulling out of their financial support for the companies and this time or I'm going to do the reverse I'm going to be a great partners automotive companies just like they did a great partnership me fast forward\nAll the automated companies made it through fast forward I was the number one player and every one of automotive companies now that doesn't mean that sometimes I get it wrong\nYou know flip camcorder I Love the concept I liked it but the minute associate jobs out maneuvers ACLU's the business and so when I get it wrong or fail fast is an important aspect but know that\nThat's exactly this is exactly you inject growth was on the show he had the ... he had this nickname called neutron jak for being a guy who did get rid of his bottom ten or twenty percent of people want a regular basis and I said how do you feel when when they call you knew from Jack and he said you know I'm proud of it says not everybody's meant to work a GE\nHe says you know our our code the remaining coworkers feel much more pride if I get rid of the the ones who are not strong my customers get a better prop when I first came over to G. E. R. at Consumer Reports are refrigerated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd you've got electric car and I said ... and I do and you always let me call him by his first name and he's he he's just been almost like a father to me in so many ways and so generous with his time and he thought process and he said\nI Want to go see it drive it and I said a ...\nOver the foremost ... Mr President your security team told me I cannot move you off the top three rooms here\nAnd he said John on the wrestling I said I said and so we started down when he was death came running up to me quitting since John we're not prepared for this but secondly something you need to know\nHe hasn't had a license for ten years he cannot drive the car [laughter] this is going to be interesting but he was so curious and at that time you're talking about late eighties early nineties and yet he was thinking like a teenager\nAnd dreaming big dreams and he has the same philosophy that do and I learned part of the front of me my regret isn't that dream too big that says going occasionally miss I Wish I Dream bigger and I wished on this more\nAnd he taught me that in in so many unique\nWay I Want to talk about creating a store to coach because that's where the drugs can recreate and the fact that is the name of the book who is the ... the author said book who is my\nGuest fellow Taipei [laughter] time to move to vote somebody in the energy [laughter] that is correct chairman emeritus of Cisco his book connecting the dots lessons for leadership in\nA startup world let's start micro and then we'll get ... I got there are many people who you are listening to the show who are either in startups contemplating Serbs or whatever\nYou were running a company that is you were kind of supervising you if you will ... of a bunch of companies that are start ups what do you want to tell our listeners about something that's not obvious about how to make a startups ...\nWell it starts with something Marty that that is basic but most people don't take time to analyze and\nYou've got to get a market in transition business model wise or health care wise or government wise and combine it with the technology that's new and transition big data a security if you will artificial intelligence markets to infringe give me an example what is that a ... a company like Wal Mart that is about to get Amazon we saw I was on the board of Walmart\nAnd we saw it coming in and famous just brilliant good people and we saw Amazon coming and we could not get out of their way and it took them Twenty one years to have the same pass the market cap of Walmart much valuable company in the world that time\nAnd it took 'em what ...\nFourteen years to pass GM and it took over seven years to pass Tesla the pace of change is changing which such tremendous speed those are technology enabled market transitions in the automotive industry\nOr in the area of retail this is going to happen to every industry so the first thing I said a start up\nAnd I met her in West Virginia or do buy a\nNew Delhi or where Silicon Valley is tell me what the transition is you're working on because you haven't got a transition you're probably not going to be exciting\nExample of a transition in one of your companies that's that you that you were\nAbout security ah here's a phone not it's the only to the best of my knowledge gets announced him are I'd say a safe cases they had the concept of from a company called ... we had Seventeen people when I got an additional him now they're over\nFifty people but you basically side you're African straight into this case and you close it and nobody\nCan tap into your voice or tap in to turn it on your cameras et cetera and much of your audience I Know might be millennials they're going to say well that doesn't bother me\nIt will bother you we can no longer take your smartphone to work because your employer especially if you're in defense or in business isn't going to allow devices that crack spyware so quickly and faces to it so the inflection point is it's transitional cybersecurity done through hard\nAnd this is one Marty that this when I tried to say no to so many times in Canada you my curiosity and and my weakness for dreaming big got the better of me\nAnd we basically are we're at the Clinton Global initiative in member I'm a moderate Republican uh in terms of opposition dangerous species here in California Clinton didn't you didn't you vote for Hillary Clinton you look at that time and I understand that voted for a for a Democrat for president but\nYou're in ... I'm kind of in a tough spot because I Believe strongly and strong defense than a little regulation on business a and a strong education in choice and sexual orientation and immigration are especially high skilled immigration\nSo as I look at this session the Clinton Global initiative I'd been asked to be on a panel with the person who want it three years before and we judge twenty five thousand companies to the top five star ... the top one got a a million dollars and that went down for one for helping to start out\nThe person that was shocked me was the one that won at three years earlier\nWith cricket farming ... I thought that's neat next issue [laughter] watch how he asked a question and then he said John can actually tell you about my company my curiosity got the best of me I said you can tell me\nBut I understand this isn't my sweet spot not invest and I don't understand anything about crickets and farming is nice but don't know a long story short\nAs he got me to understand it was electric and finally it was about Internet of things that was about digital stations about growing critics fifty percent faster it was about saving the planet because you can develop a given amount of protein at one time at the one tenth the environmental damage that we do with me I'm a meat eater and it's a cleaner protein but more effective for your kids than plant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse me or that the major thing you have to do is here's the plan to get here you outline division almost right the press release before you make the first move on the jets game and then you your regular report how do we do it\nAnd you bring our nation together with Democrats Republicans say who doesn't want to create jobs their kids why should this be a partisan issue let's get the regulation down which is real problem let's create an environment where start ups have a chance to be successful let's do a student debt which is a real problem for Americans being so deep and dad about the time they would normally do start up\nThere saying how do I get my kids through school\nSo I think that there's probably five to seven things that we can go after aggressively I Hope both parties would do this together I'm an inclusion or a person and uh uh I'm a believer that the only way you can do something this fundamental is for the majority of people in the country to come together behind it\nOne of the things you listed there and that you also emphasizing the book and I've read a quote here from it which says quote in the book by the way it is a is John chambers connecting the dots lessons for leadership and started world but he also looks more broadly including an education he wrote\nThe K. twelve education system in the U.S is broken and in need of dramatic repairs and ... well the U.S spends number one or number two per capita on education in the world yet we score near the bottom among developed nations so it's less of a money question\nThan an ally location questions so now if you were the US's educations are what would be your first crowd sourced edict elaborate or be inclusive leading\nThe asset of as our comes in and do a ... even a present tries to come in and do this they'll get chewed up because of all the issues of an incumbent system that was designed for the past not for the future and I admire what our teachers have done in America and I want to thank them for giving back\nBut we have to redo the whole curriculum system\nAh we we spend that much money are but we do the poorest job many of the textbooks that might have actually you know you might have used during school\nAnd so we have to think about how do you teach entrepreneurship how do you teach education how do you teach technology in a way that's exciting not just something the geeky as over to decide do you got to outline a vision on it and both parties need to come together I think America's ready for this\nAnd I also want to lower the pressure on us if France can do this\nAnd if indeed came with one point three billion people tell me why America the innovation nation in the world can't fix its education system and become a startup nation again\nHere you know I'm not as that that sounds a little to pat for me okay what it's worth\nYou talk about you mentioned in past week we could teach at entrepreneurship well you know\nThe people who tend to go into teaching tend to be very anti capitalist very anti corporate so and have a business sense and the professors who tend to create the K. twelve curriculum also never met a liberal arts didn't like the quadratic equations they like Shakespeare that like the pope and Asian wars and the word entrepreneurship\nFor them as a almost a dirty word mhm how would you try to go but I mean that I Do also believe that ethical entrepreneurship no is ultimately not only a job creator but it is what is enabled that iPhone ... you're talking about as you even the crickets to solve the protein problem in developing nations\nBut how do you get the education system that is lard with anti people who think that entrepreneurship is half what it was pretty much a dirty word what do you do about this well\nSeveral things and and he raised probably a question we can talk about do as just on the question but taking um Canada in reverse order you raised them number one companies have to just do the right thing\nAnd what Cisco did is we were always one of the best of getting back we went every corporate social responsibility a word that was from the Clinton or a secretary of state and President Obama to George Bush in ...\nAlways that look like what we're doing the right thing regarding education reform bill\nOh about a million New Yorker ran right on network academies where they could get a job for where the jobs are going to go in the future\nBut you need to get a small working group together the outline what do we want the outcome to be and you've got to catch the diversity and especially the young women in the second third and fourth grade by the time they get to high school and college it's too late to get in the interest and excitement\nAnd you've gotten to his action figures where it makes the Sicily in terms of what you talk about and then you've got to reward the states or the districts within the states that take the risk\nExcept and you've gotta have courage and ideas are going to feel some of them\nAnd as a society instead of minute one fails everybody jumps on says see I told you it wouldn't work\nBecome a started nation actually a number of them to fail let's go for it and what is the downside of\nThe worst thing you can do is do the right thing to long we are in that case we have nobody to blame but ourself have ten years from now we're not generating twenty five to thirty million jobs a decade in another twenty million to displace the workers that are going to be\nOut of the results of digital station artificial intelligence we know what's coming yet nobody's stepping up the plan now to do it we've come to short term focus [noise] ah I Want\nTo get back to some of them I'm very sensitive to my listeners who all four hour of dealing with their day to day work life issues and all this ... very high minded macro talk may be seen as out of touch so I'm going to get very specific for a moment\nYou said in your book that the Internet of things is going to be a bigger deal than the Internet\nOr in terms of jobs in whatever what should my listeners know about the future of jobs in the world of the Internet of things\nThey're going to be dramatically different than today tell me more let me be realistic you in coal mine in West Virginia even if it comes back and you find a way to clean coal or something like that they're going to be human as much as\nThe equipment whopper rate ah drones will be all over the place it's like at an FAA flight zone in a pet store in in an area so you've got to see

R. W. this is left right and center\n[noise] welcomes waste special edition of KCRW was left right center decisions decisions I mean do you live from the commonwealth club in San Francisco [noise]\n\nAlways left right and center as you're civilized provocative an antidote to self contained opinion bubbles the dominant political debate I'm Josh Barrow your host your center and business columnist at New York magazine on the right as making McConnell Washington Post columnist on the left is Ana Marie Cox host of with friends like these and columnist for ... girls\nAnd please join me in welcoming our first to special guest Ken white criminal defense attorney and my co host on our special left right and center series all the president's lawyers and Kim Miller Republican strategist and former communications director for Jeb Bush [noise]\n\nWelcome everybody I Want to start by talking about President Trump's taxes or rather his father's taxes the New York times published this expos a fourteen thousand words I Hope you will read it in its entirety\nAnd it describes how Trump's parents passed an enormous fortune hundreds of millions of dollars down to Donald and his siblings well paying very little state or gift tax this of course runs contrary to Trump's self mythology as a man who got rich starting with only a million dollar loan\nThe ... the tax strategies the times describes many of them are aggressive but some of them of the times felt comfortable calling outright fraud including a scheme to disguise gifts by inflating business expenses the Trump children would invoices or the parents buildings evading taxes in the process\nOf making the wall Street Journal ran a column by Holleman Jenkins that mocked the times for expecting quote rigid adherence for the law is this like is this normal rich person behavior should we be outraged by this\nWell okay let's let's there are a couple of things going on I mean the first is look it is true that tax the tax code is so complicated that like there is no hard bright line\nAnd not all but then as you can tell some things you can tell right if you have the money acts lawyers would they would take to differ I wouldn't let you have money in a Swiss bank account and like you're not paying taxes on it that's just illegal and we know that but things like transfer pricing things like your kids haven't company that bills you\nThings like having your kids on the payroll of your company\nThere are actually quite complicated tasks for whether those things are fraudulent or not\nUm and so I think what this actually indicates is\nThe complexity in our tax code which is there to try to sort of squeeze every last dollar out of companies and so forth is that it would be better if we the simpler tax code that just tax income when it hit a person regardless of who that person was and so and so you could still have a progressive income tax and get rid of the corporate income tax\nWhich would there then lay and get rid of the estate tax and treat estates and also as income if you did that then there would be no kind of arbitrage between trying to take this basically a one of the things that sort of under discuss this was tax arbitrage right you're you're paying the money to him in income rather than inheritance because inheritance has a higher tax rate\nSo if you just haven't won tax rate\nFor everything there wouldn't be all of these opportunities all of these these\nKind of games that we have to argue about whether they're fraud or not ... ... what did you make of that because I found you know reading this long article ... there was a lot of stuff that sounded like basically just what rich people do with their money but there was some of it that sounded like no this is not something that everybody does this was very unusual quite fraudulent behavior\nThat most rich owners of buildings in New York would not have thought they could get away with yeah there is a mix of stuff\nThat you get audited for if they catch and stuff you get indicted for if they catch and they have the resources to go after you so some of the things that were described in that article or a classic frauds games you know in inflating invoices undervaluing a property is by far\nThe ten that get you prosecuted in any context including the tax and the reason you do it is because the IRS investigates\nSuch a tiny percentage of people audit so few of them and criminally investigates even fewer but it's absolutely the type of conduct that if my clients get caught doing it and uh someone from iris the ideas come knocking I'm telling you I'm a I'm a need a pretty big deposit\nFor that [laughter] ... it was at one point your job to stop Donald Trump from becoming\nDrags out here firing the race and so\nThis is you know one in in many store a line of very long line of stories about either that Donald Trump's businesses were any or that his businesses were not terribly successful and there's just you know endless stories like this but I think part of why the story\nDidn't get as much attention as it feels like it ought to have this even though it was huge news in certain ways it felt like old news and people always assumed that Trump was cheating and the trumpet really inherited a lot of money even though they claim they didn't\nSo I guess the question is how do when you were trying to get people to care about this sort of thing\nHow did how did voters feel about that [noise] you know\nOne of the things that we ended up unfortunately been kind of an unknown I Know that was one swing voters actually thought about this I I thought it was one of the bigger failures of a of the Hillary campaign and they're super PAC was that they didn't even try to really run ads on this they didn't try to message against that\nWe did a bit in the primary what we found was that primary voters just didn't buy it right Republican primary voters saw rich guy the ... festival guy\nAnd I'm you know they they saw these schemes was kind of general the way you do business if you're somebody like Donald Trump\nI I don't know that that\nWould have translated into a general election audience that's kind of an unknown known a few hours as Rumsfeld would say um but I Would I think that the times story brought up for me\nWas I felt like there was a lack of interest among the press corps in in pressing him on his business interests because they felt like these stories landed with a good ... and here's the thing there's this big open question uh what what we now know is that from Trump or a engaged in some\nEthically dubious maybe fraudulent they'd be illegal schemes\nI've pretty much everybody on the stage agrees that if we opened up the book of the Trump Organization that and he was not the president that he would be in handcuffs\nLike I I don't think that anybody thinks the Donald Trump was not engaging in illegal activity at the Trump Organization a bud ... a a from a campaign standpoint he managed to get away with it because voters didn't care but but you know there should be another standard of of groups of people who care leads to care if voters don't care\nSo what's what's the play here for Democrats what should the media will be doing that it's not I mean if it feels like this is something that should hurt the president hurt Republicans politically and yet it's not one off\nLike definitely I guess I Believe in the broken windows theory of tax fraud which is that we should care and that you care about the little things it's not you don't do sort of jury nullification arguments about tax fraud like if it's something illegal it's illegal and we should find out more about it\nUm and I do think that this is a problem I think Tim Israelis are it in on what the problem for the presses which is that uh if you think of ... no one's gonna care about a story like even if it's a big story like you have less incentive to do it I mean I think the time should be you know I mean\nI have mixed feelings about this because I I feel like they did all this work and they put all this energy into it they took these reporters off their beach for almost a year and put all these resources in the paper and not only the statute of limitations passed on to tax fraud but it's passed on people's attention spans like it's just I also think\nIt it just falls into a category ... by the way I wasn't trying to say that like what he did was okay I was trying to say it's really complicated to sort out which basket things within the times article falls and fall into some of them are shady and some of them seem to be clearly illegal\nUm but you know there's this category and journalism called me go my eyes glaze over and taxes are just in that category trying to get anyone to care about taxes I've been trying for like Seventeen years now\nAnd it's just really difficult because it's complicated because you do explain all of these you know and it will carry forward was one of the things that he got paid for by the times earlier rate\nAnd people just don't care and I don't know why they don't care but you cannot get them to pay attention I think\nOne issue here might be the fact that we sort of created a culture where people think of tax fraud as being like if you're rich enough to get away with it like I Want aspire to that I Want to fire to tax\nFraud\nAnd we don't think it was always on the Republican primary for good for you know making\nWas talking about it also is sort of like we've we've we've made it like well and tax fraud who cares about talked about but you may if you turn it into like he took money out of the pockets of people like you know people don't think of it that are a lot of people don't know if I had asked me what I Would do that and it's just it's just the ... the low level you know like if you're paying\nThe handyman in your house in cash and you're not paying sales tax and he's not reporting that income people behave like this in a in a very small way and their personal lives and I think imagine that if they were very rich they would behave like a very large way they don't think they're taking money out of somebody's pocket when they don't pay sales tax on September\n... like I ... it's hard for me to it because I spent so much time and\nTwenty sixteen criticizing him for everything and and for the the way he was ... his\nHis contractors and suppliers and I thought that was going to land and it didn't and when he didn't chandelier guy when he didn't he he like he still has to all of these small businessmen in Atlantic City\nAnd when it came down to and I'm not sure how much of this was motivated reasoning and how much of this was really true but there was a sense that like all these rich guys cheat anyway right and so I'm not\nInvestigation this complexity typically would be a but you know a month law and this type of thing when he's doing things behind the scenes as nothing doesn't signify anything\nThe other thing about ... cells Trump that's related to this is is less I think about the excitement among the base but more about the fact that we're talking less about Donald Trump\nAnd and you saw this in twenty sixteen where anytime from was in the news for a given week his poll numbers with ... a little bit because you know while we were a polarized country this is a small percentage of people that hate Donald Trump and also hate the Democrats and so when Donald Trump's on the TV all the time that I I really dislike the Scott\nBut when he's not when Brett Kavanaugh is on TV all the time they start to forget like we've all turned into Donald Trump a little bit we all of the memory of him that now in cycles\nAnd so this habit and twenties sixteen where the the Access Hollywood tape happened three weeks out and and it was like Donald Trump's done and then he behaved for two and a half weeks paid for him right uh and and didn't make a ton of news and

Republican strategist to Miller is with us and I want to welcome ... Lopez who is senior finance correspondent for Business Insider\nAs we tape on Thursday evening the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen Thirteen hundred points and two days and\nPresident Trump knows why\nWe have an interest rates going up and then flipped that's much faster than certainly a lot of people including myself would have anticipated I think the sun is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nWith the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates although not all that quickly and not this week what has happened is long term interest rates have been going up a lot on the open market and that's bad for stocks and it makes it more expensive to get a mortgage but it also might be necessary if the fed is going to have to keep raising rates in order to stop inflation\nMaking is is Trump right about the fed have they been raising interest rates to much are they screwing up for things for him politically by pushing the stock market out in inflation is\nNot particularly high and you know like the fat likes to to run the you know they want to nip it in the ... I Want to get ahead of if they want to get ahead of of of inflation's like maybe they're a little too tight and it's\nSort of hard to judge rate 'em but whether or not they're wrong Trump is wrong to go after them right because then the independence of the Federal Reserve having an independent central bank was a tremendous achievement\nAnd it took decades to build up the credibility that the president does not interfere with interest rates I mean like fat you know Nixon's Federal Reserve was like a little too close with Nixon and that was really bad for the country\nAnd he should keep his hands off of the ... the same reason that he shouldn't say many of the things that he says I'm because he is chipping away really important civic institutions that are important for our economy that are important for a civic society they're important for our democracy um do I expect him to like\nHave a change of heart and realize that challenging that independence as a bad idea no but you know in an ideal world where Donald Trump listen to someone\nI wouldn't do that so that the funny thing here is that the fed at least ... for an institution in Washington seems to basically ignore the president when he runs his mouth like threat so that part or or like arguably one could actually see the fed being like oh yeah\nYou see this\nJust to prove that the president is not telling them what you heard that that's like some people's real concern oh well that's this is where this is where the tradition that the president doesn't comment on interest rates comes from it or not it doesn't go back to George Washington we didn't have his even back back then it's not in the constitution\nIt was the Clinton Administration and the reason they did it was the George each W. Bush spent a lot of Nineteen Ninety two complaining that interest rates are too high and the fed was too worried about inflation or should be cutting rates\nAnd the perception was that the fed had actually become more reluctant to cut rates because they thought if they did it with\nDidn't talk about interest rates not because he was super disciplined and carry thought it would actually interfere with the fed doing what he wanted but so I mean if we set aside should the president be talking about this you are you actually sort of think that he's right about the merits you're right the like the fed has been I can too fast they are\nTo their two arguments and Wall Street has no idea which one is right and one is at inflation Israel and so you should keep hiking and the other is that you know we just have too many bonds because central the central banks are buying them any more than ... easing program is pretty much done and so\nYou know we have all the supply and we don't have anybody who wants to buy them so maybe you know you you don't hike rates\nYou have to what that means basically because there's so many bonds out there that the fed is you know it doesn't it's not a market buying them anymore that interest rates will go up on their own as those bonds and he defined by the ... is basically putting too much fuel on the fire by by hiking itself but\nThen again nobody actually knows if that's true and the Donald Trump definitely doesn't know of that so I don't know what he's talking about and there are a lot of economists and there are a lot of people and I I you know in my reporting go away I Do is I call around and\nAsk people and if some of the smartest people on Wall street on any answer this question then Donald Trump certainly does it\nSo you know we ... either way interest rates grow up we get we get a stock sell off\nWhy because of the way that corporate balance sheets are now you know interest rates are low they borrowed a lot interest rates are going up they're going to have to pay back that get they have them it's going to be more expensive for them so margins are going to get that are so stocks are going to go down\nIt's not rocket science and um it and it's not something that we can really help because this is the way that things were set up\nA sign of the the funny thing here for me is that you know I mean the president is right that the higher rates are pushing stocks down enough kind of embarrassing for him the remarkable thing is the fed is run by the guy he picked to run it that's the fire the fed cherry hired a new fed chair and then the other thing that's kind of weird for Trump is he's mad at the fed\nWon't really go after drone Powell the fed chairman that personally in fact he did this like I'm not bad I'm just disappointed bit\nWhich is not really a thing Donald Trump does he's doing it with the fed chairman\nNow this is one of the things that he believes forever like he's had this theory to the extent it's a theory about monetary policy like for yeah it's been like it's like the human body is a battery theory than\nLow interest rates because he's used to being a guy who was in debt and I are as money so he's he's he's a low interest rate but it's one of those\nCases where he has his policies when the few things it's like in a constant for him he really really generally believe that he's just like not bothered to set up a government that would enact the policy he cares about what he just has a belief\nThat general broad general description of higher or a cat and mouse game or a Woodward book that why does he believe the things we don't know he's just believed him for Thirty years\nOn rural like this is him or the same as a matter even maps earlier like this was Donald Trump view of two modes argue about helping me or somebody that's hurting me that's what he cares really over the long term economic benefits the obviously over here with the deficit or the death\nAnd and he doesn't care about the fed policy except to the extent but right now he thinks that of making the economy go slower and so bad that where he is he's a ... there's a there are people who are against him were buyout are hurting\nIran what about Jared the business and and the other\nThing is I feel like you know this just comes off along sort of news cycles where the president was complaining that people don't give him enough credit for how good the economy is and how strong the stock market and then you have a two day sell off and he switches to explaining how what happened to the stock market is somebody else's fault\nAnd raven up your ... your ...\nAnd there's always a tweet right like there isn't there he doesn't have a tweet about the president should be impeached the stock market like tanks\nA thousand points that you're always\nA treat so I'm so drawn\nBox and that's Kanye West I'm\nCalling you a fresh off wearing his ... had the Saturday Night live he went to the White House on Thursday to meet with the president and he talked about how great the ... makes them feel\nLike everyone but\nMake me guy didn't get to see that all the time like a guy\nOn social media from my readers and so forth is like two groups of people who feel completely powerless and get outraged when you suggest that in fact\nThey have quite a bit of power in in the institutions that control and so you will say something like well you know the left is getting pretty good at shutting the right completely out of university and they'll do like what about southern governorships right and and vice versa the right to spite controlling\nBoth houses of Congress the presidency and now the Supreme Court really feels like liberals have won the culture war and are just preparing to destroy them and I think that like\nThat sort of describes a lot of what his worst about our politics in this moment\nAna Marie Cox and I think that she could kind of directly to that but what they talking about a a metaphor I heard recently Democrats are pointing at the rule book screaming\nIsn't allowed to play basketball when the dog dunks on them over and over and the crowd goes why\nIs this Airbus three I Hope I mean it's like\nThree rabbit in the White House [laughter] my uh my weight of the week comes from Oliver Darcy who's a media reporter at CNN he tweeted Barnes and noble announcing a press release the political book sales have jumped fifty seven percent in twenty eight team compared to the year before\nThe retailer released this map showing which states we're interested in books critical positive of Trump and if you look at the map the map looks you really similar to the twenty sixteen election map know a few few states has flipped\nThis is still a map that would elect Donald Trump president so I Apologize\nThe Hillary Clinton lost the electoral college in Barnes and noble although I don't know maybe she won the popular vote I don't know what the totals were in in California and New York but it really illustrates the divide in the nation remains almost exactly what it was on election day almost two years ago or Tim Miller I Want to thank you very much for

I mean ... not only has issues with regulatory policy in specific cities\nBut I'm also issues with what sort of impact or they're going to have on the economy in the future with unemployment and that sort of thing um so I just think of these companies become larger and larger scale is bigger there is a definite shift in attitude I mean you can see that ... Amazon Facebook Twitter\nYou know there's been a change just in the last six months as all these tech companies or you know being forced to testify before Congress a and there's a growing sense that these are\nYou know important policy questions that they have to pay attention to what I Want to talk with you about one company that is having its own running with regulators at the SEC who are forcing some organizational changes on it which has Tesla what you've been doing a lot of really great\nReporting on and I feel like Tesla sort of embodies the same time a lot of the best and the worst of Silicon Valley like they make really innovative products that a lot of consumers are really passionate about these products could do a lot of good in the world in the long run for the environments you on a mosque is a guy who puts rockets in space he believes he's a super genius because he is at least a regular genius\nAnd yet he's on Twitter calling the tie cave rescue up guy a pedophile and announcing a take private deal with ... bragging my source says yes any\nMoney from hedge fund managers um I I think that there are two things to think about this one is the move fast and break things each house should it be applied to everything and one thing that I find in my reporting about Tesla is that\nUh the same things that people criticize has before or the the things that people love has for\n'em when Iran gotten a Joe Rogan show\nThe first thing that Joe Rogan asked Iran was\nHow do you have all the time to just\nBuild rockets and dig holes and builds cars how she was telling your amazing but you could also say how do you have\nTime for this how no seriously how do you have time to tweet and vehicles and they'll ... now how do you have time [laughter] so there are two ways to think about that there are ... you move fast the right things you could say wow it's amazing how you build a car from design to launch so fast that's amazing the\nOther thing you can says oh you built a car from lunch to design so fast yikes yikes because it's a car that\nYou know a is consistently he's\nUnder under sold or under he's under performed in what he said he was going to do studies going to make X cars he actually made much less than that and so you know shareholders starting to wonder so do you move fast and break things when you're building cars is that\nGood it does seem like a bad a phrase I specifically to cars you\nTell and John and Silicon Valley I think it's starting to try to figure out is this\nSomething that should be applied to every single industry is this something that we can use on everything and the answer might be no because you know I must might go bankrupt um but ... and the and the other thing I Want to get to is you know\nCause is it okay to\nLie to regulators are lie to shareholders as long as you're making cars that are supposed to save the world\nThere's they're making what what do you make of the the SEC is in this weird position because they're supposed to protect shareholders and the the clear judgment of the market as the shareholders are better off\nIf mosque stays a CEO and so the the SEC is sort of trying to find a way to sort of you know like rap must on the ... so that he'll stop tweeting like this can continue to hopefully run his company like an adult it's a weird position\nFor the ... they have still not found that way right I mean the boards in that position as well you know I I think the the thing about manufacturing cars at scale is really hard right it's really difficult that's why there's not that many auto manufacturers because like there's only a few firms that have ever gotten a really good at making huge numbers of cars\nSo far Tesla is not one of those firms but like\nMosques sort of ... foods

San Francisco [noise]\nYour work life all of our work lives welcome to work with Marty Nemko [noise]\n\nMost people believe they're ethical and in most black and white ... most people are [noise]\nThere are lots of gray areas and what to do in those situations [noise]\nAlready done it for five common gray area ethical dilemmas that occur in the workplace with some frequency to kick around both sides used my frequent co conspirator other showing on airing ethical person the maverick county superintendent of schools and my wife Dr ...\nAnd do you want to start by describing the first of those five ethical dilemmas\n[noise] sure [noise] um because it's one that I have faced in the past and I know I picked it yeah that\nIs you have an employee who was a an okay work or maybe not a great worker maybe even a little less than that um but they're getting by and then the person is diagnosed with cancer\nAnd start treatment\nAnd because of the treatment ... work performance really falls\nAnd particularly if they are um [noise] bringing in money yes they are a nonprofit in their job is to bring in money and that's not happening then what do you do\nTo you let them go or do you somehow try to cover for them because they need the money\n[noise] okay well we're going we're going to do to your listeners I'm going to or we're going to take turns making an argument pro and con goes the gray areas clearly they wrote who's who made on both sides and then we'll turn to you too you know you could call in and tell us what you think we're simply or think about what you think is was your approach and what you've\nDone your what you've done or maybe we'll upon but first I'm going to make the argument for retaining him I Know you did in your case to retain this person\nOr actually there were several sadly that there were that were at least three that come to mind [noise] anyway\nI'm going to make that argument and then you can make the argument against it and then most will ... come up to who loses a mother listeners away and\nThey're not even for retaining this person would be the most organizations but especially non profits in this case the examples of nonprofit person most of those nonprofits certainly espouse putting people over profits so to let that person go when he's been an acceptable performer and now as to endure treatment for re Kurd cancer\nA chemotherapy or a would be a critical especially since you know he he is in this case is family sole support and you save a little\nUh because he's worked for nonprofits and from a pragmatic standpoint letting him go is going to hurt the regret organizations morale\nAnd besides you with the let's let's just say it's not a stage one cat so which is not an issue but let's say this record and then it's in his lymph nodes it's unlikely that he'd want to or be able to stay employed for very long\nA retaining um would be inappropriate cost of doing business uh okay no Barbie you want to make the argument against retaining\nI think this is an issue that really depends on the particular workplace if you are a non profit and you are providing services to people who are very needy and the absence of\nHis ability to do his job means that many other people are left in a bad circumstance you may not have a choice or if it's at all possible I think you would try to accommodate the person as long as you can\nAh I Know in our case we had various people donate some of their sick days which is that an easy thing to do but again if you our mission is to provide services to people who are in bad shape them really need those services\nThen the only other option would be too I'm kind of change his job so that he's doing something that's less critical and\nThat you may not be able to afford it and sunny and they have to consider the good of the many over the good of one\nUm what I Would do there is try to find out what options there were for disability insurance or maybe even a worker's comp or some thing where he wouldn't the person wouldn't be laughed at without any salary or income\n[noise] okay well I'll tell you what I Would actually do in this dilemma in most situations\nUm\nI like to think that the wisest kindest approaches not to the individual who the person sitting in front of you for example em noting with interest how much of air time and the media is being spent on this one horrendously killed journalist\nWhen there are millions of people dying of other things ... and the media can be such an important vehicle for saving lives in other ways I like to think that I mean that's called utilitarian as him and I would like to think that\nI Would weigh in the situation the benefits of retaining this person\nOr and what would be the negative impacts of course you're right if I could somehow have him trade tasked with somebody else a I Would do that if like you know but I Would be trying to think largely in terms of what's going to yield the most good for the most people\nAnd yeah and then let's see if I decided I needed to terminate I'm a I Would of course explain that to everybody in the workforce so that they understand that is an ethically based in that are just a you know save money based decision\nAnd then I Would do what I could to help him find\nA iffy specially if this family needed the money or find whether it'd be giving him a generous severance package or feel like you said finding appropriate disability services it wouldn't be workers' comp because he got the cancer not because of the workplace probably\nSay no no fly it depends on where the perfect and we're feeling\nYeah if you're at a factory breathing carcinogenic chemicals but he ... and Kelly PA kind of preclude a lot of that's anyway are those are my thoughts are do you want to render your social should we go to the listeners\nI Would be curious to know what listeners have done and the situation\nOkay so are you just heard us make best case arguments are in a very difficult situation in which in a place of employment\nA a K version as not just cancer because stage one or even states too you know it really ... you could ever an awfully long lifespan of productive work\nUh but were let's talk about somebody who's worked performance has declined as a result of the cancer the chemotherapy and maybe it's occurred\nOr do you keep this under what circumstances maybe the more gray area nuanced way to bring it up as in what circumstances would you keep this person under what circumstances would you let this person go what do you think um we welcome your call here at work with Marty Nemko and ...\nThe phone number for one five eight four one for one two three four that's for one five eight four one forty one thirty four [noise] let's turn to another ethical dilemma while we're waiting\nFor calls to come in a and this is about a sales person who um is he or she ethically obliged to reveal his products core weakness so to make a specific\nIn a are you selling was a new ... and the prospect of customers coming in and he or she is deciding between a Chevy Cruze and a modest a three\nAnd this customer tells you that reliability is her let's say let's start with his or her as making an awkward her number one criterion in choosing a car she says I hate getting into my\nThe lady of being on the side of the road waiting for tow truck and this person believes that Chevy is more she says you know I I think ... more reliable than Mazda that's why I that's why I'm inclined to to get a Chevy\nBut he was a salesperson I think you're pretty sure she's wrong so you're thinking of checking Consumer Reports about those two specific models and letting the customer know what you find so Barbary make the argument for why the person should check and report back to this customer\n[noise] well I'm not sure that that found person has the obligation\nNot acting you were talking about making the argument for checking in reporting you're right\nI'm not sure that the ... and half the application to check in or\n... yeah that's the argument against I make I'm asking you to make the argument for doing the checking\nOf color you want me to say he really should yeah right and then we'll have a hard time with that ... will do ... or ...\nYou have you have this died that you want to work for a company that um manufacturers cars that are not reliable\nAnd even they already have have taken that step to say okay I'm a sales person I'm going to sell people ... I don't think are reliable and\nFor use if he's come knocking on in the case of the software I say\nIf the car is good and you shouldn't be working\nWell again it's a mixed bag and so we talked about reliable and different features if I'm working for the software company I may not know upfront how bad or good the software which liabilities but I have an obligation to a informed my customers that software missile costs was not expected to notice all can\nCan take the software and ... and why it should be bored or not and if it's overall so horrible yes they should quit the job but I Want to know what listeners think does this sales person have an obligation or less again let's be nuanced\nUnder what circumstances does a sales person have an obligation to disclose negatives not just positive about his or her product\nThe phone number here where we ... the topic is ethical dilemma is in the workplace the phone number for one five eight four one for one two three four that's for one five eight four one forty one thirty four let's move on to the next that's supposed to\nSee if we can never get quality because we move\nA scenario and we do have ... I just was we can I can wait for a moment I just\nWe will do let's give a heads up while getting the calls coming we don't screen by the way we're proud of this is truly democratic radio we take calls in the orders that they come in\nSo that you really get to hear people say without us filtering it in any way so All right let's go back to the phones welcome to work with Marty Nemko and ... what is the perspective that you would like\nTo share that share of the perspective\nOf hanging up let's go to the next level [laughter] well that's a perfect\nCertainly it's it's one it's a very clear black and white perspective or in any case would notice going to the phones welcome to work with Marty and Barbara what's on your mind\nAlone if you are you\nThere are a little yellow Marty Hi yeah Hi my name is David I'm from Santa fell by David and uh I I Love your topic\nAgain I have a personal experience with it like to share on the air awesome to your most recent point um my career has been in the uh the mortgage banking world as we know it had some serious\nUm but many of them many of those uh mishaps shall we say we're due to the um the outlook and and I'm Mr ... very very few people\nHowever uh the senior management and the companies that were responsible were also responsible for telling the company like and so my experience up until two thousand and seven\nUm was as a salesperson for an organization that was responsible for a lot of damage and I saw happening um ended up retooling myself with the job\nTo the damage will look to stop and listen to some assuming the damage was a phony out applications for people who weren't qualified to get a loan and not disclosing what the actual costs so it was\nA it was both responsibility of that company to be more disclosing as well as frankly for the uh the the bar or to to make a risk to more responsibly borrow is that fair statement\nUm I Would I Would recommend it to to put in more on the market you are stating earlier as to the responsibility of the company not necessarily the consumer and say this if you're trying to sell negatively advertising adjustable loan to somebody who doesn't understand what that means\nAnd and they are coming in and there are two and a half percent three months later to be six and they don't know what that means and the commission level is high enough to get people to be dishonest is a form of omission\nYou're still committing a heinous that okay and uh some of us can't live with that\nOkay so what you said you read to him\nI said goodbye um I put\nMyself back into the market as a as a salesperson for an equally long terms sales process where there was a lot of um people skills that's what I enjoy about about this and yet it it it was it was where the product and a facility for selling the product\nIt's got to like it you got to believe in it and then have to fit your moral and ethical standards\nAnd that's good for you as an individual but it's also good for this society because that's the creative destruction of capitalism\nIf only people will only sell products that they really believe in then then the only people who sell for ... ... are going to be a sleazy ... bad salesmen and then and those companies will tend to go out of business and that's the good side of capitalism rank\nYes and it's a change that we need to foster even though it's not the right on the horizon for for a lot of our company is these days but I think we can make that change\nI think it's important anyway thank you and call Barbara newcomers should go back to the phones\nNo I I totally agree when you are selling something like a complicated mortgage where we don't expect the consumer to know\nThat hey it's two and a half now but surprise surprise and two months it's going to be six percent that's entirely unethical and I would be right with and I would not have started working for that company and I would not say working for that company\nLet's go back to the phones welcome to work with a quote Robert I'm cold water on which side of which you get to the ... we discussed would you like to opine\nHello you hello Hi\nHi I wanted to make a comment about the sales [noise] um [noise] I think it is partially the consumers due diligence to do some research but I also believe that as a sales person\nI'm I'm hearing on radio 'cause you you turn down your radio please\nOkay sorry about that you know and I think it's very important to actually know your competitors are\nAnd to be aware of that you have some type of food but it happens comparative analysis to truly be able to offer the customer and and you know what what their needs are and and and also while selling the benefit of your product first solution you know I mean how do you know with full confidence that you're giving them the best solution\nLike you say you are unless you know\nAnd that's not true or not is not too much to ask the sales person to understand the competitors and you know while there's no question I Believe in the short run the sleazy sales person makes more money\nBecause they're going to close more sales right away based on not disclosing the negatives but in the long run they will even make more money because they're going to get more word of mouth referrals from satisfied customers were blown away by the fact that this person you know this products that really right for you or\nA minimum there'll be able to put their head on the pillow better at night so it feels like it's got a medic as well as high minded value anyway thanks very much for the call let's bar but let's go to the next of the ethical dilemmas\nAnd this dilemma is um when I got a job seeker is desperate and many of the listeners to this show them and some of them certainly are looking for a job\nAnd when you're desperate the question is is it worth lying to land a job and so Barbara why don't you start by making the argument ah for why is worth\nA ... not lying we're lying I don't know ... make your way to make any argument I make the argument you won't make the other argument [laughter] okay\nUm well let's see just for fun I'll make the argument for saying okay\nSo are you are an employee and your skills are primarily soft skills and\nThe problem and reason that you are having trouble getting a job just because you don't have good technical skills and that kind of what they're looking for so you got by for a long time by being organized and well liked but you can't relate to the job so\nA soft skills are actually a very important part of the job of any job in fact that the one the more common way that people lose their jobs because they don't have the skills they may have the technical skills\nSo if you got hired you might be able to collaborate with your co workers where someone else could help you with the technical part that you're not so good at while you can help them with the skills\nAnd if you don't lie to get the job then you won't have the opportunity to do this because nobody's going to hire you because you have a gap unemployment\nSo therefore since there would be a way to produce for the company and be a good employee how it might be worth doing\nWell first of all of a of course if the job requires technical skills all the soft skills in the world they're not going to you know you can dance around and get help but then you're being you're applying for a job is to go so that makes that argument but makes that week but I Want to make the general argument against lying\nYou are first of all being unfair to the honest job applicant who through your clever successful lying\nI'm would be denied the job you know I ... and yeah it's possible that that person may need the job but less than you do but that's far from certain so even if you're desperate also if you've not been selected despite months and months of trying\nIt suggests that you may not be as worthy an employee as you think even in terms of the social skills\nIt's wise or to look inward and say why the hell it by not gotten employed in ten months of hard trying\nAnd then either decide you're going to improve your skills or change careers to one in which you would be more readily hired or simply a lower level job and your career this to you know it is not even borderline or that there's no way you should be lying\nCan you slowed that you're talking a little fast and because your accent a little difficult to speak right into the phone and speak a little more slowly please\nShut 'em what you make enough money or they theorized that you can support your says I Know\nThat that seems to be quite a reasonable arguments\nYou know uh I have no ... no I could I could see that being said the only argument against it is to say let's say you for argument's sake let's say or do you speak with an accent so I'm assuming from another country and so you have additional cultural and linguistic competence\nAnd I would imagine that there are people who are struggling in your country and instead of owning the party favorites thing where you're selling hasn't horns\nYou were doing something to improve the lives of the struggling people in your country isn't that more ... a wise or use of the heartbeat of your life and so in the party favors\nYes but what if I if I can vote to even off my country okay and then maybe use that money to a game for the people in my country or even the people here because\nI'm inside all day and it's not that hot and I get on the mission ie the village you drink something for her\nAnd then then I Would like\nBut the money that I\nWent back and they wouldn't have even more than\nI Am honored by your call and we all are lines are lighting up so I Want to thank you for the call barbers anything you want to say you should go right back to the phones I think let's go right back from the phone welcome to work with Marty and Barbara what's on your mind\nHi Marty and Barbara um I did I did appreciate what you had to say about uh ethics in the workplace\nOr having bump heads with ah the number two person an HR all large ah agency I'm but going to the uh the party favors\nI Want you to know that I'm sitting at my desk [laughter] and I am wearing mine the lush lobster hat [laughter]\nWhich I bought a farm community thrift on Valencia straight okay and what I'm going to do with what I think I'm going to call it Lawrence lobster\n[laughter] um that was a lot of different Saturday Night live I remember that segment go ahead\nWhy don't I don't I don't remember that I just thought Lawrence would be a a dignified name for it\nNo he was a John Belushi was holding this live lobster and for the boiling pot [laughter] it or not I mean we're please go ahead\nAnd I thought it was an ethical to put into a boiling pot of water anything that was the life that you knew my name's ... I'm Sorry yes yes absolutely husband wife or anything [laughter]\nBut um it's going to find a home at eight twenty six Valencia with the pirates store [noise] and um because of course pirates need lobsters\nNear total pirates like a fish ... right but\nBut in terms of the store if that's how you're going to be able to make a living that's not a bad thing as long as you know you know you you do your civic stuff are there other ways to to to to show that absolutely absolutely\nAre in fact the fact that there are thrift stores that benefit um\nThe community allows us to get our frivolous and not so frivolous stuff and say you know when I'm finished with this um I Will bring it over to this place because I Know they'll put put it to good use\n'em and and please don't be jealous I'm sure there's another Lawrence lobster hat out\nFor you [laughter] you're just going to have to find it thank you very much\nNot horrible and of course even better in a thrift store you make it affordable to people as well as supporting a non profit or we're just we're we're trying we you know because public radio listeners are lofty in their ideals we're trying to we're looking at dilemma is\nYou know and and is who is who is lived a better life the person who is working\nI'm too you know to improve human kind more broadly or the person who's selling party hats and um that's what we're exploring\nBob or anything you want us to address you go back to the phones\nI Want to know where I get that out there are a lot [laughter]\nAnyway let's go back to the phones welcome to work with muddy and bribery what's on your mind\nHello it's you yeah hello Hi Hi yes I'm\nI've been kind of on a losing streak in terms of interviews in the last August or so if I had a bunch of interviews for a when a last August and the day and\nHis August or last August meaning two thousand Seventeen of two thousand eighty\nA thousand Seventeen show over a year okay and I've been on a losing streak I Can't quite close on a fairly working in a job that uh [noise] uh\nPaying me you know ... far below what I mean\nA lot my potential is what I've learned in the past yeah I've been trying to get another job and can't seem to Clinton hill\nOkay so let's let's let's trouble shoot so um first of all have you done with Barbara is is just earlier have you tried at least\nGet some honest feedback from the employers as to why they didn't elect you\nI have a some some have said uh you know just very vague\nThing a as usual in these days\nRight very vague you know others have said oh yeah there's an internal candidate you know something I mean it's not very how\nCrap no it's not useful or anything but nothing you so nothing useful\nNo not okay I'll give you a multiple choice then which is a following feels like the most likely source of the problem number one you have been adequately in the interview demonstrate that you're you know very good at what you do for actually stories or going to the white board or showing work samples\nUm will stick them one at a time to what extent do you believe you've done a good job of demonstrating you have to be God but you're pretty darn good at what the what the job requires a by telling those stories et cetera\nBut I I I think I have good stories but maybe a I'm over talking perhaps I'm just going on for too long a that's a great one I look up at the uh people I'm Talking to the idea of rolling their eyes so\nWhat is it a length of time now there I always tell people that know as the um the fall of the traffic like rule during the first thirty seconds of another into lights green second thirty seconds it's yellow they're willing you are ready ready for your shut up and up to sixty second markets read you better shut up because you probably overwhelming them are boring them\nBut it's some so sometimes that if you're talking significantly more than a minute at a time\nOr you're not being concise enough but it also could be what you're safe there rolling their eyes that's usually not the length of what you're saying are you saying things that seem cliched or obvious or or or clearly wrong do you know\n[noise] um I don't think so I mean I think um [noise] you know a lot of water either panel interviews and you have to\nYou know the cat questions are can didn't I I just think maybe I don't know I'm just not to [noise] you know understand anything on I mean I've come and uh you know second or third in some cases but you know that's not a after me over the top\nYou sounding a little flat is that possible because usually when people come on the radio there were a little nervous of their eggs or energy levels actually Hi I'm Wondering whether you\nUm [noise] I don't know I I\nI I really don't know so let's let's test it out what kind of job you searching for\nI'm\nSearching for a a job in the public sector institution us you know the panel interview\nDoing what what kind of job in the public sector\n[noise] um [noise] a marketing\nMarketing in the public sectors and nonprofit marketing kind of thing or government marketing of particular uh you know drug programs or more welfare programs or whatever like\nThat right yeah okay so I'm gonna I'm On the interviewing him asking a question well tell me about an example in the past in which you have marketed a nonprofit of governmental program [noise]\nUh yeah so uh in the past I've ah marketed a federal programs in the past such as my last position I um [noise]\nI took the ... an opportunity to market a a program in which a governmental or to bring public support for mental projects and programs which were I'm OK to increase the transportation programs\nCan can you be specific tell me about this specific transportation for what you did to market it\nUh\nYeah so well you know I mean already I I think already kind of flubbed them flip the delivery on that\nOne of those little ... I Want to take warm I Want to get more data here before I get rid of my opinion as Barbara do the same of course I'm so tell me more about what you specifically did to market that transportation what did you do to market that transportation initiative\nWell for example I'm a there was a a ... which are trying to um [noise] get\nA increase attendance over the past year um and uh when I took over a a publicity uh for this campaign to mark this particular our friends I was able to increase attendance by five or forty percent over the previous\nWhere did you do what specifically what did you do to to enable that forty per se that's a big increase what did you do specifically [noise]\nUm I was in charge of the publicity after it's a it's a outreach or we did a ah we did um email blasts a cause I'm you know created a ... a marketing collider all et cetera that are", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Work with Marty Nemko", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "19", "locations": [["maverick county", 28.70914, -100.49952], ["us", 45.99696, -118.49854], ["Santa", 13.99417, -89.55972], ["Valencia", 39.46975, -0.37739], ["Valencia", 39.46975, -0.37739]], "not_found": [], "ep_coords": ["San Francisco, CA", 37.77493, -122.41942], "in_country": ["maverick county", "us"], "out_country": ["Santa", "Valencia", "Valencia"], "in_state": [], "out_state": ["maverick county", "us", "Santa", "Valencia", "Valencia"]}]
