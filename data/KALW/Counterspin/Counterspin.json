weekly look behind the headlines I'm Janine Jackson\nThis week on counter spin as we record the show on October force it looks as though Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed for the Supreme Court\nDespite well despite so very many things why are Republicans so set on pushing through a candidate opposed by a coalition of Christian churches as well as more than a thousand law professors as well as anybody concerned about sexual assault\nAnd beyond his temperament what are we know about Kavanaugh's record as a judge will talk about that with Marjorie cone professor emeritus at Thomas Jefferson school of law and former president of the national lawyer scaled\nAlso on the show these those on bound says the cover of the car at Forbes magazine stating of the head of Amazon dot com quote he's\nBuilt the most innovative and feared juggernaut of the twenty first century and every industry is now fair game close quote\nSo that's good\nIs it appropriate for media to approach Amazon as though it's simply a better mouse trap and bees those as though his bank account of a hundred and sixty billion dollars can coexist happily alongside workers who just had their minimum wage pushed\nOr sanction about the impact of Amazon size its influence and its values on community [noise] we'll hear from journalists Neal demaio is author of most recently the Brooklyn wars that's all coming up you're listening to counter spin brought to you each week by the media watch groups fair\nDonald Trump's public mockery of Christine Blasey Ford the woman who testified she was assaulted by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh wasn't acutely despicable spectacle and an administration that is no sugar when it comes to despicable spectacle\nBut the Kavanaugh hearings the FBI quote unquote investigation into allegations against him the whole process seemed to indicate more serious failures than Trump's vindictive creeping us\nWhat is going on here and what might mean for the Supreme Court going forward Marjorie Cohn is professor emeritus at Thomas Jefferson school\nOf law former president of the national lawyers build and deputy secretary general of the international association of democratic lawyers she joins us now by phone from San Diego welcome back to counter spend Marjorie ... thanks for having me Janine\nWell we're in media arrests here of course we just heard this morning October forth\nThat the FBI had completed its investigation which Susan Collins called very thorough despite not including statements from four door dozens of others who wanted to ah contribute\nI have so many questions but they really all kinds of amount to how is this happening how are we had a place where a man who ... his way through his hearings snarling and accusing and making clear that he hates Democrats the Clintons and the left\nCould even be considered to have the temperament appropriate to a Supreme Court justice [noise]\nWell that's an excellent question but it's very clear and it's been clear from the start that the Republican leadership in concert with Donald Trump is going to ram this nomination through\nSo that they can achieve a solid right wing majority on the Supreme Court which will last for decades and will reverse many of the rights that we hold dear\nThe Republicans know that Kavanaugh would provide a reliable vote against immigrants workers voters and gay and transgender people he would deliver it dependable votes for employers private property in church state bonding\nAnd they can rest assured that he would do is best to immunize Trump from criminal liability and enabled him to continue their mean spirited right wing agenda and this is more important to them than any judicial temperament than any credible allegations of sexual assault\nBecause the bottom line issue one of the most significant issues is\nAbortion rights reproductive rights and overturning roe v Wade in addition to gay rights and they have rationalized all of these other horrors 'em to that and\nKevin all seems so tainted though at this point why not just some other conservative what is it about the timeline that you think makes them feel like they have to keep going with this candidate over the objection of now you know millions of people\nWell in part they want cabin on the Supreme Court before the November sixth term\nIn the Senate and then there might not be sufficient votes to confirm him after the election um that's the most immediate consideration but they were in a hurry to get him confirmed by October first which was the first day of the Supreme Court's new term\nAnd they want to help ensure the outcome of several hot button cases that are on the court docket including cases involving double jeopardy immigration age discrimination and the endangered species act and\nThere is a possibility that the court might decide to take up cases involving gerrymandering gay and transgender rights and the separation of church and state\nWell you've been writing about Brett Kavanaugh for a while now and you have pointed out there's plenty to undermine his candidacy even before we get to sexual assault allegations and be those other things are in a way that risk almost being overlooked and one of the concerns\nIs around his record international law and the power of the president what are the flag bearer on again they're nothing to do with his quote unquote personality but they're derived from his public record as a judge\n[laughter] well keep in mind that international law in so far as the United states has ratified treaties or customary international law are part of US law under the supremacy clause of the constitution and yet Kavanaugh\nHas nothing but scorn for international law and he confuses international law with foreign law international law as as I said is treaty law and customary international law which is customs that countries have built up over the years\nBut foreign law is totally different it's the law of France or Brazil or Germany and he conflate the two now that he's been on the court of appeals and during the\nBush administration's so called war on terror\nCabin up almost always deferred to the president on executive power now the Supreme Court during the Bush administration did check and balance\nThe executive the the president and said that federal courts have jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus petitions by Guantanamo detainees they said that a U.S citizen who's being held as an enemy combatant has due process rights\nTo contest his detention and they said that Bush's military commissions violated the Geneva Conventions and the federal uniform code of military justice now in two thousand eight the Supreme Court ruled in ... versus Bush\nThat Guantanamo detainees held as enemy combatants have the right to file a B is corpus petitions in us federal courts to say on being unlawfully held but after ... cabin on the court of appeals did his best to try to neuter\nThese habeas corpus rights that the Supreme Court has upheld in blue median in case after case and also\nKavanaugh has a at a record of dangerous difference to the president not withstanding the case of Jones versus Clinton the Paula Jones case which said that a president has to answer to at least a civil case that didn't involve a criminal case\nKavanaugh doesn't think that a president should be bothered to answer to a civil or criminal case while he's in office and under us versus Nixon a unanimous Supreme Court said that Nixon had to turn over the tapes during the Watergate scandal and that led to Nixon's resignation and yet\nBut one of the interesting things\nIs you know we sort of have this idea of the way to respond to corporate malfeasance\nIn our age is a vote with our pocketbooks right and we learn from boycott movements and you know I remember back twenty Thirty years ago there was a spate of like paperbacks of came out about you know how to shop for a better world\nAnd we very much is sort of the east coast with modern times that you make a statement with your dollars\nAnd that was not always the case in one of the things I found interesting in researching this article\nWas the degree to which that was first of all a response to some of the\nBig corporate chains like in ... in the twenties and thirties trying to get people to identify more as consumers because they want people thinking and you know and the voting on the basis of what's best for me for you know easy shopping and not\nWhat's best for me as a worker what's best for me as a business owner who has to compete with these chains\nAnd then again after that starting in the sixties and running through the eighties and nineties not till today consumer movements as a response to our lack of political power and other ways right you know if if Congress has all filled out the corporations at least we can vote with our dollars the\nProblem of course being that that's not a very effective way of of accomplishing things so you know what are they doing the article was sort of look at what you can do when you go to shop but also what you can do to affect our shopping choices at our corporate world outside of that sort of consumer base if\nWe have so much first of all that's presented in kind of\nHas been a shift a ... and now we talk about companies are they good companies or the bad companies but he used to be that just bigness itself just size itself of a power was considered to be a cause for concern\nYeah and and you know clearly Amazon with this announcement this week of you know raising their minimum wages is trying to cast themselves as we're not bad guys were good guys right\nAnd that's kind of not you know shouldn't be the point right I mean it's nice that they're doing that um but does that mean that we should trust a company with massive control over all areas of are consuming experience and our entertainment\nExperience and our cultural experience and the ability to compile massive amounts of data from our\nBehaviors and all these different places does it make it better if they're nicer people rather than worse people I mean I guess a little bit but really if we're going back to the principle that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely\nThe idea is really nobody should be trusted with that level of power which is the whole point of the anti trust movement of late nineties that early twentieth century\nAnd I think one of the realization here is that what you know Stacy Mitchell was saying how quickly in my article\nIs that we need to not just approach this as how do we find that most conscientious way to shop but we need to really have to return to\nAnti trust you know we really haven't had a strong anti trust movement to break up these enormous monopolies in the last few decades and you know regardless of whether it's Democrats or Republicans in power we really need to start pushing in that direction\nWell in a what Stacy Mitchell from the Institute for local self reliance says is that folks are starting to see that she thinks you know that there was a period where Amazon with this bright shiny thing that made life easier and now it's starting to shift a bit to people recognizing that\nCancelling your prime account is not necessarily going to be enough given that as you report it a lot of what Amazon does is out of the reach of individuals' they're selling to public agencies they're selling you know over your head um in in a sense but\nThere is movement afoot to talk about anti trust in a way that that might make it more meaningful again\nYeah and the FCC is holding hearings and there's an anti trust caucus in Congress now and they're you know some rumblings\nAnd I think things like you know obviously Facebook breaches and all the other sort of big malfeasance that were clearly seen by some of these big overarching corporations\nHe's starting to get attention not just from consumer advocate for the world but also in Congress than in other places but it's going to have to be a big push obviously right because you know Amazon and company like that\nHave the ability not just to lobby like crazy but also to do things like\nTry to undercut opposition by simply saying hey we're going to ah we're going to raise their minimum wages with the cat is not nothing\nBut it's an attempt to deflect right attempt to get people off their backs I think something that is going to be a battle not just over the next year or two but over the next decade or two to really sort of try and push back again in the same way that\nIt took decades to fight the power the monopolies whether we're railroads or whoever standard oil back in the late nineties early twentieth century\nAnd probably now as well as then investigative journalism is going to play a role and and that leads me to a Segway you were until recently the news editor at the village voice launched in Nineteen fifty five the personal turn it in Newsweek clean\nThe village voice has ceased publication and that has a lot of meaning\nIt changed over its history certainly it means different things to different people what did the village voice means for you and what do you think it's closure means for the city\nYeah I mean you know there's been a lot of talk in the same way there is an awful lot of things these days especially in New York about well you know the voice wasn't what it used to be any way what in journalism is right now I had written for the voice for Twenty years and I've been out of there are there the last couple\nYou know one of the things that I really realized the more time I spent working on the voice was the special role that it really had to play in terms of being\nA real alternative to the corporate media and you know some of what you see in other outlets if you know really\nWas sort of the predecessor of a lot of the sort of ... things like you know like for example which has a great job\nBut the voice really had at uh Billy and sort of those of trying to be both the funniest and witty if people in the room and also the smartest and the most serious about the journalism and I think it's something that you know I'd like to think that we carried out until the until the bitter end\nAnd I'm obviously ready for other places as what right now and of other people who you know contributed voice are going to continue to do that too\nBut I Hope that there will still be room for that kind of journalism in the world you know stuff that makes us laugh\nBut at the same time stuff that really does the best of what a dress code of journalism is supposed to do not just giant articles trying to win Pulitzer is but really exposing the dynamics of power exposing what we need to do in order to change our world for the better\nSo I'm very sad to see the voice go not just as a staffer and as a writer but as a reader of it and I hope that people who are thinking of journalistic endeavor that future try and find a way to make that that sort of project work again because I think it's what we still very much need\nWe've

listening to morning locally produced\nForty whoa [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\nWell some to counter spend your weekly look behind the headlines I'm Janine Jackson\nThis week on counter spin Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell tip day poorly hidden hand by saying that we're it you know up to him\nCongress after the election could be looking to address Social Security Medicare and Medicaid which he called the real drivers of the debt\nMedia were quick to report Democrats outcry but that didn't include any questioning of media's own role in laying the groundwork for claims that Social Security is a controversial or a troubled program in need of addressing\nWe'll go over some myths about Social Security once more with feeling with Nancy Altman president of Social Security works board chair at the pension right center and author of among other titles the battle for Social Security firm FDR's vision to Bush's gamble\nThat's coming up but first we'll take a look back at mainstream press\nMore information about Washington Post columnist ... praise and murder at the hands of the Saudi Government comes to light fare analyst Adam Johnson called detention\nTo prop up the mythology of the U.S as a noble protector of democracy and human rights despite wars of aggression spy regimes the funding and arming of right wing militias and the propping up of dictators\nAnd that's the idea that the U.S political class does bad things not because bad things serve us imperial interests but because they are corrupted by sinister foreign actors\nIn a report on why show gays killing was unlikely to fundamentally altered the U.S Saudi relationship\nNBC News on October seventeenth explained that quote Adam Google and Middle East researcher with human rights watch said the longstanding economic and security ties with Saudi Arabia has forced us to tolerate a lot of questionable Saudi behavior close quote\nIt's unclear if those were Google's words or those of NBC reporters but you're left with the same idea due to economic and security ties somehow out of control the\nMost powerful country in the world is forced to tolerate\nWhat's called questionable behavior a phrase that sweeps together the destruction of Yemen which the U.S tolerates with material support including weapons and targeting instructions the heading of dissidents the disappearing of women drivers and the brutal murder of cars showcase\nThe theme was echoed at vox where readers learned that quote the realities of Cold War politics got us involved in a deep long term cooperation with the Saudi state that is not otherwise unnatural partner for the United states close quote\nNever mind that the U.S Saudi partnership predates the Cold War by about Fifteen Years Johnson writes the idea that dictators or sectarian regimes in the Mid East aren't natural partners of the U.S is simply fiction\nIt's refreshing that some are starting to challenge the United states grotesque alliance with the ... monarchy but with this should come questioning of the reassuring narrative\nThat the Saudis have corrupted plead or captured and otherwise benevolent values base to US government\nSadly but historically the u._s. hasn't embraced despotic regimes despite their oppressive nature but because of it [noise]\nUSA today's October twenty fifth front page headline read is the second amendment under fire in the west the online headline gun rights under siege was no less dramatic\nBefore going on to explain the actual subject of the story recreational shooting on public lands in West has officials struggling to balance sport verses safety [noise]\nSo yes the story has nothing to do with the right to bear arms whether that means participation in a militia the Supreme Court's traditional interpretation or a private right to own firearms as a two thousand eight ruling written by Antonin Scalia reinterpreted\nThe word Second Amendment don't appear in the body of the USA Today piece\nBecause the bill of rights isn't relevant to the topic at hand which is that quote all across the west federal and state land managers are struggling to balance the demands of recreational shooters with the fear that their bullets are starting fires\nFrightening other land users and accidentally killing others close quote nothing and the second amendment suggests that\nWhich is presumably wire reporter Trevor Hughes doesn't refer to it but editors who writes headlines maybe thought safety concerns wouldn't drive as many clicks as a culture war bit about gun rights\nDespite the fact that the people most likely to get excited about such headlines are also likely to take phrases like under fire and under siege rather literally\nAnd finally the New York times released news that the department of health and Human Services is speaking to force government agencies charged with enforcing civil rights law to adopt a definition of sex as\nEither a male or female an changeable and determined by the genitals that a person is born with with any dispute to be clarified using genetic testing\nAs Kaitlin burns to her own knowledge the only openly transgender Capitol Hill reporter wrote for re Y. R. dot news this policy change was enabled by media accounts that frame transgender issues as a debate\nEven though we're losing means the loss of human rights for trans people\nFor me burns wrote quote the most frustrating part of the media coverage of the memo is the overly simplistic idea that these policies merely invalidate trans feelings close quote\nWhen in fact it's a material issue about the ability of trans people to obtain identification that doesn't disclose their medical history\nAuthor and law professor dean spade and a piece for truth out ads that quote when trans phobia gets bolstered by signals from the federal government low level enforcers of gender norms feel even more license to humiliate and exclude trans people close quote\nAnd this means things like having welfare benefits terminated as a trans woman did when she showed up at her mandatory workfare assignment because the supervisor mark tourists absent saying she wasn't work ready if she dressed as a woman\nOr being denied placement in domestic violence shelters are in drug treatment programs because of the way gender markers are recorded on IDs and used to divide folks up and sex segregated facilities\nIt matters more for the disproportionate number of trans people who are poor and of color who survival is more likely at the mercy of bureaucrats and low level staff in prisons hospitals in group homes who make decisions about gender\nSpade says we need to see this White House attack as part of a broader and terrifying approach to race gender and authority\nSo while you knew what the New York times was getting at with their October twenty first headline transgender could be defined out of existence under a Trump Administration\nGiven what's at stake a less artful and more straightforward shorthand Trump plans to encourage abused and discrimination against transgender people might have been more appropriate [noise] you're listening to counter spin brought to each week by the media watch groups fair\nAn article and affairs magazine extra about mainstream media distortions on Social Security\nSite say New York times article that describes the federal budget deficit as quote overwhelmingly a consequence of American military outlay and entitlement programs such as Social Security together with the nation's unwillingness\nProfoundly wise policy we are as a nation are facing a looming retirement income crisis with the collapse of the defined benefit plan stagnated wages lots of home equity and so forth\nThe one part of our retirement gum system that continues to work extremely well your Social Security what we need to do is\nBuild on what works expand Social Security and to be very clear this myth of\nOh it's going back to front affordable\nThe question of whether to expand or cut Social Security as a matter of values we are the wealthiest nation in the world we're at the wealthiest moment of our history at this legislation that's been introduced or about a dozen bills the various ways of expanding Social Security and paying for it\nFake show I'm so quickly that if we want to extend benefits we can do so responsibly but the other side does not want to make this a question of values because the American people overwhelmingly whether you're conservative or liberal Republican Democrat\nAll genders all races everyone we all overwhelmingly agree that Social Security works we don't want to see it cut we'd like to see it expanded\nFolks may remember Paul Ryan thing that he's been dreaming about cutting Medicaid since he was standing around the Kagame college\nYou know and it sounds like super villain talk you know you you've been in a room with these people what is the social vision that they have that that backs\nEliminating Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid what what you will the word\nIdeological view and a matter of their donors you know how much money flows to Wall Street from Social Security none but if you cut Social Security back more money would go to Wall Street more money would go in fees and that's of course\nWhat their donors want so there's only a small splinter group\nThat opposes program but they tend to be extremely wealthy and was because they say oversized influence so that's one but there isn't\nAn ideological opposition to the Koch brothers and people like that and that is\nAnti government they want government to do nothing you know maybe a military of that you know that sort of this idea that we don't want to pay taxes we've got our own gated community it'll all of that\nIn starting in Nineteen thirty six the Republican to a friend who was the Republican nominee for president ran for\n... against Social Security he lost in a landslide through were opponents in the Nineteen fifties they last like teen sixties Nineteen seventies when something shifted now everyone loves Social Security but it's on affordable for very children it's\nYou know people are cheating of whatever it is I call it a solution in search of a problem because the the solution was always cut Social Security problems very but\nToday's Republicans do not have the courage of their convictions they won't stand up and say we'll like Social Security we think of socialism we by cutting back they say we love Social Security\nWe need a bipartisan solution but we're against taxes because we've got to cut it\nWell I I Want to ask you a a final question about media because although you're outlining distinct differences between Democrats and Republicans right now\nI see increasingly critics calling out media for sometimes hiding reality in that part is then frame you know I'm Paul Krugman and Michael help pick up the LA Times so it's kind of side died reporting that was saying\nDemocrats claim the geo he wants to make cuts to Social Security or you know Democrats may actually there's not a relationship between Social Security and the deficit and they make these things that are just true they put them in the mouths of Democrats and it makes it seem as though the facts of the matter are partisan\nExactly and you know I have some sympathy\nFor the media they want to see him nonpartisan but you know if one side is saying the earth is flat and the other side of saying the earth is round\nI don't think it's appropriate to say well these people say the earth is flat these this route I mean there is an objective reality and in this case there is no question that the Democrats in their twenties sixteen platform which did not get covered\nVery much cold for expanding Social Security not cutting it and it is a fact that it has been costs that out by the nonpartisan\nActually that the Social Security administration that the John Larson Twenty one hundred act is projected to both expanding benefits and pay them\nFully through the twenty first century so you know they might get clicks with the old against the younger the Democrats against the Republicans but I think it's a disservice\nFor programs like Social Security that as I say it's supposed to provide peace of mind that when you start saying well these people say it's going bankrupt to just report it because it it really does a disservice to all of a [noise]\nI Want to just push you one final question because it's it's a fused throughout the reporting is just the language entitlement program and I think you just you think something when you hear that\nLiteral meaning there's this sense that somehow it's on there and and I know you've covered the ground but what do you what's your reaction and when you hear Social Security Medicare Medicaid described as entitlements\nWell it's outrageous and it really is back to what we were just talking about about those who oppose these programs won't come out and faith so they use the pejorative label that sounds like a government handout well you know we've done focus groups on this and we find that\nPeople if you say what's in a title that they don't think it's Social Security when you tell them all that's what people in Washington they they get angry because they see that they contribute to Social Security\nWith every paycheck it's insurance it's an earned benefit and I think the real proof is that a synonym for entitlement is mandatory spending you'd never hear them talk of added as mandatory spending I had a colleague who\nWorked on a commission and the Nineteen nineties to work on so called the title month and he joked that uh turned a boring budgetary eleven letter word title months into the proverbial four letter word this is part of the billionaires get paid in fact Pete Peterson the billionaire I was talking about\nHow to organize that condition was on this is part of the strategy to make it sound like it's a government handout to make it sound like it's full of fraud all the things that it's not and it's really defined the debate\nWe've been speaking with Nancy Altman president up Social Security works there online that Social Security works dot org\nThe book the truth about Social Security is out now from strong arm press and her article the future of Social Security Medicare and Medicaid is on the ballot this November can also be found on common dreams thank you very much Nancy Altman for joining us this week on counter spin\nAnd thank you so much for having me and for having

with\nBut when corporate media tell the story through the White House is cruel prism even if they criticize that their obscuring ideas and actors that are moving things in a more humane direction\nWe'll talk about why it matters who you talk to with Tina Vasquez senior immigration reporter at ... news\nAlso on the show if it's a new day your right to ask if the Trump Administration is coming for your rights and a new way and the answer is yes\nThe White House has now via the national Park Service seeking to squelch public protest in Washington D. C. by charging for it because the important thing about Martin Luther king's march on Washington is how much it cost to fix the lawn [noise]\nIt's not hard to see through this anti democratic ploy but what does it take to fight it we'll hear from our other Hayden ... executive director of the partnership\nAt first day very quick look back at recent press [noise]\nCNN International tweeted on October fourteenth quote scared by that new report on climate change here's what you can do to help\nEat less meat swap your car or a plane ride for a bus or train use a smart thermostat in your home an upgrade to more efficient appliances close quote\nTo which fair analyst Adam Johnson replied quote reminder that one hundred corporations are responsible for Seventy one percent of global greenhouse gas emissions\nAnd presenting the crisis as a moral failing on the part of individuals without noting this fact is journalistic malpractice close quote\nJohnson was citing data from the carbon disclosure projects carbon majors report which tracks greenhouse gas emissions and traces them to for profit in state owned entities\nThe report also found that since Nineteen eighty eight just twenty five such enterprises were responsible for more than half of all greenhouse gas emissions\nA check of the next to this news database shows that CNN like most corporate news outlets has never mentioned the carbon majors report which includes many major media advertisers on its list CNN will however keep you informed on your need to buy a more energy efficient refrigerator\nYou're listening to counter spin brought to each week by the media watch group fair\nIn a typical corporate media story on the family separations and deportations and asylum denials that define immigration policy under Donald Trump the images and sometimes voices of immigrants are essentially a less active\nThey add color and specificity but say their actions don't generally set the frame of the story\nThe objects of policy immigrants still somehow are not the central subjects the main drivers of the story of their lives\nCentering immigrants and their agency changes the fabric of reporting and shift the static understanding of the situation opening ways forward beyond the logjam of hopelessness and frustration so many now feel\nTina Vasquez is the senior immigration reporter at rewire dot news she joins us now by phone from North Carolina Welcome back to counter spent ...\nThank you for having\nAmnesty International released a report just last week usa you do not have any rights here documenting multiple sorts of abuses at the U.S Mexico border\nInvolving punishing asylum seekers I suppose some what surprised to see it ignored by so called mainstream media there was a piece on Newsweek online voice of America actually ran some thing\nBut for a report that pulled together a number of current concerns including how customs and border protection start defining family\nI guess I hoped for more but you reported on this for ... what did you find important in that amnesty report that people should know about\nI guess that I and and the shocking is the number of families that were actually separated how even though and it provided and that number that's more than ... originally reported the anesthesia putting that more than six thousand families\nMinistry ... family separation policy that was announced are confirmed by Jeff Sessions and I believe it was April two thousand Eighteen it actually started to get rolled out quietly in July of two thousand Seventeen and so\nThey think that it impacted Fifteen thousand individual people and more than six thousand families and that still is just an estimate because\nWhen the policy was being rolled out more quietly with less oversight and without any sort of eyes on it publicly there's really no telling how many families were subjected to the policy how many families remain separate it or how many children were kind of disappeared into a system in their parents as well deported to never be seen again it was a really\nShocking report and that was just one part of it you mentioned a lot of the abuses that they're seeing a great deal of attention is devoted to the treatment of transgender women in particular who are migrating to the U.S seeking asylum\nLemon and the report report being sexually abused and assaulted in detention being detained alongside men and really having no recourse not receiving medical care for things that they need\nIt's a wide swath abuses that cover very very vulnerable people\nOne of the authors of the report indicated that in some of the situations are the behavior actually conforms to international recognized criteria for torture\n[laughter] yeah I mean I also spoke to an immigration attorney who told me he's representing some of the clients that were in the report and that he certainly thinks of this is torture and that falls along those\nLines and those definitions because the psychological damage that that parents experience not knowing where their children are for so long that knowing if they will see them and again and of course there's the damaged the children experience some are reporting that could be irreparable\nIt's been such a disturbing harmful\nI Can't use the word I Want to use it's been a mess and and now the Trump Administration is considering\nI'm rolling it out again so the public outcry while really overwhelming at times and it seemed to be the reason why the executive order signed it didn't seem enough to stop the Trump Administration from continuing this policy\nWill part of what informative reporting like yours does demonstrate\nContinuity and this juncture in immigration policies and practices it's not about Obama versus Trump or Democrats versus Republicans you know it's it's you know do we want a humane welcoming society and how do we go towards that or do we want a racist motive is one you know things have\nHappened before and still be worse now and that seems very important to to underscore and to make some so\nIf nothing else would I Hope that my reporting guys is it makes it clear and I'm really unapologetic and my stance on this as a journalist I think we're told that we're supposed to be unbiased but\nI can show you facts and evidence to show you that the U.S immigration system is inherently abusive and violent and racist and so what you're saying as the products of that it's just being wielded by a different administration that is more overtly\nAnti immigrant and more comfortable being overtly racist but that is always nice starting point and doing immigration reporting it doesn't matter who is in the White House that's that's the starting point that the tension is inhumane and violent and so is the immigration system\nWell when I was talking about letting immigrants action set the dynamic of the story rather than the u._s. government announced this policy here some quotes from immigrants in response I was thinking about recent pieces of yours one that ran on ...\nWay the activities are handled on public space in Washington is\nThere a demonstration activities which is you know all First Amendment activity that's handled separately because there is a fundamental understanding that that is what our public spaces or for a public spaces are for the public to use for free speech for dissent for debate for discussion of what matters\nWhen you come to Washington DC you are at the heart of the concept of petition the government for redress have grievances that is part of the basic mission of the national Park Service it is part of what they're supposed to do they don't\nOwn our public spaces the government doesn't own our public spaces there the stewards of our public spaces and they were simply supposed to manage them but they want to treat this now is if our public parks or public lands\nAre somehow their property there the wealthy land owners and they're letting us walk on their manicured lawns in charging us for them it's completely different than if a special event\nOr commercial film wants to come you space in Washington that shouldn't be charged to the taxpayers Wonder Woman was here during the summer I'm sure that costs in many hundreds of thousands of dollars\nAnd that is something that the Park Service is supposed to recoup from private commercial profit making venture as\nIt is completely different than First Amendment activity they want to conflate those two on top of all this they uh my organization the partnership for social justice funded a line by line review of the proposed regulations and found that they had hidden in there that they were closing the iconic White House sidewalk\nTo protest to this is the location that all of us can imagine people picketing and demonstrate on the sidewalk with a White House\nDemonstrations the anti war civil rights you know and fire metal writes all DVD everyone has gone to that location but the Trump Administration literally wants to take the ground out from underneath our feet\nWell Ryan Zinke he said we're just putting these things out there as ideas and a quote we want to have a genuine conversation with the public close club\nWhat that translated to was a public comment period which I understand that it's a recognized way that these process and he's worked at the same time\nYou know hey uh my nightly news must have missed it because I didn't hear anything trying to encourage me to engage in this public comment period about something that I might really care about you know so what did the process to look like and then you know folks did way and then what happened\nThey put out their proposal to public comment which closed October Fifteen that midnight and we started a massive public education and outreach campaign we digested this hundred page nearly a hundred page proposal broke it down\nWe reached so many organizations and groups who are reaching their own constituencies to get public comment in and that number which is still going up because uh comments are still registering even though the period as close\nAs now surpassed Seventy thousand comments\nIn response to Trump's anti protest plan but this language from thinking that they're just asking the question is not entirely accurate that is true with regard to one of the proposals but for all the rest of these extremely damaging proposals they wrote regulations\nThat will go into final rulemaking and that's why we were really focused on this public comment period to get some substantial comments in\nBecause an age of the month actually consider\nA substantive comments that are meaningful comments before can go to final rulemaking and explain how the final rules have considered those comments so many organizations put in very detailed very thoughtful comments a lot of affidavits and so we were building this administrate of record because we expect\nThat we will be litigating to stop these regulations were planning to file litigation as necessary torn joined them but we need to have the record underneath us which now we believe has been built in order to effectively do that\nWell let me just ask you what you hinted towards that but what's gonna happen going forward I hate to tell listeners\nThere was a time to weigh in but it's over you know obviously these are issues that will affect all of us in a deep way going forward and so I'd like to know kind of what's what's going to be happening and what can people do about it\n[noise] well I think there's a lot of ongoing activity that can happen there was a lot of a public awareness and public pressure that can be brought\nTo make this an extremely difficult process for the administration to move forward on you know some of the other proposals they haven't here they wrote regulations that would ban any future occupy action they will not allow any demonstration to exist\nFor more than thirty days you know you can see what they're trying to do they don't want any sustained presidents ever existing in the nation's capital again they have rules that would\nEliminate the certainty that permit applicants have when they submit applications and change the system so that there's basically a limbo system where the Park Service can just sit on permit applications for months at a time so for people to speak out on this and be raising awareness and ...\nAnd it's extremely valuable extremely important and we will be working with a lot of groups who are continuing to do that we've been speaking with mark ... executive director of the partnership for civil justice fun too you can follow their work can become part of it on line that

A. O. would be releasing a critical report\nFor a media activists the storm and the official response only under scored the need for the creation of communication systems grounded in community\nWill talk to someone working on just that Teresa ... director of resilient just technologies also on the show we've just seen how a number of states and cities have changed the\nWe'll stay a long overdue exercise and shifting attention from a mass murderer to the people whose lives cultures on land were devastated\nBut given that indigenous peoples in the U.S today face wildly disproportionate rates of police violence incarceration sexual violence and homelessness it should be clear that a conversation that begins and ends with history is not enough\nWe'll talk about going beyond symbols with writer and educator I'm Russell among director of the community and Labour project at University of California San Diego where she is a doctoral candidate in ethnic studies\nThat's coming up you are listening to counter spin brought you each week by the media watch groups fair\nAdvocates and activists are calling on FCC chair a jeep pi to appoint an independent commission to examine the causes for communications failures in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria just over a year ago\nOver Ninety five percent of cell sites were knocked out of service hindering rescue and recovery efforts days after the storm no TV and only a handful of radio stations could function and the restoration has been painfully slow\nThe coalition of groups also urged the agency to convene public hearings in Puerto Rico so that commissioners could hear directly from Puerto Ricans on how their lives were impacted by the lack of a resilient communications infrastructure [noise]\nBut the conversation around communications in Puerto Rico is not primarily one of petitioning the powerful\nIf anything the hurricane and the inadequate federal response have made clear or the need for other kinds of work and other places\nThat can give people more power over their communications rights as part of the fight for all of their rights our next guest is part of that work\nToday ... is director of resilient just technologies as well as an artist and organizer she's just back from the case and joins us now by phone from Brooklyn welcome to counter spin ...\nThank you well when we talk about communication failures in Puerto Rico after Maria we're talking of course about\nPeople who couldn't check on their family and friends because phones weren't working failures that may have increased the storms death toll of at least three thousand new research says as many as five thousand\nHuman beings the work you're doing seems to grow out of recognition of the full list meaning of communications technology and storytelling and how they meet\nSo what were you doing in the case and what does or doesn't it have to do with events of the past year\nWell first off I'm I'm from Puerto Rico originally I was born there but I was raised like many of my ... raised in the states\nBut I've continued to have a very deep connection with for the call and so in the past few years my emphasis has moved to trying to figure out really\nTangible ways to support the process of the conversation for the call because I have been working in media for a long time prior to this work I worked at global action project which is a huge media social justice organization so I work with young people and creating collaborative\nFilms that tells the story of what their issues are and how to resolve it and so I come from a doctor and a story telling myself on being the imports\nSo as a way to build community and so I moved into the work of technology and I started resilient just technologies is a way\nTo kind of garner all of the things that I've learned and the people that I've been fortunate to work with to see if I could leverage\nAll the different things that ... from the communications and convinces which includes not\nJust the communications but media political education decentralized technology you know storytelling a whole host of things that are interconnected with the idea of communications and so I was looking to leverage all of these different ideas for organizers in the front lines of racial economic and climate justice movements\nAnd so I've been working here in New York with New York city communities who are building local networks wireless networks for use in emergencies and for community organizing and so\nI really wanted to figure out how to use that knowledge and relationships and understandings to support my folks in Puerto Rico and the ...\nI was in the I guess just got back a few days ago I was in Vietnam as any comedy all to areas that for a variety of reasons have a long history both of struggle as well as of just really innovative ways of organizing communities so I was there to talk to\nCommunities who were directly impacted by the last of the communications infrastructure falling both hurricanes Irma and Maria as we saw or as we know of the communication system completely failed and so the purpose of these conversations with your story circles which is a a\nCultural organizing tool that comes from the south here in the U.S and the idea is to really in community have a conversation about that's what happened to us what was the impact of that\nAnd then also talk about what does adjusts communication system look like for people to really a vision ing as well and affirming the ways in which we've been able to organize already and protect ourselves in our communities and what came out of these conversations was\nA whole lot of stuff I mean there was the clear evidence of trauma and not just not being able to reach her relatives but not being able to reach\nMedical care not even knowing like what's happening day to day if there's access to clean water food was coming up so many things that people were just cut off from completely their basic human rights to communication the stories are really important to have really tell what really has been the impact but also as a healing justice\nPart of the work I think that\nSome of the times we have these conversations but we don't talk about the impacts of trauma in our communities and how we need spaces together and community to to really deal with it and address it and move together to continue supporting each other through it so I was in both ... to facilitate those stories are close with my\nFriends that free press and with most federal Saudi Arabia runs a healing justice and the colonization project import those people called step up\nAnd you're talking about the importance of these conversations and then there is the matter of creating and maintaining the space in which to have those conversations and there's where the technology can come in you know so I wanted to ask you about these portable network kits that you also work with\nRight so part of the project and my understanding of community technology as well as the just transition for what does he called means that our communities also need to have access to the infrastructure I think it's one thing to say you know we're going to push the FCC and the telecoms to do the right thing\nThat's another whole other projects to validate people's self determination by the ownership and governance of their infrastructure and so in a colonial situation these things are very very difficult and so the conversations that I've been having people there is like what technology is available that could support a lot of these\nJust removing the symbol really address the historical trauma and it definitely didn't address the fact that those systems still or the structure and foundation of this country\nWhere we heard it said earnestly yes but it's a step in the right direction but certainly in the corporate media anyway taking down the statues changing the name of holidays is presented as a dethrone ing and a controversial wanted that you know it's still up for debate\nAnd not as part of any plan of action in other words it's not seen as a piece of something larger it's kind of the end game [noise]\nYeah that's the problem [laughter] you know is that for most of us to\nActually those of us in indigenous communities who are experiencing these overwhelming statistics and didn't much women are more likely to experience disappearance sexual assault murder domestic violence than any other category of woman\nFor the native people are more incarcerated than any other category far more likely to experience police brutality [noise] those are the goals that we want to focus on the end of federal patriarchy the end of rape culture the end of the ... not incarceration of people's color and indigenous people\nStand up police brutality and removing the symbol of those things\nIllnesses to open conversation about those conversations needs to lead towards concrete action you know I think there's two ways that folks react to it on the one hand like I'm not criticizing indigenous people who participate in those action\nWhat they're doing is we occupy space stolen and so what they're doing is you know not just declaring that were still alive but we're still here but also that we have concern right that we have concerns that matter that needs to be addressed\nAnd that there's something about that the occupation such empowering for them but the way that I see\nInstitutions and cities take up the holiday is exactly opposite of that and I should have re occupation\nIt's more like this multi cultural consumerism that just puts you know the is ought to says oh I'm In business culture on display for settlers typically show and that's inherently different power it\nIt shouldn't be too hard for people to imagine a city on arena and recognizing on paper\nIndigenous people while at the same time just to creating sacred sites are polluting land in water or defunding social programs and so you have to think about it isn't just that it isn't enough\nIt actually can provide a kind of cover for those kinds of behaviors\nAnd in most cases it does I mean I think if you look at large cities like you know you look at the first is it just people say it was in Berkeley, California and\nThere's been since that time were the day was commemorated ongoing desecration of alone any land desecration of graveyards desecration of sacred sites\nMarginalization of indigenous people there and I guess you know everywhere else but it's been taking up\nIn Los Angeles and Phoenix [noise] you know across the board that the holiday is just you said something to make settlers feel like they're doing something without actually doing something\nWell I remember in New York Times story around the Dakota access pipeline struggle in which the reporter\nTalked about how indigenous people want to think about going back to what time before treaties you know which first of all of course what many would wanted for treaties to be honored you know but I I thought it represented a pervasive kind of\nVague sympathy that we see that in fact dismissive and and even in ... you know it's like oh wouldn't we all like to go back to\nA time of clean water when we were as one with the earth you know but at last we're grown up and we know that that's just silly you know it was a throwaway phrase in this article but it seemed to me to to represent a lot about how you can\nSort of throw sympathy towards the group while at the same time suggesting that they don't really have concerns that need to be actively addressed [noise]\nYeah I mean I'm a one had like it reinforces a lot of negative stereotypes ExxonMobil Savage but\nIt also reinforces this idea that indigenous people are are a race to be included and to be visible lives like our culture is there for the consumption versus indigenous nations having sovereignty\nAnd having the first rights to this land and also the the right of self determination and the right to protect our own people you know\nSo it kind of a live all of those concerns that fall into broadly the work of sovereignty probably the work because of the conversation or abolition\nWell many people are if not literally young you know a newly aware in their own experience newly becoming aware of the deeply painful history of this country you know and it's ongoing affects than its daily reproduction and it's ...\nWhat would you tell them about what it would take to make indigenous people's day campaign not a mirror rebranding but actual platforms first struggle\nAnd I think people are trying to do this so I'm going to say that but I'm also going to acknowledge that there are many indigenous people actually working on the sly and actually trying to strategize how can we use the holiday then a more effective way\nShow one of the things that I think if we're trying to change the relationships the social relationships that are constructed by colonialism by the ongoing process of genocide nothing concentration slavery\nThrough patriarchy that we have to start with the truth you know if you think about any of synthetic relationship it's built on sure\nWe have to be able to share the actual truth of what happened and some people use the holiday as a platform to try to get those messages out there some people are trying to use it as the educational opportunity to really control but\nThe truth of what happened and and what is ongoing what is still happening\nBut I think beyond that you know it has to be more than just education as well like our relationships with each other actually to transform and and so it does need to be part of a larger profit they manifest in actual material change\nMaterial change in our social relation some material change in our policies you know the policies of the schools the cities that are honoring are claiming to honor people\nNeed to change their policies towards edition of people was the lead lead to change\nWe've been speaking with ... you can still find the peace up rooting colonialism the limitations of indigenous people's day on indigenous action dot org thank you I'm Rochelle among for joining us this week on counter spin thank you\nAnd that that for a counter spin for this week counter spin is produced by fair the national
