thing you know they're relying upon hunting and fishing to feed themselves while they're on the river\nAnd there was a big difference and equipment to\nThis is the ... the necessities and measure mother of a mansion and they had to really want to go to these rivers and do that\nThere was no commercially made rafting equipment so all their life jackets their pants you know that wraps everything was thought out carefully to keep it really light and that was handmade and that was what they could afford\nThe Russian rafters made as much of their gear as\nPossible they're homemade frames made out of bladders that were covered in canvas had a rubber bladder on the inside he would carry those to the put in and then they would create a fan of these birch are I guess bridge mentions yeah for ...\nAnd they lash them together with whatever they had string 'em sit new whenever\nI got to see pictures of the Russian wraps and I truly couldn't believe it I mean it looked like something straight out of Huckleberry Finn but the thing is the homemade rafts worked even through raging whitewater\nAll these guys a lot of them are engineers and you know they had very professional jobs and some of them that they just they didn't have access to a lot of equipment\nBut that didn't really seem to be an issue for them in fact I don't remember something one of their Russian teammates said near the start of the trip\nAmericans very nice people I think a lot of stuff and I don't\nThat was ... you remember that [noise]\n\nAll through the trip as the Russians than Americans explored the river and got the hang out more what they notice was pretty simple it wasn't about politics which country was better or even more powerful but they noticed was how people approached getting down the river but they considered necessary to do it\nAt one point in the trip out of supply stop the Russian host asked if the Americans wanted what was described as forty kilos of fresh meat and they said yes\nEnough you know their power and all the food up helicopter showing up were loaded it all up and they have to bring down a couple of sheep with their\nFresh meat right there so they just throw those things in the chopper with us\nSo the live sheep end up in the boat with the rest of the supplies and they continue down river eventually they stop and make camp but this whole live sheep thing it isn't sitting well with one of the American team it's one\nOf our um participants decided she would feed the meat and says she anti though that shape and it took off and then there's those Russian guys where they were gone I never signed one run so fast and so the sheep met at an early end because they weren't going to have it get away again\nEarl and Glenda and everyone else on their team went to the Soviet Union with lofty goal to do team building while exploring and remote wilderness and they did but they learned something much simpler to\nYou know ignorance of um\nA different culture is um and and I

story with the American history guys each week back story takes the topic say first disease or college sports and explores the history of that topic in America here that guy\nI'm Brian about our ... and ...\nWe're talking today about the history of women and the American workplace before the break we were discussing what working life would have looked like for African American women in the decades fall when the under slavery we're going to go back a little bit further now and consider the workplace picture from another perspective that of young white women\nIn the first half of the nineteenth century they too were leaving the home and what might strike Jewish rosy numbers\nBy Eighteen fifty some twenty percent of on married white women were working outside the home and what many of them and countered all too often was the only wanted sexual attraction of their employers of our producers Nina honest\nI'm Wondering about the options available for women in the situation here's Nina tell us what you discovered\nThe first thing I found when I started looking into this story is that the thing we would call sexual harassment was all over the place in the nineteenth century\nI think that this might have been one of the greatest things that women fared\nThis is Lee Vanderbilt she's a law professor at the University of Iowa was written about sexual predation in this period\nAnd that's one of the reasons that there were so many limitations on the jobs that women could even take one of the ways to cut down on sexual harassment were simply not permit women to go to work in certain places [noise] keeps them away from men\nWhen economic necessity or their families to send them out into the world is launder says domestic servants and sometimes is factory workers it was very clear who is responsible for keeping them safe the women themselves\nBecause people at the time I Believe that chased women would not consent to sex before marriage no matter the circumstances\nMen were naturally\n... women were not if the man pursuit [noise] even with physical force or even with the threat that you will be dismissed if you do not submit the woman was simply instructed to refuse [laughter] that's it [noise]\nHer ability to say no\nMay not be listen to it may not even have been heard but that was the only thing she\nCould do why it's like this Vanderbilt says the relationship between workers and their employers was that a master and servant\nAmerican law said that no\nOne could interfere with that relationship\nIs another employer tried to entice to serve in a way with better pay better working conditions the master could sue that would be employer\nUh working women's ability to work in other words was basically owned by her employer\nWe interfered with the woman sexually has seduced her away\nHer services to the master even a husband who proposes marriage to her could be sued by the master who she worked for\nThe master could sue under something called the port of seduction it could be invoked when a young working woman was coerced into sex\nEspecially if she became pregnant\nRaising the question of course\nWhat happens when it was the boss himself who was doing the coalition\nIn that case says ...\nThere was only one other course of action the only way that she could get any protection\nAt all was this long shot of having her father's sue on her behalf [noise]\nConsider the Eighteen fifty eight case of ... the white cops in New York Sally Dane was indentured at each fourteen to a wealthy man named why cough in her first year on the job [noise] she became pregnant with his child she'd been returned to her father's house to give birth\nShe can no longer work to support the household economy she's become a burden on his household so she has a right to recover for his loss of her services\nNot only for the wages lost during her pregnancy but also because our marriage prospects would be shocked\nIn this case the New York courts eventually sided with her father and in similar cases other courts often to the same over the next few decades\nSome of us began to change a handful of states started allowing women to have rights over themselves and to sue for their own adoption\nBut that doesn't mean all women started benefiting from the protection of the law even in those states where they could sue seduction claims were viewed with a lot of suspicion\nWas a woman telling the truth or was she simply trying to bring down an upstanding man it didn't help the Victorian attitudes about sex where gradually falling away\nThe more women were seen as sexual actors the more they were expected to deal with negative sexual experiences as\nAnd that was the prevailing attitude until the Nineteen seventies it was done that women's groups finally gave a name to this workplace behavior\nIn Nineteen Seventy nine a young lawyer named captain McKinnon wrote a groundbreaking book making the case of sexual harassment qualified as discrimination under the Nineteen sixty four civil rights act\nThat argument was accepted by the courts and as the basis for sexual harassment law as it exists today\nFinally working women had an effective legal option to tackle the problem they'd been facing\nWell since forever the changes revolutionary really\nWe now have a cause of action and I think that that means that women are freer to consent now [noise] [noise] if they choose because they also know that they can refuse if they choose\nAnd all of this goes to a greater degree of freedom for everybody in\nThe battle for equality in the workplace is hardly Overton but American women are now at least in a position where they can own their ability to work and the rights to their own sexuality\n\nMinute honest she's one of our producers opening her shoulder story was ... professor of the University of Iowa poll of wall\nNow he's from back story with the American guy\nYou can guide

ness\n... was a stark intact I Know many people find the term struck it's hard to predict contemptible Portman into but never really was both payments in his own ride and an architect to the stars one

of Spain or Albert Einstein life magazine called picks fare only slightly less important than the White House\nAnd much more fun bets Los Angeles based reporter David Weinberger Neff designed to states for Charlie Chaplin Judy Garland Groucho Marx\nYou designed a houses for all three Marx Brothers Madonna is owned enough homes and try and keep the blonde from I'm leaving like Reese Witherspoon yes she she actually honestly and we've been fact checked into the living ranch in Ohio Jeffrey\nHead is an architectural historian and the author of a book on that I checked and Reese Witherspoon does in fact owned the Libby ranch at the end of his life while as enough could have lived in a\nGrand state on the coast or a huge mentioned in the Hollywood Hills but instead he lived in a one thousand square foot concrete bubble and less believed that this simple don't was one of his greatest architectural achievements\nThe story of the bubble house begins one morning when I was standing in his bathroom shaving [noise]\nNineteen thirty four so it was probably a street racer ... net flip down and noticed a small soap bubbles that formed and I think he reached out and touch the bottle held firm against his finger to\nThat was the moment the idea struck him\nHe could build with air he can build bubble houses and therefore wanted to build them by the thousands\nNear the end of the second World War architects were anticipating the postwar housing shortage and working on various solutions\nA larger view and want it to create a solution and to me than in for housing worldwide and\nJeffrey ... book about NASA is titled known nails no lumber because the bubble houses and you did know nails and lumber head says that ... never saw the bubble houses as a way to make money you sell them as a social responsibility a way to provide low cost housing for people\nHe really didn't make money from it and in fact I spent a great deal of money\nMoney from his other architectural practice and put it into the bubble houses\nPlus Neff was already rich remember he was building mansions for the Hollywood elite\nAnd his grandfather was Andrew McNally the car toggle for who created Rand McNally publishing\nDuring this idea of a dome shaped dwelling was not entirely new indigenous cultures in the Americas at certainly explored that territory even during this lifetime another guy Buckminster Fuller was creating his own circular solution to the housing shortage the geo desk dome\nYeah and I think there's a misunderstanding people you know look at the by the house and they think oh this is a variation on bucket for and it's it's really not it's it's more of a variation on a a a form of hearing in nature that someone has\nAdopted for human scale human years\nWhat was the original about ness design was the way the bubble houses were built now invented a new method of construction he cold air for years how it worked first a big slap\nGiant balloon in the shape of half a grapefruit with a flat side down this balloon was tied down to the foundation even deal hooks\nSo once the balloon was tied down it was inflated with a through an inland bells and it took all of five minutes later after the balloon was inflated that was coated in a bind powder in this this would happen before the gun I process uh yes gun ...\nMinutes of talking about the magical substance that is gun I were maybe you prefer the generic term Sean green\nYeah to the gun I was shot out of us in that gun and the gun had two houses that came together at a novel one of the novel had water and the other was dry some in the in the water in the mix\nCame together under high pressure to form the gun night when\nThe gun I tried it was more than twice as strong as regular concrete Neff\nLove this stuff once the balloon was coated in gun I'd a layer of wire mesh was placed over that then a second layer of gun I was sprayed on and bam that's it two men with a balloon and a gun machine could turn to bare patch of soil into a bubble house in less than forty\nEight hours an after the gun I tried the balloon was deflated and pulled out to the front door who can be used again on the next house\nAnd they claim that the bubble houses were more fireproof more earthquake proof and even more bomb proof than any traditional structure\nAnd that was so confident and has a design that he would often invite people to bash the walls of the bubble was the backside of an axe was\nAt the back so damn for some reason they use the ... I don't know what the reasoning was but I've seen an all the photos they're using the backside of the X. men like the best about the bubble houses though was that they were incredibly cheap\nAfter ... fine tune the reform process he went in search of a client someone with money would hire him to build more bubble houses and he found one the federal government\nBut first of all the houses were\nDone during the war to create a quick housing for government workers\nWorld War two it escalated and the U.S needed homes for military workers some ... convinced the government to build an experimental bubble house community in a forest in Falls Church Virginia\nTo remove him forty one Neff began construction on the twelve bubble houses in Falls Church that would eventually be nicknamed big we village\nThere was no lighting of any kind on the street and we arrived in the daytime but it was still quite dark because they were so many trees\nKathy miles grew up in one of the falls church bubble houses when she was five years old her dad who worked for the military drove the family into the forest to show them their new house he hadn't told his wife and two daughters that they would be living in a village of bubbles in the woods it was dark and damp and isolated\nAnd I can remember coming up the street and there was a clear area with still many trees and very little grass if any and there were flags stones and there was this\nHouse it didn't look like a house to me at that time that there was something rising up from the ground and it was white and large and it had to large lumps and they were held together in the middle with a smokestack\nAnd of course I was with my parents and um I don't remember what they were telling me but I'm sure it was something\nThat we were going to live in this new kind of house\nDo you remember what your mother's reaction was when she first saw\nHer over reaction was to stay calm and carry on a I think she was trying\nSo to come to something that looked like this I think she was truly horrified\nThe falls church community consisted of two single bubble houses and ten double bubble houses jumping lived in one of the double bubbles ...\nThe double bubbles were made by connecting to smaller bubbles with a rectangular cinderblock structure that how's the kitchen in the bathroom\nBecause he says that growing up in ... village was incredibly isolated\nAnd it made her stand out\nOne time when she was in first grade\nI set out to draw a picture of my house and of course we colored it and I couldn't color it because\nI kept insisting there were no white crayons and\nSo when the teacher looked at it she kept saint ex tried to explain to me that I was supposed to draw the house I Lived in and I kept saying I Do live in this house so\nFinally I felt that I wasn't doing what I was supposed to and she clearly had no idea what I was doing and of course when we passed all the houses around to our friends to look at the pictures the other children\nMade fun of it\nSo it was pretty daunting as a as an introduction to first grade for me\nRight no matter how great it was [laughter] or I mean I'm not talking about ironically great but you know like what if it was great we none of us would buy into it and I think that was part of his situation you know he wasn't like a hipster he he wasn't an unknown crazy\nYou made giant houses for rich people\nAnd yet that's never stopped believing in the bubble house he continued to make variations on it designing bubbles with straighter sides and flatter roofs ones with big holes cut out of the side\nEven at the end of his life long after it was clear that the bubble house had no future he saw as one of his greatest architectural achievements he believed in it so strongly that he spent the end of his life living in a bubble house in fact he lived in the same house he wrote an outlet and\nNow I don't want to play the bubble house off as just some failed\nIdea I think it should

then he dug a hole in the dead of night\n[noise] a year later stub Newell was standing my whole in the ground with a lump in his throat a day after orchestrating the incredible discovery of a biblical

hand over a giant fest in swirling it away for George Hall in his secret cabal of investors and then they took the job\nBut so does the risk\nEach town had its own experts its professors it's lectures of note could all take a crack\nAt the giant but most bought it the giant genesis and the whole thing [noise] some didn't and they said it was a statue but an ancient statue\nFrom some lost civilization which would have been a giant discovery if not a petrified one [noise] but every now and then\nSomeone would call it when it was just a giants game but George Hall and his investors managed to stay a step ahead moving on to another city before people caught on in demand and the answers and they would have to own up to reality\nThere was one person who didn't care at all whether it was real P. T. Barnum knew a good show and he saw one and he made them an offer he wouldn't be in sixty thousand dollars to rent the giant for three months\nAnd this was a good deal\nThat's about ... million of today's dollars\nIn George Hall it only spent the equivalent of thirty grand to make is petrified marvel their tour it was still doing\nWell but not that well\nThey never make the kind of money in Fremont [noise]\nThey didn't have Barnes promotional genius and most importantly they didn't have as a mammoth museum in downtown Manhattan [noise]\nBut they didn't take the offer\nBecause Manhattan was the problem they had managed to make a small fortune often outrageous fake [noise]\nBut people were starting to poke holes in the story letting\nLittle drops of doubts in three months in the spotlight and the biggest city in the world\nThe whole thing was bound to get washed away [noise]\nAnd Barnum said fine and then he made his own giant [noise]\nNo one can figure out exactly how he did it maybe someone made a plaster cast in the dead of night maybe someone had been surreptitiously making elaborate sketches at every stop on the tour [noise]\nBut in the fall of Eighteen sixty nine [noise] an exact replica of the card of giant\nWent on display and Barnum Museum [noise]\nAnd of course he claimed it was the real thing [noise]\nThe owners of the real big giant were outraged\nThey threatened to sue environments and bring it on you bring your giant into court\nAnd I'll bring mine and we'll ask a judge to decide which one is really a petrified person\nGeorgia all knew he was ...\nHe signed a book deal and then he admitted the whole thing [noise]\nAnd people still came to see the giant for a while\nIt may not have been a real magical mythical creature\nBut it was still pretty cool [noise]\nIt wasn't a real giant but it was a giant celebrity\nIn George ... took his money and he sold some books [noise]\nAll these different techniques than than than ... as a lawyer with ... what he called false registration colors within the lines of the the rocks would wind up with the color behind it and then he said that was to give you a speech in\nWhich he knew all about because he grew up in New Mexico\nHe grew up in that kind of thing he played in the rocks in ... I'm sure all that influenced his take on on the debt is when he did the cartoon [noise]\nAnd this is how Murray snow will become a hero to lay out designers\nRemember his work is not supposed to detract from the characters I mean and the layoffs are supposed to support the animation and make it stand out and he does that brilliantly but he also developed a unique unrecognizable style I mean it's almost like he built a stage for a show but the stages winking at the audience\nSo I studied animation at Cal arts and so we'd be watching a cartoon like duck Dodgers and the twenty fourth and a half century\nAnd we would burst out laughing because daffy duck it landed on planning an ax and Marie said drawn the clouds in the trees in the shape the giant exits\nI'll just and if we follow those planets\nOut why\nAs noble as coming into his own he's starting to get co director credit on some of the films but Doug Jones is still\nReaping most with the claim\nTop pulse and one of them are he says ... says that this became a point of tension between them in the sixties when they were working at a gym\nThere was a working relationship\nAnd it can became more and more strained as shark\nBecame more and more successful especially in the sixties and then that that came to a head when they made on the line\nThat on the line with an adaptation of a children's book and\nIt was about a a dog that falls in love with a line\nAnd it's a story on their romance Chuck Jones with the director on the short but he was having trouble figuring out how to adapt it to the executives Montgomery says well\nIf if you don't fall short I can make this work for you [noise]\nIt's so charmed brought this stuff in through it down on his desk and stomped out and reach wouldn't show him when he was working on\nOnce upon a time there was this since ...\nIn love with it don't [noise]\nYou're giving the hobby and the U.S can do that and to\nPut the dog was going to be interested [noise]\n...\nWild and I'm Kevin ...\nNever seemed to have anything on his mind at all\nIt's probably the most personal of all races films because it's really just him on the screen as pure graphics there's no\nClassic characters as you might might think of them is just tossed lines is purely abstract um but really beautiful\nThe film is is this pure a distillation of Murray says work and he's telling a story creating emotions and humor with just basic shapes and colors but Chuck Jones still got director credit\nAnd of course they won the Oscar\nBut he said that that sure didn't ever think came\nAnd Todd says that even though everyone knew was Murray suicide film\nMurray's wasn't invited to the Oscars so Chuck Jones unreasonable kept working together they worked on how the Grinch stole Christmas and a bunch of other Dr seuss adaptations but they fell out of touch for about Twenty years until the early Nineteen nineties when Warner Brothers reunited them to make cartoons at play before feature films\nThey hired a bunch of young artists who just graduated from Cal arts and one of them was Scott Morris\nMorris no voice number where do you where do I know that from I was like oh it's because it was one of the names that preceded directed by Charles M Jones and all of the cartoons that I grew up watching every day of my life\nWasn't the first lessons that Scott learned was that Murray's is fantastic backgrounds were not just invented out of thin air Murray's did a ton of research everything he exaggerated was based on something in the real world\nYou'd get an assignment like um oh you know Bugs Bunny is gonna be stuck on a desert island or are stuck on the jungle Ireland so there should be palm trees and should be able to stop and say okay great\nAnd I come back with a ... with the with the drawing and he'd be like what does this and it might have their palm trees and he's like those are stuck as were what were you looking at and it's like well there's a poetry or it out the window is like that's a ... you gotta learn your trees\nBut Murray's wasn't really that graph after work you talk to these twenty two year old animators like he was just one of the guys\nHe'd be life with school or just with the baseball game let's go do this other thing you know we should go to a museum pretty soon you realize he's more like your grandpa who is just a really cool guy to hang out with\nSo Scott Morris Mr above artist became known as the noble boys and Marie's pushed them to develop their own style but his sensibility really seeped into their work\nLike Scott is that Pixar now which is the home of three D. animation which we think is the complete opposite of you know the flat landscapes of loony tunes but you can really see Murray says influence on the Pixar Films if you look for it like um the film I\nThink about that house carried by a massive amount of balloons and lands on the very edge of a cliff foreign ... cute little robot is skirting around these big menacing powers of garbage\nYou know those are layout that make you smile that's that's classic Murray's [noise]\nIn May of two thousand one the noble boys were reunited when last time we\nAll got the call them Maurice he was in hospice basically at home it was just natural causes that he that he was dying of and he was pretty sure you know everybody's pretty sure that that night was going to\nMaybe be the last night so we all came over and hung out with him and Chuck Jones did call that night I remember being in the room with Maurice in somebody brought him photos of trucks on the phone and more says like okay I'll I'll talk to them and we all knew for a fact they haven't really talked for months if not a couple of years at that point\nAnd I just heard Maurice his side of the conversation but you know you could definitely tell that they were ah they put everything behind them in their friends you know and it was nice and I again I don't know exactly what Chuck sat on the other end of that line but um it was a very sweet moment to be able to see that\nUm and know that people could go through a lot together life and still\nHave respect for each other you know up to the last minute and kind of celebrate what they had created together\nTo some extent Murray southern noble boys as real legacy he was proud of the fact that they had blossomed into well rounded artist\nIf Maurice could leave behind this idea in other people to do their own thing\nWas a beautiful beautiful background [noise]\nI actually met ... double oh yeah yeah um I I went to Cal arts and I came in our class I was like a Monday Night and I happen to have gone to the opera the day before and you know the weekend and I was thinking about how often those guys made fun of opera and their cartoons\nBut I've been\nTo the pool widow or [noise]\nAnd I asked him you know did you guys actually go to the opera regularly or were you just kind of making fun but it just sort of you know highfalutin cultural institution\nAnd he asked me what operate did you see [laughter] and I said ... and he said uh the uh like a death is beautiful\nAnd none of the man who knew a good death when he

PR act [noise] [noise]\nI don't get blown away by um the movie stars because I've seen them over their head down\nLike I thought he had to wait a this is of course not as bad as it is for a person who restarted there [noise]\nOkay so kept up with the Internet and they have all kinds of applications and I could spend the next hour talking about all the different applications but since I don't want to do at the ... one of the application Stuart Little story and it's a this one's a few years ago slashed off which is a very popular website for nerd\nPut up with this fall and their site asking which is the best computer science graduate school in the United states\nNow do you think about it for a second this is a really dangerous question to ask over the Internet because as soon as the pole went up students at Carnegie Mellon wrote a program that voted for Carnegie Mellon millions and millions and\nThe next day through it ends at MIT rose their own programs and a few days later the pool has to be taken down because both the I mean I might have more than six billion votes [noise]\nAnd every other school had less than a thousand so I guess [noise]\nIf you think about it the poll did exactly what it was supposed to do [noise]\nBut in general we simply cannot trust the results of an online focus anybody could just write a program to vote for their favorite option\nNow one possible solution to that if the capture to make sure that only humans can vote\nOkay so kept us can can be used to improve what post another application of captures isn't free email services you've probably this is probably were most do we have seen kept us so there's a lot of companies that offer free email a Google Microsoft Yahoo it's better and up until a few years ago there were all suffering from a very specific type of attack\nAnd it was people who wrote programs to obtain millions of email accounts every day and the people who wrote these programs were ... so here's the thing if you're a spammer and you want to send spam from the Yahoo account you want your spouse to come from some account at Yahoo dot com\nYou run into the problem but each Yahoo email account only allows you to spend like a hundred messages today so if you're a spammer and you want to spend a hundred million messages per day to the whole world you have to obtain millions of ... ... email accounts from which you can spend the spam okay so this is why spammer spoke program still paying millions of accounting\nI'm doing just and and the solution to this\nAnd the pain for email accounts okay so that's what the capture so therefore when general kept us are used to stop spammer from doing bad things on the Internet\nNow of course the cameras on their side started coming up with all kinds of dirty half to get around that captures that are being used in practice let me show you one of them\nAre just we called them capture sweatshops so spam companies have actually started hiring humans whose sole job is just kept us all day long\nMaybe it's just people who sit there typing captures all day long for spam company uh this is happening this is usually happening in other countries where the minimum wage is a lot lower\nBut it's happening um but there's at least two consolation first\nIt's at least costing them some\nSo whereas before I ... get millions and millions of email accounts for free now they have to pay a fraction of a ... so they can get that many second if you think about it captures that actually generating jobs and underdeveloped countries [noise]\nUh okay so this is what some a spam company so I started doing let me tell you an even dirtier hack and this is what some pornography company so I started doing so in case you didn't know that there's pornography on the Web\nAnd pornography companies would also like to send back so let me show you\nOne trick that they're doing okay so um imagine this pornography company would like to spend ... from Yahoo account okay so they they need to obtain millions of Yahoo accounts from which they can spend spans what they do is they write a program that fill out the entire registration form of Yahoo\nNow whenever this program gets to the capture Programme can't read it so what it does is a copy is to capture to the foreign page\nNow back in the ... there's a lot of people looking at pornography\nAnd suddenly one of them get screened saying hey if you want to see the next pornographic image of pornographic video you gotta types the word that's in the buffalo\nAnd you know what people do they take the word as fast as possible [noise]\nAnd by typing if they are effectively solving the capture for the foreign company that is they are effectively getting an email account with a foreign company can later used to spend you\nI keep telling people pornographers they're very smart people\nOkay so now let me let me show you one more thing about capital so the idea of a capture is much more general must have you have seen uh the same type of capture the ... characters but the idea is a lot more general the idea is just it's just a test\nThat we're trying to test whether the user is actually a human and not some sort of computer program okay so let me show you some different examples of captures that people have started coming up with a and I'm just going to show them to just because I I find them pretty funny so these are these are also going to this all supposed to be\nTested that humans can easily do but the computers cannot you have to do\nOkay so let me show you I'm One of them to start but let me show you one on one of them that started coming up in all kinds of Russian fight this we're going to call the Russian capture this is what you have to do [noise]\n\nIt's funny the things that in Russia are the things that anybody could just off limits\nOr this actually happens to be a pretty back after this is not a very good for the computers can actually do this all the limit but but it's funny to think that\nTo see that they think that anybody could just all the limit but this is the Russian capture you have to let me let me show you one that started coming up and all kinds of Indian sites we're going to call it the Indian capture\nYou have to analyze the circuit\nThis is I'm not even I'm not even making this up for this started coming um again it's interesting to see that in India they think anybody could just analyze the circuit a but\nOf course again this is a pretty Capra capture computers can actually do this so well now let me put this in contract so in ...\nIn the out of the capture you have to want to like the circuit let me show you the capture that started coming up and all kinds of\nUs based blogs were going to call this the American capture\n\nAgain this is a pretty crappy capture because computers can actually add [noise]\nSo let me tell you what I actually want to tell you about in the ... the first little part I just needed to introduce you to the concept of a cap so now I'm going to tell you what I really want to talk about which is this newer project called recapture we started working on just about two years ago um\nAnd this is sort of the future of capturing but let me tell you and and this came from a so this new project came from\nOne number it turns out\nThat approximately two hundred million kept just our type every day by people around the world just quickly characters about two hundred million\nWords are type every day by people around the world\nNow when I first heard this number was proud of myself I thought look at the impact on my research has had\nA but then I started feeling bad so here's the thing each time you type one of these annoying kept just essentially you're wasting ten seconds of your time\nAnd if you multiply that by two hundred million you get the humanity as a whole is within five hundred thousand hours every day typing these annoying after\nA yeah so I [noise]\nSo I started feeling bad a ... and then I started thinking\nWell of course we can't just get rid of captures because the security of the Web sort of depends on them but then I started thinking is there any way new and she can use this effort for something that's good for humanity here's the thing\nDoing those ten seconds while you're typing a capture your brain is doing something amazing your brain is doing something that computers can not yet to do\nSo is there a way in which you can use those ten seconds for something that's good for humanity another way of putting it is is there some humongous problem that we can not yet get computers to solve\nBut somehow we can split into tiny ten seconds chunks pushed that each time somebody types of capture the actually building a little bit of this problem\nAnd the answer to that is yes and this is what we're doing now so what you may not know is that nowadays when you type of ... not only are you a ... herself as a human but in addition you're helping digitize books\nOkay so the idea of the following there's a lot of projects out there trying to digitize books um the Internet archive half one Google has one now Amazon with a Kindle half when they're\nThey're trying to digitize books and basically what they're doing if they're taking all books books that were in before the computer age and scanning them so that they can be an electronic format base and the way the book ditched the station works as follows you start with an old book\nPhysical book and then you scan is now scanning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book and this is literally what's getting a book means it's the way they do it if they take a digital photograph every page of the book\nThe next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to decipher once you've you've taken all these photographs with every page of the book the computer needs to be able to decipher all of the words in the photograph that so that you can search through\nThe the textbook okay so the computer program needs to look at these photographs\nWith text in them and it needs to be able to decipher them that don't you think you can also called owes the are for optical character recognition program but those are not the problem with most ER is that it doesn't always work very well especially for older books where the income faded\nThe computer can recognize a lot of the character so for example\nIn the age in the over there you see that it has lost its bridge because it's the greatest thing has the greatest so the computer can recognize me or the character so for example in this particular scan which is actually a pretty high quality scan for something to say if you try to get the computer to recognize the characters in the run OC are on this this is what you got\nIt was a moratorium days for the bread men people a test of their devotion and the method of schooling them in the proper ritual ... the strategic withholding

Nathan ...\nHere's Nathan will [noise]\nRecently\nI've visited Beloit, Wisconsin and I was there to honor a great twentieth century explore Roy Chapman Andrews\nDuring his time at the American museum of natural history Andrews let a range of expeditions to uncharted regions like here in the Gobi Desert he was quite a figure he was later it said the basis of the Indiana Jones character\nAnd when I was in Beloit, Wisconsin I gave a public lecture to group of middle school students\nAnd I'm here to tell you if there's anything more intimidating and talking here it's had there'll be trying to hold the attention of a group of a thousand twelve year olds for forty five minute lecture\nOr don't try that one I'm at the end of the lecture they after a number of questions but there was one that's really stuck with me since then there was a young girl who stood up and she asked the question\nWhere should we explore I think there's a sense that many of us have the great age of exploration on earth is over there for the next generation they're going to have to go to outer space or the deepest ocean some order to find something significant to explore what\nDoes that really the case and they're really nowhere significant for us to explore left here on earth\nSort of made me think back to one of my favorite explorers in the history of biology this isn't explores the unseen world Martin is by rank\nSome firing set out to discover the cause of tobacco mosaic disease what he did is he took the infected juice from tobacco plants and he would filter it through smaller and smaller filters\nAnd he reached the point where he felt that there must be something out there that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known a bacteria at the time\nHe came up with a name for his mystery age and he called it\nThe virus a mountain for poison and in sort of uncovering viruses firing fairly open\nThis entire new world for us we now know that viruses make up the majority of the genetic information on our planet more than the genetic information all other forms of life combined\nObviously there's been tremendous practical applications associated with this world things like the eradication of smallpox uh the advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer which we now know is mostly caused by human papillomavirus\nAnd Byron discovery this was not something that occurred five hundred years ago a little it was a little over a hundred years ago the firing discovered viruses so basically we had automobiles but we were unaware of the forms of life and make up most of the genetic information on our planet\nWe now have these amazing tools to allow us to explore the unseen world\nThings like deep sequencing which allow us to do much more than just sort of skimmed the surface and look at individual genomes from a particular species but to look at entire met a genomes\nCommunities have teeming microorganisms in on around us into document all of the genetic information in these species we can apply these techniques to things from soil to skin and everything in between a reconciliation we now do this on a regular basis to identify\nA the causes of outbreaks that are sort of unclear exactly what causes them\nAnd just to give you a sense of how this works or imagined that we took a nasal swab from every single one of the un says something we commonly due to look for respiratory viruses like influenza\nThe first thing that we would see is a tremendous amount of genetic information\nAnd if we started looking into that genetic information we see a number of usual suspects out there of course a lot of human genetic information but also bacterial and viral information mostly from things that are completely harmless within your nose but we also see something very very surprising as we started to look at this information\nIn your nose doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before new plant animal fungus virus or bacteria basically we have no clue what this is and for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data\nFew of us have actually been done to call this information biological dark matter we know it's not anything that we've seen before it's sort of the equivalent of an uncharted continents\nRate within our own genetic information and there's a lot of it if you think twenty percent of genetic information your nose is a lot\nOf biological dark matter if we looked at your gut up to forty or fifty percent of that information is biological dark matter and even in the relatively sterile blood around one to two percent of the information is dark matter can't be classified can't be type dramatic with anything that we've seen before\nAt first we thought that perhaps this was artifact right these deep sequencing tools are relatively new but as they become more and more accurate we've determined that this information is a form of life or at least some of it as a form of life\nAnd while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter really only in their infancy there's a very very exciting\nPossibility that exist buried in this life are signatures in this genetic information are signatures of as of yet on identified life that actually explores\nThe strings of aids T season jeez\nWe may uncover a completely new class of life\nLike firing full fundamentally changed the way that we think about the nature of biology the perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of cancer that afflicts us or identify the source of an outbreak that we don't unfamiliar with or perhaps create a new tool and molecular biology I'm pleased to announce that along with\nColleagues at Stanford and Cal Tech can UCF\nWe're currently starting an initiative to explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life\nA little over a hundred years ago people were unaware of viruses the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet a hundred years from now people may marvel that we were perhaps completely unaware of a new class of life that literally was right under our noses\nIt's true we may have charged at all the continents on the planet and we may have discovered all the mammals that are out there but that doesn't mean that there's nothing left to explore on earth ... times provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers people like that young girl from Beloit, Wisconsin\nAnd I think if we phrase that lesson it's something like this don't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story go after the dark matter in whatever field you choose to explore their unknowns all around us and they're just waiting to be discovered\n\nThat was Nathan wolf recorded it had

... mom over here the human voice [noise]\nWho am I\nA twenty year old student of Brooklyn College with a goal to become successful and everything I Do\nA Christian who love of God and his son Jesus and for that I Am involved in a church I'm On the praise team I ... and I work with children my weekdays consistently attending class every day and go in a trench probably two to four times a week so my brother the Jimmy\nGrowing up uh usually went to church Monday Night\nWhen the night friday night Saturday and Sunday Sunday morning and Sunday evening also\nI Would say that I'm pretty focused and I'm On my way to my destiny so what's the problem you may ask well there isn't any what to say I'm lacking a social life as well as when I get older well they regret anything those thoughts tend to pop in my mind sometimes other times I say take one day at a time\nI said that can surpass anyone thought my weight the loan keeps me from feeling like I Will enjoy life as much\nBut as a young person I Know it should be experiencing a lot more\nWatching movies or TV we see how fun cause can be when people go away and get a quote unquote we'll college light for some one equals partying drinking and having sex\nJust some people have fun in that extent I Want to be able to look at my college years and say I had an enjoyable life and you know all the crazy things I did a good time\nAt the same time it's important for me to live a well conducted lifestyle because of my beliefs\nMost people in their twenties still think the same way some people will say just do whatever you want live life\nOthers would say just do things and destruction\nAround asking people around my age on campus if they ever felt as young person that they were playing but if I'm doing something but because of their religion or any moral values they haven't\nYeah does a actually a lot of stuff the I wanted to do but because of our religion or however such as ah [noise]\nProbably partying I'm\nThings like just getting fossils is prohibited ... if\nThat's when I think about joining or rushing for paternity today do don't really carry any but ah ... structure Christian values and conflicts of where I personally believe\nOne of my church who was a reference and has a doctorate and theology and philosophy told me how she was when she was around my age\nI wasn't the party type I didn't grow up that way um my priorities for different so I'm I was more involved in church more involved in school and more and was in school activities so I didn't really have the time for a party\nWell that's great concerning what she had become and how lifestyle is it's a marble and I do look up to her\nBut then other times hearing things from people who aren't so religious who said just live your life do whatever you want makes me think yes I agree just live life to do what makes you happy just like Justin said\nOr do whatever uh makes me happy and as long as it's not harming anyone else I don't see any problem with it so I pursue whatever I Want\nI've never been fully one sided where I couldn't understand someone's point of view\nBut being in charge I Know that if not all about me but the main purpose of why I'm here I Know that there are some things in life that have to stay away from doing I can do whatever I feel like doing because some things are wrong in God's eyes and I'm just trying to live righteously\n[laughter]\n\nImagine being home on Facebook and all your invitations art invites you to a party that starts eleven PM ending for in the morning\nI Can't do that for three reasons number one my mom will not habits number two I Will be considered not living a proper lifestyle\nAnd that person will love to be in my bed around that time\nI go out partying and then be a tambourine the following Sunday it's just not cool so what else is there to do being a twenty year old in college with beliefs\nWhen I asked my past the high fat young people should live their lives he was the one thing that made me think and I appreciated it\nI was in college not to do things that would\nCause them to do more on our cause them to be all things that will take away from the integrity or their character for as a person\nBut yes there you know I Would encourage them to to focus on the goal the the school goes the\nPersonal ... allies the thing that they want to achieve\nGoals for your before because these are vigilant of it um be be very diligent\nIn Richmond our goal doing everything to make that happen and then I'm during the process that can enjoy all the finest things in life like going out with a friend for dinner crews\nAre skiing trip or or things are those are really bring a balance of fellowship and friendship center not robbing them of integrity or moral values in their lives I'm Still achieving their goals being young you know you ought to adventure is\nEncouraging words from Christians helped me see that I shouldn't worry about things in life but to try enjoy my life the best way I can still knowing what I ought not be doing\nSkiing going on a cruise sounds interesting I haven't done any one of them and now when I think about it there are few other things that I've always wanted to do OK so cool so all they have to do now is invite some friends\nMoney much less a job to pay for what it's all work\nWell there goes a bump in the road but you may not always be a problem lack of knowledge of all the fun things available can be what I Need to look into but one thing I Know I Will check me with something my friends had told me\nI Want to get to that point where I look back and I want to tell my kids when I was younger you know that type of story I just don't want to sit and say well I'm fifty years old and I want to go experienced things that you know you should have done in your teams\nThat is one of the things that I'm focused on top of the story and memories that can keep me company and make me laugh when I get older I don't want to end up having a ... being bored or moving to another level of the night before I experienced a lot\nWhen I asked my brother Jimmy if he ever let that his life and said man my life is so boring\nHe said everything I've done a I guess a purpose for ... and and in terms of you know having fun because I\nI've always had fun growing up but for fun\nBut when I asked him if when he looks back if he would have done anything differently he said no\nMountain mama took nine I'm married with a farm so early get for the home watch\nSome say it's never too late to experience whatever you want no matter how old you are\nThat's true to an extent but what if I don't live up to see fifty\nThan what my mind is and will always be an area in which I think about a lot of things but somehow I always get answers for them so I'll continue to live my life taking it one day at a time worrying about absolutely\nYou're listening to NPR rex remarried [noise]\nFind out more and explore the amazing world independent

because you can't really shop for it I'm not religious I grew up in a small town about the size of rental Vermont where I live now and we had a Christmas tree at home but never went to church\nPeople around here get really Christmas see which is actually usually fun to be around but it doesn't resonate with me personally in a big way as a holiday so here's what I Do for buy nothing day for the entire day I don't buy anything and I go for a walk outside\nThat's it and I do it every year\nI got the idea for the walk outside part of it from Bill McKibben his first book the age of missing information which he wrote in Nineteen Ninety two\nYou probably know McKibben he's the guy behind three fifty dot org he's an earnest sensible Vermont or from rich and concerned about climate change and other things that are maybe ruining world\nThis was back in the earlier days of cable TV an endless ... on what would actually beyond those five hundred channels we were promised\nMcKibben found the city that had the most cable channels Fairfax, Virginia and recorded twenty four hours of its programming and then he watched all of them over a period of about six months two thousand hours of television\nAnd then he spent twenty four hours in the Adirondacks just thinking about things and he wrote a book comparing the experience is\nWhat sets wilderness apart in the modern day he said it's not that it's dangerous it's almost certainly safer than any town a road you can so they say be alone in a crowded room for full of exotic animals there are more at the zoo it's that five miles out in the woods you can't buy\nAnything the Cuban later wrote a book hundred dollar holiday case for more joyful Christmas which was a project on the local churches to spend more money and time making sure everyone had their basic needs met and less money and effort on the shopping part of Christmas\nCreating genuine community traditions that instilled a sense of wellbeing and fellowship not feelings of urgency in competition my partner and I already have a twenty dollar ish limit for any holiday exchanges with bonus points being given for best recycled wrapping paper\nHe usually wins because he uses old maps\nLast year I was given some of that green lobby that you can use to get all\nA really thoughtful gift it's odd for me to be in a culture where by something is thought of as a positive message and don't buy something is somehow political\nWe've made a national anti holiday out of the day after Thanksgiving and somehow feel okay that the term Black Friday implies that if we don't shop these giant stores may go out of business since they've been operating in the red since January\nSetting aside this otherwise Black Friday for not buying anything and going for a long walk seemed like not such a big sacrifice considering\nAt the same time it required advanced planning was I going to drive anywhere that I have gas in the car that I have bills that were do that I have enough coffee and milk in the house did using gift cards count what about coupons for free things had like Netflix\nKendall apps barter public transportation tipping learning about the\nPressure points is a good part of thinking about consumerism\nThe good thing about a made up holidays is that you can also make up your own rules in the end we decided to aim for a negative cash flow for buy nothing day and plan to donate a dozen pairs of glasses that had belonged to my father and then we next that idea and decided not to get in the car at all\nPart of buying nothing for me is giving myself permission to say that I don't really enjoy shopping not real good and parking lots fluorescent lights make me a little jumpy I can get judgments about other people's parenting techniques and then I get mad at myself for that\nTyped in overlapping shrieking Christmas carols make this unease worse than usual\nI Can't stop thinking somehow about how the price of everything is calculated through some formula that takes into account the price of the cheap lighting and the music licensing and the narrow parking lot lines\nAnd yet overtime I've moved somewhere where I can get more of the things I have to shop for and places without terrible parking lots or\nPiped in carols places where I mostly run into my neighbors and where the money I spend goes to employ my other neighbors I Need less and I buy less\nIt's not for everyone and that's okay with me too\nSo on buy nothing day we ate leftovers from the day before we read books on the couch under a blanket we fed the birds and check to see if there were any frogs left and the frog pond there weren't and we went for a three mile walk as the sun was setting and talked about the previous buy nothing day that\nWe could remember [noise] it was a pretty great

I Would imagine they have yeah um I think that they're funny also the group in ... in a way I think there's a lot of the bottom the energy where a lot of times music today so a ... and I loved that I Love depressing and everything but their music kind of put me on a different\nA level and I like their seems in their in their music\nI don't even know what it's about it's like it's so much I like the way she says do like my\nWhich I think she was making fun of people that might take that up and do you usually smoke or drink or party\nThat was saint Petersburg by Brazilian Girls it is against DJ Project on KCRW I'm ...

not necessarily I think so either some natural disaster to tell your story I think the who's missing we will you what happened do you have enough food do you have enough water\n\nEnd on an evening shift one town over Dr Sarah ... examines the thirty year old named Kevin deeper [noise]\nTry again\n\nKevin is uninsured he came to this free clinic in east long medical or tissue volunteers as part of her residency because his costs won't go away\nFor ... yeah but it got worse and worse and worse were couldn't breathe and everything from traditional sources were showing\nThat sounds great sounds exact feeling so where did all that start unlike\nMany other tissues cases Kevin is pretty straightforward she recommends ibuprofen for inflammation\nBut mostly unfortunately the things that we all know about that we never knew that we are the hardest time getting\nThese young doctors are in the middle of their residency at Bay State medical center in Springfield hospital affiliated with Tufts University they've completed four years of medical school so they're already MDs and are now in the hands on part of their training\nMost residents at Bay State or in internal medicine a broad term to cover specialties like cardiology gastroenterologist or dermatology\nBut ... a part of a specialized to track one designed to create more primary care doctors Michael Rosen bloom is a residency director\nYou get people before medical school and then at the beginning of medical school just a huge ... says the story could have been a classical four and a half minute report but she felt in our guts but there was a lot more there when in order for the story to warrant more time to do to change in surprise\nI really wanted to find out how things turned out and I just didn't know in the beginning and I wanted it to unfold in front of me and I didn't know if it was going to unfold in any kind of interesting way and I had to do a fair amount of upfront recording just to find the characters that I thought\nI had the greatest chance that there would be something surprising and maybe a twister too\nHarping on a topic I have a tendency to harp on notice the Karen's planning her story in advance not entirely but enough to know if she has a minimum a story she's not leaving everything up in the air and hopes the radio God's smile upon her microphone\nJust saying anyway back to care and she says just because you think there's a longer story doesn't mean there is one that requires a leap of faith\nThe leap of faith list that there would be a story worth telling I just kind of cross my fingers and hoped that it would I didn't know whether they were going to let me continue interviewing them I'm probably knew they would get tired of the project and and tell me they didn't want me to interview them any more [noise]\nUm I didn't know if there would be anything interesting that happened during that period of time said that leap of faith was was really that there would be enough twists and turns and surprises in following this group of people to warrant a long form documentary\nSo when she left the three doctors looking for surprises and changes in the characters trust was key\nYeah that that was pretty difficult actually [laughter] and and that is probably\nThe most compelling reason that you really need a year to do a story like this um you know it took me probably three or four months just to gain the trust of\nThe residents I was interviewing and the um the resident director's um\nThe PR department had to sort of um give me the go ahead to meet with these residents on my own and not always have a hospital representative there that was that was sort of my ground rule but they didn't agree to that right off the bat\nAnd then there were the patients they required a wait and see approach on her part\nSome of the time it was just me hanging out backstage hoping that a patient would come in um who would be willing to have me you know in their appointment\nHaiti job ends isn't a good mood is she looks at her roster of patients she's invited me to hang out on her shift on this fall morning her first patient as a no show the second is one of her favorite\nArrows I already do I\nRosa is fifty nine she's recovering from surgery and just back from vacation\nThey speak through an interpreter as Dr job in looks Rosa directly in the eyes have you been feeling any chest pain and all of them for whom and roasted tells me that job and has been a lifesaver over the past year a year that included a severe about depression\n... ugly ups like taking a lot of medication\nHow did you secure permission to record from the patient stands up at the end um I didn't [laughter]\nI figured that was the PR departments job\nSo anytime that um you know that anyone let me wander around the hospital or wander around the clinic\nUm I was I was very upfront I just talked to the um the patience and I just told them what I was doing um but if there was a PR person there they had them sign a waiver for their protection\nBut I didn't feel like that was my responsibility was my responsibility to make sure that everybody knew what I was doing there why I was doing it\nUm and that they agreed you know if they wanted their name in or they didn't want their name in or they didn't want their voice you know I completely respect what they said\nA journalist at a conference I attended some years ago so the following don't waste a doctor's time\nYou'd reported quite a bit on physicians and said he felt like you needed to develop a very high level of expertise from the subject area if you didn't the doctors would be less willing to be interviewed and followed they'd be wasting their time with the reporter who wasn't up to speed was the implication will care and says she had the opposite experience\nWell first of all I don't really I didn't really approach physicians any differently than I approach most of the people that I interview\nMuch about what it takes to become a doctor or they don't know about all of these pressures on residents and so I just start asking from a very basic level um\nAnd and I do think that over the course of my interviews they can tell that I've done my research and that I you know I asked the questions that that show that you know I Do understand that background to these issues but I just want them to still explain it any way from a very basic level\nMany residents become primary care doctors because of their desire for social justice plus there's opportunity to for a long term relationships with patients ticked up to a job and for example we heard her in the opening\nI like establishing relationships with people and getting to know them outside of what their medical diagnoses are and I like to laugh a lot too so I Try to make my my patients experience not something that the dreadful one when they come to the doctor\nKaren also came to understand the pressure new doctors feel to leave primary care the biggest reason money\nA survey by the medical group management association last year found the average salary for a primary care doctor is about a hundred and Ninety thousand dollars\nThat may sound like a lot but consider that some have debt near a quarter of a million dollars meanwhile they see their colleagues and cardiology or hematology after a couple more years of training making at least twice that amount sometimes up to five or six hundred thousand dollars I tried\nTo remind myself I didn't go into this for the money to begin with but I think that there are other people that maybe could be swayed into doing primary care but they're swayed away from primary care because of the challenges for paying back your loans\nOne expert parents spoke to listed a handful of other reasons to leave the field the messages insurance receive for medical educators\nThis is what Dr Andrew Moore a singer who runs the advocacy group of primary care progress calls the hidden curriculum of medical education and not always hidden very well\nThere's also explicit statements like you're too smart to be a primary care doctor this is a dead field a or my favorite a monkey to practice primary care why would you do that so it's kind of a whole range of things but the basic admonition has and hey it's a waste of a medical knowledge in\nFinally after spending months and months reporting the story the surprise you look for happened us the story unfolded in front of her we pick up the documentary in the scene were Dr job and is seeing Rosa the patient\nAnd they do like taking a lot of medication so she hasn't talked me when jobs stands up at the end of the visit\nRoss that gives her a hug end up pleading look since there's often turnover among the residents Russia is worried she'll lose Dr job and\nYou know [laughter]\nIt was but I yeah she's just used for you\nI Know I mean is\nThat Russia doesn't yet know what ... told me earlier that day\nAll right to in the last few months that I hadn't seen mhm are you still in it are you still going in a primary\nI'm actually so I um [noise] um I actually decided I wanted to kind of algae\nAt the moment that I realized it wasn't a short feature and that was going to be a documentary is when the my main character told me I'm that she had decided and and she was going to be sort of the the woman that I\nHeld up as the proverbial primary care doctor who just loved being the\nCoordinator for all of her patients and the point person and um when she said you know what I've decided to become a cardiologist sauce okay that is really not good for the field of primary care but that is great for us\nMm\nSuperman Batman the Green Lantern whoever do you think they ever get tired like exhausted exhausted with

you know how love isn't\nJust spreads itself around the world I was visiting my then eighty three eighty four year old parents in Florida around the time but that Hawaii Supreme Court decision in Nineteen Ninety three or so\nAnd even though I'd already been out to my parents for about twenty five years\nWe've never had a conversation about marriage and so on the drive from the airport to their home I raise the question\nAnd I asked them if Doug my partner ten years who died of aids in Nineteen Ninety and whom they love like another son I said if that were still alive and the two of us wanted to get married\nHow would you feel\nLike I said I really want to know what helped me and my activism\nAnd there was silence after about a minute or so my father\nResponded and said you really want to know I said of course I Do of course I Do please be as forthright as you can be I wouldn't ask otherwise and he said well now that I think about it I have to tell you that\nI wouldn't be all that excited to tell my golfing buddies that my son who was married in another man I said well thank you for telling me that I'm sure it's not easy for you to say that but I wasn't the truth so now let's take another step\nWhy\nWould you not just the latest why would you not be the first to court the champagne and throw a big party for these two men you love and whom you want to see his

ago I'm not sure exactly I'm sure there are people here know exactly when it was but I was of all things playing golf in Hawaii which is what lawyers do sometimes and uh I was returning the car to the guy who was\nTaking care of the car they took my golf shoes and so he said did you ever hear of anything\nAs ridiculous as the idea of the two gay people could get married I'd not heard the idea of before and I turned to him and I was\nOut of the essence of Mike character\nIs that there's not enough love and the world I'm sure of that and the two people want to get married nobody should ever get in their way\nThe story I'm going to tell you is about the young woman of the young man in the kitchen in Nineteen fifty eight the woman was Jewish and went to Wellesley College on a quota\nWhich I'm sure it was thought of as a liberal progressive kind of step at the time they had forbidden Jews to go to ... but they were changing it but they didn't want to many Fifteen Percent\nWas thought to be

I was miserable I was tired of always being dirty coverage in such an animal poop\nI was tired of showering once every week or less because it was too much work together to store uncovered firewood to heat water for a sponge bath\nThe worst part though was that things were always dying nothing ever died of old age their animals died of bizarre sicknesses they broke their legs and got infections things were eating on a regular basis by coyotes wild dogs and big cats\nEven my hamster each Hugo was caught and killed in a trap\nUm did I seem happy\nWhen we first moved out there it was an venture and you were a lot younger\nAnd you seemed very happy\nBut over time when\nWere not coming to fruition and the way that you and I had thought\nThat's when you started to become most unhappy [noise]\nUm when did you know that it was time to leave\nIt was apparent that you are so desperate to get out of there\nBecause I thought\nIf this were a happy healthy home\nYou wouldn't be so desperate to get away from it\n\nUm\nHow did you feel when I left when you were still there\nAll I wanted to do was\nBe more involved in your life I couldn't imagine\nWhen you moved up here\nI just couldn't stand the thought of not being involved in your daily life\nSharing your life experience\nThere was no question\nThat was no question of what was I had to do\nShortly after I moved away to Tucson my mom left my step dad and came to live near me\nNow we are here together in a small house\nI feel a lot happier and I'm going to a small charter school downtown\nAfter we moved my mom and I started talking about starting our own farm and now that's my dream [noise]\nI Want to have a loving home somewhere green and cool with a real house and proper farming equipment [noise]\nBut most of all I Want a family that takes time to build strong relationships and really communicate with one another [noise]\n\nAnd now she was growing up she was not feeling well\nThe day we talked so listen closely to her sick little voice among the most striking part of this feature to me was when you ask your mom if you were difficult and you sounded really nervous when you asked that question where are you\nI'm not that that's I guess I'm\nI think when she answered I was actually really surprised\nI had always thought that was really difficult so I was expecting her to say yeah that was but\nAnd then my other Christians have you heard of 'em this book that's been getting a lot of publicity recently um it's called this life is in your hands about a woman who grew up a on a homestead in Maine in the sixties\nNow or never heard of that oh okay well I I haven't read it I just I heard her interviewed the other day and there were there were some similar things and I think one of her parents are actually like her ... her father is like a famous organic farmer and she talked a lot about\nNeeding to tell her own side of the story when it came to remembering growing up you know her parents had always talked in public about what it was like going you know quote back to the land but she felt like\nIt took her a long time to figure out how she felt about it but then also the need to tell her own story did you was this was the story of your life growing up something you felt like you needed to tell was it a natural choice for you when you made this radio piece\nYeah I think it was I

flooded it's and waited patiently until around the bend just a moment when it came up freight train\nIts roving like pierce through the fog and lifted up\nLike a big silver mobile\nPaul could feel the vibrations of the track beneath him he frantically pump the accelerator pedals with nothing\nShook his wife awake and she was terrified\nCross lights came to life and the trains began to will he said there were no time to get it when we got to push so he popped into neutral and at that moment the car lurched forward and picked up just enough feed to roll clear the trucks as the three hundred ton tree ... by\nPaul said must have been on the hill without realizing it the cars started up right away then and they drove home\nSurf took the kids inside and Paul was about to get the luggage when his neighbor or a police detective about to go in the early shift came over and welcomed him home Paul told him of how his family had almost been big prize by the train and how we assumed the crossing was not level because they had ruled clear\nThe detective said no I think you would say by the ghost children\n... ghost children come on you're a cop\nReal quick and pulled out it's just a kid\nWe went over to the back of polls Carney sprinkled a white ... recalls the curb truck didn't show him as much light on the powder as clear as day you could see tuned to him print outlined by the dust bowl

reject the idea of the group students because they see cars roll off the trucks on their own because there's a steep slope they're invisible to the naked I Will I think that it it's no fun to go to a

English it has different grammatical roles and features but no basis in any actual Native American practice or speech pattern it's totally made up\nOther pop culture stereotypes index different images Hollywood has never been shy about portraying Greeks is crazy or Mexicans as lazy but the image that crafted by Hollywood engine English is the image of the disappearing Indian here's how it works\nRule number one it has to sound foreign we hear that into how greeting like this one from the chief in Disney's Nineteen fifty three Peter Pan\n\nOkay so the median interpretation of that\nAlong with the how Hollywood engines also invent words ditch a verb tense is insane me instead of by to refer to themselves all in order to sound more foreign like in this Bugs Bunny episode from Nineteen sixty\n\nOne [noise]\nAnd that gave you hear the use of um which is really pervasive across linguistic performances and it's not really derived from any actual linguistic practice and me

movies or they can monitor\n... proud foot in Fargo which came out in Nineteen Ninety six so do you remember getting a call Wednesday night\n\nDo reside there at fourteen twenty five Fremont

doing whatever what it is people do they run they walk they talk they buy they push smaller people in little ah wields cages strollers yeah ... you know I\nI think about the perspective you have on us which is ... literally looking down on us right above yeah thank you yeah and I wonder are there things that you see about us enough that maybe we don't see in each other\nWell I mean the obvious things are when somebody's balding I can spot that immediately right and I said before we leave and yes\nBecause I see some people with the confidence of a person with a full head of hair\nBut I Know that that confidence is it's misguided ... or it's not long for this world\nAnd I think um you know I just see I see a lotta dates happening which is when to humans are figuring out whether you know they were not there will or not right I actually am not it's not clear to me while they're working on\nBut there's some question between them ... which is like you know whether we are mostly the the big issue around lampposts and often they lean against\nSing against each other and they're pushing their mouth on each other and they're like well we won't we do want to I don't know\nAnd so that's kind of like interesting to me 'cause I'm like make up your mind get off me\nYou know if the answer to that question will they won't they yeah is that they will write youth kind of played a formative role in their lives you know the the question is will will they be together\nYeah I Do have some role in that and I do like the thought I guess of\nYou know being an important part of someone's destiny persons destiny but I kind of wish for more like I Do wish for more sometimes like I Know that lampposts have featured in film I see films I've seen speed so many times be you know because we

called yeah and I\nAnd that's the kind of famous lamp whether he swings around the ... he grabs the lamp post and swings around\nOh yeah the the lamppost is the lead in that movie so that flip schools

was poppy chemical [noise]\nThere was another him and said this was I was looking at a neighbor and um she was the machine eating potato chips potato chip after chip is going into her mouth [noise] they're almost ... there's a\nThere's like here for ... to me they tell us to\nThe show people's life [noise]\nThe actual window [noise] and then the performance begins [noise]\nI sat outside the

there's this beautiful family photograph\nAnd they wait and I watched and I watch and watch and he fell asleep [noise] [noise]\nWhat happened to all of a sudden they get very excited it's like [noise] I got to get this you know and then I shoot it and I hate golfing guesses I Can't because I Want to get out\nI guess one because it's on your turn to for me to be watching that [noise]\n\nThey're

those house lately that I wrote I really do want to make a photograph of\n...\nYour every move was produced by Jonathan miserable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot on them and they started settling out\nThe reason they settled out is because it's cheaper to settle them to fight the lawsuit clearly two million dollars cheaper in some cases and much worse if you actually lose and all sorts constitute a massive distraction for management of companies especially a small\nEight man shop like my ...\nSix months into the lawsuit we finally reached the discovery phase and discovery phase we ask\nThe patent for all to please provide screen shots of FARC where the infringement of their pattern was actually occurring now perhaps it's because there's no such screen shots actually existed\nBut suddenly to spray wanted a subtle their attorney\nUh yes my company is having a reorganization on our end\nMind the fact that the address led to a strip mall somewhere in northern LA with no employees and\nWe like to go ahead and close this out so would you mind giving us your best and final\nOffer the my response how about nothing [noise]\nWe didn't\nHave high hopes for that outcome\nBut they don't know counter offer\nNow as mentioned before\nOne of the reasons I can talk to you about this is because there's no nondisclosure agreement on this case now how did that happen well during the settlement process when we received our copy I struck at my attorney said nah no chance of that working it came back sign\nNow why you can call them\nThey're not under India either no wonder I learned from this case well three the first of all if you can don't fight the patent fight the infringement titans are very difficult to overturn infringement there's a lot easier to disapprove secondly\nMaking it clear from the beginning that need to you have no money at all or that you would rather spend the money with your attorney fighting the trolls and actually giving them the money\nNow the reason this word is because patent trolls are paid a percentage of what they're able to recover and settlements if it becomes clear to them that they can recover any money they become less interested in pursuing the case\nFinally make sure that you can tell them they will make this process as annoying and is painful and as difficult as possible for them\nNow this is a tactic that controls are supposed to use on people to get their way it turns out because they're paid on can tendency works really really well in reverse don't forget that so what does this mean well the kind of saw 'em up\nIts goes boils down to one thing don't negotiate with terrorists [noise]\nPatent trolls are done more damage\nOrganization in the history every year\nAnd what do they do with that money\nThey plow right back into following more troll lawsuits now this is going into soccer I supposed to come up with some kind of a solution for the ... the system and the problem with that is is that there are two very large industry groups that have different outcomes in mind for the ...\nThe healthcare industry would like stronger protections for inventors the high tech industry would like stronger protections for producers have these goals are necessarily diametrically opposed but they are at odds and as a result patent trolls can kind of living the space in between so unfortunately I'm not smart enough to how the solution for the ...\nProblem however\nAnd it was kind of good\nAnd I thought I should pat Liz [noise]\nThe old [noise]\nInfringement it'd be a mobile device [noise]\nDefined as a computer which

monsters university [noise]\nLet's pause just for a second and explain a little bit of what's going on here\nYeah I agree so first of all monsters university and tells the story about monsters attending a university for monsters and\nParticularly nerdy monster Mike ... wants to be accepted by the cooler students school so he and his friends take on an athletic challenge the toxicity challenge\nIn one part of it is running as fast as they can all other monsters throughout what are called ... and that's all they're sort of spiky jellyfish she\nWent to glow actually hits a monster his skin instantly swells into a comic leads giant will [noise]\nOkay so sure that scene again\nWhat you're hearing or the monsters getting hit by a lower chance as they race each other\nIs a great thing about animation is that there's no sound to begin with very that's very freeing and that is if it's all built from the ground\nMyers is one of the designers behind all of the sounds you just heard\nOh in a corner of the sprawling Skywalker Ranch up in ...\nOh man I Can't believe it or is that you know Oscar that is not an Oscar that is a it's actually see three PM\n[noise] human cycle\nWhen you hear at this company for twenty plus years and I've been here over Twenty years they'd give you one of those\nThat might not have an Oscar yet but he's been nominated three times and has worked in over Seventy films\nIn his studio there is a pretty large movie screen speakers and a single microphone times also got a computer and an old analog synthesizer called uh Sinclair here\n[noise] that's a combination of the ... are actually one pro singer performing in a couple\nOf different ways so I go and record something and then I Will sample it into the sink Libya or you can virtually sample anything into it [noise]\n\nAnd they played sounds strange scene that film projects onto the movie screen\nWhen you watch the scene for the first time what do you do first\nCry openly weep open the you know I I I you look at it and oh my God how will we ever get to a spot where we have it all together but I'm so your mind starts to think about certain things will what will that\nSounds like and how should that work together and how do we make each sound distinctive because they all happened very fast\nSo back to that clip from monsters university\nTom and his team had to create sounds from us that everything but the voices and the sounds that the fully I think like footsteps or opening and closing doors for everything else the team has to invent the sounds that world and this seems that sounds have to go across both the danger and the comedy of what's happening\n[noise] wow [laughter] oh my gosh [laughter]\nThis last character gets hit he gets hit three\nTimes and expands and then they shoot one into his mouth and his whole body expanse obviously that one needs to be sort of bigger [noise]\nAnd needs to be kind of the pay off the fattest a mean body inflation and uh so you try and very the frequency so you can build a rhythm and and you know cut reach a climax\nAnd the sound has to change throughout the scene otherwise it wouldn't seem realistic and it would for the audience\nIt flies in it stings and then there's an inflation\nSo there's three aspects to each one of those things that come in and there are hundreds of them in the fly by so such a figure out how do we how do we get that idea of one two three across and then with so many different ones how do you do it so it doesn't just become you know a mess of sound\nCan you tell us specifically\nHow you made the lower chin flying through the air and hitting a buddy okay what do we actually hearing\nLet's well uh the first the ...\nBy is a tone sort of it are synthesized tone that I put through a Doppler program pitch the down a little bit I think I added a little sort of bacon frying with it or to give it some texture\nAnd this isn't the fancy industry term it's literally the sound of\nBacon in the pants [noise] to give it that kind of seasonally texture\nAnd beyond that pitched uptown and bacon frying there's also the sound of too hot wheels cars banging into each other\nWe don't have that original recording but this is what we think it might sound like [noise]\nWater bottle [noise] so\nWhy you may ask do they go to all this trouble why not just throw something or chin like through the air and record that\nTom says it gets tricky to record in the real world because you can't necessarily control that sound in order to explain this to us he tells us a story that infamous at Skywalker Ranch\nRandy Tom who's the director of sound design at Skywalker\nOnce went to collect sounds from a nuclear facility\nAnd it didn't really work out or it\nWas very sort of diffuse and mushy and the sound was not what you expected to be but as he was leaving [noise]\nThere was a water cooler that had a specific kind of home and blue when he went by\nThe sound of the water cooler blue thing and that's what he ended up using to represent the nuclear facility\nSound designer Walter March when fed\nSound kind of sneak send the side door the design doesn't have to knock you over it's there to enhance your experience to keep you inside the story and the most [noise]\nThe emotional\nComponent is at least as important as the literal component you have to be open to different things and a sink beyond the specifics of whatever something would literally show like because oftentimes that's not the most interesting with the most dramatic\nFor example there's a scene toward the end of monsters university where Mike was asking that nerdy monster\nHas to roar it's got to be a really particular kind of roar too because it makes a pretty little guy it had to be good but not great I actually did use\nThe vocal or did you sort of my own vocal and pitched it so\nIt had some body it's big and scary but not quite so big and scary [noise]\n\nTom had to hit just the right balance about the audience would believe that that for command of monsters mouse instead of his own\nIn a way that's what he's doing through the entire film and it's the ultimate test of a good sound designer\nTo make an animated world exist Tom has to make the audience forget that\nStories twenty four seven online is on the air you're listening to the radio revenge for your your money

planet to other violence is in the past and folks to spare then too but Linda says there's room for optimism\nLet's talk about Henry David Thoreau he was reading a at the time the height of deforestation in New England we think about him at Penn with a pencil you know often the beautiful woods\nForget it that's not true she she was writing as they were cutting down in the woods as New England in order to clear at for agriculture and he would write in his journal thank God they can't cut down the clouds\nAnd he would lament the loss of the so called noble or animals and he meant the deer and the bear the mountain lion you know in the time of his day the biggest thing left in the woods was a mosque ... nobody would even seen a deer in a generation\nWell fast forward to today and over a six state region of New England we see one of the most glorious and profound ... of our time as people walked away from these farms to go work in cities and do other kinds of jobs\nAre what came back\nThe trees and with them the animals at day care and moves are in such profoundly great numbers it's actually kind of a problem for people who in a modern in modern days have not lived so

career\nI Want you to appreciate what you carry in the top of your head because this math only weighs\nThree pounds and yet yet has the capacity to conceive\nOf a universe of billion light years across\nIsn't that phenomenal it really is the most complex structure known to mankind it underlies our creativity and our personalities and not only that but it can grow and change in response to the environment is a phenomenal man\nIn his house and the human body they have a symbiotic relationship the brain affects the body the body affects the brain\nAnd with all of that I was a guard dog and just thought this is the most exciting interesting fascinating thing I've ever heard of it I'm so glad I'm In college I Want to be a nurse and I just\n[noise]\nWell to this day she's the best teacher that I've ever experienced in my in my entire career\nAnd it's because she she was so\nPresent and then gauge and fascinated truly fascinated with\nThe material that she was presenting she has the flare for the dramatic\nAnd she wrote everything on the chalk board she said it was because if I write it down your going to write it down and that gets into your memory and so at the end of the class you're you've already learned most of what you need to learn I have\nTo tell you why I still use ... and do not in power point\nBecause I studied learning mechanisms long enough to know that it takes time take in the primary information and associate it I feel if I'd a flash on things like this you don't get it if you are right you use your kind of set accent\nThat's one way it slows me down it slows you down and I also repeat all the time because we know repeating reinforce so where are you saying things that have been shown for learning rather than just keeping up with technology\nAt the beginning I was captivated with the nurse science experiments that marrying diamond herself described and she had done so she did these classic studies in the Nineteen sixties showing what happens to the brains of rats if they were raised and what they called enriched environment\n\nCertain rich environment is an environment where rats had lots of poised to play with and lots of other rap to play with it a much bigger space and you can think of it kind of like the Disney World of environments\nAnd watch the show was the brains of rats raised in those enriched environments where actually bigger the outer covering the brain called the cortex actually grew significantly larger compared to rats that were\nRaised in impoverished environments where there was only one one rat in a cage with no toys [noise]\nTools we decided to publish it and I spoke to the American association of Annapolis first big conference that I had it for ...\nThere weren't too many women [laughter] agenda ... when I finished a man in the back roads up and it was a big auditorium stood up and shouted [laughter]\nYoung lady that brain cannot change\nNobody had thought that you could have an enriched environment specifically change your brain and an impoverish one change a parade\nWas the first\nNobody else had made such measurement found these results we were terribly excited about\nHer work and this environmental enrichment and brain plasticity was so influential on me I was fascinated both with the brain and with brain plasticity and so when I went to graduate school\nI definitely was was drawn to other forms of experiments that that addressed brain plasticity and my form of brain plasticity that I became fascinated with in graduate school was memory\nEveryday brain plasticity if I learned something new if I learn the name of somebody new and I'm able to remember it sometime later\nMy brain is change and I wanted to try and understand what that change was and really identify it\n... ... ... ... ... it's it's funny\nBrain cells you have to say is a little bit like fishing you don't know exactly what I Know the campuses involved I didn't know what I'm going to find there so I I put my little fishing rod which is a very very thin micro electrode down in today but campus so I can listen in on what these cells are doing\n[noise]\nI Would be listening to a cell as an animal was starting to learn something new and someone be doing much of anything that would just be firing every once in a while that I could hear on the audio monitor but\nThen one day [noise] I noticed that just as the animals started to learn a particular association the cell that was on the end of my electrode starts to fire more and more consistently right as the animal was learning in\nAs the ... really put it into his memory more more and more strongly would call that consolidating the number he got better and better and by the end of the session he was performing that association at a hundred percent correct [noise]\n\nI thought well maybe maybe I was hearing things but then I went back and analyze the data and when I saw is that this out in about twenty percent of all the cells that are recorded from the campus would change dramatically in just messy animal was learning a new association\nOnce I got used to I could actually hear this happening\n\nAnd listen to those cells and being able to identify them as we listen to them was kind of like listening to the birth of a new memory [noise]\n\nIt was so exciting to find these cells and again it was a little bit like fishing I didn't know what I was going to catch a tiny little fish or a big fish\nIt turned out to be a pretty big fish because this was the finding that got me tenure at New York university who is very very important kind of professionally for me but just so exciting because it literally took five years\nTo get this experiment off the ground you get the animals to learn and to be able to get the recordings to work and even then after everything was working we didn't know what we're going to get that doesn't guarantee success\n\nBut I have to say that I realized at that point that there was something amiss I had turned into my own lab\nRat just going from my home to work and and working working really hard to get all this work done and going back home and going to sleep\nAnd you know I was living in New York City and there was so much out there and I was taking advantage of none of it not only that I was about twenty pounds overweight because of the amazing takeout food in New York\nAnd I realized at some point that I needed to\nRebalance my life in lots of different ways and I'm march straight to the new Jim that opened up not too far away from my work and I signed up and I signed up for a personal trainer to to make sure that I Would come to the gym and get my workouts and that was the best thing that I could do\nIt was amazing you start training regularly and your body responds\nJust like the brain put the brand new environment it responds with what I learned in Marion diamonds lab and I was learning on my own the hard way\nThat you put yourself in the situation and your body responds it did so actually beautifully and I ended up I'm losing twenty five pounds and I felt great\nThat goes for the brain as well as for muscles you use it or you lose it\nUse it or lose it with you\nTo use sitting around doing nothing you lose it right\nWith me [noise]\nI found this work out that I loved and this is a a a workout that\nCombines physical movements from boxing and dance and yoga with positive ... an affirmation yell things out like\nI Will see than I Am stronger now\nI loved it so much that I learned how to teach it\nBet Sunday Morning at

English is the only language where actually means to potentially distinct meaning and it's quite confusion [noise] because I guess there's an equal spread of\nDifferent native languages in use twenty three languages and me that you go and I guess only two island in the u._k. are going to be negatives because\nI don't know if they get much of a vote as to whether an actual should mean [laughter]

upwards of forty or fifty people in each lock up [noise]\nWhen you walk into lock up one of the first thing you notice is the echo [noise]\nThey may hear catty and excited and their voices bounce off the concrete\nFloors they have nothing to do so what do they do they talk to each other and when one person talks and then there's another person I was talking to all of a sudden it's people shouting

have usually been living here for weeks by the time he meets them they've been through bind court felony review an arraignment still ... says he doesn't usually have much more than a file folder with an arrest report to go on when he meets many of them\nAnd the most important thing in that folder it's usually the offer\nDoctors how much of clients and can be reduced if they plead guilty instead of arguing their innocence in a jury trial\nAnd then if the prosecutor on arraignment writes down an offer which often they do on cases that don't involve a serious violent offenses the next thing that we told them as hate the state made this offer so now the ... if you look at this from the client's perspective\nWe are given the bad news we're giving them more bad news and then we're telling them you know what would happen if they plead guilty [noise]\n\nTypically the next time every teases planes in the courtroom which is just down the hall from the lab [noise]\nGosh six which was one of those rooms that you may have seen in a movie it's a a big formal courtroom or as opposed to be smaller rooms I refer to as fish bowl [noise]\nSo we're in courtrooms six so to have people are starting to\nMove into the into the benches um\nThe public defenders are\nWith prosecutors at the front of the room talking about the cases that are on call today the court reporter has settled into his the

attractive place to place a place to be confined folks are separated from their lives for their families and a pressure builds to get out\nToo far into some kind of resolution\n\nBowman says it's not just those behind bars you want to cases resolved the public defenders have so many clients they need to keep things moving [noise] here's former Cook County public defender Leonard the\nWell the attorneys across their heart and to the worst kinds of cases\nAnd I remember this happening to me I remember clients telling me you know the cops beat this confession out of me you know it isn't that I had a whole home response but I heard that many times before you know or what would a person would say to me I'm innocent I miss that I Want to go to trial\nAnd my response would define you want to go to trial you could go to trial but there is a terrible risk associated with going to travel with what we call the jury texture gonna get punished a whole lot more severely\nSo you have attorneys under pressure to close cases plus anti clients 'cause these and others say this is why in most cases never make it to trial to him the factory metaphor is pretty accurate\nIt's absolutely ... it's it's it's a conveyor belt that exist primarily uh twenty six street in the city Chicago you can walk in there any given time you will see literally hundreds of black men being paraded off to the penitentiary for possession and sales drop\nPublic defenders don't write the laws they're doing their best to find a workable outcome and nearly eight of ten times that outcome is a plea bargain a plea bargain is when a defendant takes the offer I mentioned before the bargain is that they plead guilty and in exchange their sentences reduced\n[noise]\nNobody wants to spend the time going to trial less than ten percent of defendants ever go to trial say this is short circuit in a system\nThat will factor for the crimes that they didn't commit is it because the legal system is just bogged down everybody demanded a full trial we'd never get through all of them are like doing radio shack who'd work harder they find a way to find it at all and that's another four with the system as a measure\nOf course there's scrutiny on the deals but public defender Peter ... says they're not always bad and insist that they don't necessarily point too weak layering\nThere are a lot of cases where I put in every bit as much time on a plea as you would I'm\nOn a trial what you're trying to do is get the best result for your client and to that and oftentimes the best result for your client divulging their exposure\nLayer groups like the American bar association have been critical of the caseloads that public defenders have to carry they say it's like justice in a perfect world caseloads would be kept at a hundred and fifty\nAnd it was probably one of the biggest mistake several people say oh you can have your husband is if you couldn't have done this you couldn't have done that or no

dust is sometimes like staring into a yearbook of the socially dispossessed David may sell understand why\nThese were people who had not been claimed by their families um on their desks and so in a way they've been written out of their family histories the existence of these canisters have basically been secret for decades and decades and and so that kind of Secret History really captivated me\nThere's a kind of charging their into I mean here you are in this room with thirty five hundred so [noise]\n\nHad and people feel very in a way offended by this work because it deals with death which is a taboo\nAnd it deals with crazy people write quote unquote which is taboo\nCombines that with a kind of spectacular beauty\nThat combination is really taboo\nWhen it happened yet toward you is this the canisters don't just look normal\nBut the twenty four years in which they sat and an underground vault it was flooded repeatedly been up to anyone finally in two thousand they were moved to a dry storage room and that's where David myself first got a peek at the remarkable ways\nIn which the copper surfaces of the canisters evolved each different from the next\n... they're in a sense miner logical portraits of the individuals who are within them\nOh my God look at that one\nThat on this looks like a cave drawing doesn't it like a bird that Flynn Sherman who's a painter from Key West\nThat's gorgeous wow for this or\nThis has an underwater quality of the basic color and most of them this is wonderful a burnt orange with gold highlights and then when this cobalt blue comes in

are with national building museum all electric can decode brain agua as thick and crustaceans of plight green and blue and gleaming copper underneath it all\nThe colors are just phenomenal the upper half or so of this canister has got the the black and the red color what looks like the ... you see that when you look at sort of a penny\nJim Webster is a geologist and curator of mineral deposits at the American museum of natural history and his very cool office with its rocks and charts and maps I asked him what's going on here\nI suspect that much of the blue is either a cup or sulfate or cover carbonate minerals as you are right which is a natural\nBlue copper carbonate minerals\nAnd then the green which is ...\nAnd the other thing I see which is fairly apparent as a white salty material and there are ... that form a white material and the Koreans everywhere\nAnd my understanding is these canisters were exposed to flooding multiple times inside of all a concrete floor it would be hugely source for the carbonate and really the copper carbonate they're not extremely soluble in water so it would take take years we don't talk\nI think about things and yet here is this example of just kind of spectacular\nMiner illogical\nThat these cancers are undergoing\nMost living organisms are largely water\nSo ... when the when the body is cremated the water is released was driven off his team are Bones Are largely calcium phosphate and so in fact they don't burn and they're stable to very high temperatures so at the end of burning of human buddies that will be the charred remains of our bones\nSo apparently those Bones Are crushed up to make a fine powder and the powders what's put inside these canisters\nWebster explains that the phosphorus and the phone's\nCombined with the concert to create the mineral turquoise on some of the cancers\nStill it's hard to nail these ballots down because the colors are still changing\nAs I returned to the hospital over the course of two years\nAnd there were certain cancers that I Would look at it again and again\nSomething that appeared that kind of deep midnight blue might become almost electric called off months later\nThe water level the humidity during a given to the temperature cold day versus a hot day potentially the amount of carbon dioxide from one year to another to another all of these factors may well cause these minerals to change from one to another\nAll the information these canisters the colors the ongoing changes remind me in some way it's the landscape of Iceland stand to top the mountain ridge there and you see geological history writ large forms of law for turf and stamped well\nIt rocks it's almost like people liken it to the pages in a book kind of opening a book of earth's history\nSo maybe the

rolling\nI'm so out of there for a minute but I Would always be trying to run and see what would the next woman was she was doing that but I just love women [laughter]\nThere was living in life he was young he had money women he thought he was on top of it all\nThe soda downfall was I'm\nBeginning really two\nHuge drugs\nAnd then he really got in trouble in Nineteen Ninety seven less than a year after his son was born Derek was arrested for first degree murder and sentenced to thirty seven years to life\nThe next time Jackson his son he was in prison behind thick glass in ... and\nSo yeah so he came to visit on his on his first birthday and I'm just looking at him and the some of my thoughts was or\nWas this glass represent our relationship and um you know for the for the first time I was realizing that they can like that is a possibility that I may never get an opportunity to to see him as a child and grow up and to have some kind of influence in his life [noise]\nSomebody\nOne might lead\nTo my own self I I couldn't find a way out I wanted to do something different but I didn't know how and and come into prison\nActually really gave me the opportunity to sit down and really examine my life in the beginning to get the courage to do something different with my life\n\nIn prison Derek got religion and he's now in prison creature with a full on congregation\nSo if it does present you're talking about\nThis I think a lot of guys\nDid religion fake religion religious but they're not\nLike the real deal how do you know\nYou didn't want his sermons in here just\nAnd he walked to walk you know just walk the walk on the pulpit he walked to walk on the yard and he'd go around and counsels people counsel to use so yeah he's real\nBut he couldn't counts for his own son when ... mother died the boys maternal grandmother took him in and she thought it was best to keep him away from his father and Derek only heard what was going on second and third hand\nSo when he was growing up I heard good things early on you know him being a church and and I would send an bibles can play football and you know him going to different schools of ... and and then I started hearing the different things\nAbout him being\nYou know industry lie for going forward and I was really disappointed and even here that made me feel grief in pain and\nSo he was basically growing up like you were growing up like I was\n[noise]\nThere was sort of want to get a second chance to Paris\nAnd we're going to hear about that in a minute but first here's another prison dad with a very different experience of parenting from prison [noise]\nI could have been a a a dad at Seventeen and been just absolutely happy and dedicated and I think I could get a been a good pop you know as a kid so it was something I wanted and uh I I was excited\nConfident hopeful and fulfilled\nJohn this thirty five when his first child was born when he committed the crime that led him to prison his kids were three eight and nine years old\nI happen so suddenly it was the the night of December twentieth and I was coming back from a Christmas Party and it was one of those drinking and driving fatality cases [noise] so I didn't have time to to to think well what what would happen if I were taken away from my kids that are never never occurred to me [noise]\n\n[laughter] it's a lifetime [laughter] if you like Twenty years ago [laughter]\nMuscles goals [laughter]\nI Know what it is [laughter] that's crazy that yeah that wouldn't have anything\nNow that we do in this hour which is a you know ... and ...\nAnd even that was awkward man you don't but I had to force myself through it like and like this with the reality man like you know I'm like why is that\nI'll watch them walk up the stairs sometimes right I'm walking behind he always going faster than me and I'll watch him go up and I remember how how I used to walk and so we're not watching walk up the stairs sometimes I'm like\nJust staring at him like man look at me that is me and sometimes it is so overwhelming because nobody wants prison for their child and so it makes me more protective\nYou know now more like okay where are you at and and I'll I'll see them but I don't let them see me [laughter]\nThat brings up a whole nother thing but yeah just watching them watching his mannerisms how we interact with people on the tea or hardly interact with people in the prison very outgoing\nAnd I tell them is all the time I saw you just a function in um extrovert because really your introvert liked them [laughter] you really want to be by yourself you really do good by yourself\nBecause we're outgoing people want you know people will talk to us and like us and so I see that it you know\nBut he has no problem being myself [laughter] we\nBasically do anything just like when I get ... but I go outside at night and I just be walking when now just walking like what the hell is you're doing out here you're like me I feel like being by that and then we both ended up just being out there walking near we always run into each other out there like man [noise]\n\nI Am nervous every time the alarm goes off I didn't like

wife and I saw\nA cut his hair for the first time and that's like a rite of passage for every father to cut his son's here at some point in time and he was scared at first because the whole month before the visit I told your baggage or haircut don't get your hair cut 'em cut your hair\nAnd he's like oh All right uh you know he was skeptical\nAnd then I brought my ma clippers out and when it

glimpse of how thirsty he is to have a father and his life\nBut I Believe that a surety of\nExactly when I was going to come home it was occupied too much of his mind I got him worrying\nAbout me in

Chanel number five\nIn these ads where it's just them in the building isn't even pictured which is quite unusual normally scaly is there because it gives a sense of scale to the building but ... to put a character by itself with no picture of the building\nWhich is sort of like yeah now now these people are stand in for the architecture that's kind of interesting and weird and and unusual\nThe models started showing up in character in costume at events to alert people to buy these condos and then there's the picture of the building itself\nThe real Renwick street is very short narrow but in the architectural rendering these very modern looking condos are perched along an Eighteenth century can now with like clippers ships and\nPeople wearing you know colonial garb and I just learned as recently the official term like the official architectural term for the rendering them a new building is called the hero shot like the building as a superhero that you're looking up at\nAnd in the case of the hero of Fifteen Renwick you've got a blimp just casually flooding by tall ships in their masks that appear to be about as tall as the building\nAnd I love also that um the here in is still in there with the neon sign so at least maybe that's the time traveling Porto that they use to get to never never New Amsterdam [laughter] exactly [noise]\nNow I mentioned on the spot gas that I Love New York history I always see layers of the past around me like I actually happen to know that Hudson Square back in the sixteen hundreds was farmland that was owned by the Roosevelt the Roosevelt the ancestors of Franklin Eleanor in the door\nSo I became obsessed with his ad campaign particularly because I'm not the target audience I don't have a couple of million to spend on a condo so who came up with what were they thinking or smoking we\nAre adamantly opposed to the scale is that you're describing we never put people in ... because we think that people don't necessarily identify with the people and you can always you know they never look good\nSo that's where Amy Franco was coming from before she started working on this campaign for her company if studio but then the team started doing some research in the area and they were impressed by how long it's been a hub of craftsmanship\nAnd and really the characters tells a story of the creative class people these creative iconoclast that lived there then and have lived there for all the time and live there even now\nOf course in the last two decades areas\nBut New York also has a very wealthy creative class that can afford to buy their\nAnd might find this out campaign really fun\nJennifer Connelly John Slattery Daniel Radcliffe Sophia ... involved live there\nAnd it's not just Hollywood people you know in the west village got any legal with Calvin Klein Julie inch novel and so how there's David Byrne leash a keys or Anderson Taylor Swift when she moved to New York was looking to buy a condo in Hudson swear it but she went with tried decade\nOr so I read on curbed [noise] but these characters weren't selling the idea of a super successful creative class\nThey're each created to personify a different feature of the building\nSo for example the whole team together decided that rather than your basic gym\nThey wanted to offer something that was more distinctive so they decided to put a boxing gym and so therefore we have a boxer as one of the characters um one of the apartment has a beautiful terrorists that overlooks you know the west side so we put an astronomer and to tell that story so that when\nI went to I Want to read like the ... the back story you know I Want to hear about the astronomer and his two hundred years in Manhattan [laughter] right exactly\nAnd those Eighteen century French wigs and close we're not totally random according to a scene as a beta project manager\nNew Yorkers had being on a world the city had influence from the French and then we did the research we did see that you know American ... at the higher aristocratic level did have that French influence in it as well\nDid you look at steam punk as well 'cause there seems to be in terms of contemporary\nRe did not look at steam punk we weren't even considering the vocabulary of that word at all\nNeither was Kevin to me so [laughter] do you in lakes and with Israel was a\nKevin co founded the company march which designed these rendering\nHe usually renders more you know normal non fantastic building so he was totally like to work on this project and by the way their officers right below the Manhattan Bridge so you'll hear the train rumbling above us we're leaning over his computer looking at all the different versions of the hero shot which didn't make it\nThere was the colonial one and there was one that felt a little bit more like gangs of New York it was it was a little more like war fee and a gray and and then like barrels and\nBoats and yeah like I can imagine the boxer character would do very well in the gangs of New York area but ah I don't know about the astronomer I think you'd get a telescopes to\n... you know it wouldn't have been as good for him or any anybody Russia's really one probably the only one that could have held his own\nI was surprised that even consider the gangs of New York background I mean the production design on that Martin Scorsese movie was awesome but the five points was still a dangerous slum and and this was the other runner up\nUm you should feel free to pick them up if you want them and I said like what\nShe said I like all those paintings that at Warner gave us I I I don't need any more art mom\nThere's also the you know the big fan you're has a box of Christmas ornament [noise]\nYou less my head in Stewart's garage [noise]\nAnd I instantly have these fantasies of Stuart channeling all his rage against my mother into the clay bust of me as an Eighteen year old you know like smashing into smithereens with uh nine iron ore\nSliding off his roof and watching it smashed on the sidewalk covering it with a female dog hormone and putting it out on the sidewalk and [noise]\nAnyway I I figure\nThat's it I mean that's the good news\nI don't have to worry about their had any more except\nMy stepfather didn't destroy it in fact thinking he was doing me a favor\nOne day he drives it in his car over to my dad's house somebody there so I get this call late one night I was a booth and say hey Jay it's dad\nI'm Stuart came by with your head earlier today\nAnd uh we're wondering when you're going to combine pick it up [noise]\nAnd of course at this point I'm thinking like that is like my monkey paw it's like\nHead that won't go away\nAnd I I tell them when I sit down and you know I got a lot of work right now I Can't just drop everything and go up and pick up the head you know can you just\nHold onto it for a while\nAnd he says you know um [noise]\nYour stepmother and I are really trying to reduce clutter in our\nI think we both really appreciate it if you've got as soon as possible [noise]\nThis rejection of the head\nHurts me more than any of the other had rejections more than my wife's carpets golfing at the mirror idea of taking home where my my wife leaving it in her ex husband's garage or my mother leaving at her ex husband's garage because\nMy father left us when when I was ten and as a result his approval has always been something that I desired more than anyone else's and\nBecause it's been so elusive and so\nThis really sticks with me and I say dad\nThis is gonna sound completely ridiculous but it hurts my feelings that you don't want my head [noise]\nAnd I think for second this is great we reached this whole new level of father son understanding and then he says\nThere's a painting of me in the downstairs closet that nobody wants [noise]\nAnd I know immediately the painting he's talking about it\nIt's a portrait that my grandmother had made of him when he was Twenty years old [noise]\nShe hadn't hanging over her fireplace until she died\nAnd uh and I don't want it you know\nSo it seems like we've reached the standoff right where\nNeither one of us who wants to take each other's crappy are so am\nI say look to do whatever you want with it OK throw it away I Can't deal with it and I and I hang up or go to sleep and I have a very fit full night's sleep tossing attorney and I wake up the next morning and I think you know I'm going to go get that had and I [noise]\nI mean I drive to my dad's and get it in the in my my rationale is\nIf somebody's just throw this thing a way it should be me and um\nSo I get up there by the time I get up there my dad's already put it in\nHis basement and um to get into the basement and my dad's house there's this little door the back of the house you have to crouch down to kind of gets through the door and I would do that and go in there and I'm In the basement and there's the head staring smuggle a hit the water heater and I\nI go over and I and I pick it up and it's kind of Stephen heavier than I remember it's like it gets a gravity from Jupiter or something it's\nReally really weighs a lot I mean I'm kind of caring across the base hunch down to get back through that little door in part of my spine just goes again it's just like my back just said screw it I hate you die\nAnd I stagger out of this door and into the into the sunlight blinded by pain and smack my head and like my actual head on the tree branches\nAnd I drop and drop that had [noise]\nAnd for a moment I think thank God I'm Free it's over\nBut then I looked down and they had is perfectly intact\nLike I don't know it's made of kryptonite or something [noise]\nStaring up at me with that smirk it's just like ... it's like saying to me you're rule dude [noise]\nSo I pick it up and I put it in the car and my first impulse is to go straight to the nearest dumpster order a garbage can and\nThrow it away but but no I I there's just something about imagined the heads high older to these dirty diapers and coffee filters and banana peels I mean it's just kind of still me as an Eighteen year old I got to figure out what to do with it so I take it home and I and I walk in the house and they put it on the kitchen counter and I hear this low under league growling\nWhoa and look down on my dog Walter is [noise]\nBlaring at the head all the hair on his back standing on man [noise]\nI've never heard a noise like this I mean it's like it's like that scene in the ... when the animals go crazy on the whole childhood\nAnd then my wife walks and she goes hey you know\nI run throwing it away I guess it was okay walks out [noise]\nWanted to say no don't do that in a way that the that the label family trigger that's a part of your history I Am so desperate for one person to like my head which is crazy because\nSo I I call my mom I figure if I can figure out why they had was made in the first place\nI can figure out what to do with it now so I called my mom and I ask her\nAnd she says well you were leaving home and I was surprised at how much that upset me\nAnd you know after dad left you were you were my anger you you were the only person I could count on and um I thought that maybe having a piece of you would would help me get through that time and and it did\nA end at some point I just didn't need it anymore\nAnd then she adds it's it's very heavy [noise]\nSo what I got from this is that\nThe head of the product of a really difficult time in my family's life and my mother basically dealt with my father leaving by creating a cult of personality with with me as a personality and her as a cult\nAnd finally she been able to leave which is a good thing right I mean ... are very hard to leave and\nAnd my wife and my dad had never been part of the cold which is also a really good thing although\nTo be honest I Wish my dad had done\nSpent a couple of years of the ... [noise]\n\nI don't think I really understood they had fully though until a few months after that call when I um when our daughter Cleo was born and\nWhen I held her that I started my own cults basically\nIt was happening to me I mean I'm she'd\nLoosely and recklessly loved this individual for no other reason than than that she was alive\nAnd as for the head\nI found a place for it in my garage between some fertilizer and some are a bag of dead batteries\nAre I think I've finally come to accept my place in a long chain of children destined to hold onto crappy are commissioned by their parents [noise]\nClear it's going to have it a lot easier though I'm we're going to keep her head digital\n\nA writer and producer on the comedy central shrimp season but you may have random in print in the New Yorker style rolling\nStone his first novel the channel to see a picture of Jay with gates had to go to our website the Martha ... personally I think that is kind of things would be tempted to buy it at a garage sale by the way I asked change mother if I could intervene earlier about the head and she declined\nShe said letting it go still made her feel guilty even down there can listen to a hundred other stories amount and\nLearn more about the knock that Oregon last [noise]\n\nThis is public radio re mix [noise]\nHe doesn't know if he'll be allowed to sponsor his mother she's still

Sloan Foundation I'm Dr Wendy's\n[noise]\nWho is more excited the first day of class the students or the teacher\nWho do you think you get excited cutting the class [laughter] I get excited coming to class\nI was a freshman at UC Berkeley and it was taking a class that first semester my freshman year it was a freshman honor seminar and so there are only about Fifteen students in the class and the class what's called the brain and its potential and it was taught by an amazing instructor my name is Marion diamond\nI've been painting here for many decades\n[laughter] because I Love to\nAll about the brain in fact that very first day I'll never forget she was standing in front of the classroom and um\nFirst of all she looked like a Hollywood movie star she had this blonde grew fond hairdo should very tall very beautiful woman with a white lab coat over a beautiful skirt and and blouse and in front of her on the table was a flowery ...\nBox now you know what the most complex massive protests last on this earth is what do you think it with me\nShe opened not ... very dramatically and she pulled out a real preserved human brain\nBrain sure without a doubt get anybody tell me anything more complex than the human brain for a little\nFreshman at UC Berkeley who had never seen a human brain before\nWas one of the most memorable moments of my entire college career\nI Want you to appreciate what you carry on the top of your head\nBecause this mass only weighs three pounds and yet it has the capacity to conceive of a universe of billion light years of cry isn't that phenomenal\nIt really is the most complex structure known to mankind it underlies our creativity and our personalities and not only that but it can grow and change in response to the environment and it is a phenomenon that\nHouse and the human body they have a symbiotic relationship the brain affects the body the body affects the brain\nAnd with all of that I was a guard dog and just thought this is the most exciting interesting fascinating thing I've ever heard of it I'm so glad I'm In college I Want to be in our scientists\n\nNear diamond was well to this day she's the best teacher that I've ever experienced in my in my entire career and it's because she she was so\nPresent and then gauge and fascinated truly fascinated with the material that she was presenting\nShe has the flare for the dramatic and she wrote everything on the chalk board she said it was because if I write it down you're going to write it down and that gets into your memory and so at the end of the class you're you've already learned most of what you need to learn\nI have to tell you why I still use truck board and do not in power point\nBecause I study learning mechanisms long enough to know that it takes time to take in the primary information and associate it a field guide to flash on things like this you don't get it if you are right you use your kind of set accent\nThat's one way it slows me down it slows you down and I also repeat all the time because we know repeating reinforce [laughter] so we're using things that have been shown for learning rather than just keeping up with technology\nAt the beginning I was captivated with the neuroscience experiments that marrying diamond herself described and she had done so she did these classic studies in the Nineteen sixties showing what happens to the brains of rats if they were raised and what they called enriched environment\n[laughter]\nCertain rich environment is an environment where rats\nAnd you can think of it kind of like the Disney World of environments\nAnd what she showed was the brains of rats raised in those enriched environment we're actually bigger the outer covering of the brain called the cortex actually grew significantly larger\nCompared to rats that were raised in impoverished environments where there was only one one rat in a cage with no toys\nTo we decided to publish it and I spoke to the American association of Annapolis first big contracts that I had it for ... there weren't too many women agenda ...\nWhen I finished a man in the back roads up in it was a big auditorium stood up and shouted [laughter]\nYoung lady that brain cannot change\nNobody had thought that you could have an enriched environment specifically change your brain and an impoverished one change your brain\nIs the first\nNobody else had made such measurement found these results we were terribly excited about\nHer work and this environmental enrichment and brain plasticity was so influential on me I was fascinated both with the brain and with brain plasticity and so when I went to graduate school\nI definitely was was drawn to other forms of experiments that that addressed brain plasticity and my form of brain plasticity that I became fascinated with in graduate school was memory\nEveryday brain plasticity if I learned something new if I learn the name of somebody new and I'm able to remember it sometime later my brain is change and I wanted to try and understand\nWhat that change was and really identify it\n... ...\nIt's it's funny I'm physiology that is recording from brain cells you have to say it's a little bit like fishing you don't know exactly what they I Know they have a campus is involved I don't know what I'm going to find there so I I put my little fishing rod which is a very very thin\nMicro electrode down into the campus so I can\nListen in on what these cells are doing\n[noise]\nI Would be listening to us out as an animal was starting to learn something new and uh someone be doing much of anything that would just be firing every once in a while that I could hear on the audio monitor but\nThen one day I noticed that just as the animals started to learn a particular association the cell that was on the end of my electrode starts to fire more and more consistently right as the animal was learning in the fire\nAs the animal really put it into his memory more more and more strongly would call that consolidating the memory he got better and better and by the end of the session he was performing that association at a hundred percent correct [noise]\n\nI said well maybe maybe I was hearing things but then I went back and analyze the data and when I saw\nIs that this out in about twenty percent of all the cells that are recorded from the campus would change dramatically just as the animal was learning a new association once I got used to I could actually hear this happening\n\nAnd listen to those cells and being able to identify them as we listen to them was kind of like listening to the birth of a new memory [noise]\nToday at one\n[noise]\n\nPublic radio remains all night long here on AOL W San Francisco [noise]\nYou're listening to public

this\nI have a small apartment here in Bor on and in the living room with my apartment I have two big pieces of exercise equipment once built by Nautilus which is a free weights system\nBack in the comparative cool of marks apartment he offers me a Pepsi and tells me the story of how he saw his net worth skyrocket from a modest middle class income\nTo over fifty million dollars in just two years he had fourteen cars for homes and he spent his weekends comp that some of Las Vegas is most elite casinos\nAnd the muscle behind this sea of cash wasn't technology or manufacturing it was carpet so much money it seems so unbelievable\nAnd your chair and just go [noise] well yes I Would lean back in my chair on the private jet flying into Vegas knowing I was going to be staying and an eight bedroom suite at Caesar's Palace but you start thinking there's so much around you there's so much money and there's so much reality no one will ever let this thing fall apart\nAnd I I I couldn't have been more wrong but you do sit back and think to yourself you know I just spent fifty five thousand dollars on a watch\nBusiness is very simple it's not easy once you understand people's greed you have half the equation is that the buyers equation\nIf you're tired of going through the same problem with every time you want your carpets playing his time you've called us I'm very ... president of

unbelievably greedy they would still have become rich men\nBut they lived dangerously and when they were finally exposed there was no plea bargain to be made mark was convicted of stock fraud wire fraud and tax evasion and sentenced to eight years in federal prison\nThat first night in jail in lockdown with all of the other people all the clanging of locked doors behind you the black and blue marks from the handcuffs\nOr the little steps you have to take because your feet are handcuffed together and suddenly you realize this isn't just for a few days or hours this is gonna be months and years even if I make parole it was the harshest ah scariest slap [noise] uh I could ever imagine\n\nI still didn't feel like it quote criminal I somehow felt we were different and I started noticing every white collar guy did talk to began every sentence with well\nAll I did was and then you fill in the blank once you're there and you start feeling the animosity the other prisoners have toward white collar guys were they looking to go there they city you you're no different than us You're just a thief used other words\nEven the word embezzlement and nice we're here these they said you lie to people to take their money that's what I Do too and that hit me like a ton of bricks\nImagine going from your home and Malibu one day to a prison cell the next and not just for a few days or weeks but years this is a hard pill for white collar guys to swallow for mark the first step was completely accepting the skill owning up to the lies admitting that he was a thief\nHe says that after that at least he could do as time knowing that he was in jail for a reason that there was no one else to blame but himself\nThank you all for showing up it's a heck of a crowd my name is mark Morris I'm forty five years old [noise] like I don't want to put a human face on a stock\nAfter mark got out of jail and the Nineteen nineties he began the next phase of his quest to own up these days he goes

didn't advertise\nAnd there were maybe sixteen people on stage I'm not kidding maybe nine people in the audience and he was the greatest concert I've ever seen this was in Birmingham, Alabama about five years ago\nAnd they just use the horns a lot\nPretty sweet [noise]\nBut I I have a fantasy of having a music school\nThese kinds of people would come and\nStuff actually just entertainment and I would feed them so I kind of imagine a band like a broken social seem to do with that that would be a lot of\nShowing that we had also when water barrel on the front that was an outdoor shower that we

was a part of the tradition of your neighbors flavors up you know they were down here's Betsy bloomer Arthur's wise\nYou can hear the surf the the sunrise and sunset and the tide slowly so faithful [noise] I mean going we had a wonderful community out there and wonderful people it was just a special place\nLike in a stormy weather as much as marijuana I Would always go out there with my dad after storm to undo some beach going after the tide goes out you never know what you may find on the beach\nMuch erosion and severe rough on pilings you know when we would sit in our main room table and look out seated [noise] you could see nothing of water in front of you in fact they at high tide water came right up to the bottom step\n[noise]\nBeach erosion and sea level rise or different realities on Cape Cod much of the coaches clouding seawalls made with wood concrete and metal they're supposed to hold the line against the retreating shoreline but they're Only Temporary fixes\nMost beaches on the Cape and islands are eroding at a rate of several feet per year George price the director of the Cape cod national seashore to the north beach it's even more\nThe decrease in size was pretty dramatic there was eighty feet of erosion on the ocean side three years in a row that's pretty dramatic\nThe government is owned these cottages since Nineteen sixty one year to Cape Cod national seashore is formed to preserve the coast so\nThe government in other words George price and the national seashore ultimately responsible for the cottages while they're being threatened by origin\nSo frankly it was August first of last year that there was a field trip that involve some of our people and some of the coastal scientists and others\nThat went out to take a look and the word came back to me that it was a lot more immediate than we anticipated and that that was really the the trigger that let me know\nThat there were a couple of cottages at that time in jeopardy\nAgain Robert cruel we really didn't know what was going to happen as all that but within two weeks on the thirteenth of August everybody that had a seashore camp out they received a letter saying we have thirty days to get out and that was it\nSo when you affect five families all at the same time that's really going to be a critical mass of of community a concern\nThe backlash from the families formed a groundswell the media followed the conflict started politicians all the way up to the U.S Senate Sean summers is a local Chatham official\nNobody had argued that we're having um erosion problems and nobody argued that eventually we're going to have to do something uh but we were arguing that there was no imminent problem no imminent danger and I believe that we proved that too I'm a just a button to everybody except for Mr George Burns\nIt's very easy to to pick the the federal manager or the state or the county manager of the inflexible jerk crowd uncaring\nWhen in fact we can tear all we want but if there's a decision to be made about a resource that's going to have a major impact in the future than we have to proceed along those lines that we think is going to be the best for the resource\nAnd so when we did and other folks do was to I'm trying to get some a historic designation some other things just basically some time so we could explain to um the powers that be that in fact this really wasn't a a a threat to anybody out on the beach and the ... just were not in any imminent danger\nBut I think once they made the decision to remove them may just could not change course mean\nHow'd the erosion the facts of the Fox um the the nothing\nChanged over time there was not a change there we if you take a look at the GPS marks and you take a look at a at the

what about ... hours and um yes ah\n[noise]\nMy share of NASA watching [noise]\nWill never wears off [noise]\nSo\nIt's just kind of special I got to be in the control room at Vandenberg air force base in California for the launch of ... I had to settle\nThe vibe in the control of them is completely different than when you watch a launch what public viewing area it's all business at liftoff the crowd I had just watching the rocket launching the sheer and it goes off and there's all the smoke and fire but for the people in here the job doesn't end and the rocket launches they're monitoring everything\nThey're seeing one of the rocket fire and rightly the engine testify thrust it's quiet\nIntense focus\nAs last wish launched change\nYou know that was my first time a control room I've been to a couple of other launches that Kennedy and you know always been impressed by the rocket far away and how amazing it looks but being in the control center with special for me growing up in the Apollo era I'd always seen that room where everybody's like you know feels go you know it may go down the whole law arms\nAnd I always wanted to be there but I have to say that I was surprised at some of the checks the one in particular that still stands out is umbilical lubricant jak\nThat's a guy named Tom Wagner during launched Thomas sitting right next [noise] can you should wait for the past [laughter] on that Tibet every right to be nervous even working towards these days in more than ten years [noise]\nFrom ... this is horrible a show about the cosmos at our place to find the shelf for [noise]\n[noise]\nOn September fifteenth twenty teens and dumped it to rocket lifted I sat you into orbit satellite carries what just might be the most sophisticated space laser ever built and they didn't put it up there to shoot down ... asteroids itself shine a light\nA very precise focused light back to earth a single photons of laser light [noise]\nTom Wagner officially is NASA's program scientist for the crisis fear\nThat the studies the frozen regions of the earth\nPlaces critical to understanding our planets changing climate\nWhat's really funny is that at the start of it when I was a geology major back in college if you told me I Would work on glaciers I Would have said absolutely not you know it was\nBack in the eighties and you know people were just starting talking about climate change nobody really knew what it meant\nAnd doing ... you were out in the western us mapping glacial Marines from you know twenty thousand years ago and even older when the ice sheets came down from Canada but for me personally I wanted to work on something that was more dynamic and so I originally started working ... hours\n\nI sat ends in two thousand nine I said\nTo his in development it looked like it was going to be a little more complicated the original theory was hey well let's do a single being similar to what we did the original I sat and they said well there's this new fulltime counting stuff it looks like it's inexpensive maybe we could add that has like an outrigger on top of that\nAnd then the more we talked to said you know if we're really going to do that and it's going to work do we really need the big heavy laser in the middle and then you start coughing it all out you know more mass more power bigger spacecraft bigger rocket more energy needed bigger solar panels you start to go\nHey this photo counting stuff is going to use low power laser huh so we can make everything smaller and you know what these low power lasers they last longer than a high powered lasers so a lot of things came together early are where we wound up with the sixty votes on counting system that was really exciting to see and see the science mature along with\nI have to also extends masters ice bridge mission the holy sheet episode of orbital that [noise]\nMap the polar region [noise]\nThe new life have to satellite in state of the heart to determine exactly where it isn't space the satellite actually uses seventh laser beam and a technique that may sound a bit old school\nThat's seven beam gets shot off onto a map that map is up the stars that are over the satellite at that moment and by looking where the laser beam comes into that map relative to the stars we can very very precise figure out the orientation of the instrument [noise]\nAnd I just find that in mind boggling the funny thing is this though [noise] all the people who work on the project to have been doing this since I saw that the kind of go everybody knows about star drivers why are you kidding me I Can't believe this works let alone we need it\nJust the whole idea of knowing what rating is in space right I mean that I mean I think most people aren't aren't don't really know that we use star trackers I could we send Cassini out to Saturn why do we know where it is we're taking pictures of the stars very far away from Saturn and yet because they don't move very\nMuch [laughter] I Know and I feel so old school to me and you almost like navigators of old on the high seas where their sex and [noise]\nSo the point of building this next satellite we mean of course you know the one point is to have a data record that continues that we understand how the ISIS changing in many years to come hoping that I had to be taking data but the other thing is we're making much better measurement more accurate measurement and we had before [noise]\n[noise] yeah and it's it depends on how you quantify but it's like an order of magnitude better you know getting back to the football field analogy I sat would have put one being footprint on each end zone of the field I sat too is going to measure every yard line\nWe're going to get such an amazing new picture of the ice and up the planet on the whole not just doing the polar regions right the satellite is on when it's going over the entire globe\nSo we're going to be mapping things like the heights of rivers and lakes which nobody's ever really done before in a systematic way we're also going to be measuring the height of the world's far\nAnd that's really important as we try to understand the earth's carbon cycle you know fossil fuels to see or two in the atmosphere and then out to plants\nWe don't know how much carbon is tied up in the earth's biomass the forest and I said to going to help us do that [noise]\nWe also want to understand how the sea ice is connected to the global system\nAnd it's both influenced by and also influences is as we've lost the Arctic Sea ice cap we think that it's influencing North America right now it's changing the jet stream of potentially changing storm tracks but at the same time as the planet has warmed up and the polar regions are warming faster than the rest of the planet\nWe know we're losing the size we're losing an extent for us losing in sickness and the thickness one is what we're going to documents so much better with I said to them we ever have\nTo [noise]\nYou were talking about the Nineteen [noise] and we've actually seen that in the ... percent decline in the amount of the aftermath of the sea ice they're\nGoing to love going to like the last ten years has been losing about two hundred billion tons of mass yet we measured each year that incredible\nTo one thing to consider though right is that we also need to know the flux that is how much comes in and how much goes out will take the Antarctica case from it right there if you took all the oceans around the world just picture them in your head now take seven millimeters right\nOff the top\nSo much snow falls on Antarctica every year ... ... even though it's you know it's still considered a polar desert and things it's a tremendous amount now that as you can think of the ice sheets like if you're pouring\nI Know builds up in the center of the ice and then it flows after the sides\nNow we want to get it the process he's controlling it because that's the only way we can really do forecast so one of the things we find is that a coastal areas are losing a lot we think driven by the ocean interior areas may be gaining a little bit\nBut what I set to I think we're going to be able to pull it all together and we're going to see Barry very precisely where changes occurring and that'll let us do a better job with our forecast\nIs it just it's a wonderful story of how you design the like the best laser ever built basically you know when you've got you've got this really interesting new technology there's all kinds of wonderful things like the accuracy of the star tracker but then what's coming out of it is I Try to understand how our planet is changing\nWe you can think of the earth like a giant machine and the parts are all connected to each other and work together we need to know how the atmosphere works how much snow that's bringing to the ice how much when there is it's blowing the sea ice around we need to send the ocean how much he gets bring to the ice sheets and causing it to cast [noise]\n\nAnd with the mission like I said we think we can pull those things together so we can do a better job of forecasting changes\nAnd the fact is unique satellites that do it because if you want to understand how the earth disconnected you need to make measurements all over the place but you need to make them very very precisely and this is where a satellite is perfect it's up there in the environment of space\nIt'll last for a long time it covers the whole planet and you go over and over again making the same measurement everywhere\nAnd that's what really allows us to pull it all together to get this picture of the earth that lets us understand how it is today but also how it's going to change tomorrow\n\nAnd then finally to in in ... its dismal but exciting at the same time\nAs we lose either from the Arctic Ocean we're essentially seem to spin out of a new ocean for the planet [noise]\n\nThe Arctic Ocean right now is highly stratified and the ice forms a platform for a lot of creatures\nTo live as we remove that ice now when can stir the ocean so it's no longer so stratified\nAnd the species that live there change [noise]\nA lot of the species that live in there it's polar regions are very very long lived\nAnd consequently they are very nutritious they built up a lot of fatty acids and things whales come through in each certain kinds of plankton well what's happening is shorter lived species from the Pacific are now able to live in the Arctic and it's more like popcorn you know than helping meal [noise]\nSo to me it's fascinating as a scientist to see what the changes in the eyes the changes in the ocean and like you mentioned even even the chemistry the ocean because the layers are getting mixed up your different species that are moving in\nIt's a fascinating scientific problem huge amounts of data to be taken it also kind of scary yeah and\nI think a lot I mean I have children you know and I think a lot about the future and what their future is going to be like one of the things that I'm hopeful for is that by doing this kind of research we can put bounds around that problem\nAnd help humanity better mitigate the changes that are going to come but what people also have to realize is the change is already hear sea levels already rising\nHas risen and we're getting\nCoastal flooding even around the U.S [noise] but my hope is that with measurements from things like I said\nWe're going to be able to do a better job with projections and help humanity better prepare for what's coming [noise]\nWagoner he's master's program scientists studying the client sphere coldest parts of the year [noise]\nThere are crowds cheering outside and mission control everybody's\nAnd I'm sitting next to Tom Wagner [laughter]\nAnd I have to say Tom Wagner is a hero in mind this is one of the most brilliant people I've ever met he's not getting rich working at NASA he's doing something to his passion studying the ice studying the way the earth is changing\nAnd there's a combination of emotions as we\nWatch this rocket lift off [noise] there is the incredible triumph of building the world's greatest space laser sending it up on this amazing rocket there's all the technology there's all the science data\nAnd then there's just a little bit of catching your throat when you think about what it's going to reveal and the fact that it's revealing their plan is changing very quickly\nThat Sunday Morning at eight [noise]\nIt's something new to live in a public radio reached\nNinety One point seven at around San Francisco [laughter]\n[noise]\nSee that the following podcast contains language and content that may not be appropriate for all listeners discretion is advised\nYour dad gave you well that's the problem um but my um my dad left when I was for only a vice I got from my dad was to be still and take this because unlike admitted\nHe used to show me what four to use like a crab fork and we had all these uh like instruments a civil war out on the table it took me awhile to get the hang of that\nOh they're not getting any advice no but he lead by example of ought not to do\nOr what do you use\nFor salad it's the third one from the right my dad never gave me a nearby um I think he did but I don't recall does your dad ever give you any advice ... um my dad was gone by the time I was too and they're by the time I was twelve\nTold me to go to school thing college did you listen to him\nI Do not Lewis\nDid your dad ever give you any advice yep he says smoke on the on the weekends\nYou're now tuned in to St Clinton's ear hum from PR rex is radio Tokyo I'm now I'm incarcerated here saying Clinton state prison in California I'm nine to look for a visual artist to volunteers at the prison and together we're going to take you inside [noise]\nToday on the pocket and we're going to hear about being a day for ... [noise] um\n\nHe did your dad give you any good advising me when I was growing up yeah not that I can recall but when I went to prison\nHe did say watch your back\nIs that helpful I mean it was cool covered for me um you know I guess it said that he can't tell you a mutt [laughter] okay well being a parent is a lot more than giving advice but if you're in prison it's hard to even do that\nBecause you're in prison yeah but you can actually give advice NBA adapt from prison is harder but a lot of guys here have children and there's all sorts of different ways that they do it and that's what we're going to hear about today and mainly we're going to focus on this guy here\nSo when I was told I was going to be a father started to think about\nWhat type of father that I plan on being\nDerek how the way has been incarcerated for Twenty one years when his son was born there was a twenty four year old drug dinner and had a lot on his mind\nI Can't be a father like this in my current condition\nAnd living the way but I was living are really need to change\nThat meeting to change and actually changing your life Gerecht now knows like two different things\nYou know I'm at the hospital with his mom legacy and his face was like\nIt was like a miracle was like man this is a human being I'm responsible for human me and so the man with trained with that was a whole lot of emotions\nA whole lot a whole lot that I wasn't even really prepared for or have even the emotional intelligence they deal with it\nAnd I just didn't know how to say\nThis child is what's most important I just didn't have the tools\n[noise]\nIn spite of being a new that he didn't change and\nI started getting sucked in to the criminal lifestyle criminal criminal behavior after that it was one of the dogs and\nGo on give me a typical day like what was your you got up and then\nI saw him fall so why would I Would get up at of course I Would have girlfriends strolled all over the city\nSo if depending on what girlfriend house I was at you know so I Would get up and kind of call around and see where everybody was doing where everybody was going to be a [noise]\nBut I was you know the freeway\nKickback see what was going on [noise]\nUm so the typical day really was like me really making sure that the ... the spot where we wish I had had dope out there you know people who are out there they were ready to spot was rolling\nI'm so out of there for a minute but I Would always be trying to run and see what what was the next woman was she was doing I mean I just love women [laughter]\nDerek was living in life he was young he had money women he thought he was on top of it all\nThe soda downfall was I'm\nBeginning really to\nUse drugs\nAnd then he really got in trouble in Nineteen Ninety seven less than a year after his son was born Derek was arrested for first degree murder incentives to thirty seven years to life in\nThe next time Jackson his son he was in prison behind thick glass in a visiting man\nStory so he came to visit on his on his first birthday and I'm just looking at him and some of my thoughts was or\nWas this guy I was going to represent our relationship and um you know for the for the first time I was realizing that they can like that as a possibility that I may never get an opportunity to to see him as a child and grow up and to have some kind of influence in his life [noise]\nSomebody could be better than that\nOne might lead\nTo my own self I I couldn't find a way out I wanted to do something different but I didn't know how and and come into prison\nI actually really gave me that opportunity to sit down and really examine my life in the beginning to get the courage to do something different with my life\n\n\nIn prison Derek ... religion and he's now in prison creature with a full on congregation\nSo what is in prison present you're talking about [laughter]\nThere's a lot of guys\nGet religion fake religion religious but they're not\nLike the real deal how do you know because you can sit in one of his sermons in here just haven't tier two and yeah you know I mean is there any walk\nThe walk you know just walk the walk on the pope and he will have to walk on the yard and he'd go around and counsels people counsel to use so yeah he's real\nBut he couldn't count one's own son when his son's mother died the boys maternal grandmother took him in and she thought it was best to keep them away from his father and Derek only heard what was going on second and third hand\nSo when he was growing up I heard good

sometimes right to walk them how he always\nHow how I used to walk and so when I watch it woke up the stairs sometimes I'm like\nJust staring at him by man look at me that is me and\nSometimes it is so overwhelming because nobody wants prison for their child and so it makes me more protective you know now more like okay where are you at and and I'll I'll see them but I don't let them see me [laughter]\nThat brings up a whole nother thing but yeah just watching them watching his mannerisms how we interact with people\nOn the teacher hardly interact with people in the prison very

interesting I'm I'm going to be honest though new chemical stuff\nBut apparently they're versions with chocolate and I feel like I I Would be into that I just never really liked the the ones with candy fruit and stuff in it but that that wasn't my thing\nAnother thing that we did every year to is this holiday called ... it's celebrated in many countries it's when the three wise men that

year or understand it\nAlthough there's been no visual confirmation of fifty to hurt scientist are fairly sure that it's a way\nThere are characteristics to the signal even though the frequency is off of what you would expect the signal type is above we'll call\nMy name's darling captain and I and join appointment between ... and the graphic institution at Harvard Medical school\nThe sound has been recorded in an area of the north Pacific where whales are often found and those characteristics that you mentioned\nThere distinct from other sounds like fish or book propellers\nIt is not impossible that it's something else mimicking we'll call structure\nBut so far we don't know of any underwater minor birds that would be doing that\nMost people are aware that marine mammals you sounded communicate or we often don't think about how critical those sounds can be underwater\nBecause they're dealing with an environment in which light doesn't penetrate well most of the communication that goes on is likely to be purely acoustic purely through sound\nBut even if we recorded every single sounds that we make we still wouldn't have an idea of what they're communicating until we could associate those sounds with the whales behavior\nOr we need to be able to see what the animals are doing and a record sounds from the nuts animals over a long enough period of time to tie it back to
