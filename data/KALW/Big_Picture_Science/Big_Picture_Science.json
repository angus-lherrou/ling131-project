cats rats would you start looking you wanna [noise] rabbits and fans at a low shark spiders toads I mean they're all animals\nWe conveniently forget that humans are in that list too we are also animals however we observe the amusing the terrifying the occasionally odd behavior of other creatures\nAs if they inhabit a biosphere that is separate from our civilized own\nAs a result some of our observations about animals how ever well intentioned as superficial and you don't have to be clever as a Fox to recite a few popular tropes like quiet as a most dumb as an ox and that sneaky weasel\nRight that's right if I had an elephant's memory I could do better than say bloodthirsty batter brave it's a lion but enough wanting around the point is we make easy assumptions about animals based on their appearance or some aspect of their\nBehavior and as humans who conveniently forget their animals we want to be accepted and appreciated for who we really are this means taking time to understand the context of what seems like bizarre behavior for example let's say we hear a guy screams\n... sandwich and then he throws a jelly sandwich at someone\nHim to a casual observer that guy's nuts and then you find out that he works for ... deli thanks for Jews and Reagan for all your daily nice\nYou just want to find it in a cage together that it ain't gonna work so that's how a sense that we can't really understand smell that communication that send to communication means nothing to offer and say we don't understand it and we misinterpreted animals as a result\nI Can't recall who wrote this but somebody said something to the effect that animals don't just live in a different world they inhabit a different universe is that really true\nYeah yeah I think that's a great quote we see well we have well off and just not as I K but different animals have heightened senses or other senses the less well developed and so yeah they sensory realm as is very very very different from our house and say\nIt's really hard for us to put ourselves in the shoes and to try and walk out what's going on\nWell finally Lucy or we tend to stereotype our fauna friends although I guess calling them friends might be just another example of anthropomorphizing but what would be the benefits of understanding them better I mean aside from our pets well\nUnderstanding animals is really important

only going to make us ... the planet\nLucy cook thanks very much for speaking with us my pleasure it's lovely think he\nLucy cook is though all the just and she is the author of the truth about animals stones lost love ... and other tales from the wild side of wildlife so it's an important point the one that was made that\nIf we think an animal is gross they're dumb or we have some reason to recoil from it we might not be motivated to care about that animal and a conservative habitat for example in the case of the vulture\nAnd more than that we don't understand why they're doing it I mean the animals are not deliberately be gross or anything like that that's their lifestyle and there's got to be a reason for it because otherwise we wouldn't be around doing it so we've got to resist the temptation to you know consider their behavior in the same terms that you would consider that somebody invited to dinner\n[laughter] that's true animal behavior is complicated and remember that humans

documentary film\nRodents of unusual size\nBut as the film describes there's more to this story because of the nutrients are not a typical invasive species they were purposely introduced brought here

about humans and so while there are a lot of them and their invasive to Louisiana they'll kind of scatter off when you get nearby\nMy goodness I write a nutrient is a rodent right so what are its closest relatives I mean it's also known as a swamp rabbit so I presume it's related to ... uh tell me about you know closely related critters\nSo new tree or rodents they're closer to things like copy bears and beavers than the kind of normal rats that we think about\nA lot of people confused copy bars in nutrients ... bars are the largest rodent in the world but they're much cuter in coffee bars actually have kind of for regular legs where as nutrient looks more like a rat\nThey're semi aquatic animals there are ... in the sense that they only vegetation particularly route\nMost nutri or maybe about Fifteen to twenty pounds but one of the big problems that they have to be an invasive species of the breed really quickly so like within three months four months you know baby can start reproducing and they have litters of sixty babies and so you can imagine that they're more prolific than rabbits\nAnd what about their teeth I read that they have read teeth kind of reminds me of a I don't know a vampire\nMe [laughter] well while we consider nutri kind of cute once you get up close and personal from far away they kind of have this kind of horror movie look in the sense that they're you know look like the super size giant rat\nBut they do have these giant front orange teeth the teeth or orange because they feast on route and the roots are rich and iron into the iron basically manifests themselves an orange teeth that you see some people are actually making jewelry out of them in Louisiana\nWe've labeled termites as tests for\nGood reason termites can eat wood grass money they can eat books worldwide they do at least forty billion dollars worth of damage a year [noise]\nTermites have excellent immune systems they have internal immune systems and they also have a social immune system that is enforced by soldiers they also have another kind of social immune system which is that they spread their feces about\nThey groom each other obsessively the result is that it's extremely hard to kill termites with biological agents\nNow what happens next is that we're about to make the case for the virtues of the term I so we ask that you clear from your mind images of amounts of would be it's fine to wall board in your basement or the ragged holes in your prize book collection and prepare yourself for\nUnder bug an obsessive tale of termites and technology reporter Lisa ... book about the upside of this under bug\nShe spent eight years studying termites with researchers from a wide array of scientific and technological fields and learn that despite being publicly maligned termites or central contributors to the planet's environmental health\nAnd they're even pointing their literal antennae toward the exciting future technology okay Lisa we want to hear more about that but first what's the most impressive thing that you've seen termites much their way through\nI Would have to say the most impressive thing it's probably some sort of power system insulator um where I saw this what if not would though I'm I Know well [laughter] [laughter]\nThey're also capable of eating other things so in Australia people talk about the meeting tires they eat the coating on wires\nAnd uh I happen to be visiting Berlin and someone who worked at a government lab that was formerly in East Berlin took me into their basement where they had different colonies of termites that they've had for\nA Thirty years or so each growing in kind of of that I'm In temperature control rooms and they have these to test different industrial materials on them\nSo they would take like a whole intact insulator of some sort or transformer case and they would jam it down into the vat of termites and they leave it for a month or so and then they would pull it out\nAnd what remained what the termites had not chewed away would look like a sculpture because the termites had been gnawing away on the sides of it in sort of strange organic patterns really\nWe do have to overcome our disposition not to like termites to prepare ourselves to here in what ways termites or beneficial\nThink there's two things one thing is is to watch a collection of termites\nIf watching aunts or other insects grosses you out which it does me I feel itchy when I look at ... I don't feel that when I look at termites ants move in a very a sort of ... by the judge did weigh termites slow\nAnd to me they're not as disturbing to actually watch\nAnd then the second thing is I Would say termites have an extraordinary aesthetic\nWhen they're building a mound that can be say Fifteen feet tall they feel inside of it with their antennas defined rough areas and wherever it's rough they pull away the dirt until it's smooth and so when you open up a termite mound it's this\nExtraordinary world with these very smooth beautiful interior spaces and I think if you look close\nNow when they're making their their mound why did they making them out of and what does the material that the results\nWill different termites build in different environments so the termites that I watch for the longest time we're macro attorneys Madeleine says and they were in Namibia and they build with little balls of mud which they making their mouths and the mud is\nSomewhat cemented with some kind of special termites saliva\nAnd we don't know exactly how they built\nBut a basic description of it is that one term I Will put down one dirt ball and another term I Will put down another dirt ball and top of that and then they keep piling up the dirt ball until they have like little peaks and then those little peaks kind of connect to make frilly little walls\nAnd then those walls some of them have arches in them they begin to build up and one of the things that we know drives them is the smell of fresh air inside their mound it smells really intensely of termites smells really intensely a fungus\nAnd of course there's all this feces and they're constantly transferring microbial sort of starter culture to each other by mouth to mouth and melted but [noise]\nSo there's this intense smell in there and when any fresh air comes through some termites run from the fresh air into the mound and set off an alarm of sort of us that they make a sound and then other termites grab a dirt ball they build and build until they've cut off the fresh air smell\nSo just to be clear the fresh air is not something they're drawn to the way that we are when we want to step out of our buildings and get some fresh air the fresh air suggests is that there may be holes are vulnerabilities in their defense system\nYes if you're a termite you're constantly being attacked by aunts and aunt eaters an art barks an art wolves and anything else that can hack their way into your\nInto your mound so one of the things that you do if you're a termite is you you know how to control your perimeter and the way that they do that is that when they smell fresh air they know they need to go do something\nWhat what is the reason for these complex structures though I mean they could probably just make a very simple mound I mean maybe I I Would say maybe like an ... mountain but perhaps that's not simple either so I shouldn't say that\nThe lie so a lab or it almost like a like a palace an insects version of a beautiful palace well\nIt's always an interesting question of why something that evolutionarily drive to like a bug\nIs building something so elaborate like amount or the particularly these uh ... mountains in Namibia I'm we know that the mound itself has several functions one of them is that it works kind of like a long it manages to both protect them from wind and cold\nYou know keeps moisture in it keeps too much rain out when it's really wet it makes the air fresh it also keeps too much fresh air from coming in and it also regulates the temperature", "year":

A. O. W. dot O. R. G. [noise]\n\nWe're talking about non human communication in this episode of big picture science there's a lot of it going on but will miss it unless we take the time and develop the tools to study the messaging system of other species\nSimon ... is a professor in the botany department at the University of Wisconsin Madison as a research scientist who studies how plant sense and respond to the world is experiments are designed to produce quantitative data but for as how he feels about his subjects he's not neutral\nI teach in introductory biology class on plant biology and we start off which I'm going to tell you why plants are eleven on the one time scale of awesome [noise] if you're not\nAnimal kingdom not this island clear if they'll produce the world\nBut that particular Denver and in the corner all it's more like you then you know\nPlants have exactly the same problems that we have the sometimes the world is not a nice place to be\n[noise]\nAnd if a plant speeding eaten it doesn't have the luxury of running away\nBut that doesn't mean it's without options plants are good at producing chemicals so they can make toxins or something that tastes bad to act as a deterrent\nAnd now we have some insight literally how they do this in order to understand how chemical signals travel throughout a plant Dr Gilroy and his team engineered some plants the floor is when attacked that's right they light up\nThe reason the plants are glowing green is because we took a gene from a jellyfish gene makes a protein that naturally glows green\nAnd then they would watch under a microscope how the plant response to a threat such as being besieged by a fuzzy six legged tear\nThe capitalist thoughts chewing on the leaf and you mentioned the leaf is made up of thousands and thousands of cells and those those are being broken open by the caterpillar munching on that [noise] and that is a really big stress\nThey did one more thing in order to watch what happens next that is to the poor plant being attacked they engineered it said that the fluorescent protein is switched on in the presence of a substance within the cell called the calcium iron when the calcium levels go up the plant glows brightly\nCalcium spikes increases in ... levels within a sell carry information and trigger things and so one of the great examples of that is the reason that your heart is beating at the moment is because within the muscle cells with the hot\nThere were ... spikes of calcium being produced and the cops and levels go up and that triggers a muscle contraction and then the cost some levels go down and the muscles relax so that cow some changes triggering the biology of your hot\nThat theme is carried through biology so same deal with once they have spikes of couch him to go up and down inside the cells 'em loose trigger the downstream responses\n[noise]\nAnd so the plants start to glow bright green at the location where the damages occurring but then researchers we're in for a surprise\nIt was really sort of unexpected when we saw it so\nYou know if you pick up a leaf in the fall and look at it you can see all the veins across the leaf those veins the plumbing system of the plant\nI'm In the plants are engineer plants that glow in response to the signals we see that that plumbing system lights up in a wave moves through the plot and this was the super exciting I'm really unexpected but it moves down through all of that plumbing that vascular system\nAnd then goes pasta shoot an out into the leaves\nAnd this isn't like this time lapse videos showing plants slowly turning in the sun or opening their leaves these chemical signals move fast\nAnd it it's all in real time so we can watch the globe progress through the plant we can see where it goes so it's letting us really for the first time visualize this information moving in real time fruit the plot\nSo it's clear that plants have a complex internal signaling system\nOne part of the plant can send signals to another part of the plant it tell us what's going on so the more that Simon Gilroy and his team learn about plant communication the more impressed they become because well for one the plant signaling doesn't stop at the leaves edge plants have buddies\nAnd there's also some really elegant and just very nice experimentation that says that an individual pond can send information to another individual plot things like when an insect is chewing on the leaves of one plant volatile chemicals released on those chemicals blowing the wind\nAnd it perceives that volatile chemical and it will switch on its own defenses so this clearly information flowing both within the organism but also between organisms\nYou didn't contradict me and my uses the word communicated ... matter us demand picks to which\nHere [laughter] we can say that plants communicate\nYeah communication is information exchange\nI'm we're never going to use the language that we used to describe how human beings how we operate as far as taking in information and processing it when we're talking about plants because that's the realm that we understand and did you have in the back of your mind slip clumps clearly not animals ... green animals they're going to do things a little bit differently\nBut I don't think there's a problem and using the language to try and an ... what they're doing\nWell I think this question will be on some people's mind is the plant feeling pain when that caterpillar jumps down on it\nSued that\nKind of depends on what you think pain really means so there is clearly\nThey signal being generated so the receptors for wounding an damage of being ... good and there's information which is being passed to the rest of the organism this guys will be for the rest of the plant to trigger responses which has sort of the defense response is the way of dealing with that\nAbsolute immediate damage or there's no brain and there's no nervous system and so we usually think of the processing of the feeling of pain requires that processing component to it on those structures don't exist in plants\nSo that's not a definite no\n[laughter] [noise] um [noise] I Can't I think again it just gets down to we inevitably use the language of how humans perceive the world and how we process information on what happens to us\nTo put other organisms and complex and I think that is an absolutely appropriate thing to do because how else are we going to think about how these things operate so this damage this information on this response\nOr any of that pain that gets down to what you think your definition of pain is\nSimon do you own any pets\nOh absolutely yeah couple of cats\nWould you ever bite down on your cat's leg\n[noise] no\nI Know better than to do that [laughter] but you know\nThat would create a lot of pain for your cat so yeah and young if when you're working with plants if you ever hesitate if you have any regrets in what you need to do to them to test their receptors because they need to be damaged in some way and and do you ever pause and wonder if he should do it\nIf you could adopt one sensory system that a plant has for a day\n[laughter] which would it be\nRight that's a tricky one um [noise]\nYou know there's a hidden half of the plants that we don't usually think about which is the root systems and so we see you know the leaves and we know leave sense light and temperature and lots of things so there's a root system that reveals a lot about the U.S\nAnd supplies have the ability to sense concentrations of nutrients and gradients of water and that will be a really different\nView of the world from the world that we inhabit on the sensory systems that we use so that might be a really really interesting insight into the dynamics of going on underneath offbeat but we just ... usually just never really think about of course you'd have to stay put for the day [noise]\nIf you had roots yeah I didn't say it will be easy [laughter]\nYeah it would bring you into the world of the challenges but also the opportunities that you get by having that way of dealing with the environment around you so parts have access to resources that human stone\nOn food that just different approaches to solving the conundrum of how do I stay alive and reproduce on the U.S well\nSimon go right thank you so much for joining us today

I'm Talking about the ability of bacteria to count how many of their brethren are around them and then when there are enough do something altogether as a group\nOr I'm sensing is a hot area of research in microbiology and this guy knows something about it he coined the term\nYeah I'm Pete Greenberg I'm a micro biologist at the University of Washington and then what floats my boat is the way bacteria interact with each other\nEarlier in the show you heard how some mammals implants communicate well even a simpler organism like a bacterium has an impressive communication capability which it uses to coordinate activity\nSure they may be tiny but you do want to know what bacteria are up to because some of them will make you their home understanding quorum sensing can help us do encourage healthy bacterial growth or to prevent that which is harmful\nThey did that bacteria released molecules into their environment and also a sense what molecules are already there this tells them how many of their buddies are nearby and when they detect decorum they act their communication is sufficiently new ones didn't variable well it's tempting to call it language\nA lot of people will talk about the language of bacteria and that's a stretch to call what they do language they have the ability to communicate by using small chemicals they released some of their environment and their brother and can\nDetect those chemicals and if I'm not rather enter around all making the chemicals that on the signal everyone in the population to do some interesting behavior and analogy\nSmokers in a room so if one smoker comes into a\nLarge room a head of a meeting\nHere's a little bit of smoke in the room and nothing happens but as more and more people accumulate and everybody's smoking a level of the smoke in the room goes up and at some point there'll be a move to open the windows and that whole ... smoke out of the room and they'll be a\nA benefit to a group so where should I imagine that quorum sensing is taking place I mean maybe in my bloodstream but and maybe other places where where does this go on\nYeah so you know wherever bacteria congregate and groups which is pretty much anywhere\nThat's one ... cent in will occur\nWhen bacteria are free and the ocean they're low population density sound Kwan sensing doesn't occur in but if they are growing in a fish got or in a light Oregon of a fish or on a piece of algae they'll accumulate\nAnd ... cents and will occur we are interested in bacterial infections with shoot a mono sent along the ideas that one at first invades the host it's out low population density that doesn't display it's weapons and that can grow underneath the radar\nUntil it gets to a point where there are enough bacteria to make things up who hurt the host and then they do that in a coordinated fast\nSo when I think of a quorum sensing works it's because these individual bacteria are releasing if you will or some sort of signal molecule into the environment whatever that environment is blood water or whatever right and and then when it gets to a critical concentration they've reached decorum is is is that the deal\nYeah that's the idea so they make some inexpensive small molecule that as a proxy for their density\nEach bacterium is making it\nIf there's just one bacterium in a large environment as it's produced and put under the environment it will defuse away if there are a lot of bacteria packed together each bacterium making the small molecule\nThen the concentration and the environment goes up and when the concentration of these small molecules reaches a critical point\nIt can interact with her a sector that is present on every bacterial cell and one that does that the bacteria no there are enough of their brother and around and they commenced to do these social activities\nYou point out that the signals are small molecules are in other words if they're releasing some sort of chemicals into the into the water there or whatever the local environment as and so um what kind of chemicals are being released here can you give an example\nYeah I'll give an example so when we first started working on this we were working on a particular really interesting bacterium hits or marine bacterium that makes light", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Big Picture Science", "city": "San Francisco", "day":

points of water had to be neutral can be very acidic or very basic\nAnd that's all know that exploded now that we've been studying extremophiles I mean who would've expected to find life kilometers down into the crust which we do\nLive finds a way in all kinds of environment\nLife finds a way and so that's the story over my career has been\nThat the universe has appeared to be more bio friendly than when I started out it doesn't mean it is we haven't proven that that appearances actually translate into reality but I think we will in this century\nWell and and finally Jill I'm what does it mean that you have not found aliens so far in terms of how you sustain yourself psychologically in other words what's it like to work on a program that you may never have an answer for it\n[noise] when I started in this exploration I think I understood fairly well how big a question it was that I was trying to answer and that I might not find an answer\nBy the end of my life but it might be my granddaughter or her granddaughter that eventually succeeds Jill Tarter thank you so much for joining us today oh Molly it's been a pleasure thanks for having me\n[noise]\nJoe ... or one of the founding members of the SETI Institute where she's now on the board of trustees she is the subject of a book by writers ... schools making contact Jill Tarter and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence [noise]\nThe ranks of women astronomers have been growing Jill Tarter took an engineering class according to a study by the American Institute of physics about one third of those who get a bachelor's in astronomy work astrophysics far women in science she checked more women are getting to a degree\nBut not necessarily the job for no longer living in the era of Nineteen fifties stereotype but someone in the Silicon Valley didn't get the\nNext are women's brains just not suited for tech it's wonder women on the picture science\nMichigan this American Life like sprint Camille sentimental photograph of herself and she's a little kid on vacation with their family in Canada and then I glance back at the picture and I saw my grandma walking through behind her\nWaking Camille grew up in different states committed no him at that age or his grandma coincidences do they mean anything this week wow\nThis American Life had your way Wednesday's at noon here on KLW at KLW dot org and on your smart speaker say play KLW\n[noise]\n\n\n\nThings have changed since the days when astronomers Jill Tarter was the only woman in her engineering class at Cornell University according to the national Science Foundation the ballots his tipped towards greater equality when it comes to degrees earned as well as job placement in most\nSTEM fields that is science technology engineering and math\nThe exception is the e in stem men continue to seriously a number of women in engineering and computer science why is this a memo written by Google software engineer suggests one reason the culture is hostile to women\nThe memo was meant to be shared internally but it was released publically and it struck a nerve both in and outside the walls of the tech giant it reinforce the image of the Silicon Valley as the segregated valley\nThe tech companies have been criticized for lack of diversity in hiring women account for thirty one percent of Google's workforce but just twenty percent of its technical staff according to the company's own diversity reports\nAnd while employment in IT field is going by thirty seven percent since two thousand three the percentage of women in engineering hasn't changed it's flat at Thirteen protect\nAnd the percentage of women working in computer science has actually down since Nineteen Ninety\nThe Google memo was written in twenty Seventeen but the thinking was borrowed from another era where there were men's jobs and women's jobs\nWell they don't get ... they can become dressmaker kept people the barber shop can't can't can't gun stuff [laughter] well the danger of doctors and lawyers to you know there are judges and lawyers are\nA stubborn imbalance of women in tech but because they claim that there was science supporting it men's brains are more suited than women's protect jobs\nScience journalist Angela ... says this is a persistent myth and people are not looking at current research how science got women wrong writes missing in her book inferior she addresses the software engineers misguided memo\nSo it wasn't as though he explicitly said that women are biologically less capable of doing the job but he certainly heavily imply that so within his memo he used this kind of biological argument that because of testosterone levels early and development that women are somehow have\nDifferent capabilities are different preferences to men\nUnderlying a tool the documents that he used come from various thesis research but one of them in particular is work done by a researcher here at Cambridge University Simon Baron Cohen\nNow he is a very well respected world famous autism are such a but well the parts of the hits were such as more controversial is on sex differences so he claims that there are such things as distinct male female brains\nAnd that they predispose\nThe people who possesses male female brains to slightly different interests and hobbies and this Google engineer drew his kind of inspiration from this although I have to say that having such a topic in great great detail for a number of years\nThis theory itself and Valentine's Day we doesn't really have a great deal of evidence behind it\nWhat let me just follow review on what his point was I mean it may be that there's\nA some tendency you know the the leads to a difference in behavior in a technical environment between men and women I don't know but on the other hand is usually what the cases is that there's so much overlap and these capabilities that shouldn't really affect the number of\nFemale engineers I mean what what was he tried to get out here\n[noise] yes absolutely this is where it gets complicated because there is lots of research on sex differences is one of the most fashionable fields in science right now and there was such really can tell you whatever you wanted to tell you depending on which study you happen to pick up\nIf you take any group of people and divided down the middle you will find differences between them and thoughts of product to the fact that we are all different as individuals and in fact there's far more differences within the sexes and they're all between them you know we're just so different\nAnd this is why the complication comes and\n\nOne of the barriers to women pursuing careers in science and technology is a climate that his subtly unwelcome ain't poor worse harassment of women and space science and astronomy has been in the news and gotten our attention but some researchers suspected that was more to the story as big as it was\nThey wanted to quantify other alarming anecdotes that they were hearing associate professor of anthropology at the University of Illinois captain Clancy and colleagues surveyed more than four hundred astronomers and planetary scientists with questions of their experience in the workplace over the last five years but this survey was unique\nWe focused our attention on the experiences of women of color because women of color face a double bind and we wanted to see the extent to which we could see that in the sciences\nThe researchers asked the women about eight different issues related to identity gender gender identity race sexuality physical ability mental ability narrow diversity that is variations in neurological conditions and religion\nAnd we asked the extent to which they had overheard disparaging remarks about these kinds of identities to the extent to which state experienced verbal and physical harassment as a result of these identities\nAnd then whether or not they'd ever felt unsafe in their workplace and finally whether or not they'd ever skipped professional event due to feeling unsafe\nThe result was the paper coauthored by Dr Clancy double jeopardy and astronomy and planetary science women of color face greater risks of gender and racial harassment published in the summer of twenty Seventeen in the journal of geophysical research planet\nThe results may have been given less attention at the time then they deserved because they were published in a niche journal but the implications are as broad as they are sobering our main\nFindings where is that women of color experienced a the greatest degrees of verbal and physical harassment even more so than white women that they felt unsafe in their workplace and extraordinarily high numbers\nForty percent of the women of color in our sample so that they felt unsafe in the workplace as a result of their gender and you know that was a really devastating up for us and then of course the number of women or women of color and white women reported that they skipped professional events because they felt unsafe what\nYour reaction to the results of your survey and from one account I read that you were devastated and I wonder if you could expand on that because women and women of color have reported this sort of behavior\nAs a complete surprise [noise] no um\nI mean the thing is is that none of this work that I've been doing for the last five years has ever surprise me you know it's not that a single time I've seen data and been like oh I had no\nIdea that women of color were going to experience and greater degree uses\nHarassment um instead what I think it is is there's there's something about hearing anecdotes and having your heartbroken by having a friend tell you that something happened to them\nBut it's another thing altogether to have those strung together into a quantitative story you know one that says that this isn't just a one off this is actually a systemic problem\nNow in in your survey and as you just said forty percent of women of color reported that they felt unsafe [noise] how do you define that term that's an alarming word to feel unsafe how did you define it\nWe didn't define it we just ask them to what you know have you ever felt unsafe in your workplace and have you ever skipped any professional events because you felt unsafe and so that certainly leaves it open for responding to interpret that term however they like you know the\nWay I might interpret it might be different from the way you read it but either way I think it's going to be a pretty negative workplace experience if you could ever label what you're experiencing as unsafe\nYou use the term in your abstract micro aggressions and I wonder if you distinguish between micro aggressions at one experiences in the workplace and a blunt hostile remark an actual physical aggression\nSo micro aggressions are really about different types of incivility Z\nOr unpleasant interactions you may have in the workplace that are clearly a result of your identity and usually specifically a result of your race that's really where the term I Believe originally came from is understanding racial micro aggressions so someone might say something that I'm very subtly racially motivated\nLike making a comment about oh how often do you actually wash your hair to an African American person or a or else actually I'll tell you one that I I Know happened here on my campus because uh a lecture told me about an a student at first telling her about it\nIs that uh there was this one African American woman and a lecture hall she was one of the only African American women in the entire chemistry class and she could hear a couple of white men behind her giggling\nAnd couldn't figure out why and then at the end of the class realize they had stuck a pen in her hair [noise]\nUm you know and she had sort of an afro and it was a a department of chemistry Penn so it was like a let's make it as obvious as possible that you are not welcome here that we find something other and weird about you\nWhat was heartbreaking truly in and you identify this was reading that I'm Eighteen percent of women of color and twelve percent of women\nJust skipped out on a professional meetings on seminars and other events that they would otherwise go to because they wanted to avoid this hostile climate that it's so bad that you [laughter]\nThat you avoid doing the thing that you love and participating in your field in and collaborating with your your colleagues because you don't know how you're going to be treated in that meeting\nExactly and you don't want to be reminded of you know the person who made a pass at you at lunch or the person who made you feel smaller made you feel stupid so you miss out on that seminar you miss out on the chance to meet you know the senior colleague who does the work that you do\nUm or a chance to bond with some of your friends or or a chance to just learn something new and exciting you know um and so you know what that means though if they miss out on that networking\nThat I'm can help them be seen as a quote team player or\nOne of the things I was really struck by when conducting interviews for this project which we hope will go into a a leader publication\nIs that a number of the respondents and not just women of color but women of color white women white men men of color um there were all were present in our sample many of them said oh I started out in physics but I left physics to go to John in me because I Want it to be in a less hostile discipline\n[laughter] and so I mean that makes me think that physics might actually be even worse than astronomy in terms of how hostile it is or just how intimidating that workplace can feel\nWorkplace aggression and sexual harassment in the workplace they're not new but you found that people did not expect to find them present in the sciences as well and why would people think that the sciences would be immune to aggression and sexual harassment\nShort and this is one of the things that I find frustrating sometimes in fact as someone who's both a ... a social scientist and a trained like scientists because I'm a biological anthropology I'm always surprised when I encounter a scientist from other disciplines\nWho are incredibly staunch believers that science is a meritocracy that the best people who do science are the ones who stay in science and they're the ones who succeed in science they're the ones who get the best papers and the best funding\nAnd they just couldn't be further from the truth I mean what really matters in science is your pedigree what matters unfortunately it's often your identity or the number of African American female post stocks that I've known over the last five to seven years\nWho um end up on every shortlist that they go up you know when they go up for jobs and then are always there's always a white man chosen over them and it's always they're always told afterwards oh well you interviewed really well but this other person was just a better fit for our department\nYou know these are extraordinary scientists that I'm Talking about who aren't getting these jobs so it's not that they're not good enough right they're getting the interviews\nI really think that scientists have to start paying closer attention to issues of implicit bias\nAnd interrogating this notion of meritocracy a little bit more and like stop that just really think we need to stop deluding ourselves that everything works out for a reason or that everything is fair and our field 'cause it's not that way in any workplace\nAnd only knowledge that that's when we actually can start to raise them consciousness around it and actually affect change\nCaptain plenty thank you so much for speaking with us thank you\nGathering Clancy use an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Illinois\nOne group is fighting the unwelcome

S. S. the international space station\nFor a year you know as an astronaut your job is to not only applied vehicle and you know operate the hardware fish but it's also should be [noise] you know it's mental subject I think\nIt became a great teachable moment of what is the difference between a gene being president or being expressed\nAnd so obviously the expression of the gene is like the when you read the book of life\nIs what is really active form of genetic code versus just losing a whole page from your book of life which is what kind of some of the headlines looked like for a little while they're really exciting thing though is that we know of a shortlist of genes to keep an eye on for future astronaut that seemed to change when you're up there and and don't go back right away\nYou know if he'd come back a different species of if he went up a man and and and came back a turtle I mean that would have been you know dismaying for his wife I Would I Would think\nYeah yeah he would you know we get a less applicants to the astronaut program\nAnd Christopher Mason thanks very much for speaking with us great thank you my pleasure\nChristopher Mason is an associate professor of genetics in computational biology at Weill Cornell medicine and now a decidedly earth found astronaut reaction to being a lab rat in space\nScott it sounds like a year in some sort of conveying it's are you in a car somewhere\nIn a spaceship going to Mars [laughter] no actually\nI'm In a a I think it's a suburban heading to the island Ga I Wish I was on his racial\n[laughter] now when you came back to earth and you heard about these epigenetic changes what was your reaction to hearing about that stuff\nYeah I don't know you know it's it's something that you know is not symptomatic\nI Can't feel it it's interesting information for me\nAnd what about the telomeres because unlike what normally happens or you know as you get older your telomeres shorten you know did you did you notice that at least that you say wow I feel Twenty years younger or something [noise]\nNo [laughter] no but uh you know I tell them airs apparently in space got better but you know with a couple of months after I got on the\nFactory where they were briefly knocked the fountain of youth\n[laughter] but that's disappointing well finally than Scott you know you come back to earth and at least for a while some of your DNA has been altered did you feel like you didn't have an identical twin during that period\nI Hope so but when I see him impersonate looks somewhat similar may show I guess not\n[laughter] well Scott thanks very much\nAll right take care of\nCaptain Scott Kelly is a former military test pilot and astronaut what fascinates you about this study well I think it's interesting to me simply\nBecause of the immediate applicability\nTo the human exploration of the solar system I mean you know\nWe we we go to Mars we go to the moons of Jupiter we go all over the solar system every night on my TV\nBut one of the big unknowns is how good an idea is that is that going to affect the health of the crew members in ways that we haven't yet learned about so you know this this study bears on that TV show are you watching that travels all over the\nSolar system just about any ... show on the air and there always are plenty of them\nWell it's wild stuff that as we heard the changes the astronaut Scott Kelly's DNA were mostly\nThe story gets even weirder with the suggestion that at the genetic changes can be inherited in other words\nThe consequences of behavior could be passed down to the next generation\nIt's ... days not destiny on big picture science [noise]\n[noise] ... five will remember the Olympic black power salute fifty years later with one of the men who raised his staff John Carlos\nPeople say you sound like you used to run a sound that you still got the fire was the flowers wouldn't me when I came to find new when I left and Joe justice is ... ... all men women and children when the last\nFifty years since the Olympics black power salute today at five on cross currents from KLW needed [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThe results of the NASA twin study are only relevant the astronauts there yet more evidence that everyone's DNA is subject to sometimes dramatic a modification by our environment\nScott Kelly's DNA reverted to his pre flight chemistry when he returned to earth and it's our understanding that epigenetic changes accumulated over a lifetime are erased the Ford genes attached to a new generation\nBut we aren't certain of that research on non human species suggests that at least some of the changes can be passed down\nReporter Carl Zimmer whose latest book is on the science of heredity describes those studies and what the NASA twin studies says and does it say about changes do astronaut Scott Kelly's DNA\nYeah so what is happening in a study like that is that the actual a sequence of letters in Scott's genes is not being rewritten by being in space\nBut when scientists look at his cells before and after and compare them to his brother marks they can see that there are epigenetic differences they can see that the pattern of molecules around his DNA seems to be different in some regards than it was before\nNow in some cases and then maybe it would be in the case of Scott's if some genes are turned on and they're turned off due to environmental factors could those changes in those genes or the activation or the dorm at state of his genes be passed on to another generation\nAh well that is a very big controversy I'm so this is something called a trans generational epigenetic inheritance nice big craze\nPerson or some other species has\nAlters the genetics and theirselves that includes germs cells in other words agents from that that can then produce the next generation and that next generation the idea goes can inherit the epigenetic changes along with the genes\nAnd so there are lots of really good compelling examples in nature that this can indeed happen or they just don't really include humans can you give us an example of how it might happen sure so let's say there's a plant\nAnd mining its own business and it gets attacked by some insects\nSo plants switch on a bunch of genes when they sense this sort of attack and they produce a bunch of chemicals that the hope is quote unquote to drive off the insects or at least sort of minimize their attack\nPlants that experience an attack from insects or or pathogens\nThey will produce seeds and if the when those seeds grow into new plants they will actually respond faster to these kinds of attacks than they would have otherwise like they have a memory yeah\nAnd the same is true of the seeds that you produce from those plants um and so you that seems to go through several generations with plants\nWell here's a blue sky question you're ready actually it's higher than blue skies [laughter] at the [noise]\nThe orbit of the international space station let's say that Scott had fathered a child in space when he was his molecules are undergoing these changes is it possible that anything that has changed in ... we say is DNA did not change but any of these epigenetic factors could have been passed down to this child\nThere's no evidence from humans that it could have and part of that reason for that is that it seems that\nPlant biology and animal biology are very different and the way that epigenetics is controlled in both kinds of organisms is different and so in humans during that process of an embryo developing producing its own eggs or sperm\nA lot of those epigenetic marks that may have accumulated in one's lifetime get stripped away in those cells and then I sort of a baseline set of epigenetic marks or put back in place\nSo in a way it's kind of like a racing memory in every generation that doesn't necessarily totally closed the door I epigenetics in as an a kind of read it in humans there might be other molecules\nThat can also carry this kind of epigenetic inheritance forward and scientists are looking into these and and there are some studies on mice that are really intriguing and really thought provoking and my step closer to humans than plants are they are and so they exactly and so there there are these studies in mice\nThey will not make it to the next generation in that particular case as far as we know now turns out though that nutrition probably affects your DNA and can pass on\nIn some ways that we don't fully understand that it as an example when in the city of St Petersburg during World War two lots of people starved\nAnd actually people came out short for generations after that and there are other examples of this as well that's thought to happen by DNA modification and in fact there's another interesting example I can tell you about which is\nIn Guyana you can actually look at when kids are conceived not when they're born but when they're ... which is nine months before when they're born\nAnd it turns out that kids conceived in the rainy season\nCome out different in height and build than those in the dry season those in the dry season the parents had better nutrition the mom in particular and so the kids come out a little bit healthier in a little bit bigger and it's also the case they have differences in their modify DNA\nSo that as I say nutrition actually does affect the modification of your DNA now exactly how that makes you bigger and healthier we don't understand and that's thought to be able to pass and the next generation's\nLike I said this is astounding because this is this sounds like I don't know ... in evolution this sounds like the stories you know that they believed a two hundred years ago that giraffes just stretch their next a little bit and so baby giraffes have longer next I mean I thought that that was long gone that idea\nWell I I think most of the more permanent things like giraffes probably are genetically controlled or or how much has influenced by ... genetics isn't fully understood but it is fair there are epigenetic in fact most of them don't pass generation or so it's thought we don't fully understand very active area of research\nBut it's pretty clear that epigenetics does affect you I mean you and now it's actually it turns out that believe it or not\nAs you age or DNA modifies as well in fact you can tell how old someone is from the modifications in their DNA\nMy goodness All right well don't look in mind set\nBy the way that does not pass the next generation some modifications in your DNA that are are associated with your age they will not pass on to the next generation that clock reset so when you start out as a baby you are baby\nI think you don't get born it's a it's an old conjure [laughter] no no not at all you know we talk about controlling future generations by modifying DNA I mean this was in ... when the term designer babies and I think a lot of people would go for that if it wasn't too expensive I don't know but this sounds like you could do things by you know just\nTown that I mean is that truly does it go that far\nYeah that's not so clear I mean again it's a very poorly understood area and that's why a lot of people are working on it it's very very clear that the nutrition on other health of a pregnant mom\nHas a huge influence on the unborn fetus so that she pregnant women need to take care of themselves obviously and you're not here how they shouldn't smoke and drink alcohol those are very very ill effects\nNow to what extent they wind up modifying the DNA\nOf the fetus is not so clear but it is very likely that is the case so I Would argue that that's a huge and very important developmental time\nAnd in fact there's an area called preterm birth babies are born to early can have significant health problems and and that often happens because of issues associated with environment so pregnant women who live in poor areas have a much higher incidence of preterm birth\nAnd it's not because they're not necessarily giving good nutrition and such to their kids\nThe child will not develop properly and and maybe get worn early and that does have serious health consequences\nAnd so it's plausible we don't know for sure but it seems very likely that some of that will be up and genetic then those kids that are born earlier could modify DNA that's a little bit different than those of others so environment does have a big effect\nMichael Snyder thanks very much for speaking

R. G.\nWe promised you two stories about genetic research taking place behind airing locked doors one was on the international space\nStation the other in Southern California was visited by reporter Carl Zimmer so one day I went to visit a biologist name Anthony James he works at the University of California Irvine and we went down to the basement\nThen he opens up this door into this small room it closes the door behind them\nAnd we're actually basically in an air lock he turns to an inner door opens that one up and we go into his lab which is an insect Terry ... is a place where he raises thousands of mosquitoes\nLab is abuzz with research because while a mosquito may look non threatening I mean it's small enough to purge on a finger nail no insect species who's been a more efficient killer for one they carry malaria a disease that deal death hundreds of thousands of people a year mostly children\nThe gamble at the University of California Irvine inserted gene into a mosquito that will stop its deadly parasite passenger and then released those genetically modified insects into the wild\nThe gene editing technique CRISPR allows for these precise in rapid edits which when combined with gene drives greatly increases the chances that the genetic modification are inherited again and again\nCarl Zimmer's visit to Anthony James in sectarian was part of the research for his latest book she has her mother's laugh and the powers perversion some potential of heredity it explores among other things out having the power to change genes directly challenges are traditional notions of heredity\nCarl can you describe what it was like to be inside this in sectarian\nWhere the mosquitoes bussing all around you how close did you get to them\nSo you know this is not a place where you're just like in one gigantic cloud of mosquitoes of it it would be very hard to do research and to read these mosquitoes or they're just going around willy nilly they're managed at each stage of their life cycle\nSo when they're when they're larvae um swimming around in water which is what ... does do and so they're in these little Tupperware tubs that are sealed and they're off in their own room and once they have developed into um the adults with wings\nThen they're put in jars where the males and females mate\nAnd then the females than need to drink blood and so they get transferred to of all things these movie popcorn tubs\nWhere James and his colleagues stick this little container of warm blood on top of the lid and then the ... underneath serve sticking their little ah mouth parts through a membrane to to drink the blood so they're alter hang upside down feeding on blood it's quite bizarre it's\nA good luck for the mosquitoes 'cause they get free refills on those town that's right\nThat's right as much blood is you can handle and then and then once they're ready to lay eggs than they are transferred into a dark room because female mosquitoes like to be in the dark when they lay their eggs\nAnd they're put in other jars and then um they lay their eggs there and then they die and the scientists extract these little strips of eggs which they then take to insert DNA into it does have a little creepy factor\nYou know the cow's blood ... yeah oh yeah no there's there there's definitely a creeping as do it but then at the same time you think well

um and it seems to be only in the evenings but maybe that's just when I'm returning home but they don't smell it every day\nHas to do with the wind direction that has to do with the humidity has to do

natural environment in the parks I go to ... homes I said he dogs they're so kind of any place with their dogs could be the cognition lab [noise]\nOkay so it turned out the dog cognition lab was right under my nose [noise] dogs have some of the makings of good scientists they're curious about everything they can't stop collecting data but since dogs don't submit their conclusions about what they smell to referee journals\nDr horribly studies they're sniffing behavior to make inferences about their cognition and what ... they are\nDogs have now been trained detection dogs have now been trained to tell us when they notice all manner of object and\nReally most objects have a smell potentially if you have the equipment to detect it so that is everything from you know explosives detection dogs they're cancer detection dogs their dogs who can detect um bed bugs of course than any other varieties many other varieties of insects\nThere are Scott detection dogs in other words dogs are being used by researchers to\nFind the Scott and the ... of wildlife populations that they're trying to canvas but that are hard to see their diabetes detection dogs can tell when blood sugar is dropping\nSo really you could put their nose in any direction just tell them what it is that you want them to notice and they'll notice it for you\nDogs can detect all manner of objects as you say and how much do they need to detect any just a tiny bit and and and how how low does that that concentration go\nRight they often need only a very little bit so I think it's something on the order of uh Pica Graham a trillion of ground of TNT or other explosive for an explosive detective detection dog to to notice it\nThat's at a far lower threshold that we can detect that we have decent noses but we don't bother to sniff things\nUm that detection threshold is really different depending on the odor and so some objects they really need that minimal amount others they might need more like a millionth of a gram much much more\nI'd like to pick up on something you said of dogs can detect cancer and I understand that they can detect certain kinds of melanoma and you also said diabetes so I Wonder if that suggests that we are emitting something from her skin is it her skin that they're smelling\nA lot of dogs who come in with their owners won't approach the samples\nAnd I think it's because the owners have been spent a lifetime telling that dog not to miss things\nActually when we pull our dog away from the smells we're telling them they're not allowed to you know use that perceptual Oregon and they and they're pretty cooperative it kind of stop using it as much\nAnd it's sad that mean they can learn to use it again right and when they come upon this you know must be like discovering your own superpower\nNow I was amazed to learn that dogs can smell well it's not it's not surprising that they could smell the movement of air through the room but because they can do that you write that they can actually smell the time of day so I'm Wondering if you could tell us the difference between how afternoon in mourning smells\nYeah or what would a dog that I Wish I knew exactly but I think I can almost imagine a little bit it's like the way of seasons have a different smell right we might notice the advent of spring and a lot\nMore is happening when the seasons change than in our living room throughout the day\nWell the temperature of the room changes all day right I think that's what it is it's that air flow through the day is pretty reliable um air rises along the walls as the room is warm and then it kind of hugs the ceiling and then start falling and it kind of crashes into itself\nAnd imagery of this is kind of wonderful like a backwards waterfalls of air going up the walls and then and then crashing down as a waterfall in the middle of the room\nSo I haven't seen an example of how dogs do use this to tell the time of day but we can see that dogs are attuned to odors and different parts of the room at different times of the day so they're presumably marking that day by this air flow this natural Airflow\nI'm so for instance one's own smell in the room will be moved to the side of the room and your accents as the day goes on\nWhen you were going through the self directed experiment on trying to improve your own smelly inability she could smell like your dog um did you ever sit in a room and and try to see if you could smell the different times of day\n[noise] haven't sat in the room the way dogs might send in the room all day and try to smell the difference I don't think I have the acuity for that but I have done other ... and I regularly do other exercises still that\nTry to bring smell and prominently so when I wake up in the morning I Try to smell how late it is you know five if I don't set an alarm so\nWhat six AM versus nine AM that's exactly what you're trying to smell you're trying to smell kind of the war of the day how much of the day is happened there is a smell in a room at a certain time of day and I think you might notice it if it was different\nIt's that type of thing and I also try to figure out if there's anyone in the bed with me and I are dogs sleep with us\nAnd so I have my husband and my cat and two dogs and my son who might be in the bed in the morning and without hearing or seeing anything I Try to\nJust notice by smell if anyone in the bed and sometimes I can do it not not reliably not all the time but that's the type of thing I Try to do to imagine a little bit what it might be like to be that dog\nI assume you've invested in a king size bed of Vegas that you can get yeah Alexandra Horowitz thank you so much for speaking with us my pleasure\nAlexandra Horowitz has a dog

A. L. W. dot O. R. G.\nWhen it comes to our senses we can see as they were why were grateful for our acute vision for our exquisitely sensitive hearing\nThe sense of smell may be number one for a dog but for humans it's often rated as least important it's the dispensable sense and the one that people would be willing to lose if they had to lose one\nTo reconsider our sense of smell is not only better than we think it is more important than we think smell plays a big role in love and even survival and we needed to fully enjoy the taste of food if you're skeptical about that here's an experiment\nA couple of jelly beans different colors they you know are they going to have different flavors\nPut one in your mouth and plug your nose at the same time now bite down on the jelly bean and with your nose ... taste sweetness\nThen release your nostrils and you'll be shocked by the experience of suddenly having the flavor of licorice are lime or bubble gum or whatever the jelly bean as and that's a fantastic way of really illustrate\nOf with what we consume but\nWhat about the role that our sense of smell plays in those other things like love and survival will conduct of neuro scientist Rachel Herz so is it our sense of smell was the first since to evolve\nIt's located in a part of the brain associated with memory and emotion so if you haven't already had the honor maybe it's time to meet your nose it's more than a resting place for your\nGlasses we sometimes read a reference to the extraordinary ability of super smugglers who conduct voter tests and pick out the electable foods should we envied them\nSuper smell or is as far as I Know don't exist there are people who are quote unquote noses and that some people who are in the perfume industry primarily who are very good smell ers and mainly because they had been trained and also because they're paying exceptional attention\nTo what they are smelling and the more attention we pay the more we can actually smell because the more of our brain is being used but the other thing is that we all in fact have a unique nose when it comes to the receptors that are expressed\nWhich means that for some people specific odor as compounds are going to smell somewhat stronger because of the fact they may have more of a specific kind of receptor that's sensitive to those compounds\nAnd for others that's going to smell weaker there's different ones for each person so there may be people who are super smugglers of a specific kind of chemical if that is even true but it isn't the case that there are super smell or is the way they are super tasters I'm super tasters or something different\nBook on a super taster tastes was do you know I as a non super taster can't\nWell you may actually be a super taster so super tasters taste everything more that is to say they get more sweetness and more salty nothing more bitterness especially\nAnd sour and as from a taste that they perceive they also get more creamy ness when they're eating something fatty or you know less like ice cream and more spicy and that's when they're eating hot pepper\nNow what a super taster has actually more taste buds on their time than people who are tasters or non tasters there's three classification so you're either a super taster it tastes are non taster as super tasters have the most taste buds tasters are like in between there sort of the Goldilocks version and the non tasters have the U.S\nLet's get back to our sense of smell then our our nose is actually pretty good at smelling apparently we shouldn't so our noses or it's essential we know it's essential that taste food and to enjoy the rose but you also had written that it's essential for relationships\nWhat we found and other people have as well is that it's especially essential for women in terms of relationships so in terms of the century feature that women find them most attractive and which is most important for them in terms of\nSelecting a lover it actually how a man smells because she can only have a certain number of children in her life span and it's actually not that many so she wants to make sure that the children that she does have are going to
