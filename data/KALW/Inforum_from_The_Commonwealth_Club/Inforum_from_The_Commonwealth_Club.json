discussing her new book good and ... the revolutionary power and women's anger at least you garden principle of the black features latter strategy in partnership director for the national domestic workers alliance and co founder of black lives matter\n[noise]\n\nHey everybody know for real hey everybody [laughter]\nSo hello and welcome to tonight's program with in forum at the commonwealth club I Am ...\nGarza and I'm the principle of the black futures lab I Am the strategy and partnerships director for the national domestic workers alliance and I'm also one of the co creators of the black lives matter global network\n[noise]\nI Am super excited because we are here this evening with Rebecca Traister the author of big girls don't cry the election that changed everything for American women all the single ladies unmarried women and the rise of the independent nation\nAnd all all\nGood and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger tonight we are discussing a topic that has been at the center of the national conversation this year which is women's rage and I just want to say quickly that um it's been a hard couple of\nYears [laughter]\nUm so we're really really really excited to have you here and please everyone give Rebecca warm walk um [noise]\nIt is I\nI just want to say it's such an honor to share the stage with at least you know who is also in the book [laughter] she is one of the most vibrant and nuance voices on women anger power politics I'm quoted in the book so it's a real thrill to be on the stage with the right now\nIt was such an honor actually to be interviewed and be included and I remember that interview and I remember during the interview getting really freaking angry\nSo we're going to do a little bit to night [laughter] um but I wanted to just start off honestly to say this is such a timely conversation\nI like many of you watched a month right of Supreme Court\nNominee deliberations I'm certainly through my fair share of cuss words at the television along with other objects I watched as Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nCourageously I told her story and her experience knowing that she was following in the footsteps of people like professor Anita Hill who also courageously put everything on the line to\nKind of share her experiences in front of a panel of angry white men and moves so we saw that repeated again although there may have been different voices there than there were um in Nineteen Ninety One\nAnd some of the same during wrestling just family\nAnd I also am was incredibly moved\nBecause every time I wanted to throw something at the TV I Would hear screaming coming from the Senate chambers\nAnd somebody screaming I Do not consent somebody screaming all kinds of things right and actually during the boat itself I mean I was sitting there\nBecause as they were going through the vote they kept having to say sergeant and arms clear that chamber because you would hear women screaming this is not okay\nThere's a concentrated effort to control power at the very top\nI'm In a way that will actually work to suppress the power of protesters in my social movements going forward and also to reverse the progress that has been made by century's worth of social and political movements that have\nVia mass action protest electoral activation like civic participation\nUm worked over the course of American history to make this country's slightly better a little bit at a time and now the power that has been challenged by that history once she put in place mechanisms is working to preserve their power\nBy ensuring a court that can reverse\nAll kinds of ... all lots of that progress not just row which has been talked about a lot but further got voting rights got collective bargaining rights they the ability of workers to organize\nUm that that's the big picture of what's going on which has power tightening at the top in reaction I'm In part to the anger coming\nFrom those with less power the thing that I'm so glad that you talked about the protestors because\nEven before there were the allegations of assault I was so moved by the protesters in the original hearings and there's a way in which a political media now they have is though the only challenge that was brought\nTo Kavanaugh came with the with the assault allegations in the protest that happened in in response\nBut in fact I was so moved to the first time and this was you know a few weeks before I was going to publish this book it was I was very worried during the summer that there wasn't active resistance to the cabinet nomination that everybody was going to roll over that the Democrats were going to roll over and\nAnd I think there are very many legitimate ways to to criticize the the Democrats approach to the Kavanaugh nomination\nBut my fear going into September was there's not going to be any challenge to this what I understood to be the stranglehold that a Trump Administration was going to put in place the a lifetime appointment\nAnd so for me the opening day of hearings and Linda is our source was I Believe was the first person to stand up and scream\nAnd then it wasn't just Linda it wasn't just Bob Bland it wasn't just the the next woman or the next room it was this endlessly renewable\nUm raged coming from women who would come into the chamber standup scream be taken out arrested and then more women would come and stand up and scream and that was moving to me even before we got\nTo the assault allegations and the post ... protest that erupted after them\nAnd and for me I Would say especially after the pain of watching the testimony day and watching Christine Blasey Ford half\nTo tell her story within such a narrow range of expression that we all understood she had to stay between these lines that she could not raise your voice that she could not be angry on her own behalf that she could not\nAppear anything other than solicit is polite deferential reasonable science based in order to make her store it in order for her story to be taken seriously and and be heard as credible and then having watched\nBrett Kavanaugh come in and be able to use anger as a rhetorical\nTo bolster his position he could use the snarling bluster and fury to amplify the righteousness of his cause and that is very much in line with what I've been writing about in this book about how the the fury that we take seriously politically in this country has always been a few ...\nTheir fury but when that fury has been aimed at a white patriarchal\nGovernment it is discounted and marginalized and written off as crazy or dangerous um and yet we revere the anger and ... and are trained to reflexively respect and and treated diagnostic the anger of of angry powerful white men\nAnd I'd watch that happen and it was so\nSad to me to watch that and understand that night that that was probably going to work for him that he was going to get to use that weapon and it was going to cement his place for his lifetime on this court that was gonna then exert control over\nSo many bodies in so many lives the most moving point for me was the next day seeing the video\nOf ana Maria Sheila yup and Maria Gallagher in that elevator and they weren't the only ones there are others you know I'm just morale is I'm confronting Ted Cruz and also with my squad [laughter]\nAnd Allison Turk goes a confronting Joe mansion\nAnd there were these activists going the power of seeing those two women in the elevator\nPointing fingers doing a thing that we have been told we're not allowed to do pointing fingers at a powerful white man and ... and demanding you look at me look at me when I tell you the story of my life and my experience in Wyoming this elevator you look at me meet my eyes it was so powerful\nExactly that rhetoric and incredibly powerful anger that is happening in response to some of the symbolic victories of Brock Obama and the inevitable presidency of Hillary Clinton and\nIncluding black lives matter um and yet the actual anger at that time and and anxiety about the impact of that kind of racism and massage and he was downplayed\nThen you have Bernie who was also really terrific at communicating a crucial in righteous anger about economic inequality and he was great it that he and Trump were both able to use their anger\nIn ways that they were applauded for as a political tool right and and they were very good at it\nHillary was both bad at it just or rhetorically not gifted at conveying passion I think you know that it's very hard to divorce\nHer oratorical gift from the kinds of messages that she was probably sent for her entire life is where it gets really complicated always to talk about Hillary\nUm and when she talked to too loudly enter microphone she was accused of being shrill and loud and she was yelling hum but there was another thing internally that then happens\nWhich is that when protesters disrupt both when black lives matter protesters disrupt both Hillary and Bernie they are cast by the political media and by the supporters of those campaigns it's fundamentally disruptive\nRight you screwed up the events like no that's not no they're good on this trust as they are good on that apparently we screwed up the election yeah yeah right right you know what I'm saying yes not the fifty three percent not to fifty three percent\nBut and black lives matter right just checking yeah\nPretty much know what I mean yeah yeah right so that is that's exactly that's like we're in a progressive sphere is not just like\nOh the anger of progressive as the current that is the less powerful the anger of the masses are of the oppressed or the subjugated is the thing that's cast as disruptive within a progressive sphere the anger of the less powerful entity is cast as\nThe problematic force [noise]\nI\nLive in a little bit more because this isn't the first time that anger has been written about\nAnd I was thinking through some of my teachers and mentors and I started thinking about a tree lord course and she wrote a beautiful piece\nCalled the uses of anger where she's really getting into this dialogue about essentially what's getting in the way of us building the kind of movement and together that will be impactful and accountable and effective\nAnd so if I can she says anger expressed and translated into action\nIn the service of our vision and our future is a liberating and strengthening active clarification for it is in the painful process of this translation\nThat we identify who are our allies with whom we have grave differences and who are gentlemen genuine enemies anger is loaded with information and energy when I speak of women of color I Do not only mean black woman\nThe woman of color who was not black who charges me with rendering her invisible by assuming that her struggles with racism or identical with my own\nHas something to tell me that I better learn from\nLess we both waste ourselves fighting the troops between us if I participate knowingly or otherwise in my sister's oppression and she calls me on it to answer her anger with my only blankets the substance of our exchange with reaction it wastes energy and yes it is very difficult\nTo sit still to a standstill\nAnd to listen to another woman's voice delineate an agony I Do not share or one to which\nI myself have contributed so we get into this in the book where essentially yes there was a lot\nAnd on the left and as our kind of teachers have taught us and we cannot separate these dynamics of race and gender right so I guess my question here is what can we learn in this moment two years in right\nI'm about the kinds of alliances that we need to be building how do we move through these dynamics where\nFrankly I'm a feminist\nYou're a feminist but I think for a lot of my crew they're like well I'm not a white feminism is not my thing\nAnd then there's just not a lot of people who know about black Semitism which is literally a it is a clarification of how it ain't feminism if it doesn't include all of us [noise]\n\nHow do we do it well I think that one of the major questions posed by the book is is coalition any better coalition possible and I can't claim to answer that question there are a lot of different voices in the book offering opinions\nI think that Audrey lord vision is one of the more optimistic visions because and and it's one that\nIs echoed by Linda source or who says contentious dialogue is by design that's in the run up to the women's march where so many of the very old angers within a women's movement were brought to the fore because in the literally the days after\nNinety four percent of black women vote for Hillary Clinton and fifty three percent of white women vote for now forty five I'm gonna I'm gonna start doing it too [laughter]\nIn the days after it is white women who suggests a march on Washington and promptly hall at the million woman march which is an appropriation of a demonstration staged and led by black women itself an outgrowth or or or a a response to\nDemonstrate the million Man March and what could be more emblematic of\nSort of failures of taking responsibility and the appropriate the impulse toward appropriation than those dynamics but what happened in in that from those first days in which you saw so much old history and there is so much history it extends back centuries\nOf women of color black women leading the way of doing the the revolutionary thinking and organizing and then being raised within the movement that they've laid the groundwork for and that is a lot of the history of the women's movement extending back to the beginning of time in this country\nAnd so in this moment in the days after this election\nWhich so many white women are truly like horrified furious and traumatized I don't mean to take anything away from the anger and shock that that so many people it's fundamental it's crucial this anger and shock felt by women who had not who had previously not been angry and that way had not seen\nCertain things in the world in that way but what happened in the intervening period was that women from other movements came in women of color they insisted on the ideological tenants and principles of the women's march\nBeing intersection make making clear how impressions are inter locked\nThey made clear that we were going to have the conversation about race there was not going to be a women's march if there was not an open and often very difficult conversation about this kind of oppression and white supremacy within the history of a women's movement there were all kinds of course immediately it was written about as you know is it more divisive is it\nKnow of anger and resentment and inequalities within progressive fears are in every mass movement it is not unique to the women's movement mhm [noise]\nUm and quickly the divisions were used to sort of say oh this is all falling apart well what happened is it was the biggest single one day political protests in this country's history and those millions of women many of whom were very new activism something like a third\nOf them it was the first protest they'd ever attended were they're marching side by side with the domestic workers alongside\nBanners about environmental racism criminal justice and there were some there was contentious dialogue there were\nThere was the famous sign all the all you ... nice white lady that the next black lives matter march right [noise]\nMhm [noise]\nAnd we're still we're still waiting [laughter]\nAnd\nUh you know this is the this is this is I Want to be optimistic but I'm also very keenly aware of my waiting is right the white lady being optimistic about other white lady this is not always persuasive and that's why part of my job\nIs at this point is to actually talk to white women about the history the contacts the power dynamics\nUm because if I Can't just be optimistic that things are going to get better I Do agree with Linda SARS or an Audrey lord that the contentious dialogue and that and the difficult conversations and the anger between\nPotential allies can be deliberate has engendered which is the word that Audrey lord uses that it can produce the stronger movement I think that the ... and\nAnd um differences within a women's movement our strength because it permits us the chance to grow and change with the times and it permits has to be better than we have been in the past [noise] I\nTo do your activism that way by interrupting dinners or by screaming and people in elevators it's so awful that's connected force don't it's not civil it lets people know that there are others who feel the same it let somebody watching on a computer somewhere very far away from Washington DC who is limited and\nAnd upset and sad\nAnd still furious about what's happening and let them hear a voice that reflects that sadness and fury back to them I Know that somebody is yelling at this guy ... ... and make them understand that they're not living in isolation\nThat they are part of a mass anger at the kind of power abuses that we're living with right now mhm there is tremendous value to that incivility but it's just a part of what's happening\nSo let's go the civility thing and let's start moving towards that building power thing\nAnd transforming power because quite frankly it is great to get more women elected it's great to get more folks of color elected but if we're putting people in the same structures that are ultimately not made for our power\nThan we're really just replacing one group of people with another but we're not actually transforming how it works so you said\nTwo things that were fascinating to me in this book and one was\nThis piece around anger and self care is\nSo there was something in here where he said or you interviewed someone who said something to the degree of like folk always want us to move through anger to a thing yeah so you can't just be angry because anger is explosive and it's considered divisive and it's considered to be not\nProductive particularly when it's coming from limits but it's it's a conversation to be had about\nHow it is that we use anger productively ... a how do we keep ourselves from using anger in ways that cuts us off at the knees when we need to be moving together and\nThe other piece of my question frankly is you know with all the rhetoric that I hear every day when I turn on CNN about extremists and mobs and all of that\nThing is there hope for women's anger to finally be seen as what has transformed this country is there hope for that okay [laughter] the the first\nQuestion oh yeah and I'm five minutes till ... so you get your question of any so the first part of that\nAnd it's really fascinating because there is there's so much baggage attached to anger as a divisive confrontational fundamentally poisonous and corrosive force right\nUm I think that women here a lot about a lot more about that about how it poisons us and fundamentally deformed us it makes us unattractive ugly threatening of course the way it's framed depend so much on our race\nAnd class position and power that we have when we voice it but in in almost all women it's discouraged in one way or another in less it's on anger on behalf of a white patriarchy in which case you get Phyllis Schlafly and Susan Collins and you know the women at the Tea Party and the women shaking their fists at kids trying to integrate schools [noise]\nThat kind of women's anger is pretty much the only one that's encouraged by the power structure and its anger that is deployed on behalf of the power structure but otherwise we're told all the time that our anger is explosive and destructive and bad for us physically bad for us um\nAnd I I don't want to pretend that there there are those destructive qualities in anger and part of what we're talking about tonight is how anger between allies can sever\nI Do want to talk about the message that women are never given which is that there are all kinds of positive joy is liberating aspects of anger and some of the poison\nAnd corrosive impact come from being told that we're not to express it\nThat if we express it it's going to be bad for us it is going to make us unattractive and scary and undermined the very project we're so committed to seeing through if we if we start speaking in angry tones and so we hold it in or we redirected in places where it's not really supposed to go\nAnd it can explode it can make it to me I think there there is a very valid argument that to change the way we receive in here and respect women's anger and acknowledge it as politically consequential\nAs part of the force it one of the key forces that has reshaped and transformed this country over centuries\nIf we value it was even a fraction of the value we we offered to white man's angered powerful women's anger it could actually anger could be just an emotion that's integrated in the full range of human expression and rational reaction but the other thing is anger in a political context is connected it's not just divisive\nAnd there are a lot of examples of this one of the places where it was made clear to me it was when I went to Georgia in the summer of twenty Seventeen and talked to some of the newly activated\nSuburban white women who had been politically apathetic had lived in red areas never put a yard sign out because you have voice there sort of private democratic leanings would have been disruptive\nWould have made them unattractive within their communities would have would have caused problems\nUm and then in the wake of the twenty sixteen election we're so mad that they yelled mhm\nAnd then when they yelled they discovered that a woman down the block was also they became audible to each other and then once they realize that there was a woman two doors down who'd felt the same way all this time and that they've been living for decades\nThinking that they were the only ones because they never expressed their dissent then they become became unable to each other and the next thing you know they'd like joined indivisible and we're spending twenty four hours a day knocking on doors not just for you I was there right before the Jon Ossoff\nElection and he lost they had been doing it for other candidates and they have kept doing it since and they're out there right now working for Stacey Abrams and Lucy McBath\nAnd [noise] and\nAre they are politically activated people and it does not mean that there are progressive ism is perfect and that everybody you know but but they are committed in in a new way and part of that was because of that anger bubbled over in a way that that could then draw them together into coalition and the beginnings of organization\nIs part of what does that and I do think we have to stop this development and start crediting it if you look back\nAt the movements that have transformed the nation from abolition suffrage the labor movement the civil rights movement\nThe gay rights movement the women's movement of the Nineteen seventies\nYou will find at the beginning of all those movements women who were angry at injustice and that anger was what spurred them out of their homes out of the domestic sphere into public speaking roles into scholarship into legal work to start fighting cases that we're going to transform the legal system\nInto petitioning for their own freedom you find that at the beginning of all these movements and yet we're never taught to respect women's anger as politically consequential as patriotic\nAs key to the slow process of trying to make this country adjusts a more just place but it is right there it is the under current under all of it\nAnd I think we're not taught it because the power structure fears it because it knows what it can do you know what happened over the past two weeks and and the Republicans out there talking about the angry mobs of screaming animals at the same\nAre they know the power of anger they want their base to be angry\nThey're saying it's qualifying\nAnd they're trying to gin it up on their side they know the power of anger and we should know the power of our anger to I heard that so if your question [noise]\n\nIf you have fights and we want you to\nCome back here to the Mike there's gotta be tons of questions\nPlease high so quick question um two parts so what was what was your most favorite or the most valuable thing that you learned in writing this book and what resources would you suggest that people go to if they want more after your book to learn more great\nQuestion a great question the most surprising thing that I learned well there's actually a particular story which I didn't really know about which is what happened at the stonewall inn\nUm I in you know part of the process of being a journalist a feminist journalist has been learning all kinds of history I was never taught [noise]\nUm and I sort of knew a popular version of\nThe gay rights movement as it erupted out of the stonewall inn on a ... June night and a series of June nights Nineteen sixty nine [noise]\nUm I understood the gay rights movement as a fundamentally a white male white male lead movement and I kind of knew as a footnote in my in my brain that like oh Sylvia Rivera was was it stone wall that night\nAnd I kind of oh and Marcia ... there was like something that was in my head that was like I think it was more complicated than that and I went back and I read and they're all kinds of conflicting reports about what happened at stone wall and so there's not\nThere's not ones that story but a lot of the reports all reflect\nA similar thing which is that two female identifying people of color and a lesbian named stormy to love ya were three of the initial insiders of what became the insurrection at the stonewall inn mhm [noise]\nAnd I'd never heard of ... uh she was a a lesbian of color and she reportedly fought police when they took her out of the bar", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Inforum from The

you I'm I Want to amplify the issues of identity my um my wife identifies as Filipino American as she was an American born Filipino and she lost her connection to her language because she grew up in an era of not just English first but English only\nAnd that is severely limited for sense of self and it's a limited her\nA sense of opportunity to visit the Philippines because she is embarrassed that she doesn't speak a language I'm to drive that point home I I'm just a little bit of Mandarin but that was enough to open up the opportunity for me to travel with my country school to China just recently I just got back at the end of last month\nUm and was able to navigate um I wouldn't have thought to go on a if not for that little access to language so an identity and being able to open up world\nI'm I'm In support of the resolution obviously um because I Do um with the the uh educators at best the FCC\nHave struggled for the last year or last several years rather a around issues of sustainability for that language pathway we've seen since my son was enrolled in kindergarten\nThat were ram flipped from a I'm bilingual by literacy bicultural a pathway to a plus program I'm not

because if we can establish reading verify three thank you\n[noise]\nHello I'm good evening I'm my name's out from Collins and I'm a parent at Francisco middle school and I'm also an active member of a pack\nI wanted to speak about um what\nAre they part presentation and also common we know racism and is is an issue in our country it's an issue in our city and it's obviously an issue in our schools as we see there are some great work going on in our district nonetheless that has been my experience as a parent that black families in other families have had to consistently advocate\nUm to make sure that the district lives up to its vision of culturally safe and supportive schools\nAnd my daughter schools I have had to ask why black children were told to pick up trash in the schoolyard as resorted practices I've had to ask why there are no black or Latino next authors taught in my daughter's English classes I have had to organize with other black families in order to make sure that black history is celebrated in my daughter's schools\nI have had to inform staff at my school that my daughter's peers have joked about the KKK and said black people are stupid within the regular course of their day\nThis year I had to help my Thirteen year old daughter navigate a state wide project\nWhich included the Confederate flag it's the Mississippi flagged by the way I had to help her include important history not taught in the class on the ways that that flag within the flag has been used to promote racial chair and white supremacy that's a lot to a whole\n[noise] with the experiences such as these it's no wonder why black children in slam families sometimes don't show up or do well in our schools\nHow can we say that we as a district are committed to safe and supportive schools when we are committed to addressing racism and bias with educators parents and students when we have an opt in model for addressing racism\nYou're after your organizations like a pack and climbing and individual families like me ask for the district to commit to diverse literature implicit bias and restore to practice training and pre K through Thirteen through twelve ethnic studies at all cites\nFamily should not have to ask for our schools to be culturally safe\nI'm asking the district to hold itself accountable and report instead of just reporting on test scores report which schools engage in anti racist professional development report which schools are actively celebrating black history repeats and take an inventory of disco teachers are teaching and our middle and high school English classes thank you\n[noise] [noise]\nMy name is Julia Roberts from and and I wanted to speak to how troubling\nCriminals report is ensuring that the a disproportionate impact of suspensions on African American families is is white on again\nAnd and it shouldn't really be a surprise to us and we passed a safe in support of schools ordinance but we only implemented it for a brief period of time and when we did implement it we saw that get closer and we saw suspensions going down\nAnd but then we didn't actually continue to implement it and we know that are teachers change from year to year school staff changes from year to year families continue to change when you have consistent implementation from the district\nUm infamous capital of the districts not always implementing the progressive policies that we passed we really soon families step up and say I want to think a pack and for all the work that they've been doing um\nOur school last year and a pack and recite black families met with different principles and\nI'm In our school and in other north side schools and it was one of the first year so that we had black history month celebrated in all of our classrooms and the two things that were really powerful about that was having a family is asking for that on him and also having superintendent Matthews asking questions about\nHey what are we doing this year now so that power of having the district asking questions and measuring what we're doing and having families and advocate at is really powerful\nAnd it's been a huge change for our school and what you even though there's only three percent of our families who are white can still feel like a really white space so we managed to celebrate black history month for the first time in this year we're actually celebrating\nOutlet Latin next History Month and all the various heritage month so it's really opened black families open space for all the diverse families in our schools that have their cultures and history celebrated [noise]\nWe've also seeing that I'm an okay it's headed drastic drop in suspensions they went from being in the middle school with the highest percentage of suspensions to being the lowest and he's a whole community school approach and part of the power that approaches actually using um including students family and staff voices in decision making\nSomeone asked that we do that at the district level and make sure that when a pack makes recommendations we're implementing them in centering them in policies like the student assignment policy and I hope that next year we'll have more than three items crossed off a pack list thank you\n[noise]\nUh I'm my name's Lisa long I have two children and the mission high school like waiters or

transportation to ensure that these opportunities that my daughter really wants to ensure everybody has access to there are some considerations\nFor students who might live in the bay view or other

allow the students who live geographically far to engage in the after school program the after school life that is one of the beautiful things that we laugh about law\nAlso not only for students but for families to be able to come back to school right to engage in all of the parent opportunities that there are as well how can we facilitate\nAnd only make it for certain things depending on their schedule but we take responsibility as a district to support that access as well [noise] finally\nWe also need to support the culture chefs that are necessary as many that we've heard tonight so it's not a question of any student being considered and other who needs to fit in but the average student feels that they belong\nThat the only bad middle school students who return as low graduates say ... is a great place for us we are low [noise]\n\nMy name is Julia Roberts told me and I'm speaking tonight on behalf of the San Francisco families human um and I want to point out that even though

from supporting students that are there now and continue to support students here with them and supporting students right now it's having access to the school [noise]\nNothing stopping little from becoming from being a meat grinder and I know there are folks with ... are working to make sure that it's a more inclusive environment [noise]\n[noise] [noise] I feel like the the conversations that we have in San Francisco take me back to listening to the this American Life the problem we all live with which focused on segregation\nAnd in a call ... pulls out sound from a board meeting a school board meeting in Ferguson where Michael Brown was shot and killed and Darren Wilson was not convicted for his murder [noise]\nAnd their school district had been on food into another district so they accidentally integrated the schools and to hear the white parents comments about that situation and to share the same kinds of comments accurate echoed in San Francisco school board meetings is deeply disheartening\nSo an echo that this um this modest correction as an error that would otherwise exclude students from Willie Brown from having access to a peak courses at Lowell\nI'm absolutely needs to be corrected and it's I feel like it's just the beginning of the conversation it's deeply sad to hear that families are here in opposition thank you\n[noise]\n\nFor a president ... members a super

[laughter] I'm thank you to everyone who came out um\n[noise] so I'm I'm fully supportive of this policy um there's there's a couple of reasons why um [noise] you know the first thing is that if we are in a position where saying it any of our schools that some of our kids can't be successful um then we got a problem and the problem is not with\nWho are qualified to be there um the problem with that is with us then um we have to be able to ensure that all of our students can be successful and we should never be saying that these kids can't make if they're if they're not prepared to be there this is a public school system\nAnd the fact that they would we would be saying that or people would be saying I think is very problematic the other thing to remember that Dan to ban three is not a lower standard um these these are high standards um in fact if you look at what the University of California systems doing if you look at what colleges are doing all over the country this is the direction that they're going it more\nHolistic admissions looking at more factors in just test scores and GPA um we know that um and and not only that but at the University of California actually has a local admissions policy where if you're on the top nine percent of your high school that you are guaranteed to get into a ... or you see\nAnd so these types of policies where you actually ensure more accessibility\nWhere you ensure more diversity where you ensure more opportunity is becoming the standard in\nThe ... at the college level um so the fact that we would somehow be saying that we're lowering standards when in fact colleges do that as a higher standard when you're looking at a greater set of factors and your intentionally focusing on diversity so I actually think it's somebody mentioned that maybe we should have a larger ban two and three maybe we should be looking at that\nAt the middle school level at the elementary school level to help them uh be successful at any high school but in particular mark winning offered a\nProposal for ... instituting a summer bridge program you know several years ago we did is\nSo tonight is really about Enron Lynch a policy we still need to have a more robust discussion about supports for students in the middle grades in elementary school for students success and given the policy change what additional resources might be\nA necessary and so I appreciate that the conflict feedback from both in terms of what they would recommend in terms of those concrete support\nBut I I just wanted to mention and\nLongtime a teacher at law is now retired Joanne Stuart when I mentioned this policy she said I wanted to do those kids I Want it to the kids don't worry about in middle school and I think we had the same sentiment from Marshall tonight so I really do hope\nThose understand that we are trying to make them look nice stronger by being more inclusive and more diverse I Will be supporting the policy thank you [noise]\nStart from others\nI just wanted to take a moment to address I don't assume positive intent and own a soon that um the those have you came here tonight to say just slow down and slow the policy down and\nSend the policy back [noise] that you cut your attempting to come from a positive place but I Want to just take a moment to read the words of Martin Luther king this is from fifty five years ago from his letter from Birmingham jail [noise]\nWe know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor it must be demanded by the oppressed frankly I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was well timed in the view of those who have not\nWho have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation for years now I've heard the word weight\nIt rings in the ear of every negro with piercing familiarity this weight has almost always Mitt never we must come to see with one of our distinguish jurists that justice to last too long delayed is justice denied\n[noise]\nBasically falling out the gang [laughter]\nI Do want to appreciate a everyone that came out the speaking public comment I notice is a very passionate and I'm sure that many people are passionate about [noise]\nI wanted to follow up on a one of the things that are commissioner Hany mentioned about university is moving toward a policy that\nOh we are accepting their permit here is actually was also done in Texas\nOr the University of Texas at Austin and miss the top six percent of students from across the state and imagine Texas may progressive um and so if you're looking for\nResearch based on this is just like this if you do a super simple Google Search you'll you'll find plenty or so\nI Want to be labor the comments I think that my colleagues spoke well for me to not and so there's no other questions broke hobo pleased with Cosco\n\nChairman were voting on both policies to five winter one student's Simon and Gwen twenty point when little admissions Chris\nI'm listening into yes thank you Mr Murray yes Mr Hany yes documentary on the high missing yes Mr Sanchez yes Mr Watson\n\n\n\n... section of public comment on general manners judo a masters\nOr pleased about the public comment as an opportunity for the board to hear from the community or matters within the ... we actually she refrain from using employee a student names\nIf you have a complaint about district employee you may submitted to the employee a supervisor in accordance with district policies that was a reminder for rules of California law do not allow us to respond to comments or attempt to answer questions during public ...\nIf appropriate the superintendent ... acts staff will follow with speakers\n\nSo if you are if you would like to leave this could probably otherwise we will convince the public comment\n\nLost your name is here and then they'll leave a let's see so I have a Ricardo Lopez and when I when I when I asked you noticed we make your way to the

what ... is particular comment\nUm my wife and I have two children and I said if you're a state and we've been done everything from beyond the PTA board to running auction shares to fundraising volunteering in our in two very good but obviously under funded schools because they seem to all be underfunded in California\nUm it is a privilege that I can cause and both my sense is office when leaks who will be presenting this data with me and the privilege of having my principal says here that we can on now for all this good data\n\nSo we want to begin with a first thing that all the data that we are going to present tonight is over three years [noise] so are we back in mind what I Would like to do is show you that she a demographic trained\nAt San Francisco Unified School district approximately ... we have had fifty three thousand students enrolled in the district\nAnd when you look at the demographics vote at through ethnicity and a program lens what we find is that the decline to state um has started to increase more than two percent\nGate the other uh decreases or increases way less than a two percent but that has been a significant increase of more than two percent when nine point two percent of San Francisco's students are with the decline to state um ethnic um background\nAnd interesting fact is that we have more than thirty five hundred students in San Francisco enrolled in chalk this cause and are a pre gay and really meant has increased up to Fifteen for the students this uh last year\n...\nI'm going to turn to Dr Stevens to present the stack yearly and Matt data\n\nOr commissioners what we're looking at as a representation of the aggregate scores on us back for a variety of of ethnicities across the district so to further to the left you'll see that the district to aggregate ... score has risen by from fifty three and fifty four to fifty five percentage points meeting proficiency [noise]\nAre you also see that for some demographic categories there's been a small but steady increase over the last three years um and then a a more significantly also noticed that for some ethnic groups you'll see that or the performance has remained steady or declined\nI'm so this represents in effect a widening of the treatment gap by only a few percentage points but it is still a widening of that gap\nOh you'll notice over to the left in the orange a bar or that we've seen a a different rates of improvements by level or we've experienced almost a three percent increase or for elementary age students taking us back\nA relatively modest growth at the middle school level and approximately a five and a half percent dip at the high school level of this represents only our eleventh grade test takers they're the only group required to take the U.S back each year\nAnd then for African American students the only game that we've seen has been at the elementary level we've seen losses of small losses but still losses middle school and high school level\n[noise] [noise]\nThis ah this is a corresponding sort of results for mathematics and we also see that at the district level we've achieved fifty percent or a again a this was equal to the performance two years ago [noise]\nUm this still has a ten percentage points higher than our largest urban counterpart in San Francisco or you can see there than the demographic breakdown um\nThis thing in this year's results are over on the right hand side another one of the interesting facts about the Sears performance or cohorts with students moving from the sixth or seventh grade made the single largest sort of increases on the U.S back a math proficiency rates compared to other grades are in the district\nUm these increases are also um court or out pacing the corresponding increases at the state level\nOr so to the extent that we're seeing that are entering into middle school and all of the supports that weeping and been putting into middle school makes a difference here is we're showing up\n\nI'm looking at bright spots within the district that many I could almost need each and every school in a talking about some big bright spots this is the fourth year that we have seen the aspect being administered and if you look at the ... consecutive up would trend\nIn fourteen Fifteen to Seventeen Eighteen receipt in schools in English language arts and ... schools\nIn math that have shown an upward trend for or for yours [noise] um and other interesting factors if you look at the California school dash boards criteria for performance\nThe will drank forty percent of schools or fought the schools as um high to very high status\nIn performance in both gone daddy as yearly and Matt\nSo again the schools are\nHigh to very high content that is a within these schools nine are that are nine schools that have a proficiency of eight of above Seventy five percent in both gone daddy as which means Seventy five percent of the students a meeting or exceeding grade level standards\n\nOr how do we compare to other districts across California these large urban districts across California or by lodge I mean having more than fifty thousand students enrolled\nAnd you can see that we are the only one that has maintained at the above fifty percent proficiency rates in both math and English language arts over the last three years however when we take the same districts and we tried to look at them for African American students\nWe had the second lowest in performance\n[noise] eat every designations as if us these e as the designation rate has been moving slightly a void ... however the state treat is two percent student higher than our rates\nAnd the gap in that he designation rates between Asian and Latino students is increasing\nThat are also a as you can see some bright spots in schools where you can or the district street that red daddy designation rate was uh twenty five percent or more um\nAcross that and the e as students um be designation and eight of those schools are listed above along with him but emphasis that he designation grades\n[noise] I'm going to turn it over now to this than to send to talk about the high school indicate that\nEvening commissioners thank you return\nPleasure to present with you um when we start talking about high school measures that we want to first look at high school reading this as an opener and if you'll remember high school reading this is something that we developed with other core districts and the indicators of high school reading this which are on the right side of the five or ... if\nThan two point five or above they have no these are efforts in English language arts or mathematics they have a daily attendance rates of Ninety six percent and they were not suspended in during the school year\nThe good news that we see with the citizen twenty Fifteen sixteen we saw one thousand eight hundred and Thirteen students come out of eighth grade that met these high school readiness criteria\nYou also remember that simultaneously we have developed on tracking off track measures for our students and of that one thousand eight hundred and Thirteen students NSF USC that met the criterion Fifteen sixteen\nI'm we now see the eighty three percent of those students are on track to graduate this year [noise]\nAnother measure that we looked at is the cohort graduation rate\nAnd we the stages release the most recent graduation rate for twenty sixteen\nSeventeen should be noted that this year the state adjusted the Cold War graduation rate calculation which resulted in not only our district and the other districts and the states um and and throughout the state or drop from about one to three percent\nIt was a slight adjustment and the calculation\nI'm so any increases that we uh we would know this year that factor should be considered\nI'm as if you see the sixteen Seventeen cohort graduation rate was eighty four points four percent\nThe really good news that we should celebrate as a district\nThat are African American graduation rate continued on the upward trajectory even with the adjustment um with the remember the one to three percent adjustment and the African American graduation rate was Seventy seven percent which is continuing to narrow the gap\n\nThank you so much I'm Kevin is not your today but he has already presented this previously a this is the chronic absenteeism and suspension rates which you can see\nGoing up [noise] um [noise] and", "show_name": "Inforum from The Commonwealth Club", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco",

C. hammer and tonight I had the pleasure of being in conversation with gray\nAnd it is a pleasure by the way I Am twenty four team during the midst of all the brutality unrest the re rose to national prominence in our stop right there and let's give him another hand [noise]\nBefore\nWe have been let me just say it's an honor to be on the stage with M. C. M. sees a friend and a legend\nI did read here\nHe is even colder than you want them to be I'm excited for him they say histories than I Do and it really is an honor to all of you came out tonight\n[noise] thank you thank you I'm a\nI don't think I'd rather be anywhere else so this is this something you know life is a a a journey and certain things you want to make sure that you were a\nBit your voice was heard you were not silence and if you were a counted in the moment so I'm as you know I express myself I'm going to pass 'em your work and what you've done in your courage has been very important to us or I wouldn't want to be any place else tonight\nOn with that being said I Do want to say a\nCouple of words are that are on board for people to understand uh one of the word brutality and when you look toward brutality up\nThe definition is defined as Savage physical violence in great cruelty\nSo I'm anybody wonder or who has\nA any misgivings a misunderstanding of what this is all about\nUm this is about voices crying out saying that uh we don't want to be brutal lives and I think if you listen to that definition you get a better understanding this is this is about people standing up saying hey I Am I'm a I'm a human being\nI'm a person a family man woman and a brutality just doesn't fit with uh\nWith my person in or um\nMy beliefs and then the second thing is injustice which\nReally are casually the same things cruelty ... repression exploitation bias prejudice discrimination and intolerance\nSo would that being like the foundation of uh this this great conversation and we're only going to have about forty minutes or to really get into it um I just wanted to leave that as as a foundation and then jump into things and also say that we want to have a\nUh about Fifteen or twenty minutes McEwen a at the end of this and a maybe a little more\nMaybe a little more maybe that All right\n\nDo I want to jump right into and and again I Want I Want to thank you for the book the book is substance a and there's so many things out there today that are not substance I'm I I told you you don't it back to if I were to actually teach from the book\nThe book can be taught for years income it would take time because obviously I'm\nYou were very meticulous and your thoughts on what you wanted to communicate with this book so I Want everybody to know that if you don't have the book or you know some people who don't have the book go out and get the book because it it will enlighten you in so many uh aspects it\nIt really will he found literally will believe that [noise]\nYou you know but a lot of people don't read and uh also uh with\nUm the way news and information is fair to us is always a leaning in one direction or the other so and and you talk about truth a lot in the book you talk about truth and so people can't really properly to buy or disseminate truth\nIf you I'm really dive into the book you you'll get a better understanding of it is true of the truth of this struggle and the truth of things that led to protests\nAnd I look for books like that I look for books um that can um to give more fuel to the conversation and put it in proper context and this with the book does and with that being said or ... or do you want to ask you\nThis is this protest is the work of hope protests at its core is telling the truth and public\nIt is the confrontation and disruption rooted in the acknowledgement of a future that has not yet come but that is possible to work at hand is hope we're so you describe it is hope or tell us more about\n[noise] yeah I think about um you know people talk about truth and reconciliation all the time and don't want to acknowledge it the truth has to come before the reconciliation right\nAnd that when we think about this record that we would tell the truth is our bodies we sit in the street to say that we don't know everything but we don't like to be alive today that was like what we felt confident in that was a well kept us in the street every night\nAnd like when I think about the work of hope hope is that belief that out tomorrow can be better not today's hope when king says it the more of the universe bends towards the justice that's about faith and belief in things and see when\nWe say that the ... because the people that that is a statement about hope\nI think about why people on the street people running for office all that to me is hope ark and like I'm obsessed with that like what does that mean\nHad to be committed to this and I think about the work of telling the truth is like sometimes the uncomfortable work but the important work I you know I was at this um\nThis is not a humble bragging I just want to provide the contacts [laughter] how was that um I was at miss Tina's party beyond his mom and\nThere was a [laughter] like uh the\nIs important I meant that she has its wearable our party every year and so we have to like where art so I'm going I'm ran this like plastic coat thing that has for quote doing it and one of the or has for facts one factor all true is that uh we're as more people for we'd all island crimes combined\nA that one in five black men in Florida can vote that is true and then one of them was that white high school dropouts have more wealth than all black college graduates which is true\nSo this guy walks up to me he's like is that true and he's a white record exec in like a major place 'cause this is the party so he is like is that true and I go faster and he was like well during the reason why people have more wealth is that they're more white people\nAnd I'm like you know like right this party is I Can't like flip out so I'm just like [laughter] I'm like oh that's really interesting and I'm like [noise]\n'cause like what else do you say you know so I'm like you know the only reason they're more white people because you kill half the people in and slave the other half an hour [laughter] he is like ... like he's like I don't know and I'm like this isn't something that you get to not know write like that just happened [noise]\nBut it's just a vote when I think about that in the Congress as question it's like the truth about wealth is that we gave people wealth right we did we just gave we gave people how this\nWas ... percent loans for a long time we gave them free education like we gave it to them and when you think about people of color and poor people all of a sudden nobody has any imagination they're like we don't know what to do it's like we already do it right like\nWe did it once before and Mike I'm obsessed with that then like if we can rewrite the tax code and the backup paper towels and napkins and scrap paper then like we can actually do all of this and a generation that this doesn't have to be a five hundred years solution of six hundred your solution they literally\nThat can be like you really rooted in a\nMoment when I think about hope hope to me as a few of my faith is tied to test it often do I think it's necessarily gonna change but do I think it can change I Do and I know that are only get their when their people like imagining a different world like fighting for something they haven't seen before that to me as a homework\nWhile that now if that was a lot to consume from that small question so\n[noise]\nNow don't worry we got it all [noise] yeah\nAnd it was a it was entertaining at the same time but that's the old style you you you bring a lotta substance and then you give us a little laughter what does that make the medicine go down a little bit better but it's still strong medicine I'm ...\nBefore he asked that question we were together at a disadvantage [laughter] and um he no these are the lights on glasses he normally where Dr thing [laughter]\nExactly right exactly right so we're together and somebody like you know do they like to re so good to meet you and I'm like what you mean my friend M. C. and I just I introduce some kind of [laughter] San jose hammer cars that gives it away [laughter] I'm like [laughter] see and that brings in little I Wish I had videotaped her she's like Oh hi Mr him see and then she's like empty [laughter]\nEvery every time they see the lights and glasses you know it's ... it's really\nAnd there's so many people today who like literally can't think about collective action outside of organizations and like you can be a member of things during the chapter is something that's fine too but that's not the only way that you can make a difference and I think\nBest peanut butter and jelly sandwich maker you've ever seen I made like amazing sandwiches I was like what we did in somebody's cautious kitchen we like made a ton of sandwiches and like people forget those stories UC UC events like this and you don't see me sleeping on the side of the road like MS Margaret house on this\nReally special air mattress with the cat walking all everywhere you know like you didn't see those those are the stories that I Try and lift up in that chapter of like all the people that had been forgotten along the way but if not for them there is no movement mama cat that was a woman who made dinner for protestors like Sunday nights\nAnd that would be the only meal that a lot of people got like we'd be out for like seven PM like for I Am you know and nothing would be open because they were afraid of the protesters so like at midnight if you're hungry it's like where did you go and like people stepped up you know there were people who like\nThey'll bring up the grill and they would like grill hotdogs or hamburgers ... it was so much community and like those things had been forgotten but we remember them because we were there and I wanted to use the book as a way to bring those stories back\nOr it's fantastic and ... ... ... and actually you you you told them a great version of it there but in the book is even more powerful um and actually want to quote\nUnquote it from the book because it was a real\n... from the book [laughter]\nSo years before any of us would take the streets of calls for verse affirming his important\nIn August mark is Anthony hunter or gay black man and now the chair of African American studies at UCLA he was studying black migration as a professor who studies he was thinking of ways of challenging students and others to think about blackness\nAs defined not only by skin color but also by our relationship to in a way from power and to realize that we when we consider blackness Annette since we find that most\nPeople are politically black as that's real heavy for for us to even consider our relationship to power in a way from power and and and I think when you do look at it that way ... more people would consider themselves politically\nThey have a better understanding what it is to be politically you know black from that from that perspective\nAnd he you know that somebody should do a whole piece on markets hunter like they should people should write about him you know I talked to him and he was like\nHe was like when you look at how cities have been formed like the what black people they've determined almost everything like where black people chose to go where they were excluded from\nLike where they died like that with like a the ... that actually has a defining part of how America became America so he was like well he treated black lives matter he was saying like that there is no he was a different version of there is no America without black people because he said like what black people did and how their bodies move like reshaped American ... ways\nAnd it was interesting because he has just been forgotten in the larger narrative about both the movement about the hash tag about like how we talk about this the right place and I wanted to use the book is a way to re surface that\nGood good this is good because again on the narrative got hijacked and the narrative got the the hash tag got hijacked so well when you say black lives matter and ... I mean depending on who you're talking to it means a totally different thing for some people a wall go up immediately\nThe black lives matter Black Panthers I just say Black Panthers the black lives\nMatter black lives matter\nWhere the guns that I didn't say anything about violence as a matter of fact the only thing I spoke about violence was again is when we started this conversation or said brutality and I've defined what brutality is and\nBlack lives matter to me means I don't want to be brutalized black lives matter to you for some reason means Black Panthers and even met narrative got hijacked but that will be a different conversation but it means without substance\nI'm all these other things that are that come from I don't know ah again people's ability to hijack the narrative but it certainly is not what the origin of what black lives\nMatter is and was in to this point and again in in the book you are is is very well stated overtime and we're talking about markets are Anthony hunter UCLA overtime he had come to an awareness\nOf an irrefutable truth that black migration and movement is the defining characteristics of growth in cities and\nAlways has been that what black lives choose to do matters significantly listen very closely in on August twenty twenty twelve he fired off a tweet check out these amazing articles by gene twenty three Bain and all the mores\nNew ad of context magazine hash\nTag black lives matter he was explaining about the power of the migration and influence and if that black people have and that was the origin of black lives matter and a at a later time and you could expound more about this but during focusing which um\nI was there I mean the your jacket so that\nMeans [laughter] vest [laughter]\nI just see the best but uh I ran into a lot of people there were a information and I like the I like the analogy and the reason why I'm huge huge change from hashtags frozen over to ... black black lives matter talk about\nYou remember in the early days like we were all treating has hurt us and that was like what we did that was like what we treated and has like Mike brown but it was but Ferguson sort of took off\nAnd what was happening though is that the trolls were like also starting to flood aspect Ferguson and we just couldn't all of a sudden it stopped being like a a powerful way for us to to organize which was actually really hard\nAnd then there were people who came down with a sign that said by husband I remember we couldn't stand still so like we were really making a lot of signs and stuff 'cause like we couldn't stay in stone who wants to like lugging around assigned as you're like walking down the street\nSo it's really a lot of people who came to visit like they were bringing a lot of times and we would like that's great 'cause like we didn't have you know to make assigned you have to be still and like we can do\nSo people bring signs and there are a lot of times and then with the has had black lives matter and we I remember the days and we just started to read it out and it became you know we think about hashtags is really great ... paper clips for conversations and it became like a really do paper clip and it blew up and like that was a big deal what was interesting about St Louis though is that\nLike we had such a great tunnel vision you know like being in the street it's like I have an eight hundred falls on the protest started I'd like ten dollars and fifty thousand a hundred thousand but the reality of it in St Louis I had the same amount of influence as I had at five thousand that I did have five hundred thousand because we were like so sort of just television and what was in front of us\nIt wasn't until I like travelling I sat in St Louis and I realized that like everybody across the country had been watching everything that we had been doing\nA and when I look back on Twitter and makes me I'm a little sad now because people are like trying to get they they wanna be famous and why be miserable on the platforms and like we just didn't even we didn't even know that was happening because when you think about St Louis they you know Mike Brown's name but the police killed nine people right after my round they killed ... nine days later you know it's like\nIt just happened over and over and over in St Louis\nAnd I write about some of the data in the book is in St Louis St Louis is the St Louis region has the highest rate of police violence in the country\nSo that could actually makes sense that the protests started an originated there but it was really wild to think back and I remember I Would go to other places and people have like watching a live stream and like we used to ... you know we knew the police are watching a live stream 'cause we saw them watch it\nBut we didn't know like other people were I remember being one of the ...\nHe just wasn't in the car and we said we were staying in my car and like we could see the live stream like on his police car like\nComputer you know it was like you were watching us and we knew those people watch it we had no clue that like the world was watching in the way it was which has been interesting the last thing I say about social media is I've seen the good and bad of it right like the first person ever permanently banned from Twitter was banned for trying to raise money to give me killed so that was not cool\nAnd then I've seen the really cool part three I've seen people come together and build community\nThat guy actually has a White House press credentials which is wild like outside name come up with like why is he not gone somewhere but he's still around which is not fun and I see some of my friends from Twitter yeah Sam Hi guys\nYou just you you brought up a subject discovered extensively in her um as well which is the relationship between the community and police and\nAnd this is a specific paragraph here we said what we quickly realized is that the federal government could tell you how many inches of rainfall there was in rural Missouri area in the Eighteen hundreds\nBut it could not provide reliable statistics on the number of people that police killed last year let alone all the other forms of police fathers impacting communities around this time or you had a gentleman uh the joined you joined organization Sam Sam we love\nA young a policy expert and data scientist in San Francisco or he reached out via Twitter about what's an interesting proposal\nHe'd been engaged in policy and thought he had an a and thought he had been with us in a in although we had been with you industries verbs and he knew that if the protests were ever to have a impact\nThat they would need data informed data set of demands that yet to emerge and so he he wanted to introduce utilizing I'm\nPolice violence is so prevalent in black community that the majority of black youth have either personally experienced a witness police violence in their lives\nAnd there was no accountability for this violence in Ninety seven percent of all police killings the criminal justice system does not charge officers with any crimes and in Ninety nine percent of the cases the officer is not convicted so\nThose numbers are what they are those facts are what they are the facts and prove they just don't stand on a stand on their own\nMerit and it's not it's not anybody specifically pointing to a specific person we just pointing to a specific reality it's just reality and who wouldn't want\nTo I'm On a very personal level\nWho wouldn't want to be next to somebody any human being who wouldn't want to say hey man I don't want you to kill my children I don't want you to be my kids\nI don't want you to take my sons and daughters and put them in jail I couldn't hang out with a person who didn't want to ... wouldn't want to protect their own family and their greater family in any aspect of that or from any aspect of that and so those are the numbers\nThat we're dealing with the reality that we're dealing with nobody has said every police you meet as a bad person nobody is said there were talking about an institution and we're talking about facts and and we want to rectify and fix the facts and take away a\nYou have a quote in the book or the bad apple whatever the case is or if the whole ... ...\n... it's like not a bad apple that barrel [laughter] here like the bad apple whatever the case is I'm I'm ... around like the unarmed is really interesting is that like life who actually more likely to be an armed and not threatening which is interesting like that it's like not the public near that\nPeople also sort of do the like all communities are dangerous thing\nAnd therefore after three is a dangerous and the police have to be there and because of police are there there's obviously like a spike and police found and the date actually doesn't show that either that there is no relationship between community around some police found in some places very\nHigh rates of community bounds of extremely low rates of police found and vice versa so that was interesting for us in like an but that is in the book I'm In that chapter but\nWhen I think about the book in general it is like if some of the protest some other police and then there are two essays\nI write about my mother for the first time I'm a mother left when I was three came back when I was thirty and I read on being gay and I've never written a you know I've treated not being gay and lord knows I've done a lot of interviews are being gay but I've never written about it\nAnd wait a minute ... you do any\nOf 'em [laughter]\nEver see the guys [laughter]\nWow [laughter] find things new out every\nDay because I Am because I wanted to make sure that you don't mind for that we Chavez hold people in all of these rooms you know and like there was no way for me so that after about Jones was my mother is called um\n[noise] I can remember now the sadness\nBecause she left when I was three I'm thirty three she came back when I was thirty our house burned down we were in fourth grade so and there's no there's no nothing about all of us together like there's no toy there's no blanket there's no photo there's no it just doesn't exist\nSo like three years ago me and my father's sister em I'm Joan took the only photo we have each other like of all four of us in one room which is sort of wild so right about her\nAnd I read about that um because\nHe is president Everytime I show up with other people that like if she can leave us and it feels like anybody could leave and that you know I've had a hard this has been like a heart for days and the other day I woke up and I just wanted a mother you know it's like angry at her for the first time in a long time but you can I just wanted to know that there was a place I Love live to and like\nShe's gone she is she's she's alive but wasn't a mother [noise]\nUm and then I write out being gay and like when does it mean to be gay and then move man like how do I think about this idea of not coming out of the closet coming out of the quiet out which is a treat than I did a long time ago that I turned into an essay\nIt wasn't that I didn't believe in God but that I Believe in storm more\nStolen from the X. men men seem somewhat more related to me than a Jesus died for my sins and rose again I went to church because I had to church was about more than God to me or whether it was not about guys so much as it was about the other things it was the change the rhythm of blackness in one room all of us focusing\nOn something other than a are paying for a moment\nAccent for relief from a power greater than our own able to cry\nAnd dance and sing and laugh at them and feel free\nIt was this feeling of freedom that I most remember from church that's what he taught me\nThat that could be moments in this world when black people could come together and feel and unguarded joy when we could be given and we could share a happiness they could take us through the next week until we needed the next dose next Sunday\nBut my father to him church was holy he often credits his recovery from drug addiction as being possible only because of his relationship with God\nA power greater than himself to even thought that he might have been called to be a preacher one of the memories that I'll never forgives watching him preach about Jesus is\nCrowned with on on the calls but for me ... was a place I went because I had to go [laughter]\nI Will say this is only the second time I've heard somebody else where you from the book [laughter] and I'm I'm like I like that you know it's funny [laughter]\nUh [laughter] um and that type of this call I was raised by magic right yeah\nWell I just want I just want to see a a a find all of that there's not enough time that we can have some great conversation about all of that and we will about all of it um I I Do want to I I Do want to um include this it really goes along with you were talking about the second goal but freedom is not only the absence of oppression\nBuddy there's also the presence of justice and joy\nWe have never seen a world of equity justice enjoy we're trying to create something altogether new and it is impossible to create something new in the absence of how I Would even go as far as to say that many would decry hope\nThe loudest could eventually be the most hopeful among because I Know I I think that a little differently but many who decry it the most\nCan be the most hopeful among us\nThey are doing the work of whole deconstructing our current realities but they are afraid that they may feel so they hesitate to bill or they fear that the world won't get done what would you say what we what were you trying to say you in a specific point\nTwo things one is about the so that's after I was raised our magic I'm I'm obsessed with\nI was trying to think about where did I learn good and bad and like good and evil and it was in church it was like it was storm it was like the X. men told me so much and\nWhen I think about story if you remember the cartoons that storm would like show up first she like rather than as a life that you know the lightning bolts rain something and then she would like always step back a little bit and like the team that come in and I learned so much about like what do they mean to have power and restraint like what do they mean to be a part of a team of all great people like\nStorm taught me all those I write about um I write about Mario car is that if you\nIt's a number one the less power ups you get like you just don't need the help we're close to the number one and like the for the young ... twelve you'll get everything you can get you know it's like a lightning bolt I read I read shell agreed say like you can at all and like that taught me about like well I what you get when you need and like\nSo right about that like this idea of like we learn these things in many places and those are all valid and like church taught me some things that taught me to sort of freedom enjoy it didn't teach me good and evil I learned that stuff much later from church but like storm taught me so much\nAnd the second piece this idea of sort of the people who are afraid to open and like what that looks like\nIs that you didn't hear people asking all the time I wasn't as being the right and left in terms of messaging wiser right so good at messaging and it's not the right is actually good at messaging is it the right to have a different a different job is that\nThe right is engaged and recall in memory they're trying to take us back and they're using like nostalgic images to like reinforce his idea that we've already survive once before\nWith the left we're always engage them make believe like everything we want and something we never seen before so when you think about like\nFree health care you've never seen that like the best you can do is make it up for the person next to you like you've never seen it before my bar as always if I Can't explain it to my aunt and it doesn't work\nAnd not the amicus dumb because she is not but she's not sitting in front of the TV all day so like when I'm Talking to her about Cavanaugh I'm not entering from a space of roe v way because like she just is it ... like she believes in a woman's right to choose a row the way it is not the place for me to get her there so\nWhen I call on me I'm like I mean you know they hide in the papers he like they had the papers I'm like are they [laughter]\nBecause [laughter] the entrance right and like I can get her and she's like they had to pay was around like they can either [laughter] and I'm like and they trying to take away people's rights that you see things and they take that and I'm like yeah I think [laughter] but like I say that because\nLike so much of this work is like how do we create interested in the ... people and like how do we help them think about a world that just isn't this one of them but a world that they deserve so what does it mean to say that people\nLike you know should every kid like learn how to read and write and it's like people were like yeah since I went to school looked like where every kid can read and write and it's like [noise]\nLike getting people to start to like exercise those muscles of imagination that is all that we are engaged

did not feel like my peers and I are learning everything we need to be\nAn active participant in democracy many students feel that things like more robots to political science classes and education around climate and social justice issues are necessary how might you address this pardon\nMy you know my daughter went to Harvey Milk 'em and\nHad a really big social justice bend to it as you can tell 'em and that coupled with her parents um activism a made her kind of like super activist for a long time and\nAcross the entire school system it would be wonderful if we could bring social justice and political science and all those lower classes\nI have political science and high school I had a I had a political science class in high school and I had\nI have a best time ever in it I Would love to have that happen\nAcross the district um and it would be amazing if we can bring it and really bring it to everybody across the district not just Fifteen schools um so that's really where I Would really love to see that happen\nAnd I have I have\nI have lots of plans for this I think that we could bring a lot of really good education to parents and students and everyone involved in the school district if we really really work\nTogether as an entire district not just one or two schools [noise]\nThank you [noise] ... question for you [noise]\nThere is no standardization or central a website for school tours where shadow opportunities and this seems inequitable what would you suggest or how would you improve access to a school site visits and information\n\nAnd so there isn't a separate website uh but there are different pages for each school and they're not sufficient they don't have all the just super practical information that working families need to have when they're making school choice so\nI'm so one thing I Would do is improved a site so that there was perhaps a video that can help people get a sense of the field for the school also\nPractical information about the rich enrichment programs that are available at each school and basic information about before and after care and what the cost of that is because those are the fundamental things that we need to know\nA language accessibility on each page is important\nBut more than that as some people referenced before I think we really need to invest in building and romance and retaining students and it's more than a website it's taking it to the streets it's you know when I go to Sunday streets with my two boys\nI see charter schools and they see private schools have tense and we should be going into communities and really telling that successful exciting stories about our schools to get them curious about a Roman\n[noise] thank you so much um [noise] I mean yeah next question for you and there have been a couple of\nQuestions about this so I'm In a sort of combine them into the um some of the public middle schools in some ... private middle schools\nHave an off in a way a policy for cell phones during school hours um a lot of questions out there about cell phone use in schools especially middle schools um so what kind of policy would you support\nA for middle school specifically regarding the implementation of of cell phones during the school day\nSo I is that the salt tears and students hot recently at a ... middle school and mission high school and I would say from the lens on being at mission that\nWe need to have a consistent and strict ourselves on policy\nNow there are times that in the science classroom for example you might actually use her phone for timers as timers\nBut those are those are monitored we have so much on monitored use and it's really easy you know in in any school setting for kids to kind of slipping under their tables and for where I could sit at various parts in the classroom I I could observe that the teachers and the Paris cannot always catch that\nWe need to have like a shoe pocket or something you have some way so we\nI'm In often\nThank you belong to ask you the same question what what are your thoughts about cell phone policies and specifically in middle schools um but if you have thoughts just in general for the district\nSo I'm Muslims in middle school and we had to get them a new phone and he didn't her for a week\nA week we had the most conversations over I was his best friend and I was like I should just not even get this could have phone anymore\nUm but it's a problem of therapists right and I really do think you're going to see a movie or some you know something around a technology and disorders\nOr especially around us cell phones are now we're for mobile crisis and we've gotten calls from parents who have been attacked by their kids we're talking with their cellphones right so it's an issue right some issue has become a mental health issue as well right\nAnd so we do need a stricter policies around or what is healthy use of cell phones and not only do our kids need to be educated about it but parents do to write him a in a slow to our school stuff [noise]\nUm how are we going to do we have to come together collectively and figure out ways to do it with the professionals we may have to drop in the field and see what\nThey may be able to suggest ah but I Do think it's an issue and we do need addressing\nThank you next question from Michelle I'm not going to have you go last again [laughter] sorry [laughter] um let's uh Michelle and mia M.\nVaping has become a huge issue um in schools whether it's high schools or or even middle schools um what are your thoughts about a prevention efforts to reduce\nThe use of a\nTobacco products and and other devices like that\nOh boy [noise] um [noise] well let's see there's I think a couple of things and\nWe need to have robots discussions about this in our high school health um classes which I Know are to an extent happening I've had kids my kids have been in high school and I have heard about those discussions that we have to be starting earlier because we all know that that starting earlier so that needs to be happening in the earliest elementary school and and\nAnd actually a big part of this I think it's educating the parents and teachers because yeah I like no idea what vaping was like a year ago\nSo we um we need to make sure that parents and teachers understand what the risks are and how to identify that that might be happening on the other thing is um we have to you know I was a big supporter of ah you know against the big tobacco efforts that we've had\n'em here and so that they are not marketing to our young people and we have to all unite around causes like that\nOn so that there is there is less risk because we know that they also were targeting on disproportionately students of color and um and we have a responsibility to support and protect our young\nPeople thinking man\nThe sense of very important issue that you know\nTwenty years ago Thirty years ago the tobacco industry was you know targeting young people in different ways I and now they're using how called vaping as\nUm and discouraging people from drinking water so um you know I worked as a structure a transitional edgy of San Francisco I worked with various community groups to I\nHave young people educate their peers on the harmful effects of the tobacco notches cigarettes but tobacco because uh we can see that when they're using things like you know cookies and cream flavored vaping it can be misleading and you don't know ah\nWhat you're getting into and then you you know have all these harmful house side effects so I think first of all I Would want to work with our wellness center is work with pure resources to really have youth designing their own ads to combat or be big budget ads\nUm and yeah I I think they have the answers\nThank you um I just got hit an update there was an an an additional questions from one of the sponsors um that has been added so I'm going to insert this one here and we'll have this be for a leader and Monica\nAnd it's from the um SF Educational Fund African American and Latino kids across our district or not doing well academically what is your plan to deal with this what ideas do you have around closing the achievement gap while keeping students at the center\nAll right ah I said Alina and Monica ... All right\nUm well this is exactly why I'm running I'm unfortunately I've seen first hand how um my children have different expectations I'm set by teachers then we're set 'em for me as a child growing up I'm not all\nI've also seen some great role models for my kids um\nI think a lot of it starts with getting more teachers of color into the classroom um\nWe've already talked about implicit bias I think that's a huge part of it building capacity and it's not just enough to send one person from school say off to a training about something as serious as implicit bias\nThe parents and students could kinda\nThey're uncertain at this point what the process was in identifying the you know how the school relocation was going to happen\nYou're listening to K. A. L. W. Ninety One point seven at San Francisco I'm K. A. L. W. education reporter Lee Romney this is a public forum that took place on Monday October Fifteen\nAt Ruth a sell off all of the art\nThat involves Thirteen of the Nineteen qualified candidates running for the three available the on the San Francisco Unified School district board of education\nFrancisco Chronicle education reporter Jill Tucker is the moderator you can find this entire recording at K. A. L. W. dot or that's also where you could find information about Nineteen candidates for the San Francisco Unified School district for\nNow let's return to the forum\nThank you so much um I like this question because it comes from a fourth grader so I Love kids when they ask questions I'm so let's go with Michelle and the question is um this is a a student who is very interested in math\nAnd she wants to know if there's going to be enough differentiation which he spoke correctly [noise]\nFor her to learn interesting math and and I think this goes to perhaps a little into the question of uh\nBringing algebra back to the eighth grade and and how to engage students um in math and how to differentiate math at all grades including fourth grade sums up student\nThank you for asking that question and I certainly hope so one of the one of the main tenants of of why I'm running as to making sure that we're meeting all students where they are and that we're providing the challenges and the opportunities for them that they need to be successful and if you are interested in math absolutely I Want to make sure you have all those opportunities\nAnd we do need to support our students to our teachers to be able to differentiate in their classrooms um I Do I think that what's really important is that we look at\nUm the way that we expand opportunities for all of our students is not by limiting opportunities and so we have students who are already took salary and middle school and in high school because they love math and they're ready and they want to go on and be\nEngineers and physicists and all kinds of things we need to make sure they have the access an opportunity to do that and when you start early you know in elementary school I Want to make sure we have girls math class and we have opportunities for college that they see themselves as math people because I Want to make sure that those advanced math courses in high school are reflective of our entire student body\nI Want to make sure that they all have access there and we have lots of math opportunities not just calculus but we're also putting in um data science data visualization and financial management and all of the rest\nThank you feel the same question from our fourth grader what would you do to make sure\nThat a student who is interested in math and fourth grade remains ... interested in math for the rest of her life\nUm so I absolutely agree with Michele I'm not that actually one of the subject areas in which I work with coaches a lot on the air and a different you should have heart rate like when you get an a curriculum out of the box and you as a teacher you just by how you're going to\nMake that curriculum come alive for ... is an incredibly challenging an awesome job of a teacher\nAnd they can't do it alone\nAnd uh we in our district a need to make sure that if students are ready to celebrate beyond what the teacher's able to provide in the classroom or we're not standing in the way of act how reaching those opportunities and that we need to make sure our course pathways the structural organization of our staffing alliance to adopt\n'em and now we provide not just the core schedule is starting in high school but in middle school as well um and so I Do think that I supported openly the re evaluation of our curriculum um and understand\nCommon Core but also that were being includes over the fact that students are coming up with different levels um\nAnd I will stop there\nThank you for the next question for Monica and phone got what curriculum subject is currently missing that shouldn't be taught in school that you would want to advocate for\nUm Monica so this is talk to a lot about parents is you know just preparing our students for life like financial literacy debt to being a good civil servant and being in\nAll these life skills that our kids are not being taught you know in our school so that when they graduate you know we have a huge percentage of kids are Eighteen you know getting into that and how to balance the budget how to have successful relationships consent that needs to be taught very early ... and so what [laughter]\nSo all of these things about relationships about finances about serving the engagement needs to be taught from elementary and you know from elementary school onto through twelfth grade and so really so that we are preparing kids not only to graduate but prepare them for life\nSo they can have successful relationships that they can be financially stable they can buy houses they can um you know have healthy relationships that are so that's something that I Am very passionate about and making sure that it's you know age appropriate and I remember going back to the question about suffering engagement I'm\nReally even with our elementary students talking about ah\nGetting their response is about political things that are happening now like for example like the whole you know families in cages and our kids being separated from their parents like so often are just so much better than we are and they can we buy those solutions that we might be too afraid to tackle matter which I was young [laughter]\nShe could go on for a long time on that one I could tell she ... up over\nAs my buddy ready for the question so K. through twelve ethnic studies for an hour and high school and introduce streamlined and always being from kindergarten is the first start\nI'm a member segregated from your Monica is on it as well as a school for me is more than ... mix right 'cause on there for six hours a week\nOr two about leadership it's about you know or other things that are I really feel like a I'm going to bring to the school district is really addressing real privilege umbrella toxicity and so we talked about this the sexual harassment and stuff going on but we don't really talk about\nThe root of some of this stuff and where it's coming from and I feel like you know what I'm saying that because one of the curriculum to answer the question is a mental health right or milk religion a little dog says he for me it really was a metro because you are the needs to be addressed a within our school districts and um\nI started a pool or prevent program or burn I was going to address the concerns within this country with the with the amount of young women that were being raped in high schools or the country and it still exists today and so but I think that needs to be expanded the roads are district\nBecky thank you\nThe next question is for Allison and Martin please um there's a a a significant teacher shortage and in across California across the country really\nUm but what are some specific ideas you have for solving the shortage of special education teachers and parents and I would love if you could be a specific as possible please read art with I'm Alison I really appreciate this question\nI was a teacher Galileo and I'm holding my parents are more psychologists and so they were all my my on call resource and because I enjoyed working with students with disabilities I ended up getting more students in my class\nAnd um I had a para that was kind of the deal and it was one of the best teaching experiences I ever had um being able to teach a really diverse group of kids they can all see that they were valued and that they could all cell in different ways but I had the support that I needed and I think one thing that we do not do in our district and it leads to a teacher burnout it led to my burn out in ...\nFor foreign prop Thirteen so we gotta talk about that too but\nTeachers burned out because they're just they're overloaded and there's some schools that have more of a lower than others and we really have to acknowledge that and some teachers have more of that load in school and we really have no metric to see if you've got ten kids with ITs and two kids with diabetes\nThat's work that is currently not compensated for and that's the same with Paris too\nAnd we really need to come up with a metric to compensate teachers and really evaluate how hard they're working so that they have a manageable workload\nThank you learn\nA little disclosure here I or I was a special ed I was in the severely emotionally disturbed class because I Am trends [noise]\nAnd when I was in high school because of the class I went in and had therapy or we had to talk about her feelings [noise]\nNow I think we should actually get trans\nNon binary gender expansive teachers and Paris I think we need to recruit\nWe need to recruit people who traditionally have been ... by the education system and I think we need to do that now we need to start really looking and finding people who have\nThe fire in their belly for teaching and really bring those people to San Francisco Unified School district\nYou very much thank you\n[noise] um the next question is for um John and a leader teachers in San Francisco school districts make less money than some surrounding districts where do you think the money can come from to pay teachers and more competitive salary Alina\nI I guess I just want to talk about partnerships that's something we didn't really talk about follow that and I and others have been talking about whole community schools\nWe all we all benefit when we invest in our public schools and that's one of the reasons why I'm such I Am so in love with our public schools even when they're not perfect because they when we invest in our schools and we invest in other people's children and we all benefit and um\nI have a really strong track record of helping to bridge those gaps and create community because we can't do this alone none of us can and um because of that work\nI've been very successful in in helping our schools to really really be the vision that our district has set out\nTo create um and because of that I'm One of the only teachers have endorsed by the teachers union I'm endorsed by the San Francisco Democratic Party I'm endorsed by more board members and any other candidate um and or any others more supervisors than any other candidate and it's because I've been showing up there's a few of us that are educators and parents we've\nBeen showing up and doing the work and I would really appreciate your vote for that I can continue to do that work and continue to serve and and help the district realize his promises on for all children in the city thank you\n\nSo um\nI think it's very important to include people who are showing up and doing the work on the board and at the same time the district has been\nA electing people who've been in the system for really long time and already have high school age kids are already out of the schools are for a long time and there hasn't been substantive\nClosure of the achievement gap in Thirty years of effort\nSo thinking about what we can do differently is very important to me as someone who will be in the school system for another Fifteen Years with my two boys\nAnd one thing that I'm really passionate about is infrastructure\nUh it's so boring and sexy but when you think about chronic absenteeism it's only what's happening in the curriculum and with teachers that's very important but it is also the fact that and the baby asthma rates or four times as my hospitalization rates are four times higher we need to think about health\nAnd we need to think about transportation to get students into the classroom in the first place and we will be working on school assignment\nAt the same time we're working on a tenure capital plan for our facility if\nThat's what I'm excited to do and work for you\n[noise] [noise]\nSo first of all I just want to thank you goes off or coming and taking the time and listen to us you know I'm I'm a ... parents you guys probably retard and whatnot\nAnd so I definitely want to say thank you I'm I've been a schools when I was in K. to twelve you know I have all the reasons would be upset about the school district but I'm not right here in San Francisco unified because I understand that we it's it's hard I work in our district and I work with the teachers and be worth a try or people will try and I'm saying is you know um\nSome of our kids are not even making it to school right and and I'm leaving is with us 'cause you know this seems to be a group of people you know all of our to our important but some of our kids they're not making it\nRight and that's a duty not only with the school board with all of us here in his room you know so that's why mental health is my most important issue right if we if kids don't know that their loved that they're taking care of in the schools in at home\nIt we're not getting anywhere so when we talk about this opportunity right because it's not an achievement things one opportunity thing right we really have to get some models hierarchy in sort of dressed in court\n... election but [noise]\nI Want to thank you all for ah for listening tonight and all of us because we we can talk um [noise] and ah as a trans by Jewish parent I Will work by keep offer everybody and that every student ah I'm endorsed by evolve California which is trying to reform prop Thirteen\nUm and the clothes that are that are corporate loopholes\nAnd a trans United a bipolar the oldest a first bisexual political Action Network\nUm and uh the barrier reporter which is really exciting I'm public students public public school students are really important to me because you know have kids in the district and I want to see every single child succeed\nIf that means going out every single school and hanging out and getting snow every single family I'm going to do it on I've already started [laughter]\nBut uh I Hope that we can all come together and really make this district a beautiful place where every school is number one on someone's list\n[laughter]\nThinking thank you I've been gone for coming out today and thank you for all the organizer as he made this event happen I Know it takes a lot of effort to plant events and to get people to show up on so I ... and my first time candidate and the youngest candidate running this time around I'm twenty seven years old\nI have a degree in political policy but I'm Wise enough to know that\nI don't know everything and not fly I really love to our educators into our parents to teach me a thing or two along this process I've been really excited to have lots of great conversations across the city\nAnd I think what sets me really a part of that I not only how they use organizing experience I have\nExperience developing legislation implementing the legislation and including on passing free me an e for over fifty thousand young people helping to reauthorize the children's find which serves um provides a hundred million dollars a services to children and youth and I hope to earn your vote this November\n\nHow a thank you for having us first of all and thank you all for taking an active role in uh this process and and the the running of our school district\nUm I I firmly believe that the school district in the schools must serve the kids with ... for the needs that they have\nRather than providing a service that may or may not fit them that's why I'm a fan of community schools\nAnd arts or to allow kids to learn in the way the best suits them and express their learning through the arts and bring their culture into it uh we need to re imagined the schools so that they ... match the needs of students and families today um\n[noise] we need to make sure the money gets to the classrooms and ... a support the teachers so that they can teach our students because there's nothing more important it is the most important job there is\nLike you\nYeah thank you all very much for being here thanks to our organizers um education as a civil right I'm In education in itself shows safety net um you don't become a teacher because you want to get rich you become a teacher because you have the heart of\nThat's a fairly in of itself improve the outcomes in our classrooms um [noise]\nOne of my big platforms in my campaign is reading
