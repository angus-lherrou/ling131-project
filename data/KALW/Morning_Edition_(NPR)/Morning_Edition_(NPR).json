World Service for me Steve and soccer like us today is a British Labour Party politician there's profile of influence goes beyond the normal for a ... position and pay\nThat's partly because David Letterman has long been tipped does a rising parliamentary stop enjoyed a rapid rise after entering parliament in two thousand and served in junior government posts on to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown\nBut it's also because of his passionate personal politics the son of immigrants from day on a\nHe speaks with personal experience and the degree of anger on issues of social and economic inequality racism and ah been deprivation those all the issues which he says the Gulf into politics to address\nAnd yet today British politics is dominated by something else bricks and just five runs the u._k. is supposed to be out of the new and still the processes mired in uncertainty governing conservative politics is deeply divided on what Brexit should look like\nSo is the Labour opposition David lampley argues that any deal should be put before the British people in another referendum but how would that\nHelp the nation move on well David Lowry joins me now welcome to talk like you you've been in the house of commons a full ... about Eighteen years\nCan you ever remember a time when the atmosphere was more poisonous and politicians ability to develop a policy on\nLacking no and show I mean this is an extraordinary period in the case history um\nThat seems to be little common ground frankly between the senior politicians of the day the country is hopelessly divided and it is not entirely clear\nWhat the way through ways or indeed the show medium or long term future of Britain is to be the next few months whooping Jamal trust I'm quite sure about that there'll be a lot of coming and going I think in the political fabric\nAnd we will end up in a place eyes and sings as exiting the European Union or I think potentially with a second I'm referendum and the people's vote determine the way forward\nYou talk about the ... the divisions and there's no question about the divisions in the ruling conservative party and it's not our job today to go into those what we need to do is analyze Walt the Labour Party is doing and at a time when surely the owners feel ... on the opposition\nHas to be clear in its Brexit strategy piracy is the last thing the Labour Party has come out with\n[noise] I prefer enough I mean the truth is that\nWe had a referendum on the left\nThe labor pouncing divided\nUm people in ... in London voting overwhelmingly to remain on people in states particularly in the industrial north\nVoting to me and in that sense the Labour Party reflected the mood of the country now so it's been my view\nThat people voted for a whole raft of reasons um um Britain has been slow to protect clearly to get wealth from London and the south east to the seaside town to rural parts of the country and to the north\nI'm ... and therefore in a in a sense waltz alone was sold this referendum or sorry the frets it would be the officer today's problems is clear now\nA I'm afraid actually what we should be doing is getting the end of this running that this debate on our relationship with Europe and dealing with a profound problems so I think the best way forward on that is actually A People's that\nLet's talk about the profound problems as you see them um do you see Britain has problems primarily and particularly the your constituents and the people that you were with day by day do you see that the most profound problems are results of issues of of\nClash of race discrimination\nWell the two go hand in hand obviously a mother in law to distinguish between one and the other the truth is\nThat there are profound inequalities in Britain in an age in which the laws currently revolution means ... that's been a massive loss of jobs in the middle of the economy Britain has struggled to devolve wealth out of London and the southeast and on top of that\nIn an era in which is a little bit about immigration um yes I'm afraid are I think it's demonstrate that we've had a forty percent rise in hate crime and they were read an entrenched inequalities\nFor black Asian a minority you have to people in our country I mean I think as a less employment\nDoing less whether an education doing less sweat in housing and we've got a huge problem in our prison system that David Cameron off me to look into the cause of the amount of black method minorities in our present those are profound problems but sitting alone site though these are problems with the economy and wealth\n... of course the fat white working class populations in Britain as well\nLet me ask you a personal question seems to me politicians all have the road and distinctive style is yours is is a very personal style and it involves\nThe injection of a great deal of passion and at times a great deal of anger into politics I'm thinking of your response to the tragic fire Grunsfeld ... Seventy people\nLost their lives and thinking also about your reaction to the revelations about the so called when rush generation we were wrongfully forced to leave this country having made their lives here for many many years you get angry in public that serves your issues well\nWhat I describe why there is ... baby passionate but I've got to say\nSeventy two people lost their lives in a fire that could have been prevented\nAnd absolutely we have to have politicians that will speak truth to power when you look at the faces of those who've died and when you challenge meal when rush\nBritain's stop deporting its own nationals to Australia in Eighteen sixty eight how can it be rights when we had a generation of people that arrived here from the Caribbean\nGave this country so much that you stripped them of their rights you ... them into tightened them you deny them access to pensions to health care\nAnd that is not something that should animate and make people furious that this has happened in Britain's name of course and let me just say these are the descendants\nCountry is horrendous and of course that has animated me because they included my parents and our generation bought it in parts of the rhetoric\nAnd the rhetoric around immigration is the rhetoric around different it's not consistent with a civilized democracy and we should call it what it is\nYou do not get to say that you're going to have trade deals with the wild and then treat the world's population at a ... because of your color on your off in such an atrocious why\nDo you believe looking at politics today that there is an institutional racism in for example the home office which which of course was the department responsible for for the wind rush decisions do you believe when you look at policing in London today that there is institutional racism\nRacism and discrimination exists in breast and of course it does I Do believe that the wind drops as an example of systemic discrimination against low hanging fruit which was British nationals\nWho ultimately was subjects because of empire treated as they were because of the color of their skin not if my seem fair beneath yes systemic prejudice and discrimination\nHow to handle it the best use the leverage you have I'm very mindful of your personal story you know you as you've just said you were brought up by a by a mother who came from guy on I made a life in North London lived in poverty your father left home\nYou manage to get a great education went to one of London's best universities to Harvard University\nAs well you now I've been going the barest a or a politician you have\nSucceeded in Britain despite everything that we've just discuss so how do you leverage walk power and influence you must it\nEvery day my life that is why it is so important to me to speak authentic Clinton and with power about the subject but let me just say that\nBut going back to where I began the report from the equality and human rights commission today saying Britain is seeing an alarming string of backward steps that it's in risk risk of becoming a to speed and two tiered society\nThat Eighteen years if it was in politics doesn't seem to have Neal did very much\nFor having a paradox Brits an addict fast is a country with someone like me kind of violence and do well it's a country relative in Europe which feels that it can be fair and you can get a fat Crocker the Ritz but yes\nThere are forces in this country don't want to take this country\nThey're all full sister ... the empire was good and that's why we should reject the European Union and recreate a new imperative them it doesn't seem to understand Britain's history and Britain's history is not just the history of\nWinning the war and Hitler and of King Henry and Henry it's a history also of colonialism an empire\nBerries good and that is bad in that story\nThe ...

moment here ... speaking to the nation about her decision what what is your saying\nShe she sounded very steady and she looked a little sad but she said that she said before she was not born chancellor\nOr that it hasn't been a daily honor but also a daily challenge to serve as a chancellor for the past Thirteen Years and as head of her party for the last Eighteen but that it was time to

choices but ... says that's still really high the masters doesn't add up\n... says the customary charge for this test is thirty five dollars and that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area even if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nOr just do the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than the station is being left with to pay out of pocket so the mass still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she hated that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nI Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought\n... cases and that grand piano Winston says if all that money went to pay for

an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive bill Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby a but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test [noise]\nUh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergy so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I was\nPart of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so if everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things I can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could it expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think\nWe have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of

into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he will take office on the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy\nAnd let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves who was reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil or almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption crime and\nThey ... the restoration of national pride I don't think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate for them to a dashing so comprehensively I should say though that both NATO himself insist the survival of democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out parts of the constitution to report is about the need for the future presidents who respects to judge\nTo remind him and the people the people of Brazil about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they see is a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an on corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not his home in Rio\nHe's rainy on that he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said that does have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready people hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high mood right\nYet the prospect of more guns ... police violence social concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is rolling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... powder a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are especially the poor people than minority\nOkay so both concern and

... she has thousands of social media followers they're my lawyer tells stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital\nStories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad a girl who was on the streets selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there are still on the streets when you're free to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's ... more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think the more than me I'm particularly it's fun to recoup the mile or has an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way it was a story about about social media\nBut will make people reach into their pocket and think that the individually by taking a small steps are making a difference\nSo who is Katie ... why did you start this organization\nKicked him out there's a woman from New Jersey who had a long background in doing various forms of yeah community help and volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on an evangelical internship\nAnd then from there she continued their relationship for the country and she started ... first registered in two thousand and eight\n[noise] she didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow and kicked him ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this was an incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia was an army Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental and the starting up of disorganization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also being part of the vigilante groups which is a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nAnd he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls that he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie ... the founder of the organization now what he was doing\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my mother had an intimate relationship with him but she conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven\nThere was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who\nWho says that she said something on the lines of you know I told her that she loves the children but she didn't she didn't really get it\nAnd I might lower recounts that conversation differently she'd heritage but she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to this story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that she had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died and as a consequence you know potentially all of those who have contact with them which\nAccording to reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nAnd more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually are willing to bring a case they were to be tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the ... at one point to you in a bottle\nSays you know where are your schools where the school so you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if\nHer organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to the cities that it had been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we have from the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nAnd Liberia still allows the organization to operate schools there\nWell the story it's really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm On the local community of the sense of\nA lot of people had a feeling that something going wrong in this and this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has announced a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case\nUm and they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we are both a process for credit than these organizations have we hold them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed and the school\nThat was Finley young for pro public I talking to Rachel Martin since his story was published Katie my lawyer has temporarily stepped down a CEO of more than me this is NPR News\nFlorida has some of the toughest building cars in the country but certain

founder is an American woman named Katie ...\nShe has thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lower\nLiberia who doesn't have a mom or dad I'll go on the streets selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water on the streets when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who is a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's at more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me I'm particularly for ... an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the ... level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually but taking a small steps are making a difference\nSo who is Katie mother why did you start this organization\nKicked him out there's a woman from New Jersey who cut along background in doing various forms of gift community help volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand of six on an evangelical internship\nAnd then from there to continue the relationship for the country and she started up which are the first registered to vote in the ...\n[noise] she didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow and ... has been very clear and her own promotion of organization that what she brought to this was an incredible depths of love to love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her\nAnd the Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental in starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the area of West point where he operated he was well liked\nWhen he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nGet Katie ... the founder of the organization now what he was dealing [noise]\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that ... had an intimate relationship with them but she's conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven\nThere was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who [noise]\nWho says that she's had something on the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't didn't really get it\nNow my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that the he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that she had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors that was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died and as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which\nAccording to reports on to our reporting and also to court documents and the organizations internal documents was many many girls\nAnd more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually are willing to bring a case they were re tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to this to be that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we have from the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling this story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nAnd Liberia still allows the organization to operate schools\nWell the story is really\nThe building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm On the local community you have the sense of\nA lot of people that are feeling that something has gone wrong in this and this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has announced a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case\nUm and they're living as well at more technical stuff like well how do we how what's the process for credit things organizations have we help them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was fold and the school\nThat was Finley young for pro public I talking to Rachel Martin since his story was published Katie

EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene\nAnd I'm Noel King good morning the u._s. stock market looks ready to recover some of yesterday's dramatic losses when Wall Street opens this morning most Asian markets were down overnight the Nikkei\nHangs saying but the Shanghai stock exchange was stable which was unexpected because China's stock market has fallen thirty percent since January and its currency is falling to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years NPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob\nYou more into our what thirty percent drop for China stock market sounds pretty darned bad what's going on\n[noise] we'll try this kind of me has been leading for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt Sparling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble\nAnd through all of this Beijing's making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from an economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in the stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have\nAs big an impact on the economy like if the dog the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy if say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency of un is edits weakest link\nKeeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\n[noise] well what's interesting here Noel is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing years ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that\nThe u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nChina is doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and start managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and\nChina by these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a communist I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chain to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy was\nAlready vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost NPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks out ...\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change\nSilicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes blocks chain the technology behind crypto currency like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science is talking about watching\nBut at the recent global climate action some in San Francisco it was all over the place their panels papers people were talking about how he could help mitigate climate change in\nAll sorts of ways and agriculture harvests oils frustration\nWith our sometime in ... he came to the conference to spread awareness about plunging so what does it\nChange or distributed letter technology really references a larger system of technology [noise]\nOkay [noise] think of it like ... ... is like an accounting\nBook everyone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank\nBut instead on the computers of everyone on the ... transparency is the main advantage ... tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer to endings human trafficking now even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nBall gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he's still makes the grand tech world pitches he's a CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\n... the black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credit systems the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use blood chain\nMarket for people taking carbon out of the environment not a company has been launched yet\nBut that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch\nYou want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy because there's a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution that things to fix climate change\nAre going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute\nThe call I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data with the hot new things\nAnd these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype we need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nBecause it could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees a company's planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mock a climate scientist at Stanford agrees\nBut she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially can kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually more important to make the entirety of the problem something not solvable\nWith a clock ticking on climate change Locke says there's no time to waste sorting facts\nThis is NPR News\nThe Democratic nominee for governor in Illinois have contributed more money to his own campaign any other candidate in

NYU school of law he says Michigan maps are among the most skewed in the country\nIt's very clear to their number one goal above protecting communities ethnic geographic otherwise in Michigan it's very clear that their number one goal was to maximize Republican political power\nRepublicans have taken the majority of the state's congressional seat nine out of fourteen even in years when Democrats have gotten this far more votes overall\nThe redistricting proposal would create a commission made up of four Republicans four Democrats and five independence a majority that includes a mix of all three would have to agree on the map\nBut the opposition calls the proposal an expensive way to change the system that already works when delete harbor is a Republican and has worked for for secretaries of state she says this whole thing is skewed to help Democrats\nA gimmick and bypasses are elected official in our democracy and if they want to have the pen they need to win

get people excited about Chiquita Hannah of Detroit plans to vote in November and she's leaning in favor of the proposal\nWhy should the person in an office get to decide like who gets to vote in that

sponsored colleges schools with storied basketball programs such as the University of Kansas and low for among them ... longtime coach Rick Pitino was forced out of a job over all this but he was not even brought on trial\nNow joining us to talk about this case and what the NC double a can do to clean up corruption and college athletics is Washington Post sports columnist Kevin Blackistone also familiar voice on our program Heather Kevin hey are you doing I'm good thank you so what does all this mean for college basketball as a whole what happened yesterday you know I'm not sure names\nAnything for college basketball um in in total because what happened here was a pretty isolated incident um but what it does is it exposes the recruiting practices have been going on and ah\nBall for as long as I can remember and that is basically channeling of money from a one source um to the families of talent um to ensure that that talent goes to a particular school\nAnd what has happened over the years is that the uh manufacturers of of basketball shoes Adidas\nA Nike or those those uh operations\nHas gotten people in the middle of them um to help transfer that money\nSo that the surprise here is that it has been criminalize 'em by the federal government as opposed to be policed by uh the NC double A. as it's been done for years and it used to be that the worst thing that would happen in this situation is that a someone would be banned from\nThe NC double a a coach who was who was caught um funneling money or or some middle man\nNow as I go out of Iowa which is which is a step\nAt absolutely now you could possibly go behind bars which is ah what these uh these three men are facing\nWhat you have these three men facing that you say um but I Wonder your colleague at the Washington Post Sally Jenkins room recently that the real defended here should be a university but the universities are actually considered victims and all of this did you see at the same way that she does I\nI don't see it that way but that was the way that the federal government decided to get involved in this basically they said that the ... universes were being defrauded 'em by the system\nAh because by funneling this money um two players are are players families um these people knew that they were making these players in eligible under Institute double A. rules and therefore that at some point\nIt would all be found out and they wouldn't be allowed to play to the universities that have given them scholarships\nAnd therefore they had to fraud at the universities of of value which is a very strange thing to me because I still don't know\nHow that's fraud I mean universities or a University of basketball programs in football programs are still going to get these talented players under they're very um [noise] a low level of remuneration a for athletic talented brings them um tens of million dollars in revenue every year\nWhich speaks to what you said this is

rough day yesterday the Dow was trading up about point eight percent this hour\nBut I don't think the market volatility we've been seeing in the past couple of weeks is not over NPR's Yuki Noguchi joins us now to discuss some of these markets wings ... good morning oh\nAll right so it has been a choppy October yesterday markets closed down and the Dow innocent pie basically erased all their gains for the year what has been going on it's because\nInvestors are conflicted and one of their biggest underlying concerns is the global economy you know how the trade war will play out and how higher terrorists might effects it might affect U.S companies\nUh you're starting to see some of that already a caterpillar which makes farm equipment and three M which is a huge conglomerate that makes everything from sponges to car parts or this week talked about how that starting to affect their bottom line now on the plus side the economy and labor market are and\nHave been chugging along so there are no clear indications that that's going to hit a wall uh some companies are beating expectations and although interest rates are heading up there still historically low\nAll right so some good factors some bad factors one of those sectors that's been hardest hit in recent days is the tech sector yesterday the NASDAQ which is made up of a lot of tech stocks I had one of the worst days in seven years now this morning we should say it is trading up but what is going on in the technology sector\n... well the technology sector has been on an even steadier and stronger Bull Run in recent years I'm apple this summer or you might recall became the first company to reach a trillion dollars and market value so basically textbooks have already risen very high and I have a lot\nFurther to fall on and when you have a ... few companies talking as you saw this week about leaks sales or miss profits on that makes investors nervous that perhaps\nThose stocks are overvalued and tech is a great example actually of how the volatility kind of spreads around the world yesterday you had some us tech firms including Texas Instruments and AT and T. reporting some weaker earnings which then prompted you\nNight but then by the morning you had stronger results out of European tech firms and send U.S companies including Microsoft and Twitter this morning and\nThat's helping shore up some of those losses so it kind of good contagion they're eating nerve wracking though to see the markets lose like six hundred points in a day and analysts say this could continue for a while really quickly why is that\nIt's largely because we don't have clarity on some of the questions that I outlined at the outset where's the global economy had it how much our trade or it's going to affect companies and into investors feel they have a clearer picture on that\nYou are likely to see strong reactions to any kind of news that could be interpreted as a significant development and we'll get another chance or later today with Amazon and Google alphabet recording their earnings NPR's Yuki Noguchi thanks so much thank you know\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change\nSilicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes blocks chained the technology behind crypto currency like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science was talking about watching\nBut at the recent global climate action some in San Francisco it was all over the place there were panels papers people were talking about how he could help mitigate climate change in\nAll sorts of agriculture\nOr the oil's frustration\nOur sometime and co chairs the climate change coalition he came to the conferences spread awareness about watching [noise] so what is it\nA chain or distributed electric technology really references a larger system of technology [noise]\nOkay [noise] think of it like the ... is like an accounting book\nEveryone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank\nBut it said on the computers of everyone on the block chain transparency is its main advantage ... tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer Jew endings human trafficking and now even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nFor gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he's still makes the grand tech world pitches he's a CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\nNor is a black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credits that since the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting\nEnd to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment now the company has been launched yet\nBut that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch\nYou want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy because a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of silicon valley's big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it's just there's a quick and easy solution the things that fix climate change\nAre going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute\nBecause it before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data with the hot new things and these are proven to be valuable tools

Steve Inskeep\nWe put your questions to commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your inquiries each week about how politics and government work either Cokie high fever and it's certainly a big question now this relationship works and here's our first question\nThis is Nicole ... sketch from Nashville, Tennessee in New York fatty Arabian special relationship really based primarily on an oil arms arrangement or there's something more to it\nWas not oil for arms and soil and arms\nOf recent years the United states has become much more self sufficient in terms of energy but Saudi Arabia remains a huge producer of oil and more important incredibly influential and the international setting of oil prices but it's also a purchaser as President Trump has repeatedly said\nOf arms made by U.S companies but there's something more and that is mainly Iran the United states is saying Saudi Arabia is a check on Iran both in the region internationally and to the extent that it's alive issues the U.S also thinks that Saudi Arabia could be helpful and then the elusive Israeli Palestinian peace agreement\nNow oil is also on the minds of our next listener hello my name is Shawn fits Morris I'm from New Orleans Louisiana how did the U.S view Saudi Arabia before oil was a thing thank you\nBasically there was no view before oil was a thing a Saudi Arabia as we know it was became a country in Nineteen thirty to the very next year inside an agreement with standard oil of California to form aramco the Arabian American oil company which is now owned by the Saudi state\nAnd that happened even before it was clear\nHow oil rich the country would be\nThe leader for a unified the country and started a relationship with the U.S was Abdul Aziz evens out he\nHad forty five sons Steve and all the king's since his death in Nineteen fifty three of them one of those times the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman would have been hearing so much about lately would be the first of the next generation if he becomes king\nThe next question is whether us being so close to the Saudis can get them to do anything\nI this is Alex ... from Upton, Massachusetts how much influence of the United states have over Saudi Arabia's foreign policy\nWell I'd say the question is more how much the U.S has chosen to exert a the biggest case in point at the moment is the civil war in Yemen where the Saudis have been accused of bombing civilians and closing off access to a humanitarian aid so that now there's an enormous food crisis taking place\nBut because Iran is involved with the facts and the Saudis are fighting\nThe United states has sided with the thought is\nThat there is ... and Congress which showed up in the last defense bill of trying to protect civilians\nAnd there's talk of sanctioning Saudi Arabia in some way because of the journalist killing as well ... thanks as always good to talk to you stay in commentator Cokie Roberts you can ask Cokie your questions about our politics and
