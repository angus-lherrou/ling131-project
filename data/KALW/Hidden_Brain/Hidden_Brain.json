I'm from Detroit Michigan\nBrandi drew has a story that may sound familiar to you a story of poverty and debt [noise]\nIt's the kind of story that may lead people to quit conclusions so pay attention to your own Randy is now in her late thirties [noise] a few years ago her life unraveled [noise] or the time she around the dining services department at a senior living facility she being with a company that ran\nIt for more than a decade one day she made a mistake\nHome that was our because daycare closer to six I get off at\nIt was like maybe a\nTen mile drive busy traffic area and I knew I had to pick up diapers and easiest thing for me I thought would be to pick 'em up before the baby up\nAround new stopped at a store run in and grab the diapers she's white took credit card at the self checkout station and reached out to\nIt turns out she used the wrong card\nNot her own by the company credit card\nWhat's crazy is I didn't realize at that moment\nI didn't realize until my supervisor column in and said hey what's this purchase\nHad she not said anything I don't think I Would have realized that\nRandy carry the card in case you needed to buy dining supplies for what she never had a problem before never been reprimanded she thought an apology and an explanation would do and her response was well you\nKnow we have to terminate you\nAnd I'm like no I didn't know that like can I just pay you back it was only like twelve month and she said now in cases like that you automatically have to terminate them play\nAs this crime and crime and like all day because I couldn't\nBelieve that I didn't want to go home and tell my kids what had happened and I didn't want to tell my husband what an Avon I just didn't know what to do at that point I felt like a ... I felt like a failure as a parent because I didn't provide a a good example even though it was a mistake\nBrandy on more than her husband so the last of the job hit hard she felt like a loser she tried to bring in money doing odd jobs like cooking takeoff meals but the stress grew brandy and her husband began fighting she had supported him when he'd be laid off a few years earlier and treat expected\nHe'd do the same for her\nBut he felt he situation was different\nHe'd been laid off Randy was fired he was mad that she'd made a stupid mistake\nThe final argument was that um I left the house that morning I was going to chat interviews I had two interviews that day and I didn't purpose toilet paper son when he got home from work that day there was no toilet paper when I came in with the kids who just immediate started yelling\nYou can't keep yourself together you can't do this you can't do that so I walked right back out the door and I never looked back\nWithout steady employment and her husband to help with bills Randy watching anxiously as her household supplies dwindled she worried constantly about money [noise] to make ends meet shorter than your credit card the date arrived ground detour\nAs your as your checking the prices and remembering the prices and figure out if you buy two cards will you have enough money for breakfast you are forgetting things you're paying less attention to your rent your kid's homework dilemma of the other things that make you know life complete\nThe thing is as a result of doing this the underlying problem can become worse if you don't pay our bills you'll be even deeper and the whole next month\nScarcity in other words is attract the scarcity trap for us is\nAll those ways in which scarcity today begets behaviors which leads to even further scarcity tomorrow and we think it's something that poor people do people do is another example we think the lonely do this\nSo people who are lonely will often engage in social interactions in a particular way which actually makes it harder for them to make friends\nJustice the poor focus on the money they do not have\nThe lonely tend to focus on the\nFriends they do not have the result is they try too hard to be like in a conversation the lonely person might be so preoccupied with making a good impression that he can't pay attention to what's actually being set the conversation\nFalter instead of appearing likeable he's seen as awkward are flat footed what happens as a result people do voice the aqua conversationalist [noise] and the only person becomes even lonely [noise] this lands offers a new way of\nThinking about white people who find themselves and scarcity seem to do things that\nTo an outsider look stupid when you were in a whole why would you take yourself even deeper Sanders says we're asking the wrong question\nWhat if it's not the poor people are somehow deficient but the poverty\nMake everyone less capable that it's the it's un\nI tomorrow what are we to become poor or with all of a sudden have the same as like the poverty is in some sense changing our minds\nHow do we know this isn't some leading house theory to excused irresponsible behavior and down in San Diego wanted to test that hypothesis\nOf all this is true one thing that ought to be true is the same person when they are poor should have very different cognitive capacity than when they're rich\nSo how would we test that well unfortunately we don't have the kind of money to go around making poor people rich but a sugarcane farmers actually create a natural experiment for us\nYes sugarcane farmers specifically those in India who are paid only once a year right after the harvest\nThe month after they get that income they're pretty rich but like anybody who\nSpent a little too fast and so by the end of the harvest cycle they're relatively poor so now we have the same person a month before harvest poor in a month after her this well off\nAgain you have the same group of people who are poor one moment and rich the next ... tested the farmers on their long term thinking when they had no money and when they had plenty of money the results were stunning\nWe found a huge difference so we found that post harvest when they're well off and they have much more impulse control\nFarmers who are rich tended to think about things that would help them over the long term this matched other research that shows for example that farmers who are well off tend to read that feels more regularly and farmers who are poor\nFarmers who are poor mostly focused on how to make it to next week short I'm thinking\nTo be clear it's not that poor people focus on immediate needs because that's all they want to think about it's all they can think about scarcity captures the mind like it did with those charming men in Minnesota in fact scarcity can actually look or how you perform on an IQ test\nPut simply being poor is like having just pulled an all nighter\nNow if you've been very lucky maybe you've never experienced what it's like to be poor or hungry or lonely but they might be another former scarcity you have experienced\nOn some days that we get to leave at four pm Sunday's we'd only tell why am I [laughter] and then you usually start the next day or night thirty or six in the morning usually work\nEighty hours a week\nWe'll find out how

desperately need is in short supply your brain tends to focus on that thing this focus can be so intense that impede your ability to think about anything else\nWhat happens when the thing you're missing it's time when you're so busy it feels like you don't have time to brief let me tell you the story of a young woman\nReasons that will be clear in a moment for as long as she can remember Katy has been driven really driven\nUm when I was in high school I was determined to be valedictorian so I took a sophomore level on our biology course as a freshman in high school and I studied around the clock I had no cards I walked through the hallways with a note cards if there was a holiday party I brought the note cards and I'd also studied until two or three in the morning\nShe says she wanted to be perfect at school she eventually got to medical school where she felt she graduated at the top of her class and quickly started a residency the new schedule was grueling\nYou can get in at five thirty or six in the morning and you round on all your patience and then you you round with the team that means you go to all the patients and\nChecking on their plan and adjust medications et cetera is necessary and then there's usually a lunch conference where we have education and then in the afternoon we might take new patients and and keep following up on our patients\nAnd on Sundays we get to leave at four pm some days we don't leave until one AM [laughter] and then you usually start the next day at five thirty or six in the morning and again [noise]\nUm and you get one day off a week usually work eighty hours a week\nAs Judy's workload grew she started to feel she couldn't afford to waste a single moment instead of spending anytime relaxing she started to focus only on things directly related to her success at work\nWhen I first started it was just like really busy so I Try to come home and I felt like you know I just don't have a lot of hours so I Need to make the most of them and it was like okay I Need to make sure I'm exercising keeping my body healthy and they need to read and stay on top of things so I come home\nAfter pretty long day and I might go walking for half an hour and then I'd read and then I go to sleep um but then as time went on I decided to\nTry to get in more exercise than like I never know and I'll get enough exercise and so I started spending all my free daylight hours\nWalking or running outside are going to the gym [noise] up to three hours a day plus like working [noise] Fifteen hours a day and trying to read and then go to sleep\nAnd uh she focused intensely on to things she believed was key to her professional success Judy lost sight of things on the periphery [noise]\nShe didn't know it but she was entering the tunnel of scarcity [noise] in her case it was scarcity brought on by a lack of time\nSo I wasn't going to the grocery store and my house wasn't impact yet and it was stressing me out [laughter] it was just a mess and um [noise] I've my clothes piled up I had a lot of dirty clothes and\nComing home just so overwhelming I didn't want to be there and that's part of I think why I was walking so much just to get out of the house and get away from\nAll the things they hadn't done but I also forgot to pay a bill in the mix of all of this\nWhat did you forget to do were melted if we're going to be [noise] um it was my energy bill the deal kid he would have spotted honest I mean you would just basic kid despite almost falling apart at Johnson I was I was falling apart\nThere was something else Katie had battled anorexia as a teenager she knew she had to stay vigilant about eating\nAfter the break we're going to switch gears and move from scarcity [noise]\nIt turns out that having too much\nYou can have its own set of problems when you're really wealthy it's not uncommon to have the experience that everyone is out to get a piece of you to breed the kind of suspicion why are you being nice to me are you just trying to give me give you something\nI'm Shankar Vedantam and you're listening to hidden brain [noise] this\nIs NPR\nMC five stars Wayne frame or has been a rock and roll legend and he's

rich\nTaking all of her for a detox and the Hampton standardized testing hasn't really stressed and\nMy farmer private jets your island a state of the Caribbean rich I mean it's one and then what would it cost ten dollars\nMost of us would never know what that's like [noise]\nBut if you've ever being at least a little curious about the lives of the liver wealthy this next segment is for you\nBroke Harrington is a sociologist at the Copenhagen business school in Denmark several years ago she decided to explore the secret lives of billionaires\nStrategy become a wealth manager [noise] roof discovered that in order to manage money for the super rich wealth managers learn a lot about the private lives of that clients and they're very different set of rules that govern their world [noise]\n\n... welcome to hidden brain thank you for having me on the show\nFor wealth managers to do their job broke I understand that they need to find out everything about it clients life not just appliance\nFinancial life but everything about their life give me some examples are the kind of compositions people have with wealth managers and the kinds of issues there bring up about that personal circumstances that might affect how their wealth has managed\nWell usually starts with what's called know your client activity so if you were to come to me I was me acting as the wealth manager I Would first asked to see some proof of identity like your passport and then we would talk about um what goals you had for your wealth\nAnd that begins a series of increasingly delicate an increasingly intrusive questions\nThen usually we get into whatever real reason is bringing you to me\nUm maybe you want to avoid your taxes maybe you really don't like your family that's surprisingly common among wealthy people\nFor example if you have a um a relative or if you yourself are engaging in some activity that might get you started it may not be illegal but it might be socially shameful that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about\nIf you have a son or daughter with a drug problem that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about there can also be issues like I think I'm headed for a divorce but I don't want my spouse to get half my assets how do I hide those assets\nPreferably offshore so that whatever is is legally provable as mine is such a small amount that it's not worth fighting about\nSo it's really interesting because these professionals in some way to get to know their clients better than the clients own family or friends or even their own spots\nYes it's it's apparently something of a cliche and the offshore world that\nThe average client is a a man in his fifties with a secret family somewhere might be a gay lover might be a common law wife and some children\nBut they're usually all sorts of secrets that these wealthy folks wish to keep hidden and that they have the additional privilege of being able to hire people to take care of in secret\nSo I understand you conducted about sixty five interviews in Eighteen countries for this book I'm telling me a little bit about the people you're meant to be a wealth manager you have to understand financial the law but this kind of ... also calls for a certain psychological make up about what kind of person becomes a wealth manager\nWill several of the people I spoke to describe themselves and only somewhat joke in terms of social workers for the rich [laughter]\nSo you you have to have a empathy and a desire to help people but also a very high tolerance for people who would otherwise seemed to be so extremely privileged that you might be otherwise inclined to smack them around and say snap out of it you're lucky\nYou write in your book about the extreme lengths that summer\nProvide services to their clients or you write about a manager named Eleanor in Geneva who said that one of her clients once called her from outside a restaurant in London tell me that story so this is one of the first stories\nThat I heard that really made my eyebrows raise it was\nA while I was training to be a wealth manager Eleanor told this story over lunch of receiving a phone call\nFrom a client who was in another country saying I've just lost my bracelet outside of a restaurant helped me find it\nAnd the client didn't identify the restaurants by name [laughter] so imagine having someone call you from another country I mean obviously the country was identified but not anything remotely approaching a location\nSo you have to sort of marvel at the maturity of the client expecting someone else to help her fix a problem like this but Eleanor somehow did she she determined where the client was\nAnd what exactly had been lost and got the local authorities on the case found the bracelet and build the client for all the time and apparently the client was happy\nTo pay ... there are sometimes a client's do make requests like this not because they're acting childish but because they actually have an ulterior motive they actually want to test the loyalties or ability off the wealth manager you tell the story of wealth management Hong Kong named David\nYes he he got a call early on in his relationship with the client in which the clients said that he was in Japan and he was meeting with a Japanese gentleman who had expressed a desire for smoked salmon and that this client had promised him I think a thousand scientists smoked salmon straight from the factory in Scotland\nAnd was now calling David saying get me the salmon\nAnd David said no I'm I'm your wealth manager not your fish monger and the clients I'd well today you're the fish longer and so David happens to know someone who knew the head of the smoked salmon factory in Scotland and he he fulfilled the clients wish and the client later told him I basically made up\nThat story I wasn't sitting across from a Japanese fellow who wanted a thousand side to smoked salmon I just needed to see that you had the connections and the will to do what I wanted one I wanted and not ask any\nQuestions one thing that I got from your book is that there are important ways in which the very rich a very much like the rest of us and ways in which they are not up so wealthy people unsurprisingly turn out to have troubled marriages and we were children just like you know everybody else\nBut but wells you argue Ken compound those challenges\nWell apparently it's it's not uncommon for the wealth manager to be asked to find a recommend rehab facilities for kids\nWill last a wealth manager to break some bad news to the next generation to to his or her own children sometimes the the wealth manager has to broker a truce between feuding family members say one family member feels that they've been done done by unfairly\nIn the inheritance plan and has to be somehow brought back in so that they don't sue the family\nThe big risk here is if you have a disgruntled family member who sues the lawsuit process in many countries makes public many many private documents that would reveal the extent in nature of the family's wealth all of which has had been carefully guarded secrets\nGuest today is a sociologist broke\nShe spent years trying to understand the lives of people who are still hoping that they're able to circumvent the constraints of national laws and borders in the course

perspectives on Trump's supporters and their motivations and one paints a sympathetic picture focusing on class divisions and economic pain this\nIs a group that feels belittled and ignored and you know what some level they write\nThe other is more critical\nRace as we all know it's such a fundamental cleavage in our society I think Republicans are using it to their advantage [noise]\nJune Williams studies gender class and work in the United states just currently professor of law at the University of California Hastings College of law she's also the author of the book white working class overcoming class clueless miss in America Joan welcome to hit and bright\nDelighted to be here\nWe've heard a lot about the white working class since the twenty sixteen election I'm Wondering if you could paint a picture for me Joan of who you include in this group and how you distinguish them from the very wealthy and the poor\n[noise] um in order to understand American politics really for the past forty years you need to find three different groups\nOne is the poor on within meeting annual income of around I'm Nineteen thousand dollars\nThat's the bottom thirty percent of Americans buy household income and then the top the professional manager of the elite is the top twenty percent by household income um and I find that as top twenty percent in my household income with one college grad\nThe group that's being called the working class is the group in the middle it's the middle ... fifty three percent with the median household income in the in the seventies that's the group that's called the working class although they actually are the middle class\nYou have some startling statistics about wages in this middle group over the last half century or what's happened to them economically uh starting let's say Nineteen Seventy\n[noise] since Nineteen Seventy the wages and economic prospects of this group have absolutely tanked I'm actually more recent\nStatistics have come out since the book and the most dramatic is that virtually all Americans born in the Nineteen forties did better than their parents virtually all\nBut today it's less than half and this is the group whose economic prospects has really collapsed\nOne of them had showed up with a shopping bag from Macy's um and she was furious because she felt you know she's on\nPublic assistance and she can shop at Macy's and hike I Can't even afford shop at Macy's so that was part of it\nI'm also ... ... she was very angry when the ... she was in head start she was teaching in ... as a head start teacher some of these um ladies were late and she was furious because she had to pay a dollar a minute\nTo her daycare which she paid for when she was late picking up her kid and they were making her late and they weren't paying white Americans white blue collar Americans tend to have quite a judgmental attitude towards the poor\nAnd they're judgmental attitude stems from their own self image of themselves as\nKeeping their nose clean keeping on the straight and narrow hard work everyday forty years straight whereas the poor are seen as kind of hard living drug\nSex rock and roll\nUm didn't have the self discipline and now I have to pay for them [noise]\nJones as working class people have come to a few but government benefits and government programs are not for them\nWhen her own working class father in law started to suffer from dementia Joan suggested to her mother in law that you apply for somehow\nHer reaction was striking [noise]\nMade her reaction was oh I'm not even gonna bother to ask the government doesn't care about hardworking people like us it just cares about the poor\nUm and in fact you know we urged her and she did get um government help when my father in law had dementia and they deliver it to help and they deliver it quite efficiently but it was that was not her assumption\nKnow it doesn't hurt job to know that it's the job of the people were designing the programs and of the political elite to make sure that Americans know that and they have seriously dropped the ball\nOne of the things that people have often noticed is that there is a political gap between urban areas in rural areas but one of the things I took away from your book is it the gap is really between people who are cosmopolitan and their outlook and people who are not how's it going to be people who are burning\nUndone or Shanghai but they're also people in the u._k. and in the U.S who are routed to that community in a way that's very different and in some ways they resent the people who will cost a politician because they can pick up and leave and they don't have sort of the same ties are the same obligations to local communities that they feel that they do\n[noise] um that's very very true I mean there is that it does map on to class but breaks it and Trump's election we're both a revolt of the areas that had been left behind\nFor example if you look at the ... the counties that voted for Clinton roughly five hundred counties did\nI'm twenty six hundred counties voted for Trump but the five hundred counties that voted for Clinton represent two thirds of GDP\nThe twenty six hundred counties that voted for Trump represent only one third\nThe people who voted both for brags it and for Trump where those people who were left behind economically\nAnd left behind culturally as you point out because these are people who have these small very localized very deep and rooted um clique networks of family and friends they've known forever\nThey actually social science studies show that this group is more focused on um community and solidarity\nIn contrast to the professional managerial lead toward more focused on individual achievement and self development\n[noise] when you think about the ways a blue collar America and the elites relate to the work uh I I Want to go back in some ways to the the exchange said your husband had way of his former classmate\nIn some ways by asking what do you do a elites are asking what another yes it's a it's a form of social display\nBut it's also a former saying work is really how you define who you are it's an important part of your identity whereas as you point out in the book for blue collar America work is really a means to an end\n[noise] work is what you do to support your family\nUm so it's complicated hard work is valued among both groups and that's one of the key ways we should begin to forge a bridge between these two groups\nBut the hard work is a matter of ... of of persevering and staying in that job despite the fact that you make kind of hate it\nIn order to support your family and provide them with a settled family life\nOn elites are completely defined by their jobs you know what am I I Am a lawyer I and a\nTechie I'm just total self definition in terms of your job is one of the emblematic elements of the elite many people maybe blue collar folks think um the elite is just a bunch of\nSort of pathetic power hungry pencil pushers who spend their whole life sucking up to each other and confused their jobs with their lives [noise]\n\nThere's also a huge class divide when it comes to the value of education many roasted do people believe that education is the key to a better life that if you want to get ahead you need to get a good education but as you point out on the book Joan this idea is a much more controversial idea among the white working class white\n[noise] going to college is really really risky for these groups um first of all of course college debt is what quadrupled I'm In recent years so it's very risky too\nThere's very much higher dropout rate among class migrants people from non elite um backgrounds I'm so often they end up\nPaying back large college debts on the wage of a high school graduate and they see that they see it as a very very risky in addition that they they typically don't get in to the same colleges and social science studies show that\nUh if you give people an identical school record and one from an elite family in one from a ... a white working class family that white working class family\n... kid has to actually be about three times as good as a delete family kid in order to get to be seen as equally strong\nIt doesn't end there in one study Jones says researchers sent out to satchel resumes to employers the resumes what identical except for one difference\nOne set off um blue collar signals like pick up soccer like country music the other set off elite signals water polo classical music or Mr water polo got sixteen times the number of call backs as Mr country music\nSay you may go through all of this process encourage all of\nThis debt and then because you know so to speak you don't know what four to use you may not get I'm a ... a professional job anyway [noise]\nJoan Williams argues that these class differences rooted not just an economic hardship but in psychological shame and

of immigrant families in the United states do these families as you point out a calling for a relatively small\nShare of the voting population and in some ways this is the source of the friction intention that's the heart of your book\nThat's right and you know I think part of it is that is an issue that is easily understood by the public uh the fact that undocumented immigration is a very easy issue in the sense that\nIt for the average American voter or you can understand somebody who breaks the law and enters the country without proper documentation and that is a violation of our laws in orders that that can easily animate people\n... and it seems to me that's closely connected would walk polls show Marissa half of white Americans seem to believe that immigrants are a burden to us society and it's like majority saying that Latinos out to the crime problem\nThat's right and again if you actually look at the data itself right those those perceptions are not the reality particularly when it comes to crime so\nJust like many things that's happening right now in politics what people perceive what the truth is and what the facts are are very different from what the actual evidence is\n[noise]\nRapid demographic shifts ... and high not argue have created feelings of threat among white voters especially the white working class [noise] these threats come in different forms [noise]\nEconomic threat as far as I'm concerned they're stealing draws political track\nWhy Republicans on the hill understand the threat of these policies posed to the country and to them\nSo you have multiple trends happening at the same time on the one hand you have\nRapid demographic shift you also have these increasing feelings of threat among many white voters and simultaneously you also have a six\nBeing more responsive to the anxiety of white voters than the other one\nThat's right I think the Republicans have really\nTaken all of these multiple factors into consideration and used it to capitalize on a central message in theme that can really again mobilize their voters and the fact that their base is overwhelmingly white means that they can have a central message such as immigration\nThat can activate and mobilize their voters into not only supporting their candidates but also supporting the kinds of issues that they want to advocate for\nThere's been some criticism that well this is a short term strategy and if they're gonna they're going to suffer in the future and that may be the case but for the president it's an extremely successful strategy as we've seen\nYou've also looked at what happens in states as the demographics of states start to change so as the Latino populations in states judge to increase for example what do you find in terms of the behavior of white voters [noise] well what\nYou typically see is that as the population of a\nLatino voters have increased you start to see the shift in the political behavior of white voters to support the Republican candidate and uh\nThat would be consistent with the theory that immigration is explaining the voting preferences of white voters you know we wrote this book before the twenty sixteen elections so\nFor better or worse some would say that it was ... into the eye of the outcome but it was just remarkable to us that when we were putting together this this book and the our analysis is that from all these different angles not just of you know I'm\nCool white voters supported but also the kinds of policies that they favor that it was really just that immigration was such a strong and important predictor and all of these different a political outcomes that we were exploring and so\nI think that's where this idea that it was really this white backlash towards immigration that currently the political climate we live in today [noise]\n[noise]\nWhen we come back what ... opera hunters thesis about a white backlash means for politics and

Smith says that Trump was in trying to attract all voters across the United states he knew exactly what demographic and what base he was speaking to and so again with these kinds of\nEmotional appeals that are tied to a specific group of individuals\nThat pitch that message resonated as we all know now extremely well with his supporters and I think it was compounded also by the fact that we had eight years in Obama presidency and so it's immigration also tied in with the issue of race and this is why\nThe subtitle of our book is immigration race and politics because the two things ... it'd be at least in the context of the United states they go hand in hand with one another and so you have\nEight years of the presidency of the first African American person in this country coupled with at the specific campaign message of immigration a altogether tongue in a lot of that racial resentment that happened in the past eight years\nI think it just is what galvanized his campaign and his presidency\nSo one one disturbing implication from your thesis Morris says heading to a situation where we have different political parties for people of color and people who are white or an an increasingly what this means is that our political divide become racial divide\nIndeed and that that I one of the ah again more pessimistic outcomes of this research is that really\nYou know race as we all know it's such a fundamental cleavage in our society but I think also Republicans willingly took on that strategy and are using it to their advantage clearly [noise] there's an interesting tension\nHere it seems to me for both the Democratic party and the Republican Party you know we we alluded to there was some time earlier but what might be in the interest of each party in the short term might not be\nAn interest in the long term can can you talk about that from the point of view of both the Democratic party and the Republican Party\nShore I mean for the Republican Party right now they're an overwhelmingly white party and as we know with the way demographics are shifting in the United states we're going to become increasingly\nA majority minority country that at some point that strategy is going to be short lived right so but again for the time being for the next five to ten years it works so I I I think their senses well let's just go with it right they're not looking further beyond\nTwenty Thirty years from now on the other hand the problem that Democrats faced as yes they're the most diverse party that more diverse than Republicans but one thing that they really are struggling with is that the voting behavior of voters of color different is a sense", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hidden Brain", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "28", "locations": [["U.S",

straightforward explanation we use our upbringing and life experiences as a basis for a political beliefs we imagine\nThat our parents teachers in friends shape our views on everything from taxes and

elect\nThis week on hidden brain how the partisan divide in our country might arise not just from our upbringing and lived experiences\nFrom biology [noise]\nOn a regular basis right before an election someone was Sharon article with me about how\nScience proves that the brains of liberals are stunted or post on Twitter was say Republicans are less intelligent than Democrats\n[noise] these claims obscures something far more interesting and far more accurate there are genuine psychological differences between liberals and conservatives understanding these differences can give us fresh insight into our political conflicts\nJohn ... is a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln he\nHas spent many years studying the psychological and newer logical differences between liberals and conservatives he is co author of the book predisposed liberals conservatives and the biology of political differences John welcome to hidden brain thank you Shankar pleasure to be with you\nWhen most of us think about how we came to our political views John we have a relatively straightforward explanation that has to do with our upbringing and background how does that\nTheory go well\nWhenever asked my students were their political views come from the first thing I say as our parents\nAnd I think we have the sense that those views that our parents have passed along or supplemented by those you know from a clergy member a trusted relative\nNow it's important to stipulate you know John that it's entirely possible these our politicians they might indeed be saying things that are just politically strategic but how my differences in threat perception shaped the way liberals and conservatives in general think about the subject of immigration\nYeah I really think you know immigration defense or police law and order I think this is really at the core of of who we are and at the core of political differences\nSo you know if I Am a person like Wayne LaPierre who uh who feels these threats and thinks they're all around us then it seems to me I Would want a set of policies put forward by our government that helps to reduce those threats and how am I going to do this\nI'm going to do it by allowing people to be well armed I'm going to do it by spending a lot on defense I'm going to empower police or I'm going to have the death penalty I'm going to not allow immigrants to come here or if they do they're going to be extremely vetted as the president wants to\nSo you know those I think to a threat sensitive mindset are steps that you know they only makes sense is that they can't really understand why anybody would be opposed to those kinds of things because this would help us to be a safer place than\nWe\nAre now there are all kinds of confounding factors when it comes to studying how politicians speak in the actual of a political considerations that are difficult to disentangle from psychological and biological traits but John another study these differences in experimental settings\nJohn one showed liberals and conservatives positive and negative pictures\nAnd he found they reacted very differently\nA positive picture it'd be something like a beautiful sunset or somebody enjoying themselves on a ski slope I'm happy child a negative picture would be things like I'm a house or just been leveled by a hurricane or a guy eating worms or children who are malnourished\nWe had people hooked up to some physiological devices I'm the most obvious one is a electoral journal activity or skin conduct tents which is a common way of seeing if somebody's just having a reaction having\nA physiological arousal to that a stimulus and what we found is that uh people do have arousal when they see these kinds of images because they're they have some emotional content\nBut we tend to find that liberals were more reactive to the positive images and conservatives are more reactive to the negative images\nI understand that in one brain imaging study that you've conducted volunteers was shown disgusting images and brain activation from even a single image was actually pretty good at being able to tell who was liberal and who is conservative that is true then uh\nEarns of liberals and conservatives is different and the one that we did that goes back to kind of our favorite thing was to show them these these different kinds of pictures actually we have the most luck with a picture of mutilation uh and and you're right when we did that it was very easy to categorize people\nYou know without knowing anything about them all of a good look at was the brain scan results and we could be incredibly\nAccurate knowing whether they're liberal or conservative just on the basis of that\nLiberals brains when they looked at a mutilation images were much more active in a part of the brain called the U.S to matter of sensory too\nAnd that's the part of the brain that will will be activated if you suffer pain so if if I take him in the ... century tree would be active but it's also active if you see pain and others and so if you would see a movie of somebody stepping on a rocky now goes right through their foot you're some at a center to it'd be active\nAnd what we saw in these in these brain scans was that liberals were more likely to have activation medicines for two and conservative doesn't mean that conservatives are hard hearted\nUh just means that things are happening differently when they see these different images\nNow you could argue that a lot of this research is Carl ... you could also argue that a lot of the patterns to John and others find are consistent with the power of upbringing in shaping political preferences\nHere's how let's see I'm raised in a conservative home I learned to be politically conservative from my parents like my family also influences all kinds of other things about me that have nothing to do with politics the shape the kind of food I like to eat the kind of movies I like to watch the kind of sports I enjoy\nBy this line of reasoning the fact that liberals and conservatives are different on all manner of things is it about biology it just shows you how your family environment can affect lots of things about you [noise]\n\nThere's a really interesting way to separate the effects of biology from the environment and think about fraternal an identical twins identical twins have identical genes fraternal twins has similar but not identical jeans\nIf you fall into a group of fraternal an identical twins\nEach twin parents raised in the same household\nEach ... each the same food listens to the same conversations watches the same movies now if you find differences between identical twins as it grew\nAt fraternal twins as a group that suggest that biology not environment is the driver\nI asked John what some studies revealed about political preferences\nWe were fortunate to have access to a data sets a very large loads of thousands and thousands of of twin Paris collected by a guy named Linda ... have\nNot long ago it's fairly dated data set a but it was a valuable one for us because it included lots of information about their political views and when we subject these data to the standard twin design approach we did and did a fine that their political views were quite heritable\n[noise] um although people oftentimes must read this our results suggested that maybe thirty or forty percent of our political views or come from a genetic but known that bothered a lot of people and this was quite a controversial study and political science many people didn't like that at all\nUh and they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was was genetic but you know if it's thirty four percent genetic that obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component\nIs not zero but apparently that was enough that at some people were upset about that\nAnd so you you basically you're able to town in some ways that there is a closer link in the political orientation of identical twins then in the political orientation of fraternal twins and that tells you\nMatt ... element of genetics that is driving political preferences\nExactly no that's well put an end again it's nice to compare political views with other kinds of things height for example turns out to be about eighty percent\nOr heritable when you see these you know when you subject to the same kind of designed personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent I Would say [noise]\nOne of the big implications of all this work besides just being interesting in itself is that it helps us I think think about the political conflicts we have which fresh inside\nA and and you've made the case that in many ways the more we're able to see the differences between groups of people as inherent or biological in some ways it changes the way we think about those differences talked to me about that idea\nYes when other traits have been understood to be biological I'm thinking of something like hand enough you know we used to think that uh if you were left handed that was just because you got into a lazy habits\nMy father was left handed and the teacher you know this long ago would beat him on the on the hand with a ruler whenever he wrote with his left hand train them to write with his right hand so we do that as as a ... something that need to be driven out uh of course now we understand that being left handed is very biological\nThis is something much deeper than just a a lazy habits\nOr or course you know the big one today would be sexual orientation when people uh realize that sexual orientation is a indeed biologically driven and not something that they just have decided to do a then people are much more tolerant of that so we were wondering if perhaps the same thing might happen with regard to politics\nIf we realize that our political opponents were not simply being a lazy but rather what oriented to the world in a different fashion that maybe we would be a little bit more tolerant of them\nThat this is the only way we're going to get anywhere for at least understand where they're coming from even if we still might deeply disagree with their conclusions\nWhat would you say to critics who would say you know the the argument that psychological traits in biological differences are beneath our deep political conflicts doesn't make sense because\nWe didn't always have this deep divide in our country\nBetween liberals and conservatives there was a time when we had many many more people in the center of the most liberal Republican was often to the left of the more most conservative Democrat and you know there really has been a shortage of the political parties in recent years what explains this change especially over the last twenty Thirty years [noise]\nWhat I Would say to that argument is that I Believe we have always had\nThis very same division this very basic difference between people who are fairly sensitive to threats I think we need to be vigilant and those people who are more into experimentation and try new things [noise]\nI'm Ralph Waldo Emerson has a great quote I'm Sorry I Can't give it to you for bait on but it's basically that a division between those people who are supporters of tradition and those people who are supportive of the innovation is very old and a structure the world since time began\n[noise]\nJohn hitting is a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln here spent years studying the psychological\nA newer logical differences between liberals and conservatives along with Kevin Smith and John ... he's the co author of the book predispose liberals conservatives and the biology of political differences John thanks for joining me today on hidden brain [noise] thank you Shankar it was a pleasure to be with you [noise]\nSlavery per se wasn't calling for abolition at that point but he didn't want to see slavery expand and that was a very controversial issue and many southerners who believe that the only way to maintain slavery was for it to continue to expand to maintain political balance between free states and slave states\nThey couldn't really tolerate the idea that the president the United states would oppose the expansion of slavery and so although he was elected and I think they recognize that he was elected in the science fair and square\nThey just couldn't accept him as president and so what you see is they're putting a policy issue in this case an entire world view and way of life revolving around the evils of slavery\nThey put that head of the democracy so now the conflict just defense into rancor and violence and so I think it's an important lesson of how our differences can be a source of strength that they can also be in a credible source of weakness in the question\nIs do we have something in common that's holding us together most in most of American history the answers but yeah and that moment in history the answer was unfortunately absolutely no [noise]\n\nI'm Wondering is one of the things you're implying when you talk about the difference between productive and destructive conflict is that when people have productive conflict there actually\nWilling to say I believe very strongly that I'm right\nBut I Want to at least concede the possibility that maybe there are others who have something of that the all ... it may be that history will show\nIn the future Twenty years from now there is something that I don't know and I'm Wondering if if this is potentially one of the implications of what you're talking about which is the difference between productive and destructive conflict\nIs that an productive conflict people say there's a chance that I could be wrong sometime in the future I think that's correct I think that's true but even if they don't think that could be wrong there's this sense that if you believe in democracy so much there's only so far you're willing to go\nAnd so you know if you think another analogy would be in a family he writes a family we have every family people fight they quarrel they disagree about all sorts of things but if there is love and the family the conflict only goes so far the love breaks down than actually the conflict convict the family part [noise]\nMara see what tested again when we come back the political upheavals are the Nineteen sixties\nAnd ... echoes today [noise]\nYou're listening to

down and I think the point that you're making is truly well made which is that king wrapped himself in the flack you wrap themselves in this ideal of the American democracy and that potentially is what made the cockpit productive\nRight so look you know there were a lot of things he was concerned about but he said let's take these principles and actually try to see if we can all live by them\nMm Mm Mm\nI think we need to remember American democracy is\nFar from perfect but it is extraordinarily resilient and his generated tremendous progress economic progress social progress

it that so fascinates us about these moments in life at the University of Chicago psychologist Nick Epley thinks he might have one answer\nHe's the author of the book mind wise to understand how after he thinks about coincidences I Need to take a moment and explain his broader worked to your first [noise] at least book exam and how we read the mental states and intentions of other people [noise]\nThis is a remarkably useful skill ugly sometimes miss apply it\nWe sometimes attribute intention allergy to things that aren't even living [noise] especially when they're out of the ordinary for example we don't personify a sunny day but we give hurricanes I'm name Katrina Sandy Andrew [noise] after Hurricane Katrina\nThe mayor of New Orleans said God must be mad at America\nFor centuries people have described in ... to natural force is we think storms droughts and earthquakes must have a mind set around\nThis general tendency to explain behaviors in terms of purpose or intent or or meaning is often quite a successful thing to do\nTurns out we live with other people who do have intentions and goals and foresight and planning and meaning behind their actions and so by and large that tendency to make those kinds of attribution to other people is a good way to learn about each other as a good way to explain why are the people did something in the past\nTo predict how they're likely to behave in the future but the problem\nWith any kind of good tool is that sometimes we use it a little too much and that's what happens in these cases where you're trying to explain the behavior of something that doesn't really have\nA sensible explanation for some random event some chance occurrence some physical anomaly some weather pattern or that crops up that might not in fact have have in mind behind that\nThis is why we're fascinated by robots that move in unpredictable ways what we found was that when people were given a description of an object that made it sound unpredictable\nLike you couldn't anticipates its actions that's when people described it or reported that it had more mental states they were more willing to say that the object has a mind of its own that it has intentions for instance\nAnd I don't think this is totally counter intuitive that that is a mind if you if you see for instance uh billiard ball sitting on a table\nAnd other ball comes along and hits it and that ball rolls off and the predicted direction where you don't\nYou don't need anything to explain that but if you've got a ball sitting on the table and suddenly starts rolling around randomly\nWell then you've got something to explain in these cases sometimes people look to the inside of an agent give it a mind maybe the ball is possessed maybe there's a demon controlling it a moving it around the table sometimes people attribute of mind to something when it's not there but they do that as an effort to explain\nAgent and they're more likely to do that when an age of behave somewhat unpredictably\nI was over at a friend's house and uh my friend has a wonderful pool and um he had set up\nThis underwater Roomba for the lack of a better term to clean the bottom of the pools are the rules around the bottom of the pool and it goes into completely random fashion right so just runs a couple of hours that's cleaning the bottom of the pool and\nI find myself fascinated just watching it because the fact that you can't predict what it's going to do next makes it just more interesting and more a lot even away then something that moves in a very predictable fashion\nAbsolutely something that moves robotically very predictably that is just a mindless machine but when you're rumors going around randomly well\nNow it wants to go over there a little bit not wants to move over here and now it realizes that didn't clean that side of the pool over there are things that we have randomly start to get a little sense of of mine that people are crazy you don't\nYou don't think it's like your mother writer or your your ... your uh you know your spouse whose vacuuming or the living room but it starts to look just a little bit more mindful in fact the rumors are good example people\nActually do name that room but as you can buy outfits to address it up\nOr if you Google this uh online you'll find all kinds of examples of\nPeople thinking of their room buzz having perhaps a little bit more of a mind than it really does\nI Want to talk to that have been about the subject of coincidences and I thought of you and your work because it feels to me that when something unusual happens to us and we stopped and we say\nThat is weird I was just reading this word in a book a second ago and someone in the room around me mentions the very same word and and it makes you stop and look up just like I stop and look at that underwater Roomba\nAbsolutely that's a case where something unusual happens was unpredictable and you try to explain it you can explain\nThese kinds of random coincidences in lots of different ways there are lots of different kinds of causal structures we might be able to put on it um but some of them involve giving it more meaning that it actually has\n\nThis is what underwater ... have to do with coincidences like a robot that does something unexpected coincidences crowd for meaning or explanation because they are out of the ordinary we stopped to see patterns even when there aren't any\nMy favorite example of this in the world of psychology is actually phenomena first documented by my PHD advisor Tom Gilovich\nAnd a brilliant psychologist Amos traverse the illusion of the hot hand in fast [noise]\nBasketball players get on a real\nPeople believe that basketball players get hot and that there are times when they're on and the chance of making it fire after they've just made one then after they've just missed one\nAt least in saying basketball players don't have to treat he's saying we draw the wrong conclusion about district [noise] what's the magic that there are good shooter and they shoot fifty percent from\nSo we were originally looked at whether people name Denis or Denise gravitate toward dentistry but we learned pretty quickly that it's really hard to get data on those things so you know there aren't great director ease of medical professionals\nThere is a guy named able who was able to document that was a review on this paper and I said no every time you say this I'm going to just jump in and say a guy named able who was able to do something he was able to do a lot of things he showed that people whose last name is Dr or whose last name is the word lawyer named lawyer\nGravitated toward those two professions\nThere are lots of other examples Brecht looked at a massive database of millions of Americans names for the recently released Nineteen forty cents is joy examine if they were brought patterns like\nCarpenters working in carpentry bakers working as bakers butchers working as butchers\nMiners working as minor masons workings masons so we looked at every surname there is a currently at the top two thousands are names that happens to be a career name and we looked at all of them they're laughing at them that are pretty common I just listed a few and for every single surname in the Nineteen forty cents us with something like a\nI think it's a hundred and thirty million people we were able to show that for every single surname there was at least a week tendency for people to gravitate toward careers that perfectly matched their last names\nSo the obvious thing to say of course is that the reason you have a slightly larger number of carpenters be carpenters is that the name carpenter probably originated from families who were in carpentry and so there is some kind of ancestral connection to the profession that is driving both of names and the choices\nQuite possibly but if you do the math you pretty quickly say it gets to be a pretty tiny percentage of people so if you assume that even over ten generations there's a fifty percent chance that you did what your dad did and the fifty percent chance that you did what his grandfather did which is probably higher than reality\nYou're talking about a a probability of less than one thousand already over ten generations in other words surname are so old\nAnd they change hands you know when a woman named carpenter Marin County farmer for example that that's really it it really just can't account for an effect anywhere near this magnitude\n\nRent\nThem as looked at large data sets and public records check the Social Security death index or state marriage\nRecords databases with information about millions of Americans and he and his fellow researchers have seen all kinds of funny effects like for example one listener called in to say she and her husband we're both born on the twenty fifth day of different months this isn't as on communist you might think\nBeyond what you might expect by me a chance\nThere's about seven percent biased in that direction so if you should have a thousand people doing that you have a thousand Seventy people doing that\nIf that doesn't sound like a lot you're right you should think of emphasis eco terrorism as a tiny invisible nudge it won't shave for everyone does all the time but it does shape what some people do some of the time it's when you multiply these smaller effects over hundreds of millions of people that you start to see lots of examples\nBrett says that if you really love your butt day the effect gets even larger\nOr operational definition of really loving your birthday was getting married on your birthday number so have you got married on the thirteenth of the month you weren't quite a bit more likely to marry another person who also had the number Thirteen as his birthday number\nAgain Brett calls this an implicit bias for a reason you may not be consciously choosing things as important as your spouse or your profession or the place you call home based on arbitrary factors like your name or your birthday he thinks the bias comes about simply because we like our names in our butts days and have positive associations with that\nAnd so you just associate your name with all the wonderful things that come along with that uh and the the best bit of evidence I have that I've never bothered to publish this there's one part of people's names I don't like that much\nAnd that's their middle names you know the joke about that as the sole purpose of a child's middle name it's a no when he was really in trouble and my additional come as no if he might be a serial killer Sunday right in the middle name is not nearly as love this the first or the last name people feel very ambivalent about their middle name\nThey can be other reasons for ambivalence sometimes we dislike it with another person has the same birthday if you were born on April twentieth\nYou might hate the fact Hitler was born on that day to rectify instead of a consumer product happens to have your name on it but as poorly belt you are more likely to hate that product people dislike seeing something inferior in the world that has that name on it\n\nAs Britain and I were talking I realized something a little uncomfortable that I myself\nHad fallen prey to ... you know as you're talking right now I'm realizing something about myself for the very first time there is a there was a philosopher in India whose name was ... my name and he actually taught a philosophy that is known as a dancer and I I've always been drawn to the fact that\nI find the philosophy of event that would be very interesting and the fact\nThat Shankar I taught that philosophy I thought was just charming but now as I'm listening to you say this I'm realizing that this could just be implicit eagle\nRead has worked very well and it truly is wonderful it's brilliant so I think you have like a decision\nAt the same time it does make you think though that absolutely yes has this ever happened to you ... do you ever think about yourself and for the ... is affecting we're getting a little personal here but uh I I I Can't resist being a little bit personal I Would say probably the most dramatic example is that my son Matthew\nI'm his his last things Poland his mother's last name was pulling my lesson as Pelham and I entered a relationship with her before I developed this did not after I developed a theory to validate the so so your pal them and you got into a relationship with a woman named polling\nMuch as I said are you saying that the names played some kind of a role I I have\nTo think it did have to think and we were from different backgrounds different um different religions I mean where we come from very different worlds and yet I was very attracted to her\nAnd it was yes she was attracted to me right yeah [laughter]\nI said I and I understand why you would sort of called this charming and I think if you do this work for a while there is a certain smile that comes to your face as you sort of look at these connections and you sort of see you you understand sort of the choices that human beings make but I Do think there's something disturbing about it because I think\nThere is a very strong sense that I think most of us have I have the sense even though I've been covering the world of the unconscious mind for the last ten years\nI have the sense that my choice I'd deliberate choices that I've thought about that might have actually I'm making them intentionally and the idea that you're coming in and telling me that they had these hidden factors that come in and change how I think about myself and he's a disturbing idea\nIt is a little bit disturbing and of course most people do what you and I did which has said well of course that applies to the rest of all but I in particular but never fall prey to re implicit racial bias or implicit he gets his them so most of us do tend to sort of separate ourselves from even our own findings but\nI've become in the past decade or so comfortable enough for the study that I have to admit that I really never know for sure exactly why did something I mean sometimes I have a pretty good idea but I don't I certainly don't kid myself anymore to say that I even usually know why why do what I Do I mean there's just too much research and much of what you've documented in reporting on\nThat show that buys these were completely unaware of not just sometimes powerfully drive us in very\nParticular direction so I think I've just kind of let go of it ... it was disturbing to me when I first began to study it\nThe Serbian as well as delightful and now it's become more delightful unless disturbing\n\nSomehow you're wondering how does any of this matter [noise] who cares if people born or the twenty third of September married those born on the twenty third of July\nWho cares if someone named Betsy carpet gravitates to what's carpentry why does it matter if I prefer a philosopher whose name is similar to my own\nThat at least races tough questions about the degree to which we have free will so I think some people who have pretty negative reactions to this work are very threatened by it and the sense that it suggests that very important decisions\nHave at least a little nudging influence\nUm based on things that you're completely unaware of so people are more likely than they should be by chance to marry another person who happens to share their birthday number that's not an object of like a great reason to get married you should get married 'cause you shared values you're both Republicans you're both rabbit Marxist\nBut learning that these subtle little influences can affect what you do a\nApparently to some people's ... I find it delightful but some people find it pretty threatening I don't think that it proves that there is no such things free well but it to me it does suggest that we don't always have free will sometimes we make a decision\nFor one reason that we hold ourself when really the more powerful underlying reason is something we could have never put her fingers on\nAnd this isn't just a matter of being drawn to someone who shares your birthday in general we tend to prefer things and people who have something to do with us and that can be a big problem\nAbsolutely I Do a little bit of research on social justice and that's one of the things that concerns me most is that we tend to focus on people who are more like us who speak our language who speaker idiom\nWho look like us who worship like us and we have much less attention to the problem with people who don't on the other hand I think this this finding like any funding in psychology and behavioral economics can be used for good or evil and it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hidden Brain", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "14", "locations": [["Texas", 31.25044, -99.25061], ["Saudi Arabia", 25.0, 45.0], ["Istanbul", 41.01384, 28.94966], ["Saudi Arabia", 25.0, 45.0], ["Saudi Arabia", 25.0, 45.0], ["Britain", 41.66121, -72.77954], ["France", 46.0, 2.0], ["Saudi Arabia", 25.0, 45.0], ["Afghanistan", 33.0, 66.0], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Hebron", 31.52935, 35.0938], ["West Africa", 9.56, 44.065], ["Iraq", 33.0, 44.0], ["Paris", 48.85341, 2.3488], ["Vermont", 44.00034, -72.74983], ["Paris", 48.85341, 2.3488], ["France", 46.0, 2.0], ["Paris", 48.85341, 2.3488], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["New Orleans", 29.95465, -90.07507], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Roomba", 28.33214, -81.51863], ["Roomba", 28.33214, -81.51863], ["Marin County", 38.10742, -122.5697], ["Britain", 41.66121, -72.77954], ["India", 22.0, 79.0], ["Poland", 52.0, 20.0]], "not_found": [], "ep_coords": ["San Francisco, CA", 37.77493, -122.41942], "in_country": ["Texas", "Britain", "U.S", "U.S", "Washington", "Vermont", "America", "New Orleans", "America", "Roomba", "Roomba", "Marin County", "Britain"], "out_country": ["Saudi Arabia", "Istanbul", "Saudi Arabia", "Saudi Arabia", "France", "Saudi Arabia", "Afghanistan", "Hebron", "West Africa", "Iraq", "Paris", "Paris", "France", "Paris", "India", "Poland"], "in_state": ["Marin County"], "out_state": ["Texas", "Saudi Arabia", "Istanbul", "Saudi Arabia", "Saudi Arabia", "Britain", "France", "Saudi Arabia", "Afghanistan", "U.S", "U.S", "Washington", "Hebron", "West Africa", "Iraq", "Paris", "Vermont", "Paris", "France", "Paris", "America", "New Orleans", "America", "Roomba", "Roomba", "Britain", "India", "Poland"]}]
