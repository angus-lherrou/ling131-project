politics yeah from right and I'm just wondering where like you know what you think about um [noise] that notion mhm\nTo be\nThe next or to be like ...\nOur identity\nIs the most I Would say is the most intersection identity in the world so for example I'm Puerto Rican\nI Know that I Am African\nI Am indigenous\nAm also the product of European colonization\nI feel like to be like the ...\nAnd to fully acknowledge your identity and everything that goes into your identity means that we have to champion the causes of everybody in order to champion the causes of ourselves and so\nWhen you look at an issue like immigration for example\nThese aren't just quote unquote Mexicans coming in from the border these are\nThese are indigenous people\nAnd this is their land\nWhat were your mom and dad\nSpeaking to you and saying look Sunday Anita\n... he was proud like being a war was a message like look on Sunday or you're in New York or through and through however you want to define\nYourself you know I was\nVery strong sense of patriotism\nA very strong sense as we are American I also was raised as you are ... like through and through and\nSo I grew up like\nThe music I grew up around was Hector level sell the ACLU's and then hip hop in you know growing up around the\nBrand your favorite hip hop artist would be a boy so hard\nI grew up around like public enemy and knives Jay Z and then of course you have like this late nineties boom of I like your fat ... do you have big pond\nYou have all these people that we grew up around as well and so it's it's to be all of those things you know sometimes\nPeople say like oh wow you're\nThe way you articulate your platform is still intersection all\nAnd to me it's not even that we're trying it's\nAnd so what what it means to be American and what we grew up in like how we grew up on these values was my dad\nWe'd go visit family and what do they go every year but then we would drive to colonial Williamsburg what really yeah\nYou mean like for the weekend well I mean we would take a little family vacation and it would be like ... and you were young yeah those are like a two places where we went on family she cried\nWell and that's\nHow do you manage that as being a young enough\nYou know a lot of people don't know if they you know it's not like you're walking around member of Congress dreamy risk you know what I\nAm and at the same time knowing that you're going to be in Congress I\nThink I'm Still processing a lot of that four months ago or five months ago I was completely anonymous or just like any other New Yorker no one cared about me [laughter] so just like psychologically that's been at the process but\nHad a friend come over a couple of months ago\nAnd there was a magazine that had my face on the cover of it with a bunch of other faces in terms of political developments of or political ideas of twenty teens and she looked at it and we were laughing at it because it doesn't feel like this isn't my\nFavorites is an island but we're laughing at it\nAnd she says that's what you are you're in idea now\nAnd I felt like\nHad to be perfect or else I was going to be letting our community down\nSo that may be resist or an interesting question how are you managing your ego 'cause I mean the truth is is that\nYou're getting all kinds of call backs right and what do the kind of mind games that it can play because I'm sure it's also exciting to be on the cover of a fabulous magazine or a great photo shoot and all of that but at the same time it's also lonely\nIt is and if any thing\nThere are some ways in which I was more confident before the primary\nIn my brain and in my heart\nI feel very grateful and I feel very humbled but a lot of the sixth grades is terrifying\nI feel like I have this huge target\nBecause I'm embodying\nSome of the most vulnerable people in society\nThe issues that I'm Talking about or not read versus blue\nThey're just not their top versus bottom and so\nI still struggle with even conceiving\nThe idea of getting a call back like\nSometimes I talk to our team and I'm like do you think so and so would respond to us now like yeah of course and I'm like will they or I still worry about people showing up to my that\nThere was an article I think it was in the New York or were they made a point of rain out that when you talk to your kids you come down to their level mhm and I was thinking about that also in terms of the way you you said you know you talk to people you approach them you come in and you'll touched them you'll be in your yeah\nAre you thinking about it more as like well this is a really affect a political tactic world\nFeel like I learned it from my parents\nAnd when I reflect on my life experience I think of my my parents were\nFunnily enough my parents were never political\nYou know my family would always come over and we would talk politics around\nThe kitchen table but my parents never\nOrganized or did anything like that\nWhen I think about my experience I think of my parents are natural organizers they were so good at building community\nWas a public school\nThirty minutes north in a small town in West Chester\nKind of class experience because in any affluent area there is an underclass of people who serve the people who live there\nAnd that's what my family was my mom clean the houses\nThe kinds of people that I went to school and\nMy dad really struggled to start his own small business\nTo help support our family but it was always struggling\nAnd so my mom would invite\nThe cashiers from the local Dunkin' Donuts over to the house\n... going to talk because those are the people that are family could relate to [noise]\nThey were always about leaning in\nAnd the politics comes back and\nAnd that's how I practice as well\nEven though I feel very strongly about my beliefs\nMy number one job is to care about people and to lean into them\nShow them that they are cared for\nAnd make them feel hurt because I Am hearing them\nWhat is your puppy same to you when you're hearing your dad\nI think [noise]\nIt's like I'm so close although\nI'm Sorry no it's All right that's right oh my gosh\nNo it's okay what is the prime tell me what your\nUm just because it's like\nNo one's asked me that question\nSo\nIt's weird because like I guess I'm not\nA process thing this has you're asking me but it's like um\nIt's like having someone walking with you the whole time and there's some ... and then like you're going months and months and months and no one's acknowledging the person next to you and then it's like oh what does this guy I think\nSo it's it's a little emotional but um\n[noise]\nThe last thing\nMy dad ever told me before he passed away\nWas make me proud\nAnd for a really really really long time\nI felt like I felt\nLike I had failed my parents because of the situation we're in my dad had passed away my mom was back to cleaning houses I was tending bar and waiting tables and I felt like\nAnd\nIs like what wash\nI don't even know I feel like my dad would be like what have you gotten yourself and\nWhy we must file to ... yeah but\nWill be smiling she'd be smiling I saw two [noise]\nBoth in\nSociety and was in her family is and that's just not realistic at all and so I just want them to know that [noise]\nI Know that they exist\nIt's okay it's okay to be who they are\n[noise]\n\nThank you for putting it into words Eric ... we really really appreciate your work thank you so much I really appreciate your interview\n[noise]\nErica ... is the author of the New

other Latino demographic in New York City it's all about the data out data points can help us understand the future of young Latinos in New York and beyond stay with us something about you

Latinos are navigating higher education and we looked at how one university Oregon State is trying to combat the troubling trend of Latinos not finishing college\nAnd a couple of weeks ago we looked at the future of warehouse jobs many of which are filled by young Latinos and ... and we wondered whether or not these jobs offer a path\nTo the middle class [noise] [noise] these stories were part of a partnership with the community service society of New York a nonprofit that among other things conduct demographic research\nTo help in their mission of fighting poverty in New York City [noise] their data helped bring you the stories and today I'm sitting down with lives are ... he's the organizations director of youth policy to talk about some of that data that they've gathered about Latinos and education in New York City over the last year\n... ... ...\n... lives are when I first met you you were like proudly the geek you were like look I Love data I Love numbers the whole world makes sense to me because of data and numbers and there are a lot of you out there and the world [laughter]\nAbsolutely I think we live in times where what people are talking about can be a little bit uncertain and I find comfort in basing some of the things I talk about on real facts and figures\nOkay so every person who loves data has a story behind it you like this really wonderful story about what inspired you to do this kind of research\nAnd data so what's the ...\nThat particular line of work that we're talking about\nStems from one day I went with my\nParents I'm guessing about ten years ago to see the terrific show in the heights\nSuffer Washington Heights in the wake of the day you wake up but I got this little plug\nBecause I actually grew up in Washington Heights where the shows about ... a Broadway musical by ...\nI mean I thought it\nWas a terrific show and displayed in all the glory of Washington Heights with some differences to the community I grew up in it showed three communities within Washington Heights\nDominican Mexicans and Puerto Ricans all living together and most interesting to me dancing to the same music all listening to salsa\nWhereas my experience to having grown up in Washington Heights that wasn't exactly the case it is a predominantly Dominican community and actually never heard sauce until I went to college so I started thinking about while I thought it was really great that the show put the communities on the map there is a diversity\nWithin the Latino community that as a policy wonk myself\nI wondered if it wasn't getting out that actually the the different communities within\nLatino Americans in between the New Yorkers aren't being showcased enough so I started digging into the date a little bit to see well\nIf I were to tell a slightly different story that there are real differences among the different Latino communities what would that mean for the new policy field that I work and\nSo what did you find what surprised you ...\nWorking in New York City schools and it and the policy field\nSo much of your policy when it came to dealing with Latino you dealt with issues of English as a second language and English language learners and the first thing that jumped out at me was that you've got three really distinct communities of Latinos in New York the three major groups of Puerto Rican Dominican and Mexicans and\nThe largest one Puerto Rican New Yorkers really have no English language learner issues over Ninety percent\nOf young people of Puerto Rican orange and in New York speak English as their main are are are best language and are born in New York City\nSo I started to think well if the policy\nOne issue what are some other differences that we could find and then once I started to dig a little deeper a lot of new things started to come to the surface about differences and the communities both in ways that make them great and the ways that we can support them to be even better\nRight so I really I Love this particular point that Dominican women have higher college graduation rates in New York City than any other demographic in the Latino population so what's it like that\nIt's really interesting I think there are a lot of questions that are raised and a lot we can learn from particularly in comparison to to some other groups but Tina non Latino one thing we think is that the Dominican community in New York like in Washington Heights\nInteresting in that you have a lot of groups from different incomes living together because it's a relatively new or immigrant group best we prepare to Puerto Ricans\nThe schools that are majority Dominican schools you have both lower and higher income families\nFrom Dominican origins and what we find is that when you have mixed schools around socio economics\nThe culture pervades all the different groups in the school for the college going culture of the middle and higher income Dominican families really pervades the lower income families as well which is why in those schools you really see much more of a college going culture\nAnd among women in particular which is it's real bright spot\n\nNow in comparison to Puerto Rican community in New York has been here much longer and you find that some higher and middle income Puerto Ricans for the New York and other parts of the country aren't living in the same neighborhoods [noise] so where there are some concentrated Puerto Rican communities in areas of New York you're not having those mix of incomes in the school and the costs going culture may not be as strong [noise]\nMeeting ... still there's a whole conversation Ron desegregation of data it sounds like a very technical thing what would it really means is when you're taking big data and you're kind of making it into smaller bite sized pieces\nIs that a conversation that is being had regarding Latinos and lacking in the United states increasingly I think we're seeing the value of diversity in our analysis\nAnd now I think the next step is we're such a diverse community within Latinos how do we really show the differences within them and a show the needs and strengths and different communities and we're really on and exciting frontier as people start to think about diversity and identity differently on the United states census\nBureau's animal Community Survey which is really the baseline survey that we use for so much of our work\nThere's a question about race and then there's the next question about ethnicity so in race people are largely answering whether they considered themselves white black or an Asian background or other and then the next question is are you Hispanic\nAnd based on what community they come from we start to see real changes in how different groups of Hispanics people answer the race question\nAnd that's when I think open up a whole new understanding of how race and identity are interacting with some of the current conversations that we're having that is really again or allowed us to desegregate things in a very interesting way both interesting intellectually but then I think as we have", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Latino USA", "city": "San Francisco", "day":

forklift truck simulator two thousand and on social [laughter]\n... this is a forklift simulator game\nI guess the world is overrun with boxes of pipes and it's up to me to stop the infant dish\nIt's like a video of like people playing you know plus on Youtube videos of themselves playing games yeah and then they other people I Love to watch yeah I don't understand why but yes yeah it's like a whole thing I don't get it you know but like this has seven hundred thousand views and it's just like this dude\nAnd like driving a forklift around and trying to think about the night\nBut other places yeah but when I think it's funny to you and I want to show you that it's like if you look at the comments\nSome people are like giving ... like I drive a forklift and they don't go super fast that feels like they do when you're in close quarters and warehouses maybe thirty five forty miles per hour someone else's I keep your forks low to the ground when traveling like under six inches high prevents loads from ... off the forks I'm a forklift driver\nI got all these people they're commenting like actually drive ... and the reason I ended up watching this weird Youtube video is that I've been spending a lotta time doing research on the future of shots and the economy and in fact I found out that a lot\nOf our future jobs involve forklifts and that's because one of the fastest growing industries in our country today is the industry of moving and storing staff especially stuff that we order online [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you remember Patterson, California has all of these warehouses over by the highway and it's a perfect place for them it's empty flat and just a quick hour and a half to San Francisco\nOne of those warehouses if Amazon\nEvery shop to them to see if I could come take a look around and\nAnd visiting the facility\nGave me a sense of what the future of warehousing will actually look like at the commerce gross especially when it comes to increased automation [noise]\nAs I entered the building bears justice wall of turnstiles floor to ceiling kind that you see in the New York city subway\nAnd there are signs everywhere that said no photos\nOnce a guard left me and I realize it's free time tons of employees are streaming out through the airport security style scanners\nThey have just under ...\nWe also have way more than a hundred times\nI get a tour of the facility from Danny to for you to introduce herself as a community specialist I'm not\nSure what that means in fact there's a lot of Amazon specific language I hear on my tour Amazon calls are warehouses fulfillment centers they call all their workers associates\nEntry level jobs are known as tier one and over and over again I keep hearing the phrase fulfilling our customer promise workers were\nWalking around there or stop signs in a lot of places and lines on the ground like roads which is good because\nWe will be another way of ADD stage IV these\nGuided vehicles basically it's like a forklift loaded up with items but it's totally unmanned and it follows a map of the warehouse floor programmed into it\nEverything in this warehouse is yellow and gray except for another kind of robot that works here they're bright orange\nWhen you think of robots as isn't always but people have in mind this is Lauren\nLynch who does communications for Amazon [noise] they're\nPerson shaped robots more like big orange room because\nThey're square and on top of each of them is a set of shelves which holds item operate in\nSay somebody really wants to order a back massager they click it online\nOnce they do that that's when the item gets\n...\nProvided them\n\nAnd they wanted me\nTo pick the back massager a\nSecond worker calls the orange robots over retrieves massager from shelf and then puts it on the yellow tray\nKind of like those airport security traits which go on a conveyor belt\nThat we're going to go and\nIs what it sounds\nBasically the ... comes in\nThis is a place where someone gets to see all the secrets of what we order online\nAnd today that someone is a very peppy ... what are you\nI Can't keep on machines\nI Want to know what is the weirdest combo of stuff she's seen someone order\nHow many items does she have to pack a day\nWell I Know an hour they want us to do about it\nNormally do for shift so so if you do the math actually packs around two thousand five hundred and twenty items a week [noise]\nThe very last thing that happens to your back massager is that it gets a shipping lately all of the labor at this point is done by a magical puff of air\nLabel is traded and gently place era [noise]\nThat sounds\nPlacing an accident [noise]\nHard I have to admit it's literally my favorite [noise]\n... so the robots Amazon\nPretty amazing and on the way and I pass signs of a mother's room and there are vending machines that I see two\nThey're free to workers with items like ear plugs lotion Advil just this week Amazon announced that they're raising their minimum hourly wage to Fifteen dollars but over the last few years Amazon has been grilled about their working conditions for example public records show that thousands\nOf Amazon employees are on food stamps Amazon says these figures are misleading because they include people who only worked there for a short period of time or worked part time\nAnd a book published this year by a reporter who worked undercover at an Amazon facility in the u._k. details that workers often wouldn't even take bathroom breaks because they feared not making work quota and that workers were actually penalized for taking six days\nAmazon responded that they didn't recognize these allegations as accurate they also said they coach people who aren't making the quotas and that their attendance policy has changed these kinds of conditions are part of why employee turnover at Amazon is a very high while I'm at Amazon I asked learn about the\nYou know we don't have and power over white individuals make the decisions they make to stay in a career or a role for whatever period of time they choose to but we are able to do is provide a great work place with great team members and great benefits\nConsequences of so many workers turning in and out of warehouses is that it's really hard for them to push for their rights if they have concerns there are no unionized Amazon warehouses in the United states\nAmazon primarily believes in an open door policy we believe in the ability to talk directly with associates\nOpen door policy basically she's saying that they'd rather have employees talk to their managers that they have a problem than work with a union to voiced concerns [laughter]\n\nSo without strong worker protections and in an ever shifting workforce are these the jobs that the graduates of Patterson high school really want I head down to Los Angeles to place reckoning with these questions [noise]\n\nWarehouse workers resource center is located in Long Beach on one side of the room is a wall of photos of workers protesting on the other side\nIs one of the only organizations in the country that advocates for warehouse workers between people on things like wage theft and\nThe day I visit is Wayne Wilson he's twenty five and he drive forklifts for local warehouse is\nI like working in a way as good as ... you know your muscles as a child would go into\nTwain's been working in warehouses and the last seven years after he dropped out of college to start helping his family his mom got sick and he helps out paying rent and bills\nThe biggest problem for him though is the lack of consistent hours\nThe Wayne doesn't work directly for the warehouse\nHe worked for a temp agency and the agency is supposed to have him working at the warehouse forty hours a week but\nSometimes they don't want them to do last week bill I wouldn't be in one day so\nTwain sometimes winds up at five AM in the morning first shift at six AM after being called in and still gets turned away sometimes the only one full week a month\nDoing shows me his phone he says they voted the sniffles or\nOkay so you'd have senior manager and the work tomorrow he says not tomorrow they can I at least worth friday liking of me anywhere and he does not just me Thursday night to see if I have nothing out there in Texas I worked in a while you know\nYeah that is a constant threat of that basically yeah kinda\nAnd after moving up and getting off the temp hamster wheel\nQueen says he's never even seen a way to apply directly for a full time job at the warehouse that he works at\nBasically warehousing companies use temp agencies because it's cheaper\nTemp agencies provides a steady stream of labor to warehouses that don't have to worry about recruiting workers or managing them they take money out of each worker's hourly wage and joins us as a temp agency doesn't tell them how much it could be a dollar ten dollars they don't know and the lack of work or a steady paycheck\nMakes workers less likely to speak up\nBecause they don't want to re sacrificing the hours they do have\nIn ... case he says he'd like to go back to school maybe become a writer\nBut that's not his plan right now\nThe kind of ... going to school like the things that is do\nI Wish I didn't complain about ... difficult anymore [noise]\nTemp work in all sectors is one of the fastest growing industries in the economy [noise]\nIt's hard to know exactly how many warehouse workers are tap but we do know that companies like Amazon temporarily higher hundreds of

Twain she says companies see communities\nI I was five he was Fifteen and I shared at that time when I was five with two adults not my parents\nWho either didn't believe me or didn't know what to do that information they never did anything so they just understood the lesson that we are not believe and these boy understood the lesson that boys will be boys\nAnd I don't want my children to learn that lesson\nI Want to believe that in our country we actually listened to survivors and it was a very painful moment I cried after because I realized\nOh my God maybe my father will hear it this way maybe my mother who hear these way [noise]\nAnd then it didn't reach them but then on friday I texted me that\nInteraction with flake and they said you might hear something and then use I Want you to know that I Am okay and he said I'm Sorry I was not able to protect you and he said to him it was not your fault\nAnd it's not my fault and they feel very supported by you but you know that fear was confirmed I didn't tell my story because I didn't want him and other people who love me to\nHave to hold that pain\nAnd I'm not doing it alone like I'm doing it with all these women I I feel so much in community with thousands of women I have never met but whose stories I deeply deeply understand\nWhen you see what happened in the moment with Senator Flake how do you connect that to the kind of activism that you've been doing and developing on immigration how did those two worlds come together in that moment for you\nA lot of the conversation about a survivors has centered or the stories of women kinda without talking about the rest of their experience of who we are I Can't separate\nMe being a woman from being led the now from being an immigrant from being a mother and\nNow accepting

said he was disappointed when the sheriff didn't have a good answer about this at a forum aimed at young Latino voters in April\nAbility hurting\nThe New York times reported that one of the students who was in the audience to dance a forum said quote you were a Latino when you were helping deport people so why should I trust you now\nShe didn't have a choice she was required by law to cooperate with ice\nIn fairness\nShe did famously go head to head was governor Abbott and twenty Fifteen she was refusing to honor ice requests to hold people who were accused of minor offenses\nSince Andrew white lost the Democratic primary\nJolt is now endorsing her for governor\nBut ... says oh we actually got a document\nI asked ... whether she will take on what some of the younger progressive want her to do to protect undocumented immigrants things like fighting to shut down detention centers and to stop deportations\nI Want to go to that place but I don't have that power\nKnow I wouldn't just make a statement I take action\nAction can be taken in this before\nThis before is cruel bill and is affecting the documents that is something I can do\nWhat she's talking about is the ban in Texas on so called sanctuary cities it's a law called F before and it was signed by governor Abbott last\nYear a wreck you broadcast the moment you know Facebook Live video it's our son in law liberal than sanctuary cities in the law essentially forcing local police to work with federal immigration officials and\nIt allows police to ask people they stop for their papers it ensures\nLong for so long as you can and will cooperate with aren't sure if I did opposes the law\nAnd has made it one of the biggest issues of her campaign\nShe also supports allowing undocumented immigrants to pay in state tuition\nAnother policy that many on progressive are pushing for\nIs abolish ice part of\nI used to be reform\nSaying about the original task advice was to keep people out who do harm they've got away from them and it needs to be reform but do you honestly want nobody to make sure\nThat another attack on a major city is is not going to happen do honestly just want him to let them come in\nAnd and do an attack on the city's sounds a little Republican what you're saying no it doesn't it sounds like we want to protect our country\nMm\nAnd so maybe some Republicans might like this strong borders national security rhetoric maybe she can make up for the lack of enthusiasm of some young Democrats by winning over some Republicans but that's not going to be so easy given how polarized the parties are these days\nWhen we were in Odessa we met her Republican voter at the Mexican restaurant who told us\nTell me a Democrat I Know where you're at where you stand and that is not where I stand\nVery point blank so you're like Hi nice to view I don't even want to hear what you have to say\nWell what are the big reasons because Democrats are going so hard socialist there ought to bash now it's it's just it's just that's what big government lets did raise the taxes so we can say from the rich and give it to the floor [noise]\nSo here lies the crux of the problem for sure if I'm dead person that believes that her unique story of being the first gay Latino shirt and the country will reach a broad range of Texans but he could end up having the opposite effect\nLike we're not talking about towns the size of Dallas or the size of New York city\nIt's not like they spent nine million dollars and they were like oh wow like they spent nine million dollars and that meant that they couldn't move forward road construction and so this was actually a material sacrifice on the part of these towns the only person who appears to have really benefited from this is Kris Kobach so if you think now about\nEarlier to what's happening in the United states right now I'm you know what is what is the\nLarger narrative that you see that's at play here in this moment in the United states when we have Donald Trump and the White House\nAnd directing a kind of particular perspective\nOn policies regarding immigration\nYou know I I think that prior to Trump getting elected and prior to Trump\nBeing as hard line on immigration has he has been it was really easy to dismiss people like Kris Kobach but now now does elements of the Republican Party are leading the country and he has a much more impactful voice than he otherwise what\nI think that we can learn from what he has told us he believes then\n[noise]\nI think that it is a sign that radical elements of our country have sort of taken

crimes of her ex boyfriend a drug dealer even though he'd been dead for six years the police charged Cindy for having lived in the same house as her ex boyfriend when he broke the law\nShe received a Fifteen year mandatory sentence for conspiracy [noise]\n[noise] I mean\nYou're going to charge [noise]\nPrevent any harm that way it is [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nMm\nCindy story isn't unique it's part of something called the girlfriend problem it's a side effect of sentencing laws were women end up serving time for the drug crimes of their significant others\nEven though they had little to do with those crimes filmmaker Rudy Bond is turned his sister's Cindy's experience in prison into a documentary film called the sentence that just premiered on HBO\nAnd the film looks at the impact of Cindy's time in prison on her and her family and also her fight for early release\nI'm joined now by both Cindy and her brother Rudy to talk about the film and life during and after incarceration so Cindy what was your reaction at the very beginning so you just get sentenced to Fifteen Years and your brother's like hey I'm\nCan we make a documentary about this I mean did you kind of want to kill them at that point\nSo it wasn't a documentary and when he started to film a initially it was just he was taking videos of the girls for me so when I came home I could one day watch them run and play and you know the little girls 'cause I was missing all those things and so it wasn't until a few years later that\nWe want to tell your story and by then I had already met you know so many women who story was just like mine and\nI understood that nobody knew it was really going on and I wanted to share the story I wanted I thought it was very important I still think it's so important it was a devastating thing to happen to our family you know not just to me it happened to my mom my dad you know my daughter's\nIt was hard for them you know throughout this whole process so\nIt was an easy decision to say yes rather share a story like it was almost my way of you know screaming to the world what was happening\nThere a lot of things in this country that are filled with shame that we don't talk about one of those issues is incarceration and I really do appreciate the fact that this is something that most people would never want to reveal in you your whole family was like ruining take this public\nI think she was a great\nWord to bring up here because one of the layers and one of the overall themes that I wanted to bring about ... film\nWas shame and changing the stigma of being an incarcerated individual and what that meant and also being a family of incarcerated individual in what that meant and freely letting people look at what the true ramifications we're so that we could possibly\nPut a little bit of that shame on the system\nThere's a point in the film early in your sentence [noise] where you're talking to your then husband and you basically say like look I'm trying to hold it together here I'm not telling you how bad it is because I don't want you to know [laughter]\n\nWhat is it to be a woman in a prison\nWhat didn't you want to tell that you can tell him out\nI mean there's a lot of things there's we can go on and on I mean I never felt safe I mean they were mostly well they were all male guards there were always\nPeople who were needing a lot of mental health\nIt it was a very heightened emotional place to be so you couldn't say something to somebody without wondering how they were going to react they weren't bad people but they were put in bad situations and motions ran high\nI mean and I'm I'm figuring that there are some things that I'm Cindy isn't fame right about now\nYou write like she kept a lot of that from us throughout the incarceration and you know a lot of people will credit the family for me so strong and sticking by her throughout this entire process but you know in so many ways Cindy was the strongest person throughout this process you know she was she was dealing with something on her own\nKnow you get the sense that there's an intention to keep families separated\nLike it's not enough that you're going to just be in prison but we're going to move you so far away from your family that it's hard to see each other because you first started out in a prison that was in beacon New York you know somewhat close to where your family was but then suddenly you're moved to Florida", "show_name": "Latino USA", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "19", "locations": [["Texas", 31.25044,
