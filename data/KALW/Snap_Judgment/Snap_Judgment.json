into the ... valley and the yellow a came into view they were blown away\nProbably what impact of this and the most that we weren't ready for with me the scale of the Himalayas just how much bigger

best shot at living was to escape by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned the John that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and I'm from my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember about that myself we're pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try and wait it out Jason and John wanted to take matters into their own hands\nAnd the idea of killing somebody and and in some ways we we\nWe did in the art captors as evil as you might think even though we are seeing them murders somebody I very much\nUm as victims of circumstance in some way or the specially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired\nRight there in the same you know doing the same thing he was doing but Jason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but he would strategize about how we would pick up Iraq back in their schools are\nStabbed their next with sticks gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to be for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little pony or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throw some I going to jump on this diet to fight his throat gets teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker rock and um yeah of many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody than others\nMm\nAs they marched onto the rocky terrain one of the characters are bare split on now is only two characters with guns to for climbers when\nThey walked and walked for a whole night invested for a day and then did again and they did this for three days starving\nAnd I came up with this really good game to play to pass the time um where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was and\nYou start imagining exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagine eating it and then you start trying to count again\nAnd then finally one of his broken extra time it was when we take guesses and it turns out that had been five minutes\nAnd I think that's probably one time he changed completely it was an amount of suffering that I mean it was just on comprehend ...\nWe're starving to death we were always shivering on our chief were super sore from chattering all the time\nBut they just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it builds hungry sleep deprived men they could also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nAnd do seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said to here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your Base Camp and I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain along with only one of his men as guard\nAnd that one guard was to the Nineteen year old\nHe kind of weird way we're like we would take to safely up to the mountains where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet us\nAnd then we were all going to go together somewhere there was safe and obviously mess that he had bought this story that I spent a week selling to us and bought a hook line and sinker\nAnd so I grabbed his arm in Baghdad in Denali\nServed pleading with him not to go\nIn dangerous out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he was Tarasoff away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him to knock out the he has this look of like you know I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off\nThey split up tracking down which to Base Camp will Jason and his crew led to up the mountain now it was four to one\nFelt like my rib cage was going to explode there just as\nOr and I just want to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun one guy's got to guns and a hand grenade a knife and you remove like all of that and you leave one down kid with a gun with four other kids I completely changed everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate that basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on a sort of trend especially since it was the middle of the night and\nSo John and I immediately\nA\nCommunicated with each other that it was game on and this is going to happen and we all started kind of moving up this mountain\nTogether and I'm always trying to find a\nI'm trying to always kind of direct sue away that looks like the easiest way to also puts him in the most danger if he falls off it gets pushed off\nAnd you could tell they were there were like this is the moment I should I should push 'em right now this is our chance and then\nAnd then they wouldn't I stopped on a small ledge with Beth and the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something and I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this you think I should do it\nAnd she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything we still didn't believe morally and killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chance to survive\nTommy to kind of came flying over the top of me and were racing up the class and it just\nScrambled up over behind him and she wasn't expecting it at all Mm but\nAs I was reaching out to grab is God's job he's done what was going to happen and he turned towards me up close to him I reached out I grabbed his gun strapping a poll as hard as I could and he just toppled over backwards\nHe just kind of what the sparks through them in like an eternity and he looked at me and he looked at me we made eye contact the whole way down\nAnd so he hit the ledge in front of me maybe ten or Fifteen feet in front of me and\nHis whole body let out this really horrible cracking sound because really loud and then he tumbled off of the darkness\nAnd I sat down and I just started falling um [noise]\nAnd then Beth showed up you know right after that and she sort of sat behind me\nAnd wrap your arms around me and just tried to come from and I was like trembling and I remember I remember ... you know for some reason in that moment I just needed her approval so much throughout this whole thing um [noise]\nAnd this was about the time when you became very adamant with one request\nI can remember driving home from one of the appointments and Spencer bang insistent that when that he never had the surgery no matter what\nI didn't even bother to push back I figured we'd just across the bridge together if the native rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone or you know I'm without his end but\nI felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nAnd on the scale of one and how strongly did you feel this way out so it's like there's about eight and do you remember what you might have been scared of them\nAre just not for coming out of surgery as a totally different person I think is when I was scared of\nA different person center was scare his personality would change which is a phenomenon in brain surgery [noise] sometimes people experience\nLots of little changes like different food preferences liking new t._v. genres stuff like that\nAnd sometimes the change is enormous like there's a story of a playboy model who became a shrinking wallflower and didn't even want anyone to take your picture\nFor the case of an otherwise kind gentle brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family and it's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him Spencer\nHe's worried that if you change to the green you changed him\nSo I think for Spencer seeing how I turned out and everything was them all men are familiar\nMade him very hesitant there should be some amount of skepticism\nIn your approach too\nRisky surgery is ... ... ...\n... even if they help you know\nThere was a conversation I had with him at some point [noise]\nExpressing my regrets about my own surgeries because I still\nHave symptoms even after the second surgery in almost every\nTime you\nMade it to him the [noise] one of my biggest regrets surgeries and and my surgeries on\nIt's made me a ... somewhat better person at times\nUm\nSo can I get a little fish will suffer go with you especially contract [noise] okay [noise] um [noise] so in like Julie ... story with Amy I'm Vince\nSo things like our nature are character or so and I'm Wondering if that's intended buyer brain or something less physical and I wonder if\nMy only problem in line the intersection of all of those things somewhere there [laughter]\nAnd then one day these questions move very suddenly somebody to set a goal to their we spend to having severe headaches again and he ended up in the ER and from there he was helicopters to Harvard Medical center in Seattle when we first\nArrived at the hospital and my husband and I spent there was just talking butter ... British and\nShortly after we arrived he began thrashing around I was at that sort of his bed holding his feet down while the nurses tried to restart as I read and there for a few minutes as I watched him try to\nCatch its breath I I I thought we would lose them\nIn was really hard when I first arrived from Los Angeles and got to spend ... hospital room in the u._s. you [noise] to see him [noise] in a coma and\nA condition that I hoped only I Would have to have dealt with and\nI Wish I could have been union\n[noise]\n[noise]\nIt's going to take a short break and when we return we'll Spencers family as they make the decision but no family should never have to make\nSnap judgment the override episode continues stay [noise]\n\nSnap judgment is supported by target presenting future at heart a podcast on change makers and the projects their championing in communities nationwide future at heart available on apple pie cats or wherever pond cancer found\n\nFrom W unless these studios Welcome back to snap judgment override episode when it was in Washington\nAnd we left off the young man Spencer you lay unconscious in hospital because of the Mel formation in his brain in all of his family knew was that no matter what he never ever wanted to have brain surgery\n\nSpencer and had a stroke and while he lay in the hospital bed sedated he's family his mom and dad Steven as British do had to decide what to do and to me they had to decide whether or not to operate\nThey're surgeons name was Dr Keim and Dr Kim told them that if they did not operate now there was a one to five percent chance it's been two would have another stroke\nAnd that chance would increase every year of his life\nBut\nThe surgery you is proposing was very risky when Dr Kim was explaining these very daunting odds any recording it and she could go back and listen to what he said over and over\nSome risks associated with five major complication from the surgery or mine or one or anything in between uh\n[laughter] I Know that the surgery before the ...
