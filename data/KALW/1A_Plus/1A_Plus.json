our best to put some of the most useful in positive and productive calls on the air\nTo those of you who've been making that job a little bit harder I think it might be worth sharing a comment from

foreign twenty sixteen I Will find you\nAnd I will love you there's absolutely nothing you can do to stop me\nCharlie ... let's get back to Thomas comments on Facebook Tommy rights\nWhen speeches free and in the open people get pushed back when it is driven underground it is giving legitimacy\nAnd leads to action one of the sites that has made news lately is this social network called gab dot com which I don't think a lot of people had heard of before this incident what what can you tell us about gab\nAnd the kind of online footprint that Robert Bowers had\nThere so uh ... dot com is a sort of a basically a Twitter cologne um and it is was created under the premise of a maximalist free speech beliefs so the idea was a lot of you know racists bigots [laughter] we're getting kicked off of Twitter\nFor for violating Twitter's community standards are\nAnd gab was sort of a a another refuge for them a place where you could say anything because we believe in the you know eat the absolute power of of free speech but when ended up happening with gab is at it it became a cesspool it became a place where only these sort of worst people would go to express ideas that\nAre that we're really not tolerated elsewhere because they were hateful because they were angry I became it it has become a\nA place where white nationalism a\nAnd an extreme or bigotry homophobia whatever ah has has been embraced and and uh and this was a place where the\nThe Pittsburgh shooter I'm not going to say at his name was ... maybe not radicalize necessarily but but certainly able to express and have an audience for a lot of his\nI truly hateful views it was the last place where he\nHad posted before at the shooting 'em and it seems that it was it was sort of a\nA A N unproductive venture for a lot of that hatred I'm an after after um after it was clear that the shooter had been an active a participant on gab there was a lot of push back a lot of people who are coming and realizing this for the first time\nA note notice that at that at this place is a dark\nPlace to incubate a lot of awful ideas gab responded saying ah words are not bullets in social media posts I have a body count at zero sort of saying that you know this free speech is different from from action\nAnd I started when they did they actually say words are not bullets anyone who says that should go read the declaration of independence\nWhen it you know what's interesting about this and this is something that happens a lot of a free speech communities on line that they don't really believe necessarily free speech but just in being able to say anything outrageous I is that it actually shows that that that the owners of gab\nDevalue speech to a degree if they believe that it has no consequences than than there is sort of this you know this odd warped understanding of why protect it's so hard if it means nothing right um and and I think that that is something that that a lot of people\nDon't quite grapple with especially on the Internet\nJacobs I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like Gavin get us off the only place where this kind of speech proliferate so online is worth noting since our program one a as named after the first amendment quick First Amendment lesson\nHate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments\nThe line whereby speech becomes\nCurtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given them a new kind of speed and virulence that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened to Pittsburgh all the more worrisome looks like you\nShort well first of all it's not news that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death and life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more true I've seen how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to spew such hate speech\nSo it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want [noise]\nI also just wanted to say something about the ... that one of the to respond to one of the Facebook comments that you read\nThere has been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and that's true of course that their corners of the left where there is anti Semitism it's true that there's\nAnger but we've seen nothing like the white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right against Jews against people of color against algae B. T. Q. people against immigrants refugees et cetera\nAnd what's crucial is that that is being\nThat that hatred is being supported and embolden from the very top from the president of the United states that the white nationalists see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides\nAnd that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we have somebody\nOn the left who is in charge we have somebody on the right who's the president of the United states and who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist racist anti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign ad before the election in which he\nHighlighted George Soros Janet Yellen and Lloyd Blankfein and suggested that they were a part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power and the United states which of course trap taps into\nVery old anti Semitic tropes and so we\nYeah but I I I'm Sorry where am I going to do want to get a little deeper into that\nA lot of talks a lot of our listeners have been trying to get on that and endure I'd love to to get your thoughts with that on that I mean the president did address this during a speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday she began his speech by talking about the shooting\nToday with one unified voice we condemn the historic evil\nOf anti Semitism and every fan of evil and unfortunately the vote comes in many forms and we come together as one\nAmerican people\nPart of the president's opening of his speech to the future farmers of America in Indianapolis over the weekend but contrast that with what the president tweeted this morning she wrote quote\nThere is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people\nNews accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony\nFake news must and unquote gotten a number of comments from some of you about the president's potential role and all of this Susan as in Silver Spring Maryland right outside D.C Susan writes\nI look forward to the day when we once again have a president who understands and always considers but his or her statements have far reaching consequences Indira\nI'd well this was of course incredibly disturbing to have the president once again demonizing the press and calling us enemies of the people\nI'm going to be under the tree and we the people I mean this is this absolutely journalists are essentially in a way the life blood of a democracy if we are not able to inform and educate citizens um about what's going on in their country if we are not able to hold\nPublicly elected officials accountable um then you don't have a true democracy and the president and miss understands what the term fake news means fake news actually means misinformation false stories that are made up\nWhether they are spread by Macedonia teenagers trying to get money for sneakers or Russian propaganda or American fake news factories where people can make tend to thirty thousand dollars a month\nOn advertising and penny clicks from people clicking on um salacious headlines that are completely made up he has taken that term and twisted it and appropriated to try to mean any news he doesn't like\nBut the issue here is that\nThe mainstream media by and large is accurate and true just because it may be reporting things that the president things are negative doesn't make them fake\nAce in Chapel Hill North Carolina writes real media has to start calling out outlets like Fox News for their lives and propaganda that enables hate speech to be propagated\nNPR and other rational sources have to call out the president's lies and distortions\nThere needs to be a consistent strong resistance to the hateful divisive speech that is anti American journalists need to be less accommodating end quote unquote fair to all opinions and stop repeating without strong criticism the president's ignorant ramps if not you who make America kind again\nLet's get back to the phones and again thanks to those of you who have been patient with us on the phones we know that screening has been tough today but we've had to scream very hard with some of the people who felt like sharing their comments on our air we will hear from those folks but we will hear from David who's here in Washington DC Hey David what's on your mind\nI'm well thanks for having the show I um I guess I'm I'm speaking as someone who's both religious the Jewish and also very much scientific I think there's a strong feeling\nAmong a lot of us that there has been a a much lower except in on the left of people who have started with religious views and a close connection to the state of Israel I mean uh I teach at a a small school here in the city and or in the in the suburbs and a lot of her students do feel uncomfortable about Yeah Bill that um\nYou know the express a strong here instead of Israel or especially religious views that aren't um you know but I mean about hot button social issues but as their religious views that they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up and and how you or how the school deals with it\nWell I mean we're Jewish religious school so you know for us you know what we\nMean there are students who are you know are not particularly\nStrongly support of Israel in one way or the other but um when our students leave this school and they often find their campuses unfriendly they find professors especially a friendly if if they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh so I mean while it's true I mean I don't\nThink it's reasonable to say that you're seeing a lot of violence in the left that that's true I think you are saying and I think our students feel a certain intolerance 'em when they go to college um and it's you know I don't know we we felt\nWe do tell kids probably shouldn't need need to shut up you know announced they shut up that you know you can't argue with that we're\nJust kind of how you're going to have to learn to live with that kind of pick your battles I think that's a hard thing\nYet to pick their battles I should I mean I I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advised to do that and not\nThe not settle everything will David I'm going to be can be very hard to even let me\nPut that to thank you for sharing that let me put that to rabbi Jill Jacobs right but what do you make of Davis comment\nThank you David I wanted to respond to you and to Stephanie who are speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I wanted to say Seventy first time really sorry that your son is going through that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course that high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nAnd for both of you know I let it be very clear that there certainly is anti Semitism and all that and very often it ... itself\nAs as attacks on Israel and Israel is right to exist now that's different from saying that criticism that Israel's policy is it anti Semitic which is not even criticize any countries policies but often that criticism of Israel crosses a line into anti Semitism\nThat is pro Israel and also critical of many of Israel's governmental policy as we are all the time speaking out against the places on the left where\nWhere that criticism crosses the line and we have to be really clear it out where those places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post that tries to lay out some of the places in which criticism of Israel is not criticism of a country and its policies but rather crosses over into\nStraight up anti Semitism and unfortunately we have seen incidents around the world in which there are people who carry out\nWho carry a violent acts and say that they are motivated by hatred of Israel but the targets are actually Jews who are shopping in a grocery store in a Jewish store and a synagogue\nAnd at the same time and the United states right now again saying that we have to call out that anti Semitism the left what's different about the anti Semitism and other hatred a race racism and homophobia and seeing a phobia and the right is it it's being supported by the government\nIt would be different if we had a situation in which there was hatred on the left hatred on the right and somebody at the top who is trying to restore who's ... who is criticizing\nAny kind of hatred and who is trying to restore civil discourse to the U. S. but instead we have somebody at the very top who is encouraging the hatred on the right and riling up his people\nMake it to a few more of your comments as we continue our conversation which has many recalls as we can as well Stacy wrote on our Facebook page\nI Am emotionally exhausted I was in my own synagogue on Saturday when I heard the news I was looking forward to going to synagogue to escape the news of the week now there is no escaped and no sanctuary but as our ancient rabbis teachers the world is a narrow bridge and the main thing to remember is not to be afraid\nLynn wrote on our Facebook page yesterday's interfaith service in Pittsburgh filled me with hope\nVarious religious leaders offered support strengths and loved to a community crushed by its loss if anything is going to change we citizens must make it happen last night's fellowship help to bind or wounds and set us on the path for making our town better endure would you react to that I feel like part of what worked\nI hate to say in Pittsburgh favorable one of the things I think helped him this whole process as you described scroll hill\nIf it's the kind of community that had these ties long before this happened so that people who needed to come together already had so in crisis struck they just they just rolled out and they knew how to locked\nArms with one another that's right I mean scroll hill is a very this is one factor is a very educated community\nUm it's right next to CMU Carnegie Mellon university and pet and a lot of the people who live and scroll hill are um you know doctors lawyers professors teachers accountants dentist it's an educated community a tolerant community and Pittsburgh overall\nIs also um you know politically a liberal community and it voted something like between Seventy and eighty percent for Hillary Clinton in this last election even though Pennsylvania\nUm went for Donald Trump so the community of Pittsburgh overall and the mayor I'm Bill ... has been you know talking about tolerance for a long time and that is the history of the city so that's why I Would say yes it did help in Pittsburgh favor but\nYou know all of the negative rhetoric that we have coming um we were talking about the end of the enemy of the people line earlier that the president tweeted this morning I'm we now know that a bomb was apparently headed for CNN was just intercepted today in Atlanta\nJust four months ago and attack or killed five reporters and in Annapolis news written the capital Gazette so you know I I Do think we have to work\nA line between a hateful rhetoric and I'm hateful actions because of group polarization that happened\nThen just attack on the one in here just mentioned CNN is reporting that suspicious package that was addressed to CNN was intercepted in a post office in Atlanta the investigation I don't think has at least yielded any public information in terms of what was in the package whether it was similar to the ones\nThat were sent last week but that story is just kind of breaking as of this morning let's get to a few more of your calls and comments including one from Pittsburgh where Lee is on the line highly what's on your mind\nOr Joshua how you doing today\nSure what what's on your mind how ... how are your neighbors do and after all this\nUm puns very upset and it's you know it's it's devastating of a family um friends and customers in there and that live in a squirrel hill it's um [noise] it we're taking a brutal hit\n[noise] um but like my comment is is that I I think that the ... I'm sure a lot of good for the polar polarization of the um ... the climate and the politics is\nIt's just gotten out of hand if we would just be more centralized do I have people who who are um left right friends and um but when we sit down and talk we mostly mostly come to agreement\nVery closely on our on our feelings and and our um how we feel about things and and the politics it's just too far left too far right and I think we were more centralized that a lot of the frustrations would be tamped down and wouldn't be so nearly so bad\nLee what do you find works with at least your friends in terms of getting to that place I feel like some folks just feel like they're too far apart and they just can't they just can't what has worked for you and your friends in terms of finding common ground how do you do that\nI'm ... ... ... you leave out the politics and discuss the um the topic um and and your viewpoints on the topics and when we discussed that we find that even though you know we we come back to very similar feelings on things\nAnd even though we vote differently but if it just just stick with the topics and not the politics around it\nThat's that's actually very good advice Lee thanks very much and thank you for calling in to talk to us we're hearing from several of you from the Pittsburgh area including Wendy who emailed", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "29", "locations": [["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Pittsburgh", 40.44062, -79.99589], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Pittsburgh", 40.44062, -79.99589], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["north St Mexico", 33.87533, -108.25089], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["Germany", 51.5, 10.5], ["Germany", 51.5, 10.5], ["Brazil", -10.0, -55.0], ["US", 45.99696, -118.49854], ["Mexico", 23.0, -102.0], ["Britain", 41.66121, -72.77954], ["Gambia", 13.5, -15.5], ["London", 51.50853, -0.12574], ["Ivory Coast", 8.0, -5.5], ["Somalia", 6.0, 48.0], ["Libya", 28.0, 17.0], ["Britain", 41.66121, -72.77954], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Fort", 14.60365, -61.07418], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Montana", 47.00025, -109.75102], ["Pittsburgh", 40.44062, -79.99589], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Pittsburgh", 40.44062, -79.99589], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Canada", 60.10867, -113.64258], ["Pittsburgh", 40.44062, -79.99589], ["Pittsburgh", 40.44062, -79.99589], ["Pittsburgh", 40.44062, -79.99589], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Indianapolis", 39.76838, -86.15804], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Indianapolis", 39.76838, -86.15804], ["Maryland", 39.00039, -76.74997], ["Macedonia", 41.66667, 21.75], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["Israel", 31.5, 34.75], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["the U.

A. M. U. dot org comments on our Facebook page or tweet us at one hey Mr Mayor you're in the home stretch of this race just a few more weeks to go how's the campaign trail going so far it's going well we're\nUh here in the final Fifteen days of this race filling\nUm amazing energy out here on the trail we feel the wind at our backs up proud of our performance last night at the debate and frankly all looking forward to over the next Fifteen days making the closed in case the ... as to why I ought to be the next governor lead this day forward\nYeah wonder where you see that closing case right now I mean we're in a very polarized political environment but we are also a nation with lots of moderates and independents Florida has plenty of them as you know it's kind of why we're a perennial swing state and I'm speaking as a native Floridians I Wonder what you think\nHas those voters who haven't quite decided between you or Rhonda sets us on the fence where do you think that you still need to close the case in the next few weeks one I mean I think I still have to work to expose a\nMystery to standards as record to the the people of the state of Florida particularly on the issue of healthcare\nA while a member of Congress or he voted over a dozen times to repeal Obamacare are going so far as the the the government shutdown in order to see his a radical extreme policies at the far right of the governing party I'm a six years in Congress never saw a piece of legislation passed a under his signature\nUm uh and uh I also voted wild there to see an insurance company to be able to discriminate against people based off the pre existing conditions\nUm there are a lot of areas where we disagree but certainly on that I consider him unqualified for the office when you consider that one in five people in the state of Florida don't have access to insurance and that we've got a probably every one of your listeners are sitting next to or have someone in their household who has a preexisting condition\nUm the fact that you would be in favor of allowing insurance companies to charge more or to deny coverage\nOr in my opinion again is disqualified for the office so\nI Want to make sure that people understand who Methodist than it is and the reason he has yet to produce a healthcare plan for the state of Florida is because Floridians would be terrified to learn if he were to speak honestly with him about what his plans are quite frankly to increase costs jak costs and reduce coverage\nI Wonder how you view the perspective of Florida voters considering that the outgoing governor of Florida Rick Scott was a health care executive and he's\nA ... pretty well aligned with President Trump on many things I was a two term governor of the of the state of Florida do you get the sense that Floridians are really tracking with you as it relates to health care or maybe as your diversity in the political views\nLarry tweeted I Hope that when he wins mayor Gillum will remember the poorest counties in my former home of the northwest Florida panhandle\nThey may be the reddish to parts of Florida but represents a real opportunity for a Democratic Party reaching out to the working class citizens of our states Larry\nThat is a such an important point and I have to tell you having just helped to lead my community through the impacts of hurricane Michael uh we had Ninety percent of our power and knocked out thousands of trees come down roads that were blocked\nA within a week uh we had Ninety nine and a half percent of people with their power restored roads cleared\nAnd a sense of normalcy return to my community and the first thing we did was dispatch a our utility workers or to the western panhandle just west of us\nUp to begin that recovery effort for our neighbors are the Gulf Coast region will return that we will return stronger than ever but the next governor will help to preside over that restoration\nUh when when we are hit with natural disasters we come together as Floridians ah whether or not the politically that that is a community that will be for me\nUm ism no consequence there Floridians and they were part of a of our state they is often been forgotten whether forgotten cos would not be forgotten under a governor Gillum not only are we going to see that community restored we're also going to work with them to help to defined in economic future for that region that again makes them the pride of\nThe state of Florida before we had one more voice to our conversation let me follow up with you on that a little bit one of the conversations that constantly comes up whether it was after Hurricane Harvey last year after hurricane Michael this year Hurricane Florence earlier\nIs about the future of these coastal communities you know parts of Florida like Mexico beach in basically the whole Florida coastline all the way around the state or in areas that are very much at risk for rising water levels ... Gulf levels ocean levels\nAs climate change progress is and it becomes increasingly difficult matter as to whether or not people are allowed to live\nRight next to the shore I mean you saw the satellite or the the drone pictures of homes that were built up to the two thousand one building code and homes that weren't the whole world were standing and homes and weren't we're we're we're toothpicks basic that's right that Governor ... that's got to be a tough decision kind of considering whether or not the state of Florida at a certain point\nHas to tell people we know you love the ocean we know you love the Gulf but it is not safe to live here\nYeah no it's it's such a fair point an ... and and and and in fact speaking about building codes or we may have to revisit a building codes again and light of the fact that we're seeing stronger\nGulf where the Gulf waters are so warm\nBut then if then if you tell people where they can't lift that affects the property tax base that affects the economy I mean well listen\nRight now we have the insurer a last resort in this state have undercover homes\nI'm Better nice in luxurious and yes you know ocean front properties but private insurance companies are refusing to write policies there and so that puts the entire state at risk for having to ensure a homes that are being built in areas that are increasingly becoming\nUm a a threatened by rising sea levels so so what I Would say is is that we are deserving of a real statewide conversation likely county by county around how it is that we are going to be building more resilient communities\nThat in the face of sea level rise in climate change that it doesn't make sense and some of these areas that we allow for property to be built\nAnd to be built and frankly in an ... resilient way when we know that they are going to be susceptible to being wiped out\nUh with these increased storm of events and with sea level rise I I Can't I Can't tell you that there's a panacea Mm I Can't I Can't tell you in this moment what exact part of the state we would be happening to begin this conversation I think is going to be a statewide conversation and it's one that we're gonna have to lean into with county and local governments\nI Want to reiterate by the way we did invite the Republican candidate for Florida governor Rhonda ... take part in this discussion or a future discussion we have not yet heard back from his campaign but the invitation stands we would certainly loved to have him on the program\nWhich I had one more voice of the discussion now to the questioning now joining us from W ELL are in public radio in Miami is released Hernandez who's the host of its daily talk show son dial Luis welcome to want to a\nA Joshua thank you so much I appreciate it and mayor again thank you are or appreciate the opportunity I Do want to know that ah thirty one of sixty seven counties in Florida have started early voting and the counties mostly the counties here in the W well around listening area\nIncluding Palm Beach wrote in Miami Dade county's have begun early voting\nI'm Mr Mayor it looks as though Republicans are going to hold the Florida House and Senate so how do you plan to get any of your ideas through if the opposing party is in control of the two chambers\nWell one ah Louis good to hear your voice again or I'm too I'm well aware and thankful for your mind to it the early voting we actually has some of our supporters who overnight it\nLast night watching the debate and where the first in line to vote down in Miami for early voting but to your question one I Am not joined the conclusion that Republicans will hold the Senate um I think they will likely be in position to to hold the house but I think Democrats will get some gains\nThat being said we will have a divided government um um I Would say this I think what we've got to look too aware of the areas where we might be able to find some cooperation\nI'm I mentioned earlier that I thought criminal justice reform was one area where we might be able to bring Democrats and Republicans together to help or get a salvage solution that might lead to a saving money\nAnd modernizing or a system that is in desperate need of update 'em and I will tell you I'm a I'm willing and prepared to work with or what might be a speaker holy oh a lever\nI'm here and I spent some time together for two years or making our way through\n'em and Aspen Institute fellowship where we got to know each other pretty well now I don't take that the main then I'm convinced them\nTo believe in everything I Believe or vice versa but I definitely think that we began from a place where we don't think of each other as you know our enemies if you will um were sent there to do the bidding to do the job of of of the people of the state and it's my hope to find areas where we can work together maybe on affordable housing or maybe on dealing with\nThey pulled down that six billion dollars I'm for health care which is for the state of Florida one of the most exploding parts of our budget\nUm so I'm I'm not beyond working with the other party I also don't draw the conclusion that you have to be the same party in order to work together you probably recall that there were a number of sessions where governor Rick Scott couldn't get his budget through\nAnd he shared the same party or with the speaker of the house and with the with the Senate president so there there there may be some benefit in my opinion to negotiating into them negotiating with me\nAnd trying to ah find solutions I Know Floridians are tired of us getting nothing done they want their government to work for them and they're not interested in our part isn't you know squabbles they want to make sure that we can\nProduce and and you mentioned a couple of different things or want to I wanted to approach you on is the criminal justice issue you know been public about the fact that your family had run ins with the law on both Miami Dade County and when you went to Gainesville\nUh one of your brothers was arrested on drug trafficking charges you make criminal justice reform one of the critical points of your campaign for governor yeah how did your family's experience with a law at a young age inform these proposals for updating the state's criminal justice system\nYeah I mean so first I mean a shape that shaped it a lot I think if if you recall from my opening video when I introduced myself I talked a bit about\nYou know watching my mother you know two years well up in her face when uh you know the the ... come by the house and say you know your son's in trouble again right um that that's a difficult thing for any child to have to see and experience and I remember deciding at a very early age that I never want it to see\nThat expression on my mom's face because of something that I did\nUm and so I Am the first of my seven siblings to graduate from high school and as a fifth of seven kids in the first to graduate from college when my brother guy home after doing his time um I watched him want to be a better father for his daughter and a better partner or to his girlfriend and then to his wife [noise]\nUm and he went and apply for a job to job to job and got told no after no after no\nAnd it really did shake my belief that listen how can we say we want people to pull themselves up by the bootstraps to redeem themselves to reintroduce themselves into society when we then create all of these barriers that keep them from being able to do just that\nAnd so you know as a as a mayor I led the effort to ban the box in my city we don't ask about criminal background history and less answering yes as a disqualified for the position if it's not we're going to measure people off their merit argues skilled you qualify can you do the work\nAnd what we've learned is that these individuals' happened to be some of the hardest working people we have within our government because they know what it means to be without\n'em and if we're serious about trying to re introduce people into society that we've got to think about what are those ways that we can get people dignity that comes with work again because once they've had access to a job where they can earn an honest wage an honest living and it'll be a good example for our communities um\nIt helps us that our crime rate level because the best way to control crime is to reduce the amount of people re offending it's important and it's played a big role in my thinking around\nA criminal justice reform writ large mayor Gillum one of the key ways that some are proposing to reintegrate folks back in the society has to do with a ballot initiative coming up next month it would give formerly incarcerated people they're voting rights back in the Florida now former attorney general Eric Holder has spoken out about this issue before here's part of what he has set\nTo three six one a one a or use our app won a vox pop to send us a radio quality audio file will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Louis Hernandez of double you all are in public radio and Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum Louis I Know our time is short but let me let you get another question for the mayor\nYeah definitely a mayor I did want to ask you about the issue of race because it's been a pervasive throughout this campaign uh but you already know this lord is one of the most diverse populations in the country or the latest census data says that ... sixteen percent of the population is black twenty five percent\nHispanic or Latino how's your campaign connecting with black and brown voters to get them galvanized to take part in this midterm election\nYeah I mean I think we are doing 'em all the right things to try to communicate across frankly all communities um I've been in red areas blue areas purple area I was in ... I think Trump won ... thirty points Flagler about the same much we've been to the villages\nAre but we are here you know I I Will be at the University of South Florida where I Am today um which students um uh just did a roundtable with a Puerto Rican leadership in Orlando a hosted an event\nUm um buddy quest forget them I'm a a little while ago was in Little Haiti and did a video because I couldn't make it down there a ... baby ... uh which went really well so we're we're communicating across constituencies and just to give you an example of I think how it is impacting us\nIs that in the primary election we saw a hundred and fifty thousand Buddhist turn out to vote who either one we're voting for the first time or two we had not voted in the previous three elections a hundred and fifty thousand\nOr the last two races for governor Democrats lost by less than Seventy thousand votes\nUm it's my plan to double that number in this general election of unlikely voters and many of those voters will be younger voters of color are more women are more poor voters and I think we're going to perform very very well but the reason why I'd been going to diverse parts of our state\nIs because we got to stop treating the race for governor as if it's the electoral college you don't win one area\nIs the one who gets one more vote and that one vote may come through from anywhere throughout the length and the breath of distasteful unprepared to go there will go in because we're going to give voters a reason to turn out and vote for something and not just against\nThere are so many things I Would love to ask you mayor deal in so many great policy questions we've gotten from our listeners perhaps all of a chance to talk to you again but one more matter of policy I'd like to ask you about before we let you go and that has to do with a gun policy in the state of Florida let me amalgam eight to questions from two of our listeners by email Jim emailed\nMayor Gillum given that at least the house will be in Republican hands what can be done to reduce the impact of Florida's Stand your ground law it seems unlikely you would be able to repeal it\nAnd then Ryan emailed what do you plan to do to better enforce current gun control laws before trying to pass new legislation ...\nYeah well first I'm a I think we have to work hard I'm at the repeal the stand your ground or you know it is an unnecessary law and the state of Florida we already had castle doctrine which allows for individual to protect themselves and their businesses against intruders I'm a onto their property right\nI'm Sorry I I I hate to interrupt I think we should probably be cleared the difference between what you're talking about just by way of context the castle doctrine you referring to basically is that kind of your home as your castle idea that says you have the right\nTo use deadly force to defend yourself at home weren't worth stand your ground carries it farther and says you have the right to use deadly force and they feel threatened anywhere you have a legal right to be just\nTo be anywhere yeah and again that's that's vigilante gives them a that's the wow wow west and the city streets of you're able to make a decision\nOr about whether or not you consider somebody to be a threat I'm Out of your own imagination or in the recesses of of of your own mind and I think that that is dangerous\nCastle doctrine already protect you and your home there's already common last self defense which means\nAnd places where you are in public square and you result to having to defend yourself with deadly force there's already case law on the books where you've been able and you've seen cases where people are able to successfully argued the case that it made sense to be able to use deadly force\nBut to not take that to a different extreme and to provide under the cover and the color of the law people being able to sniff out innocent life based based off of their perception of threat\nTo me is is is it is a stretch too far\nUm as it relates to what we can do obviously on that I Want to make the case and I want to use regular voices of Floridians to make the case\nOr to outlaw makers around the absence of common sense when it comes to these kinds of laws and to help them understand how families like mine and like others who are raising black children\nI'm In black and brown children feel particularly\nI'm a under siege by laws like these take the case of Trayvon Martin and trace of Martin the case of marquee smug locked in\nA and there are many others and quite frankly talk to prosecutors who are saying and are seeing\nA criminals on both sides who are using stand your ground as a way to take out there you know they're they're gang enemies\nBecause they both have weapons so it has also been extended to giving cover for for legitimate illegal practices in our communities and prosecutors are left to do nothing about it because folks are able to claim as dangerous as stand your ground as a ...\nPoint before we let you go with regards to enforcing current gun laws before trying to pass new ones what would you say Iran\nI Would say one yes we must enforce a current laws but we also got to do things like ensure that if you want to carry the power of God at your waist but you ought to have a background check to do things like a convicted or a domestic violence abuses should not get access to weapons where they can sniff out the lives of their loved ones closing the gunshots\nBuy the n._r._a. in Tallahassee because we refused to repeal an ordinance that our city was simply said you can't shoot guns in city parks you kiss you guys in parts for our kids play and our and our families picnic\nAnd that was considered to be too extreme we've lost the common sense of balance here we're not talking about in the front of the second amendment\nWas simply talking about how do we keep our kids safe in school how do we reduce the level of of ongoing everyday gun violence that pervades our neighborhoods and we got her it was to assume decency here and unfortunately they enter re runs roughshod over the state of Florida right now we got to put some decency back into it\nAndrew Gillum the mayor of Tallahassee, Florida running for governor as a Democrat mayor Gillum we really appreciate you making some extra time for so thanks very much thank you for the opportunity good luck everybody go vote to liberty in St Louis Hernandez the host of sun dialing double you all are in public radio in Miami you can find more of the stations excellent coverage including a guide\nTo all the referenda in Florida on this month's next month's ballot\nAt W. L. R. N. dot org Lewis thanks for talking to us\nAnd thanks you Joshua thank you let's see I'm Out from Florida and look more nationally now what's going on to other gubernatorial races around the country which one should we be paying close attention to and with all eyes it seems on Washington these days how local are these elections really\nJoining us in Studio to discuss it is Daniel Strauss who covers politics for political Daniel welcome to want to say thanks for having me thoughts on Florida's governor's race it sounds like\nIn some ways the Florida gubernatorial race is a microcosm of politics in America right now in addition to all the other issues that are kind of spoke to Florida but it kind of seems like Florida is always microcosm of national politics\nYeah I I mean I Can't think of a better a\nGubernatorial race that represents a two of the key sort of issues right now one is a President Trump as embodied by mayor Gillum challenge or a or opponent a round to Santa's the Sanders has been a die hard fan for a lot longer than a lot of Trump's\nA standard bearers in Congress and in elected office\nAnd uh the other thing is you guys had on his race um this is a topic that\nIs coming up throughout a number of major gubernatorial in Senate races or it is voting rights as a key issue in Georgia right now and this is something that a a certain sort of overshadowed the Florida governor's race as well\nYou know it's something we didn't have time to get into with with mayor Gillum but there was that comment that Ron dissent dismayed basically right after the primary after Andrew Gillum became the Democratic nominee and he became a Republican nominee\nBasically expressing his hopes that Florida didn't in Mr dissent assist words monkeys is up\nBy making the wrong decision that of course was widely taken to be a sideways slam at Andrew Gillum who who is black to sit still feel like it's an issue at the top of the race has a kind of blend in with all the other big issues it's funny and sort of the seed\nFrom which ah grew the sort of the plant or the tree that\nUh is dominating this race right now um I don't think that particular a comment is the trending a a topic of discussion in the Florida governor's race but it it underscores that race relations remains a key issue in Florida\nSo of course Florida is going to be a a big race this year I may be a bit biased considering that I'm a native Floridian it always seems to be a big race but there are thirty six stupidest oil races around the country right now are the one or two maybe other than Florida that stand out to you as the most worth watching kind of no matter where you are in the country\nOr Georgia would be one uh Stacey Abrams versus the secretary of state Brian Kemp uh Ohio where are the former ah", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "22", "locations": [["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Florida", 28.75054,

A. L. W. dot O. R. G.\nHere's another one that's not getting that much attention proposition twelve bigger cages for farm animals and California we tend to get a fair amount of propositions that would affect animals [laughter] what what what this one too\nYeah so this is ... days however the voters voted on a similar measure in two thousand a thought was proposition to and this was sort of in a way to double down on that this would place specific size requirements on chicken coops and cages are used to compete in pigs cows\nAre on on farms in California I'm In actually require\nIt it'd be applied to any of food or or animal products sold within California so in fact this would be barred not just to California farmers with farmers across the country who want to so or ... or ... in California\nUm and so this would uh you know the specific dimensions it'd be you know\nOne square foot of of floor space for free Chen by twenty twenty and then cage free by twenty twenty two or another you know specific size requirements for for a pigs cows as well so the back story here is that she does it in the states are voters passed proposition too\nAnd that was a similar initiative which required that the farm animals um be allowed to to stand up and move around and turn around or rather and in their cages I'm an actor that path or a number of commercial and farmers argues that that does not actually require them to go and\nI suppose you could start clarifying that point on by saying no in fact by twenty twenty two ah clearly written into this proposition cage to you have to go cage free um for for egg farmers um the debate around this is really a kind of interesting because the\nThe proponents of this and that the the folks who wrote this proposition with the humane society humane society even the United states and they actually got them buy in from\nUh some groups within a California agriculture is the Central Valley eggs for example they also got the support of the California Democratic party um and and the anti side of the people who who are against proposition ... well it's a it's\nA pretty weird coalition on the one hand you have sort of\nPredictable arguments that it would raise the cost of doing business in California or raise the price of of food um and so you have that argument from the California Republican Party from\nUm a lot of agricultural interests but you also have the opposition from\nPita and from the humane farming association in these other um animal rights groups or who argue that no in fact you know we the California voters and two thousand they said we want to go cage free and that's that's the rule and and so we shouldn't give farmers additional time\nAh to to meet that requirement for twenty twenty two so so the politics of this or a little bit confusing\nAnd some animal groups also say that this at the end of the day this I mean it might be a bigger cage but the animal and this will be killed anyway and so they say it's kind of a false it's ... it kinda paints a false picture asked to citizens about how adults are treated\nSure that that that's absolutely right maybe on the day we're talking about or cows and pigs are being\nRead for for slaughter so so if you're opposed to that are across the board than than certainly um this is and this is not going to this is not even a half measure um but you know in the past you have animal groups like Peter who have who have been on board\nUm ah with these kind of more incremental steps but but this I I Believe it was a they consider to incremental\nWright city yes on Trump's side has raised almost wow ten million dollars three million from the open philanthropy action fund the humane society just more than two million a couple of individuals at the humane league Marcy for animals they've already some money on this\nThe no side has raised five hundred and sixty six thousand dollars and that has all come from the humane farming action fund\nRight and again those are a animal rights activists ... so it is kind of interesting that even though you have opposition from from big agricultural groups again the than the bulk of the money\nIs coming from animal rights groups which you wouldn't necessarily expect given that this is being um but you know branded as a as a animal rights initiative\nRight okay so that one is from\nTwelve that's twelfth yes and we made a mistake we sent eleven pups there's actually twelve props\nAnd well no actually there are a lot I live in its its top official one through twelve but nine of missing a oh voters\nMy uh find that confusing but there was initially a a a measure and some people might remember lists that I'm Around a proposal to divide the fate into three parts we're gonna have three California and that was ... nine\nOr ... or a court ruled that the no actually of voters can't use the the ballot measure to destroy the state of California [laughter] so that was taken off\nWe have other important things to do it on [laughter] well All right so now the one that's not getting much attention but it's very important is proposition eight dialysis clinic profit printing\nA a hashing it out through the ballot initiative process so on paper what this would do is that this would require companies that operate a dialysis clinic or throughout California\nTo uh to effectively um kept their profits at at a profit margins that Fifteen Percent of of their business costs are above their business costs\nAnd so uh any payments that are that they receive a above that profit margin they'd have to pay back to insurance companies or her or individual to pay for dialysis treatment so I'm effectively as it it it's a profit cap for fees for this industry\nThe back story here is that um the vast majority of the houses in California are owned by a to a for profit company there's the veto a kidney care than present his medical care\nAnd for years the um\nThe service Employees International union in the United healthcare workers the union that represents a lot of health care workers and California have um been trying to to unionize this the workers with them as industry they sponsored\nLegislation they floated other ballot measures as well to to to require higher staffing ratios\nAnd so this is sort of the latest um ... I mean their argument is that the um these companies are um have a giant market share and so as a result they're able to cut corners of the expense of of a patient care\nSo their argument is pretty straightforward but you know these companies are extremely profitable and they need to make sure that that they're not putting profit several of quality of care and the sort of force them more to invest more in equipment and training and in a ploy use\nMushroom from from the federal government or even more importantly a it would be potentially quite inconvenient I mean obviously reset her car who over inconvenient but there were times where they can be in the California with what we were there for a\nTime schedule from the ... maker things a little bit\nComplicated for for trade or communication and then there's the question of you know do we want to have a situation where winter uh folks were getting up in the dark and and kids are going to school and and you know going to school when it's still you know as far out of ... I'm an for those of safety concerns well all\nRight and said the groups for at California Democratic party Republican Party Green Party and friends committee on legislation of California\nBen I Know we have to let you go and I just want to say thank you so much to you and everybody account matters because you all have done excellent work on this election and you did a great job of explaining these proposition ... thank you for your time and thanks for your work\nOff by ... by from\nChristopher is covering the twenty Eighteen election season for ... matters a nonprofit journalism venture committed to explaining how California state Capitol works and why it matters they do really great work I Hope you can check out to count matters and also if you want more information on props KLW news cross currents\nIs doing a a ... on the website ... yet KLW dot org you can find their explanations also of the propositions what it means if you vote yes what it means if you vote no and those are election briefs\nNow we're going to switch gears and follow the money the amount of money raised for the midterms has already surpassed three point nine billion dollars which is another record and voters across the country will decide on the future of the U.S Congress\nCalifornia plays a very significant role in shaping control of the house\nAccording to Rolling Stone California is home to ten or more swing seats nearly half of the twenty three that Democrats need to recapture the house in November\nJoining us to talk about money and politics in California is Daniel Newman president of map light and nonprofit that reveals the influence of money in politics Hi Danielle welcome to the show\nThank you it's great to be here well I Want to thank you also because voters edge dot org the ballot guy that you put together with the league of women voters has really it's just amazing I think we use it on every single show so thanks for all the work that you're doing there\nIt's our pleasure and I'm as or your listeners may know you go to voters that shut or you type in your street address and it tells you who's on your ballot even down to the local level the city council school board and judges as well\nAnd it's a fantastic and information and you know Daniel the way that things are these days unfortunately as you just have to follow the money with everything and in some cases that can really determined the way you vote I mean I'm so glad we did the show today because I just didn't know that the proper eight dialysis prop\nI mean the no side has spent over a hundred million dollars do you know is this a record for balance in California\nUm it's not a rock in some but it is a ... a very high one and we we see that here you have an interest of the kidney dialysis providers would be limited in fees and they're gonna they're spending an enormous amount of money to try and block the measure\nAnd is there anything else stand out for you it just in terms of how much money's being spent on the propositions\nThink the really the prop ten which is the one that would allow local cities do have their own rent control laws um is is a really a a large money one also be due to the financial interests are on the yes side you've got twenty million dollars I'm so far with the largest funder being age health aides healthcare\nSixty million from realtors and property developers who obviously are opposed to uh rent control laws\nRight at the numbers have gone up since we did a show a couple of weeks ago again ... ten would repeal Costa Hawkins and allow local governments to implement rent control laws so as you said the yes side the group that wants to repeal Costa Hawkins for more rent control\nHas spent about twenty million the no side almost sixty million and California association of realtors is at the top with five million Blackstone property partners they bought a ton of housing after the two thousand eight crash five million western national\nGroup another five million so there's a lot at stake on ... on this one in so many others\nThere isn't that great guy that this the government send you in the mail that explains the propositions\nOr unfortunately doesn't have the up to date or any money information and so sites like voters edge and others will have that and I found that the these propositions obviously there's so much to learn and going to the voters that China and looking at the money in favor and oppose can I can really shortcut voter decision\nMaking and have you decide who who who thought are you on basically in terms of his supporters and opponents on the funding side\nAnd ... also unveiled another great tool to track money and politics the California political money tracker tell us about this project and what we can find out about individual candidates\nYes so on the the you go to the map lake out or exciting can see the\nPolitical money tracker and it shows you or you can look up a any candidate that you want that is running for state office so do you look up a Gavin Newsom candidate for governor of course\nAnd you can see his support are right now totally forty throughout wrote forty three million dollars and one of the neat things about the tools that puts together the money that's given to\nNuisance campaign and also the people spending what's called independent expenditures which basically means unlimited money and supported him and his his opponent in the primary opponent John Cox\nA raise about Eighteen million dollars so\nFar and I'm just searching for Gavin Newsom to come up with some names here what oh this is interesting to support for new some is forty two million opposition to new some Seventeen million\nTop contributors a California Democratic party a hundred and twenty thousand dollars green spoon a lot of these things I've never heard of United Health group United food and commercial workers\nAnd so you've got that and then you see the top independent spenders which is really important\nExactly for the independent spending is really the unlimited spending so you have groups and individuals that can spend an unlimited amount and support or opposition to a candidate and those are really I'm driving a lot of races right now in Congress as well as the state\nAnd the top independent spender for Gavin Newsom as citizens supporting new some sponsored by labor organizations and Blue Shield of California five million dollars\nRight so we're labor and health insurance group and then you can go in and and type in the name of that group in the state website and and drill down further if you want to [noise]\nWhat strikes you about some of them house races in California and how much money Republicans and Democrats are raising\nWell so I Would not have an exact figures in hand it's really the competitive races obviously Dr most of the spending and most of the fundraising and and the um what what's really a difference in the last eight years since the horrible Citizens United Supreme Court decision\nThat you have corporations and individuals are spending unlimited amounts to um to influence politics and and it's especially problematic in the so called dark money groups which is groups that don't have to disclose their donors and have been a big factor in all the um\nPlay in California nearly half of the twenty three that Democrats need to recapture the house in November and according to the LA Times and the top seven most competitive house races in California Democratic candidates raised as staggering Twenty one point six million dollars\nOver the last three months by comparison Republicans running for the seats took in four point two million that's a huge difference\nIt is and and I think um you know even though these these numbers are large is really hard to get a sense of what they actually mean\nI mean a elections are really inexpensive compared to how important they are for people I mean we're going to spend as a country a much more on Halloween and we are going to spend on the federal elections this year\nAnd cheese [laughter] that Daniel when you look at the money I mean at the federal level according to uh open secrets we've already hit about three billion dollars just for the midterms which is at a record\nAnd you know a lot of people actually I'm Sorry three point nine billion and people are really just tired of the amount of money that's being spent on election so\nThe real issue is is not so much the money being spent I think where it comes from and right now overwhelmingly corporations and very rich people are providing most of the money or unions also contribute but there are a modest factor compared to the the um the the very rich people computer into superPACs and the\nCorporate donations notes that ... what's needed is a public funding a lack of elections are voter owned elections and so in Berkeley for example ah the um voters last year rebounding in twenty sixteen resoundingly passed\nA matching funds program so now if your candidate for office in Berkeley and you opt into this a public funding system\nIf you decide to limit your ...\nYour campaign contributions to only fifty dollars than every dollar you raise is matched with another six dollars from the city fun and so what this means is that you don't have to depend on special interests you don't have to spend your time calling people on the phone asking for big donations you can go door to door you can have grassroots event", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018",

H. M. U. dot org the medical I Wonder if we could pick up with that last question I asked Casey Kendra\nAnd voted out of Congress they are so polarized we need to start over\nHow much do you get a sense that the pure polarization of today's politics is just changing the way voters approached this year's midterms I mean you know Nancy Pelosi's name still comes up quite a bit on the campaign trail she's a of an obvious kind of a hot button for many Republican voters but\nIt is that working in terms of making people show up or is it just turning people off\nYou know a lot of people might be an are frustrated with politics in the country but we're seeing the opposite effect of not keeping people home or or voting for some third party coalition in fact it's people strapping on the T shirts and going as hard as they can\nI Do in their political corners I mean the fact is midterms are usually about activist they're usually about the hardest core a people within the party but in fact we're seeing the potential for a surge this year in turnout I spoke to Michael McDonald who's a professor at the University of Florida who's really\nOne of the preeminent turnout experts in the country maintains a turnout database he expects there to be a turnout of about forty five fifty percent of eligible voters this year that doesn't sound like a lot but it would be the highest level for mid term since the mid Nineteen sixties\nAnd that is really spurred on by all of this high interest or seeing high turnout in primary than in special elections\nAnd you know frankly you've seen Democrats really fired up to vote against this president and we've seen that according to a few sixty percent of people say the president is a factor in their vote and that's higher than it's ever been\nA wonder wanna summers what your take is on that in terms of the the potential playbook for Democrats first of all let's just said a little context is focused on the house for example how many seats with the Democrats need to flip the house\nShirts that Democrats would need twenty three seats in order to take control of the house of representatives and right now most public pull in when we look across the landscape suggests that\nThey're doing they're making good efforts and things are looking good for them right now one thing that I've noticed as I've been talking to folks you work on the Democratic side of the aisle who are professional political folks is they're spending a lot of money to make sure that their voter turnout and particularly looking at the types of voters infrequent voters who say\nMay show up in a presidential election year but are more likely to stay home and I'm an off year or mid term here and there was a reason for that\nTypically when we look at the electorate that shows up for mid term elections it's typically older whiter and more Republican tell things that you see Democrats spending a lot of money and a lot of time on the ground trying to turn out younger voters those millennials voters of color or Latino African Americans and Asians\nWho are more likely to vote for Democrats are also more likely to stay home and mentor mirrors\nIs there a certain benchmark wanna for what Democrats would consider for lack of a better word a blowout slide you use the goal just to get a fifty percent plus one or is there a larger like a stretch gold at the Democratic party is aiming for\nWhat I'm hearing from most people including Ben ray Lujan a congressman who chairs the demographic democratic congressional campaign committee is\nThey don't think this is going to be a blowout year they feel confident and their chances of taking back the house of turning the house ... but I don't think most people most members of Congress were involved in this would say that there's going to be a huge blue waves crashing over a pick up some ten seats or something like that they're focused on delivering that\nTwenty three at turning the the House bill and the message I keep hearing from them as they want to do that as a a balance of power right now Republicans control every branch of government and they want to restore balance of power to this administration\nYou know this idea of a blue wave was the focus of an email from Marty who wrote I'm all about the blue wave but I'm afraid that between voter disenfranchisement lingering gerrymandering and possible foreign interference\nYou about some of the polling what are some of the main trends in national polls right now in terms of how the Democrats and Republicans might do well\nWhen we look at our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist polling Democrats have had an advantage on what's known as the congressional ballot who would you prefer to be a two run Congress ... the Democrat in your district or the Republican the ... in your district\nYou know we've had an advantage for Democrats anywhere from seven to twelve points over from the summer until now\nOr other polling other public polling shown it to be double digits that's about the range that Democrats feel like they would be able to take the at least that was twenty three seats in the house and I look at some other factors to just look at the landscape and the playing field and when I gamed out or how many seats would be up for grabs this year\nI found that there are ... seats that were a competitive to potentially competitive despite all the talk of Kavanaugh you know that confirmation battle in ... Republicans and it certainly did\nOnly six of those seats are democratic held seats Seventy four seats are of the potentially competitive to competitive landscape are held by Republicans no matter what you look at that and you know if the Democrats win half of those that's the house\n[noise] glad to hear from some of you with regards to your concerns about them in terms including about the nature of polling in general do medical I Love you to respond to this comment from a listener who left a note in our inbox\nI'm Alan from Ashville North Carolina\nAnd I'm frustrated with the elections with not having enough\nHoles in down ballot races even even U.S House but they house and stuff because if it's a close election I Want to vote Democrat\nAt least at the federal and state level but it it's a good weekend that I Want to vote a third party greener libertarian\nOr write my own it so I Need to know what the host or not if it's a it's an issue where\nIf my vote might be the deciding vote\nAnd I need all I Need some old you are to divide and it it actually changes my vote\nAlan thanks for your comment Dominican that cracks me up or if he wants to run for office he should run for office if he wants to a vote third party because that's his conscience than he should do so\nI get a pragmatic approach though and I think a lot of you know establishment Democrats would argue that they wish there were a lot more voters like him who voted in Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania for the Democrat instead of voting for the third party candidate now when it comes to polls look\nThere is a huge problem in this country when it comes to a polling generally and then when you go and drill down into the state level or district level or state house level my goodness\nThe response rate that people are getting from polling is lower and lower and lower every year in other words you make a phone call does somebody wish to participate in that that just continues to decrease\nIt takes a lot of money to conduct a good pole and to get a sizable enough sample that the results are representative and it's really tough and I would just say go based on the issues and vote your conscience\nYeah quite a lot of you express real concern with the very nature of polling Peter wrote on our Facebook page please discuss the obsession the media NPR included has with a horse race method of election coverage is an irresponsible journalism to report on polls one such reporting could affect turnout or elections are not sporting events\nAnd Michael wrote on our Facebook page unit which still trust polls remember how that turned out in twenty sixteen\n[noise] yeah I mean I you know look I mean the the tried and true a criticism\nI Would disagree that were obsessed quote unquote with polling we do use it to pepper our coverage and to give us a sense of what the snap shots are within districts in fact\nI'm far more interested in trends in polls rather than poll to pull horse race I think that's a not a good way to look at the polling uh I think that uh again overall trends and you know issues and questions\nOf giving you a sense of a kind of a temperature read of people is way more useful\nI should note earlier this year back in February we did a whole hour on the nature of political polling Dominican was part of the panel you can listen to that program which he called can we trust polls\nOn our website to search for it on line at the one a dot org that's the word ... the number one bullet or a dot org\nWanna I also kind of feel like the comment we heard from Alan Hughes exactly what many democratic operatives are afraid of that Democrats would be like oh it's a shoe in ... I ... I don't need to go vote as opposed to saying no I'm going to vote because my vote matters Allen sounds exactly like the kind of voter and God Bless them\nBut the exactly like the kind of voters it makes many democratic operatives tear their hair out\nThat is absolutely right when I've spoken to democratic operatives and those and democratic and progressive leaning outside groups they're worried ... about voters like Alan while they see their chance they're good at taking back the house they've really been focusing on a message of social responsibility and take our thinking of the conversation I had with\nFolks over at the end up ... who said that they're telling our message to make sure\nThat voting as a responsibility that comes a pattern for their voters so that they show up again and again and again because there are elections every year and they're trying to set the sense that yes while maybe Democrats stand a chance of taking back the house and twenty Eighteen there is an election almost every year coming up now and this is really the ground game they're setting I had for twenty twenty so that those voters\nThe complete inability of the Dems to get a message and stick to it I've gone to my local Democratic Party website in the front page does not see what they are for does not told me what they care about one summers you've been following the Democrats in the run up\nTo the midterms how common is Laurie complaint and how well are Democrats doing an answering it\nWell I think lawyers pointing to is actually really comment and I think Democrats are trying to figure out how it affects that and number of the conversations I had I have recently wrote an article that looks at how Democrats are trying to\nMake sure they have record mid term turnout and they said that when they're talking to voters are sending out mailers are going and knocking the people's doors in these battleground states and districts are trying to make sure\nThat they're telling their voters that they have a message that they are running on rather than just having these conversations that are about just running against President Trump and they said um I was talking to some groups that dead centerfield testing recently among Latino voters and they salmon and when they get this field testing\nAnd they were saying people were turned out they said if they got to try a mailer from their local democratic candidate had President Trump face on it they'd be super turned off right they throw that away they wouldn't even engage or see who the candidate was so I think they're really trying to tweak that matching you're talking about what they can do for them what's at stake that that's\nThat's why you hear are Democrats nationally talking about how this is the most important election of our lifetimes why you hear that healthcare message I think as demanding to know that being such a huge share of the advertising that you're seeing from pro democratic groups it's because they do realize that they need a message for their voters to coalesce around otherwise they're not going to turn out\nTo medical I Wonder if we can follow up on the scene with one more voice mail from a listener on the east coast here's what judge John left in our inbox\nShould try and raise ... New York\nSo often on the shows people for the Republicans the Democrats the Republicans the Democrats the Republicans would\nInstead of doing that they should be focusing on specific policies namely the Democrats that stand for searching for\nThe Republicans that stand for such and such it helped educate listeners because you don't gain anything by just growing Democrats Republicans Democrats Republicans\nJohn thanks very much for calling and sharing your thoughts with us no medical for me I don't know how you hear this but for me as a journalist I feel uncomfortable saying the Democrats who stand for ... I feel more comfortable saying the Democrats who say they stand for ... or the Democrats who have done\nThat to me journalistically that's more reliable but I Do take John's\nPoint that it just feels a little bit too\nBroad brush yeah I mean we have to always be aware of trying to get into some of the issues and where are the party stand on these things and what they've been pushing I think that that's been part of\nThe pushback and why you've seen so much interest from Democrats obviously in this election because they've seen so much of what\nPresident Obama did a regulations that were put in place that have been rolled back for example a by the environmental protection agency a and a whole host of other things including an immigration policy that Democrats are firmly against\nAnd it's also what you saw a as a rise of the Tea Party in twenty ten where they didn't trust a lot of their government officials including a lot of Republicans and how they essentially took over the Republican Party with that message of uh taxed enough already and being really in opposition to\nA President Obama's health care act so the party sand for very very different things and we're seeing that play out and going to come to a head and in this in this midterm\nStudio I Wonder if you can respond to a listener who left a note on our website the one eight dot org listening\nTo go high when opponents go low what is the effectiveness of negative campaigns are the negative campaign ads coming from a particular party or group Cady\nOh I think everyone's guilty and I don't think any party as a\nAs an Israeli going going high all the time right and I think that's because it's effective and it really sticks with people as much as people like to say that they dislike negative advertising and I think actually do\nA it is a memorable and it certainly a bill that impression that people are going to remember and that's why we see so much of it and that's why we have jobs here ... [laughter] that's funny to do\nYou you will never be unemployed not ever\nThe medical touch on some of the diversity of the candidates this time around quite a few record numbers\nOf women running a record numbers of el ... out L G two candidates running some of whom spoke to Ari Shapiro on all things considered earlier give us a sense of what that means for the midterms and whether many of these candidates are considered to send a strong chance of winning\nWell look you're correct that there are a lot of people um who are\nA ... of diverse backgrounds I mean women are the biggest bloc of this that are really driving the midterms you think a lot of Native American candidates or you know just a New Hampshire their ... who is\nA an openly gay man or he would be the first gay representative from the state of New Hampshire if he wins in a new in the first congressional district there in New Hampshire the Democrat now\nBut when again and we look at the power of the midterms women they have been fired up since the day President Trump\nWas elected when we're talking about when and where I Am a democratic women there have been two hundred and thirty five women who have been nominated for ah for Congress for their party's nomination a hundred and eighty three of those a hundred and eighty three has been democratic women just if you were to take the number of democratic women who are running\n... that would be bigger than the record previously of all women combined who're nominees and that was a hundred and sixty seven\nSo I'm Sorry you just just to clarify the numbers are basically saying that three out of four women in this in this go round a democratic women who've been nominated\nAbsolutely that's absolutely right and the the wave of democratic women the year of the woman quote unquote round to ah after Nineteen Ninety two after the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill area have been driven by democratic women and we've seen them be very fired up in poll after poll\nAnd you know they're going to lead the march to the polls for Democrats and if they win the house it's going to be largely because of women\nWanted there are some races where you know women are making a very historic a historic showing I mean the Arizona Senate races going on right now between here and send them at the Democrat and more with Sally the Republican you know Arizona is going to have\nA female senator in that seat I Wonder how much you see this as a bipartisan trend we heard the numbers from Dominican oh but do we get the sense\nThat both parties both major parties are trying to be part of this trend trying to embrace this trend\nSure so I think that the energy and when we talk about female candidates a certainly more on the side of the Democrats than Republicans I think that's frustrated and number of Republican women I spoke to chew women who founded the group Republican women for progress recently and they told me that they were really concerned that their party doesn't have an apparatus to cultivate\nYoung promising Republican conservative went and\nFrom the local the local level seats all the lap so nothing that really reflects say what you see on the left on the Democratic side from emily's list a group that cultivate and backs\nA pro abortion rights when in female candidates so there there's some concern certainly among Republicans and my colleagues that he actually asked Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell about that the question came and this back and forth about the Senate Judiciary committee and the lack of Republican women on that panel\nBrett now justice Brett Kavanaugh and these women were really and why there were no women there Mitch McConnell said you know that's something he doesn't like it is something he wants to see more up but I still haven't heard Republicans\nForthrightly at least to me answer if this is such a problem if you want to see more women in the Senate on your side if you want to see more women moving up in the house and we should note that there is a woman and Republican leadership and Cathy McMorris Rodgers but where does women come from because\nAs we know running for office is very expensive it's very tough it's very tactical if you don't have helping you don't have an apparatus those people are never going to show up\nSpeaking of women Republican leadership to medical I I'm not sure if you've seen anybody\nRunning or campaigning talking about Senator Susan Collins of Maine and her decision to allow the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation before that long expedition she gave in the Senate floor\nThat made a lot of people rather upset with her final decision I haven't personally seen that'd be made into any kind of political hay for democratic candidates would have have you\nWell she's lucky she's not up for re election year if she were a she would certainly have a lot of pressure on her back there in the same way that a lot of these Democrats\nIn red states that President Trump won have had to weigh and measure\nTheir vote for Brett Kavanaugh I mean you know it's no surprise that Joe mansion minutes after Susan ... Susan Collins a says she was going to vote for Brett Kavanaugh he released a statement saying that he would vote for break out on it would've been a whole lot different if Susan Collins I come out and said she was going to be against Brett Kavanaugh what would Joe Manchin do then\nJenny from India emailed my concern is voter suppression\nI'm terrified that the votes will not be counted correctly it is frightening what is happening in North Dakota in Georgia what can be done to stop this we heard from quite a few of you about voter suppression including one of our listeners in North Carolina who lifted notes who are out one a vox pop\nThis is God's ray from Charlotte my biggest concern is that people will not understand or recognize how important their vote for this election and how that can have ramifications on\nThe elimination of names from voter long how can we be a country that champions and promote democracy when we don't make it easy for all citizens to vote not just for what

A. M. U. dot org comments on our Facebook page or tweet us at one a\nSusanna Craig let me start with you how did this report come about I assume it was kind of a natural outgrowth of the times is previous reporting about Donald Trump after he declared himself to be a candidate it\nIt was we I'm In late two thousand and a sixteen I was mailed three pages of\nDonald Trump's Nineteen Ninety five tax returns and all of his reporting as sort of been in one way or another you know just an outgrowth of our our study of his taxes and and and those taxes in particular showed something very interesting which was not your Donald Trump at a loss\nEssentially gave him a bit of a gift card from the IRS allowed him to shelter hot up almost a billion dollars going forward um and we learn then six months later we thought you know these losses were so huge\nAnd then in March to thousands Seventeen three more pages of his tax returns um are found um released on Rachel Maddow show\nAnd they show that he made a hundred and fifty million dollars that year and this was for two thousand five and this thing started with a simple question which is how did we get from this law to this profit in two thousand\nAnd five and we just started to to ask questions around that and pulse string and we quickly realized after that that much of it um came from a sale of his father's real estate in two thousand and for his father Fred Trump the real estate developer who died in Nineteen Ninety nine\nAnd we just started to pull and pull and pull and we realized um as we did in the reporting went on just the great fortune that that Donald Trump um inherited not just in two thousand four from his father after his death that throughout his life year by year a writer by dollar loan by loan\n... can you give us a sense of how you reported this out I I Know you've gotten a number of documents from a number of sources tax returns are not a document that presidential candidates or or anyone really is required to release\nThey're attain tended recipients according to the mailings included Hillary and Bill Clinton Iraq Obama Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder democratic donor George Soros democratic California congresswoman Maxine Waters\nFormer CIA director John Brennan an actor Robert De Niro all of them have been vocal critics of President Trump at least one\nShelters lifted as its return address shields as the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee it bounced back to that district office when it failed to reach its intended recipient Eric Holder\nThe bond that was sent to John Brennan was sent in care of CNN studios on Columbus Circle in New York when it was discovered the entire CNN building the time Warner center was evacuated\nAnd the FBI says additional packages may have been mailed elsewhere and initial examination shows that at least five of the bombs are rudimentary but functional none of the bombs detonated on site and no one has been hurt as far as we know\nNow President Trump urged unity during the White House press conference yesterday\nThe full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice we will spare no resources are expense in this effort\nAnd I just wanted to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together\nAnd send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America [noise]\nLater during a rally in Wisconsin and in a tweet the president once again urged unity but he also blame the press for supposedly stoking political divisions this morning the president tweeted quote\nA very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false an inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I refer to as fake news and it's gotten so bad and hateful but it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act\nFast unquote this story is moving very fast and again there's still a lot\nThat we do not know including who is behind the suspicious devices and what message they exactly we're trying to send will keep that keep you up to speed as quickly as we can you'll get more details of course on your NPR member station and online at NPR dot org\nLet's get back to our discussion about the Trump family empire and the true nature of President Trump's wealth with Susan ... must be ... of the New York times we walk more of your questions about this investigation comments on our Facebook page tweet us ... won a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nBack to that comment with regards to avoidance versus evasion of taxes Suzanne I Wonder how your reporting turned out in terms of how much money it appears that Trump's should have paid in taxes but didn't do we have a sense of what the difference was between those two\nI mean it it it comes into the hundreds of millions of dollars range I mean they did pay some tax on um the schemes that we found 'em in the IRS push push back\nOn some of the um some of the things that they submitted that didn't add up to them but ultimately we we felt that there was hundreds of millions of dollars that should have been paid to various talks authorities but weren't\nSuzanne and one of the aspects that comes up in the investigation has to do with valuations I mean when Fred Trump's children took over his empire they valued at at a little over forty one million dollars all the buildings and all the businesses that they had in the various kind of larger Trump family organization\nWhen they sold the business ... business was off over the next decade they sold for sixteen times more than the valuation can you give us a sense Suzanne of how valuations kind of what you say something is worth factors into all of this\nValuations became a a a theme quit quickly in the in our reporting once\nI'm sort of writ large when it when it benefited the trumps to put a low valuation on buildings when they didn't want to pay taxes on it they would do that and go to great lengths to to put values that just seemed ridiculous to us I'm low buildings worth you know a hundred million plus we get a\nValuation of you know five ten million\nBut on the same amount when they had a charitable donation um where they were a high valuation um would benefit them they went high so when it benefited them to go high they went high when it benefited them to go low we saw them go very low\nAnd of course if you inaccurately said the value of something to the IRS and that compromise is the amount of taxes the IRS may or may not be able to assess on that but Russ I Wonder if you could respond\nTo a tweet from Matthew who asks how common are the various tax Dodgers committed by the Trump family that also goes with another comment from Bryce several if you've been asking\nWhether this is kind of unique to the trumps Bryce run on our Facebook page I Would like to know how common to sort of tax dodging inheritance scheme is among the very rich after the Panama and paradise papers I just assume everyone riches engaged in a lifelong struggle to subvert the law in order to get richer rough [laughter]\nThose are those are very good questions I there are some of these\nSome of the things that we are talking about here that we uncovered are um trust arrangements that the IRS has endorsed sometimes after being pushed\nBy a trust in a state attorneys I'm a ... and that that that are widely used one of them this grants or retained annuity trust which is the formal name for the mechanisms through which Donald Trump in his siblings took ownership of their fathers empire in the nineties\nThere's actually a commercial BDO the consulting firm runs a commercial where my daughter is trying to persuade her father to pass on the family winery through one of these trust 'em so there there are quite common\nThen there are other aspects of of things that we uncovered that are not common at all and are not endorsed they set up a corporation that serves no purpose of when pat invoices so Donald Trump and his siblings could start\nTaking some of their fathers profits that's not that's not anything that's endorsed by the IRS that's patently fraudulent on on its face um and so those kinda things aren't a gray area and they're not widely used so it's a it's a mix of things that we are talking about here and even in the cases where\nThey use a mechanisms like the trust that are well established and widely used by wealthy people the trumps really push the limits the boundaries of those things in ways that a trust in a state attorneys that we consulted with an exam and these things said we're beyond the pale of of anything they'd seen in their careers\nBefore we get into more of the details I'd like to get one more comment that was sent in a ... voice mail from one of our listeners who is struggling with the idea that the trumps actually did anything wrong here's what Jeff left in our inbox\nIs Jeff St Clair falls Wisconsin many many successful people have received benefits and their father I see this is a story the second part is taxes avoided\nThat is illegal method of reducing your tax bill through existing a statute taxes evaded now that would be interesting but so far all areas\nThat he use certain ... to avoid paying taxes as we all do we all take adoption standard or otherwise\nJeff thanks for sharing your thoughts with Suzanne what would you say to Jeff\n...\nThe top I mean these aren't standard deductions one one of the um one of the things that we wrote about the ... you mentioned um with a company that was set up it's it's interesting 'cause it's true that the rich\nCross the line into illegality and one of the companies that we wrote about um this company called all county building supply\nIt was set up in Nineteen Ninety to its sole purpose was to to fraud the higher for fraud the IRS to avoid taxes what it was it was a fairly simple mechanism and explain it and and I think reader or your listeners can kind of come to their ... to a conclusion on it\nFor a Trump in in the early Nineteen nineties was getting old he had a ton of buildings he had a lot of cash 'em and the Trump siblings were looking at a situation if Fred Trump died where they would have to pay at the time it would have been a fifty five percent of state tax on all the cash that his buildings were sitting on and we're talking\nTens and tens of millions of dollars so what they did was for years Fred Trump he would go out and he would buy supplies for his buildings you know we're talking boilers paint everything boilers paint supplies fridge is does all those sort of things and then one day\nInstead of him buying it all counties starts buying all of this stuff all county is owned by Donald Trump and his siblings and another family member\nAnd all counties starts paying for all this stuff and they'll pay let's say three hundred dollars for an air conditioner ... the company all county then created a padded receipt and with Bill Fred Trump five hundred dollars for the same air conditioner the two hundred dollars in profit was divided between siblings\nAnd then there's another step so they start they drain cash they drained we sought millions and millions of dollars from Fred Trump's empire ... money that no they no longer have to pay the estate tax on then they turn around and they take those receipts\nOr don't plan on voting why or why not\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one egg again for starters if you live in Kansas Michigan or Colorado is there a candidate or ballot initiative that you're passionate about or if you do not plan on voting why not\nTell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a\nThat's eight five five to three six one two one two you'll find more details on one a across America on line at the one eight dot org will share some of your stories and tell you a bit more about across America this Monday on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Susan Craig and ... of the New York times two times to get in a few more of your questions and comments won a X. W. A. M. U. dot org before we get some more questions from our listeners Suzanne what about the IRS his role in all of\nThis is their job to catch the French trumps of the world doing what Fred Trump did how did they reflect on this\nIt it is their job and it's an interesting um you know a theme throughout\nThe story when we started to look at the different um schemes and I think one thing to remember about the IRS is um you know ... large um they're understaffed and and often a lot of stuff does get through I'm an ... I think that that sort of became a parent's house as we were sort of looking at the totality\nOf the uh the ...\nThat we saw we do see I'm In some of the things that we found that the IRS did push back\nAnd you know from talking to the tax experts that we did um you understand when when the IRS does see something um there's back and forth I'm with you know and it would have been in this case the trumps but with the people were ... where were problems are found and eventually they come to his settlement\nAnd we we saw that additional toxins certain things was paid when they saw valuations that they too agreed were low um and then the cases settled in and and things move on in the case of all county um we found no evidence that the IRS I'm like oh county as the company where they had they were putting the voices in order to drain\nI'm Fred Trump's empire and in in cases like that we saw no evidence um that they were aware of what the trumps we're doing there so it's sort of a mix of they caught some stuff in and they push back an extra tax was paid here and there and then other cases where we're not convinced they even knew what was going on\nNow that you report has come out Ross have we heard anything more from the IRS they plan to look into any of these allegations or is it is it too late or or their statute of limitations that are involved\nThere are statute of limitations on any potential criminal charges those have since told there is if there's fraud involved there's not a statute of limitations on civil penalties and and collection of back taxes we haven't heard anything from the IRS we wouldn't necessarily expect to they generally run\nVery silent and most people who work at the IRS are forbidden by law from talking about any individual taxpayer we have heard from New York City in New York state taxation authorities\nWho say based on uh the the reporting that we did they have opened investigations and and are looking for ways or if there's a reason to collect a back taxes with penalties\nBenjamin has a clarifying question about all county building supply and maintenance Benjamin tweeted did all county building have to pay taxes on the income it made how much of a difference is the percentage from the estate tax Suzanne would you say there as well\nUm ... it's a good question the estate tax that they were looking at what have been fifty five percent\nWhen I'm would've had to pay some tax that would have been a business tax\nUm and it would have been substantially less than it's interesting at least in the case of the president we know because of the law says that he it incurred throughout his um his life that he may be ... potentially would've been able to shelter the income and not paid taxes on it because in America when you have\nYou know law says you're allowed to use those losses to offset future income so we just don't know exactly what each of them paid but it would have been substantially less than fifty five percent state tax if they were facing\nPart of the story also one of the other aspects of this the kinds of stands out is is how Fred Trump went to some pretty great lengths to bail out Donald Trump repeatedly if he ran into financial trouble rush there was one story that involves millions of dollars of poker chips\nOne of Donald Trump's failed casinos ... can you explain that to us so\nThat was uh in in Nineteen Ninety Donald Trump was really in its darkest moment he was facing a a payment on a bond basically a money he owns owed to lenders\nUm and he couldn't make it from the revenue the casinos his father's a lawyer showed up with checks totaling three and a half million dollars\nBought some gambling chips took the chips back out to the limousine and went back to queens with them and uh and never cash them so that was a venture determined to be an illegal loan Fred Trump or had given his son to help them make a payment get over that hump\nI Wonder if we all should be clear here I mean even if\nEven if officials in New York or the IRS had known all of these things about the Trump family Suzanne and had decided you know what let's go after them let's rain down to a full force civil law on the trumps and make an example of them\nHow much could they've really done I mean what what's the worst case scenario that Fred Trump and the trumps might have faced at the time if they had been caught and fully prosecuted\nOr a big one is they would have had to pay taxes on all the uh on all the money but there could have been civil civil fines I'm there potentially could have been criminality\nI mean we talked about one area without county where you know they use these padded receipts that they are that they came up with to drain the empire they didn't pass those costs\nOnto the tenants and I'm In doing so you know they they inflated they they did it on and you know they did it with inflated receipts and they shouldn't have done it that potentially could go into areas of wire fraud among other areas and not\nSo there's a range of things um and now you could be looking at not only having to um they're they're facing potential not only back taxes but penalties in interest on the money that vote so there's there's a lot of things that that I think various taxing authorities um another authorities could be looking at um\nWhat is this could they have ended up in in federal prison for this\n...\nFederal or state prison it depends on who choose to prosecute the clearest a legal violation that could go into a crime was what she was describing all county they were filing false documents with a state agency um and there would be lower level charges that would flow to that\nAnd yes those could be we've talked to several former prosecutors who said that looks like\nSomething that could have clearly been prosecuted as a state crime\nClearly some of our listeners so if you feel that this is not as big a story as some of our listeners feel it is Charlie wrote on our Facebook page sounds like President Trump is more brilliant than we ever thought and freedom and Jay tweeted so you're prove that Donald Trump success did start with a loan from his father\nAs he stated where exactly is the discrepancy none Suzanne ...\nComments I had one one thing that when when we started out Donald\nDollar loan and he built it into a billion dollar empire he's now in the White House and he ran a campaign based on being sort of a self made billionaire um there's no evidence necessarily that he is a billionaire\nBut what we showed is that he inherited hundreds of millions of dollars over his lifetime from his father um and some of that was done through tax fraud\nPeople may or may not care about that but I think it's an important\nUm narrative of of somebody now in the White House about how he got his fortune um and where the money came from it doesn't necessarily um stay he didn't get revenue or money from other areas um you know there's been stories that some of it it's come from Russia but what we showed is that much more of that came from his father\nUm over his lifetime and that he was willing to cross the line\nUm to shelter from having to pay taxes I think that's an important chapter and the president's life that\nYou know people can digest it the way they want it but it's it's important at least to us that those stocks and not truth is out there\nThere's also like a secondary aspect to that as well he's always portrayed his father is too much of a small timer that any money to be even of interest to him and what we've seen clearly sue scribe who they're rewriting of his father's will in Nineteen Ninety\nOr in these various schemes that Donald Trump engineered in the nineties uh when he was like it a low point is it not only was his father of incredible wealth his father himself fifty million dollars in Nineteen Ninety when Donald Trump was flat broke\nA but Donald Trump care very much about getting as much of that wealth that he could he went beyond the bounds of law unsettling says to try to claw as much as he could\nAnd all the time that he was doing this over the decades he was hiding it from public view very aggressively and that really does kind of if you're interested in Donald Trump's real life story rewrite that story\nI mean it's it's not the story that you were going to read and I'm In the art of the deal where you know everything that Donald Trump got was got you know by his own hard work and\nAnd uh and shoo Heather I'm you know business smarts and all that it's a story um we found that sucks about it at about a young boy from the time he was very young who got millions of dollars every year from his father and really every ... that he made ... covered", "show_name": "1A
