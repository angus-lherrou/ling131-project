Jason never told me about any trouble on that rig when he was home with me he was home with me and he didn't talk about the rig\nBut I Do remember this on the rise to the airport the next day Jason drove the truck\nUsually I drove so he could sleep but that day he wanted to drive and before he got out of the truck he looked at me and he said\nJoe ... is there anything were to happen to me up there on that ... would you and the kids stay in the house\nThen you're scaring me just jump\nWell probably not if I met someone else and remarried I wouldn't do that you're all over that house at houses your house it wouldn't be fair to the new man\nAnd then I said but let me be clear\nI don't want a new man okay\nI don't want a new man well that's good because I don't want to look down from heaven and she you making love the new new man either especially not my own house\nWould kill me ...

A. Macondo was taken from the Gabrielle Garcia Marquez novel one hundred years of solitude\nOh oh the well's out there have names\nWhen I started out my career offshore the only place a woman could work within the galley\nYou know the kitchen how's it going to change that let me tell you what I did\nFirst flight out I was terrified\nAnd I saw this majestic ...\nLike a cat for them to see a multimillion dollar castle in the middle of the feet\nHere the weighs twenty four hours a day\nGo to bed at night with a rig rock\nYou look out at the most incredible sunsets and sun rises and it was like looking into the face of\nDawn [noise] let me tell you what\nThese new rigs out there are more complex than the space shuttle is actually easier for that space shuttle to take off and connect to the international\nSpace station that it is to drill a well in deep water you see around the living thing it's a real odd creature it moves that breed\nAnd then you look at the picture today looks like the control room Houston in that thrilled tracks and by the way\nWe haven't changed our thinking much between those two stops Lillian Miller was haunted she wanted to talk\nShow or April twenty two thousand ten dancing blowout I'll never forget that day\nThey finished drilling at Mississippi Canyon\nEver preparing to move location\nThe job was basically done\nBut that doesn't add up by all accounts once and extremely gifted crew the best in the industry\nSo if this was going to happen\nIt should not have happened to them [noise]\n\nRaise your right hand surgeon and co Scott had these ... guys testifying just a few weeks after that blowout I made a timeline of events\nMr Harold do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God Bob the\nJimmy here all the old I Am the offshore installation manager with trans ocean that top man on the rig BP is the lease holder for the well but they hire transmission to do the drilling\nHurdles you briefly take us through the day of the incident okay we understand that April twenty two thousand ten was the day you were scheduled to finish the job of Macondo and move on to the next well\nThat's right it was the last day of operations out there\nOr we also understand that there were visitors on board the Deepwater Horizon or the day of the incident\nSo yeah sure we had a lot of visitors come out that die came out on her noon helicopter late play in trends ocean spent the better part would die you know talking with them or were they was paddled Ron David Sims Darwin's low buddy trade hand\nDawn a buddy with the trans ocean the other two would be the why were they there sir will we made several years no last time incident and they wanted to congratulate you on that\nNo last time can you explain that for the record pleas\nFor seven years we lost no work Tom owner Rick due to injury not single minute what happened when you executives ... while I was there to greet them at the job\nThings out here and ask a server\n... string yes we have full returns almost cement job early this morning we have left it was a negative Russian tests then displaced among the water\nMove all over the next we'll wait to see you\nOn a job like if we always\nThat was the way you just call you by the time you don't want them\nTo a gentleman let you get your ...\nOkay Mr Harrell so there's drilling and exploration job on board the Deepwater Horizon was forty seven days late is that correct that's correct ma'am forty seven days behind schedule yes ma'am and one of the day rate on that\nDoes it cost to drill a well in deep water die right on drilling is about five hundred and twenty five ... five hundred and twenty five\nThousand dollars per day less rocks\nNow Jimmy hair all had a lawyer sit next came when he was testifying listen to this\nWas your son about honey pressure say no no\nThere was no pressure being about twenty million dollars behind them the well what do you think you got right now but no ma'am are you sure Mr Harold\n... not all night show or not people\nDid it concern you that BP was regularly changing its drilling plans on the Deepwater Horizon particularly in the immediate days prior to the incident\nWell a lot of it was based on like you were scared of going to lose returns you know we had lost a lot of mud on his job so you haven't lost returns before on this well it was several cases yes we lost a month to the public kicks too we had to stop pop on one occasion\nI just want to clarify one last time you're losing mud you're taking kicks your forty seven days late and the only reason BP's vice president of drilling and completion and his counterpart were on the ring was to congratulate you on your safety record yeah\nThey can say that that does it from the VIPs didn't affect operations that when we come out to the ... it's not lost on anyone that those are the guys who can fire people\nState your name for the record sir\nMoms Randall ... also known as Randy\n... senior to push it with trans ocean second in command on the rig after Jimmy how\nMysteries do I want to ask you a few questions from the drill crew perspective is that okay okay mysteries them held a manner you fifty seven\nI think you said you started going offshore when you were I was Twenty one what was it like to go out to an offshore rig for the first time\nI'm I'm looking for the word intimidating me and another guy were starting out as Ross about when a when we landed there was a gentleman there to greet us he looked at the guy next to me and he said you see that man up they're not Derek\nAnd they're just be able to do that job and three months you think you can do it\nAnd he said no sir I'm Still hearts and you looked at me and he said what about you and I said Yes sir I can do it\nA new record and you did this I did\nA mystery though I'm going to show you a photo and I would like you to describe what you see\nThere's years Deepwater Horizon which sounds outrageous accrue part of the way from Korea where she was built over to the Gulf of Mexico sales are on their own power\nDrill team we're very proud of the wells were drilled we drill the well once at thirty thousand fifty feet which was a record we have the water temperature to held it for a while there are other we drills on fifty wells are not married and well all the way the Macondo\nMysteries though from the drill crew perspective what's the risk to drill and Mrs kick oil wells them at risk you could lose his life\nBefore April twenty two thousand ten was your drill crew aware of that\nWe were all highly aware of that have you ever miss the kick before April twenty two thousand ten we had enough now\nYou were the senior tool pusher on the Deepwater Horizon but who were the other two pushes on that rig at the time of the incident\nIt was ... and ... and you knew them both well is that correct ... I had worked with them a lot of years eight or nine years they were like brothers to me and the rich or other and you knew their families well there are so good choices while surely she called me a few times but\nUm labeled a return recall\nThat could have been on one of us out there you asked me before did we miss a kick though not\nWe had never missed a kick\nPeople say all kinds of things and someone you love died\nThey say time heals all wounds don't get me started on that one I always wanted to say oh yeah well what does and\nWhat is time doesn't do anything except remind you every single day of what you lost in that man oh I Am telling you he was funny\nJason was a funny man\nAfter we've been dating for a while everyone had me convinced that he was going to propose to me on Valentine's Day he took me to dinner and I kept checking the bread basket for a ring [laughter]\nThen I take the bottom of my drink thinking maybe drop it in there I even ate the raw oysters old dangerously thinking somehow he slips the ring and one of them\nI got up to go to the bathroom five times I kept ordering drinks I even tour my pantyhose on the way out of the restaurant I was so drunk and then I took them off in the truck and threw them out the window\nTwo weeks later\nHe was cleaning out his guns had them all out on the table and we were having people over his place and I said you've got to put these guns away they got kids and when I open the door to the gun closet there was the bags and the jeweler sitting right there\nHe picked it up and he handed it to me and he said you all this [noise]\nAnd I said yes I Do receipt still in the bag and everything [laughter] that was Jason you asked me before if I knew they were having trouble on that rig\nI didn't know about any trouble on that rig because Jason never told me about any trouble on that rig you wanted to protect me I Know he did I did talk to ... not\nRight before that last shift see live on the rig pretty much goes like this guy's workout they take a shower and they eat first but then they always call home to their wives Jason always called home\nThey only got a minute on the phone call so I could not\nChasing the kids would drive me crazy how're you doing out there\nEverything's fine you don't sound too good\nYears at a big hurry shall be peace plan is called for San Andreas operations darned displacement you're only supposed to keep your own one thing at a time I I don't know go step by step when you're finishing will won't operation at a time that's how I was taught\nEverything's happening to factor here I don't understand I Can't really get into it too much right now you can tell me ... or ... you understand\nJason you okay I gotta go now they got to get us off this world got to get us all home and what would you ...\nIf you love you to\nThe lows too thin that's what he told me the walls are too thin [noise]\nIt just came out of nowhere when the rig tilted I looked at my sister pages we constantly you know whether it wasn't are threatened her there was a series of combustible gases detectors alarms that\nWent on in your field turn the camera and that is when I went in the mud and coming from the dark side much yelling down my black rain the Joe phone calls and told me Trump Jewish heritage\nIs the moment you hope it never happened in your entire life aren't they were happy well trained I noticed\nThat I had an agenda on the combustible gases screens magenta is the highest important alarm the then the engine control room called me and they said what is going on I told them we have a well controlled situation in my room phone right\nOn the other and learn was the assistant driller Stephen Curtis saying we're not sure why shouldn't they should have said I'll never forget he ran a wager help Steve I'll be right there Christopher pleasant testified\nOr going back to my office just save all my big worked with computers and an assistant driller sitting next to me you say in response to tap water\nBut an normally when you're just pushing you got one in a trailer park you break the joint work ... ... ... ... with my door he says what's going on I said I don't know we got to do you juggle rolling\nNone of the guys had ever seen month through the desert for Mike Rowe him start to find Mr Williams\nYears I heard a bang her here's I'm here in through the ventilation system the engine control room pay it'll beep beep beep beep you wonder how they you know they're just as fast as they can hit the button to acknowledge the lower their beat then again I open my door and I remember a couple of people standing in the hallway but a\nTunnel vision I looked straight ahead I hear the engine engine number three starts increases the\n... ... and ...\nWith us same pomp I mean the boldest themselves exploded glass of wine ever where I'm from the ... what do I need to get out I grab for the handle at the door\nAnd made it through the door wherever drew Bush's office [noise]\nRoom and then the percussion\nTremendous explosion in her mid ...\nCared against a wall in that offer ... both me and that door ended up on the other side of the show the rig blacked\nI could hear every spring there for the call Jason and the guys in the ... Shaffir shutting it in ...\nThis is a moment of Jason yeah but it was like the PA system crackle\nTo laugh too far far far there was\nA lot to gain there was a lot going on I was just thinking of the\nGeneral alarms if there were three more gas Alonzo magenta what's called magenta every\n... every little spray cameras going off like a rocket steel with nothing down around doesn't\nUh turned against my closing off boats my hats on a second explosion occurred [noise]\nLose the other door off the hinges jumped up and I ran into the hallway I made a decision that the rig wasn't going to kill me I was going to get outside and find out what the world was going on a hollowed out do they just see patients I made my way to the bridge\nMcQuivey it was on the bridge speedier emergency disconnect system to disconnect the rigs from but we're now knew I had to get there it's best not to\nRig was about to blow over pumping muscle feeling towers falling I just don't remember the big brain\nI Try to different times of the debris was a substantial wage\nI told myself Randy you get up you're gonna lay here and are\nOpposed to disorders I could and it came free\nImmediately stuck to my head and the smoke [noise]\nGot on my hands and knees\nThen I felt something that's so much air I said to myself I Need to go that lead job\nI could feel droplets it was more storms out of my face what I felt was error was actually methane gas ... as I was crawling up put my hand down on what felt like a person and it was warm and we are [noise]\nI saw a beam of light like a flashlight balancing the life was going up and down dreamy here although I Am came out of his room\nTo give it a brooding his eyes really hard he said\nShe got blown my chance to change I mean I got Wyman down right here and I got a bond\nAs soon as I just turned out to shop for burning my eyes are on I was\nThinking of walk woman out well he made a couple of steps news just sent me down sent me down you're going to say these are no we're not going to leave you were not going to leave you would hear her divorce God's help somebody please help me all I could see was a pair of feet sticking out from under budget wreckage in debris buddy ... Charles Murray testify\nOr just come out of a shock when it exploded and\nI got a flashlight when I open the pup room door smoke blowed in my face it was dark smoky stuff just scattered everywhere when I look back into the pump room\nI knew it was time to evacuate rig or just came through that area and so why can't shame Ross do gunk cart that um was\nThey was in her room when it happened they didn't make it\nHow was running his best of luck who's ahead to get to the breeze that's where my Clinton who was on a new only ... minutes left to get this ready to go up there where I heard ... members things don't go away don't go to the pump some bad just happening there if you never did see what happened and I didn't stop to look up just kept ruining\nThe guys in that punk room and the guys in the drill jak died in ... and the methane gas and exploded men had been rated than Steve for Tony around on the bridge\nI'm sure we had no ... no ... no power whatsoever I looked out the window\nComing up from the drill for all the way up to the daring the fire was six hundred seven hundred eight hundred feet in the air is senior GPL announced over the PA to report to emergency stations in life for\nI noticed that no one had hit any of it is I issued a mate\nI recognize his voice it was Mark Williams he had a last Russian across his forehead a\nNeed to come into captain

never let them handle we had no hard drugs you know how we were a dance shit I started to merge station as we found buddy\n... hand Randy ... it looked like a tornado went through there\nWhen we saw was shared out don't about this a structured reload buddy on a stretcher it was not easy there was a lot of debris assertive to go go get a stretcher for a while I'll stay here until well no wonder you're leaving and I didn't\nCatch him standing outside the bridge looking down on the line\nIn law called the number one was driving away slot phone number two it already gone I said that\nTo the\nIt

the rich and off\nSeemed like forever [noise]\nExpected survival time in the water is forty eight hours\nYes yes it is\nI knew that because I quizzed Jason for his water survival safety certificate I quizzed him for that training tests he would practice every now and the pool with Lacey Kathleen she's our daughter\nHe knew how to change the water into freshwater he knew how to change his cover all into its location to buy I told myself that anyone can survive Jason could\nI fell asleep praying with his safety certificate in my hands\nI kept convincing myself as his safety\nI kept convincing myself I kept convincing myself Bobby here\nOn the front page newspaper that the Deepwater Horizon blew out shortly before ... pm saw those aerial shots of the rink on fire and I said oh my God we've gone and done this again is ocean\nCalled to let me know that my son Adam was how was he was not among the injured he was not among the recovered they didn't come right out and said that he was missing my mom was hoping my mom still hoping\nShows mom call you see it on TV should\n\nGuard told us a little ... work hundred and fifty two hundred miles off our coverage Russians were\nFrom one of\nStore called ... or ... learners whose father what's going on and I was told\nWord missions were still search\nBut lied to us from our bureau or kept searching for two or three days ... noodles girls were gone they knew absolutely there were gone\nThe only thing that home for me is you know that this happened before they called me you know you should know when a piece of you\nI even voted on the cover of my journal April twenty two thousand ten the start of hail it showed it was an explosion\nBut it was more like a flash but methane gas was all over the floor and all and they're all around but it was the thought that will drive you crazy if you let it\nFive years I brag that I got my son Gordon a job and I did and then of course I had to take responsibility for having ... now I I Know that's not an entirely intellectually valid ideas but emotionally it is\nI guess never will I had had an appointment with my dentist and and they call me the day of my appointment to cancel it because they had found his son died of an overdose and so when they reschedule it and I went and I wanted to talk to him to express my condolences but also because\nI've been sober a long time and there isn't the parents whose child dies of an overdose who doesn't blame themselves somehow and I just want to tell him about my years of experience and one of the things I told him as I said I Can't imagine\nHow you feel and the date that dentist appointment was April twenty two thousand ten ... ten o'clock [noise]\nWho was killed and so the next day I knew exactly how we felt\nBut I've been right I I couldn't imagine how he felt\nI called every single hospital in the state of Louisiana\nI Believe that we find him I believed chasing would be found I Believe to be fine\nAnd my daughter Lacey Kathleen came into my room and she said\nIt's not that he did\nI since we know we have to have her and she said well my dad came and told me he was dead maybe he wanted us to know\nShe was five years old\nI'd like to know who is going to enter that little girl\nHad to die because I don't have an answer for\nHer this is really not in gas or plaque means parish president\nFirst got the call I drove to ... to the first trip of Louisiana and that's the coast guard station I listen to the radio and they were pulling the men out of the water I call nine one one at all our ambulances come down to the dark for ... it'd be bringing injured people there\nFor hours I listen we got Joe Smith out the water we got Bobby Brown\nAbove the next morning they were still on a rescue boat couldn't understand why they were bringing people in for thirty hours that is a crime itself\nYou know why they did that help those men on that rescue boat until the sun nondisclosure agreements that when they decided it was time to take a man they took him four hours away to port food Sean when I asked ... go to a man why he says\nWell that's where the cars are [noise] nobody went got the keys when they jumped off that rank they put 'em on a bus had an orientation game on a drug test then they took 'em all wanna kenner when they finally got to see their fans don't want even knew who has survived\nLooking back this the first district because going allowed contributed to or worked with BP in what I call was a cover up to keep the public from noon to keep the people that seem less from day one\nWas running the show so that night that night was a sign of things to come\nReally short of a good movie [laughter]\nMan on a farm\n\nKnow BP in their permit to drill said\nThey said well you don't have to worry about the consequences of a blow out we can handle a hundred and sixty two thousand barrels of oil a day coming from one mall below the sea floor\nAnd I'm thinking well if you can it would be the first damn time in history because we never have and all the history of the industry we have never been able to handle the pollution event of this magnitude we strong just persons containment boom\nBasically paper towels to clean it up is that oil gets out of control will be extremely lucky if we can get three four percent it's what I call the trick of trying to put the genie back in the bottle [noise]\nMr hey where do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help\nYou God I Do\nTony Hayward C. E. L. or BP at the time and the blowout from his throng deposition in the criminal case against BP\nMr Hayward you hold a PHD is that correct yes\nMa'am I'm a geologist I worked for ... for eight or nine years I started out my career in the north sea\nAnd became CEO of the company in two thousand seven that's correct now now Dr Hayward when did you first learned the rig explosion on board the Deepwater Horizon\nIn the early morning hours of April the twenty first was awakened by coal what were you told I was told that there'd been an incident serious incident in the Gulf of Mexico it was the Deepwater Horizon they were in the process of abandoning ship\nAnd when did you decide to go to Houston\nI decided to go to Houston two days later as the ... I was thinking\nIn fact what happened when you arrived in Houston\nI'd been briefed on the plane coming over but when I arrived in Houston look to the video for the first time it it was\nYou had five thousand feet to rise a pipe fooled around the sea floor like a piece of spaghetti I don't know how could this happen we hadn't had a blowout to twenty five years the industry has been exploring deep water for Twenty years how on us do this but\nAt that time Dr Hayward how much oil deep he estimate was flowing from the blown out well into the Gulf of Mexico we had no actor way to estimate the flow of oil and what was the peace plan to stop the flow of oil and the ...\nThere was no protocol for this the only show away when you to stop it was to drill a relief well but when you're that it would take bumps for us to do that\nHow many months at least three months maybe longer and there was no other planned to stop the flow of oil into the Gulf of Mexico\nThere was no other plan beep he was not prepared for this but everything we did was in line with the rest of the industry no one was prepared for this BP has\nSet up a special room at their headquarters in Houston the blackout windows in screen after screen showing the gushing oil recorded by Syria's an underwater cameras highly immersive visualization environment they called it the high water\nDepths of five thousand feet you can't touch anything can't physically go down there it was enough pressure down there to crush 'em ... submarine like a can of Coca Cola anything that you have to do in deep water you do remote this was going to be the biggest engineering challenge we have ever face\nBut I called in the best minds in the industry the wild well experts from across the country and around the world a highly specialized team of people and they kept them see Flora videos under wraps for as long as they could it gets that but they didn't want the public to see [laughter]\nEarlier [laughter]\nBeep beep beep eating out and they still don't really know how well\nThey're on the oil leaking and [laughter]\nThe consequences of our actions are now in plain sight and into our way of life is threatened by menacing cloud of black crude we cannot consigned our children to this huge but time to embrace a clean energy future is now\nGetting strong opposition from the Louisiana Legislature President Obama has issued a temporary moratorium on deep water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico they work on thirty three offshore\nThe president of the families are you most men on Thursday we may beginning of this disaster Katrina\nOne thing I'll say I never thought I ever want it to go to the White House it is impressions it really is it was never anything\nWanted to do but then once I got in there I was like wow this is really something you know just being there it's real fancy it really is\nWhen we met with President Obama he explains was his decision about his moratorium on offshore drilling and I told him\nMr President don't do it please don't do it we need to keep Bruins when you're drilling for the country we don't want to keep buying all our oil from the middle east we don't wanna make them rich I don't\nI Want us to come from right here in America create more jobs and I know my son Jason would want that to I'm very sorry for your loss statements my son died and so then the American people can have their way of life\nI stand by this industry and Mr President we need you to stand with those two were you do that\nI Know this creates difficulty for the people who work on these raids but we need to\nYou we don't want to lose any more of a sudden\nWe're told him not moratorium was wrong every one of us do\nWell not all the stone in that I agreed with President not a very popular position here in the south but I Am a rare to hear Louisiana I'm a registered Democrat [noise]\nOut of the eleventh families who were there with him that day I'm pretty sure that I was only one of the room who voted for\nObama came up and he shook my hand and he said let us know there's anything that we can do\nWell I look for a second to think of something to say and when I looked up he was already onto the next one good mom says well he is the leader of the free world Darlene you should've talked faster\nThat moratorium was declared because of love and men just got killed in a rig blew up and the president look me in the eye and he told me that himself\nInto politics all that much but we have our country divided that is left and you do hear a lot of\nThings about Nancy Pelosi down here a pillow CDs politically that so darn to the picture down here in West Texas you know but if that woman was insincere she could have fooled me\nAfter Obama left she sat down with us in a room a long time and she just let us say whatever we needed to say and that was probably more meaningful than anything\nBut when Obama stopped the drilling in the Gulf I just thought here we go again in two countries\nYou know in your house you flip on your lives turn on your heat you expect it to be there you don't think about what it took to get it there so that moratorium that just doesn't make any sense to me none of us can survive without oil\nThat's our future out there that's the only middle class we got left in this country\nAfter a meeting as White House they held a press conference and all those reporters wanted to talk about what the oil spill\nMiss fantasy and would you like to comment on the oil spill and I sort of look\nAt your are on the ball before you ever get to the oil spill you need to remember the eleventh people got killed\nI don't want to hear another word about dawn dish washing liquid claiming those dogs are up and you put them back in the water the environment will survive we can get our guys back they're gone there was the explosion noticed through\nThat was not an easy day I read an article shortly after meeting with the president congressmen from Louisiana fighting over the moratorium first time I've ever seen an article written about the Deepwater Horizon when they did not mention that eleven men were killed\nThey talked about the moratorium they talked about the clean up no mention of the love men who died and I thought oh\nThis is how it's gonna be all I could think about a blood on my hands\nI can say that because I spent my life in this industry I'm an offshore a daughter and offshore sister an offshore worker\nAnd an offshore wife\nBlood is on our hands all of them [laughter] and I got so angry when I hear people complain about the price and a gallon of gas I think gas should cost ten dollars a gallon and the faces of those men should be plastered on the pump I don't\nOil companies to get any richer I just want people to make the connection there are people who live at the other end of that\nI really didn't pay too much attention to that oil spill\nDidn't even know much about it until sitting here talking to you how could I\nWhen you're an oilfield what you can handle anything you have to you have a baby in your arms and another on the way in your car breaks down on the side of the road you have to deal with it because your husband's offshore you're an offshore west that too\nJason had to tally the threat before he died I only found out after\nYou ever seen a tally book\nHe tried to get your hands on one in one of them he kept a list of all the maintenance that needed to be done on the rig\nAnd then the other he wrote a list of all the things he was asked to do on that ... that were right as Kelly books went down to read\nI told you before dates never spoke to me about any trouble on that big but he did tell his father I Know that much he told his father everything [noise] they used to have breakfast together right here sitting right here at this table\n... and our close real close we always spend one day or two weeks he was home to go to first thing you want to do with his wife and kids but before he went back off shore we spend a day at breakfast together and we go out [noise]\nI have a pass through out fast\nEnough for breakfast we check the deer feeders [noise]\nIt's

they're trying to get to do that to save some time in some money they're going to kill every one of the [noise] they're going to choose all told\nIf you that concerns you should speak\nThis is not saying I'm not doing this I'm not doing\nThat easy dad you know how it is calling on getting dark Jason [noise]\nYou can always get another job\nYou have ... I Will say that\nAnything goes wrong will just shut it is [noise]\nThey will from hell be in the rearview mirror singing a\nSurgeon said I Will but he'd never leave his guys behind a certain show well

call from Philip Morris I'd ... milking bill\nHi Milton how has your vacation fantastic jets and the whole time I couldn't stop thinking about I Love Lucy glad to hear it we've all got a lot of confidence in the show a great great that's the spirit is it tell me how sooner you wouldn't be on this is making it moved to Manhattan what I'm [laughter]\nWhere did you the idea we're moving to Manhattan well I just assume you'd want to live in the city but of course if you'd rather commute from Connecticut along I\nNo no no hold on a minute nobody said anything about doing a show in New York We're doing in here in Hollywood with Kenny for the rest of the country\nAre dumping ridiculous of course you're doing it in New York and this is what most of the audience is and they need to see it live not on some lousy Kenneth Scott\nWhat's wrong with Ken is go it's good enough for Edwin and the Allen Young show\nAnd have you seen what the ... of those shows looked like if I Want to kind of crappy picture I could just stare at the window on my wife's washing machine\nNow Milton listen I think they make all the important television shows here in New York\nListen jets I may Love Lucy but I'm also about the fond of my job and I can't buy a show that only Fifteen Percent of the country will see clearly while the other eighty five percent that to watch it with cheese cloth\n... there's been a misunderstanding I Apologize but I can tell you that Lucien does he won't leave California they're raising their family here that's one issue there absolutely clear on I'm\nSorry Janice I really liked the show but if that's the way it's going to be you'd better start looking for another spano\nHold on ... there there's got to be some way for us to work this out let me talk to the network\nUnless it's about laying transmission cable across the Rockies I don't see what good that will do if the and that's his insist on staying in California and uh I might as well drop the program right now and start looking for another property ...\nGive us a little time for he pulled the plug but you do that\n[laughter]\nGot until the end of the week but that's it\nProbably wasted too much in my time on this project will read I'll call you on friday\nOh I just don't understand it\nJust we but clearly talking about a Hollywood based show well Harry I'd say someone didn't get the message really be always serious about pulling the trigger he practically offered me a cigarette and a blindfold [noise]\nJesus Christ got any ideas and really\nThe way I figure there's only three kinds of shows there's live shows from the east coast which Lucy won't do and live shows from the west coast which bill won't buy that just leaves filmed the shows but\nThis is a situation comedy no one's ever done one of those on films that I don't see how we'd ever convince bill that would work for I Love Lucy hold on a second we've got we've got one what a film situation comedy Amos and Andy it premieres next month no kidding how does it look it looks terrific box\nIt's filmed on a sound stage with no audience and you know how important the audience is loose leaf in Harry let's just take one step at a time we can figure out the audience thing later but we need to get deal back on board right now uh come Monday you'll be looking at a big hole in your fall schedule and Lucy and dizzy and I will be looking for work\nHow quickly can you screen Amos and Andy for beer or Mexico right now cook all phone Desi and fill them in ... and Harry ... when you talk to business affairs get them to finish the Philip Morris contract already after today I'm not going to get a wink asleep and the bad thing is signed a makes two of us\nThe Amos and Andy screening CBS Rachel produced a show on film so for them or a set of stay in Hollywood but\nThere were still want snag feel what's going to an extra five thousand a week and be all wouldn't pay a penny of it that left our agents darn sharp to battle it out with CBS [noise]\nUp on our getting thankful [noise]\nWell boys and girls I say I earned my ten percent this week what he's talking about Don with a lot of doing but I got CBS to pony up most of the extra money it'll cost to do the show on Tim\nHow much eighty percent can you believe it I got him to boost the budget by four grand you just have to cut you combined salary by a thousand dollars a week to make up the different pretty sensational huh that's fine don't fine that's all you think it is fine\nNo no I think is great really great Don there's just one thing or is that you don't see and I want to own one hundred percent of the show\nYou do we do\nI've been sitting here thinking over this whole thing a weekly show means no more doors for me a little more pictures little see if we are going on here we are so make this television show we should at least on what we make\nBut she'll be taking on a hundred percent of the production cost overruns I Know and I wait a second and what that does owning the show with CBS still takes the same cut from the sponsor pays each week I ever going to make a profit and you'll be lucky if there's anything left over to pay your own salary\n[noise]\nNow LA theater which continues with I Love Lucy a\nFunny thing happened on the weight of the sitcom like Greg Oppenheimer Stein Oscar Munoz and Sarah Drew\nAre you doing all be doing just fine once you told me on the higher where you didn't have the best politician well then what ball or\nYour reputation and they were says going up a holiday\nOh sons of branches are always saying

project and we've got enough problems without ... Singh is so what is what I'm saying you got that far\nAlong condition and what would that be\nYou're a big baseball fan right only the biggest\nBorders I got to do with the prices leg I\nHere's the deal I hire you for the show [noise] boy you only get three strikes you mind telling me what you're talking about the first time you've gone through your job\nFor any reason will walk along you\nSecond time same thing work around you but the third time\nThat strike three and you're out out of what I thought my job\nJust what does this job pagan three hundred and fifty dollars a week well it's one hell of a lot less in my last picture\nBut then this is a study paycheck is not it is as long as we're on the air I mean ... ...

I shouldn't say that 'cause she's in the audience [laughter]\nAh and ah\nAnd they just bought a new house and he had no job and then ... call him and said would you write a script for us they needed him because Lucy had a radio show that it started during the summer was written by the reddish Ozzie and Harriet but they have to go back to work on Ozzie and Harriet in the fall\nTo dad wrote it wrote a a a script and he turned Lucy into the character he'd been writing for better fatty Bryce baby ... a a little girl a girl that drove her daddy crazy but being naughty and ah so Lucy Ricardo over at that time on the radio is Liz\nI'm became a little girl and a grown woman's body who drove her husband crazy and that became Lucy Ricardo\nSeeing guessing meet\n'em ... says he did a show called the on Broadway called too many girls or ... or he played in college football player from Cuba and ah and then they did the movie of it and those he wasn't a Broadway show but they brought dizzy out for the movie and she was in the movie\nAbout the music we heard tonight including the iconic I Love Lucy\n... Elliott Daniel who people heard about tonight for the composer of the Lucy\nThings the guy who comes in and doesn't want any credit right as he's under contract to follow\nYes he has ... after a year and a half its contract was up with Fox and they gave him credit is never any er any Africa anyhow the copyright and and uh and so I his interest in the show so does he live on CBS did not on the I Love Lucy theme song is actually owned by a Paul McCartney\nHow do they get owned by Paul McCartney as he bought a music library and that was that was part of it but he was nice enough to let us use it for the shortest permission to use yeah ... yeah and then\nAnd the lyricist or on the other half a because they were lyrics for it\nAnd the uh the other music I'm Doug Walter who's in the audience tonight uh where are you\nHe performed all all the U.S drones the range to everything and I asked them to arrange it and play it uh so it sounds like it's Wilbur hash conducting it as young as orchestra and so that's what you hurt and I thought it was pretty authentic sounding\nGreg this is not the first time that you and I have worked together in two thousand we produced a version of my favorite has been at the museum of television and radio in Beverly Hills\nAnd we also got a taste of my favorite has been in tonight's play and learn all about how it and it involved the radio show evolved into I Love Lucy um how did\nOriginal radio show with Lucy and Richard downing come to be it was actually Harry acronyms idea uh and and uh\nHe had written a book called the Mr Mrs who got nothing to do is have you got a ... coup that [noise]\nAnd er and he wanted to make a a comedy series out of it was it was a sort of a society show a about a bank vice president a socialite wife\nAnd a and he he's a you know ... it's talked listening to doing actually didn't have to do much talking she wanted the job so much that there's a sharp turn sharp went the Hubble Robin ... he'll do it for nothing as she wanted to she wanted to be on radio and uh\nIt it it started with somebody else playing a husband but he had other commitments and then Richard downing took over\nAnd then when my dad came on board as I said he changed the character of a no longer a socialite she was now\nA little girl in a grown woman's body who was obvious scheming\nAnd I want to actually even lose cook I wanted to be introduced us [noise]\nSo how what kind of a career up until that point did Lucille Ball half I mean how I mean when she was she was doing movies but was she doing leaves early she playing secondary roles are where we she at in her career women radio show came along\nShe did a lot of B movies and she was on the movie you know I think we need to be she was on some some major when we started with Henry Fonda\nA and I'm Catherine Hepburn and a a very successful but she she wasn't really a leading lady and she was approaching forty so it was it was getting a little late for her to to make a big splash so that's why the reason she wanted to be in radio show also thought should be able to spend more time with se\nSo this this show really was a about their marriage and and and they you know she she wanted to have a family and she she was willing to give up all that just to to be with us\nAnd how long did the radio was the radio show on the air before they decided to go into television or they turned it around\nStarted ...
