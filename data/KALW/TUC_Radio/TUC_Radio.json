more serious project when Jewish thinkers and activist in central and Eastern Europe adopted it in the late Nineteen century\nBecause they adopted the ideals the return to Palestine not because of Christian evangelical views and not because they wanted the Jews to lead to Europe actually most of the Jews wanted very much to stay in Europe\nThat the Europeans do not allow the states and Europe so the idea was born out of two impulse\nThat wish to be safe and it was not safe to be a Jew in late Nineteen century central and Eastern Europe\nAnd they wish to redefine Tuesdays and\nAs a national movement\nEveryone in Europe in the late nineties century we're redefining stuff and nationalism was the most attractive way of redefining yourself as a more than ...\nAnd the Jews had below those objective features in their face and religion that lend themselves to read the initiative to the isn't not just as a religion but also as a national identity\nSo the idea of Israel became a Jewish idea not just the Christian and Jewish activists began to work for the idea of the return of the Jews the Palestine as a project of celebration but also as a project of redemption\nThe problem was with the project of redemption not with the idea that the Jewish thinkers who saw themselves as honest believe that they would the descendants of the Jews were expelled by the Romans two thousand years before that was not the issue\nWhether they were right or not is not very important but they felt that they were the descendants of the Jews who live during looked at the Jews believe was the second sample\nAnd that that temple was destroyed by the Romans at this time of Christ and that they were expelled and though actually were looking to coming back home after two thousand years of ...\nWhat the problem with every damn ... was not the validity of the ... the problem with a redemption was that someone else was living in Palestine stance\nSo what do you do if you want to return to a safe place if you want to read you find yourself as molten nation if you want to redeem what do you think is the old ancient homeland in someone else's lives in your homeland\nWhen you know what people did here when they found someone else living your genocide the natives of America as ... as the people of New Zealand\nAre certain thoughts of Africa we call that the movement of Europeans\nFlees Europe because up pissed accused and looking for a safe New Haven outside of Europe we call that movement said look alone yeah these\nPeople want to\nReplace the indigenous population so that they can build themselves a safe haven and nation states instead of the people who live there sometimes for centuries sometimes for millennia\nSo the problem with the idea of Israel began when they wish to find for the Jews a safe haven and to allow them to redeem in ancient homeland was encountered with a reality on the ground that someone has was already living there\nAnd like so many other settlers along and movements the ideal of the new states could do not include the indigenous native population\n... scientist painters drew beautiful\nPictures of Palestine in the late Nineteen century and the early twenty century but if you look closely at these paintings and you know the landscape you can see that the villages do not appear on the heels\nThat the Arab neighborhoods do not appear in the cities that the Palestinians are absent from the pictures and from the early ... century from the focus\nAnd they also don't appear in the boys and they don't appear in the fiction and then don't appear in the early films and that's was ominous but the Palestine has been up to understand that because if someone doesn't right to vote you if someone doesn't include you in the painting\nThere is a likelihood that when they would have the power that would also take you out of the country\nAnd the main problem with the idea of Israel later on was\nThat part of the idea of aging and Jewish nation state was wish to have a democratic states because these like European Jews who really subscribed to what was good in Europe\nWhether it was liberalism socialism democracy human rights of civil rights\nAnd understood from very early on that if you want to have a Jewish democracy you need to deal with the demography\nHow can you have the first election in a newly found a Jewish state if the Jews are not the majority what will happen with the Palestinians vote for the idea of a Jewish nation homeland probably not\nAs long as the Nike surgeries on her words the ideals

years earlier this is why the Palestinians do not accept the United nation idea that Palestine should be divided between the settlers who should have more than half of the country and the natives\nNo national liberation movement at that time agreed to half of the country to a movement that they deemed as the settler movement or as a colonial this movement\nSo this was not a solution and the result was the neighboring Arab states who were pushed to act in Palestine because designing women began already in the last days of the mandate to expand the Palestinians from Palestine\nArab states didn't

America or imprison people who spoke out against war and capitalism or deport immigrant radicals without a trial or use the United States Army shoot workers Indians\nAnd to use them to break strikes\nWhen the government wanted to do that the Supreme Court inventive Lee found constitutional pegs that made such actions acceptable\nWhen the federal or state government sought to limit workday hours set minimum wage or occupational safety standards ensure the safety of consumer products guarantee the right of collective bargaining or in other ways offer protections against the powers of business\nThen the court historically ruled that ours was a limited form of government that could not tamper with property rights and the free market by depriving owner and worker of substantive due process and freedom of contract\nConcepts that elevated to Supreme status even though the limitations\nConstitution in fact those phrases themselves don't\nWhen Congress outlawed child labor the court's conservative activists majority found it to be an unconstitutional used a patient of the reserved powers of the state's under the tenth amendment\nBut when the state's themselves past social welfare legislation the courts founded in violation of the fourteenth amendment ... the justices used the tenth amendment to stop federal reform initiated under the fourteenth amendment\nAnd they use the fourteenth amendment to stop state reforms initiated under the tenth amendment\nYou can't get any more activist than that the fourteenth amendment adopted in Eighteen sixty eight\nSupposedly to establish full citizenship for blacks\nAnd freed slaves says that no state so make or enforce any law was shell abridged the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United states\nNor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor denied to any person within his jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\nOnce again the court decided that person in the fourteenth amendment included corporations and that the fourteenth amendment was intended to protect big business conglomeration\nThey also decided that it wasn't to apply to black people in the case of segregation they also decided that it didn't apply to women for some reason women were not persons\nA test case reached the Supreme Court in Eighteen Seventy five the justices unanimously decided that women were citizens but citizenship did not necessarily can for the right of suffrage when women try to get the vote under the fourteenth amendment\nSo the court had made up its mind that privileges and immunities of citizens due process and equal protection the laws apply to persons such persons as business corporations but not to women and persons of African descent\nYou are listening to we broadcast of talk on the Supreme Court by the political analyst lecture and also off twenty three books Michael ... from a twelve part series entitled democracy what went wrong\nProduced in Nineteen Ninety five\nWell into the new deal era the Supreme Court was the activists bastion of laissez faire capitalism it's struck down all sorts of reform legislation [noise]\nFrom Nineteen thirty seven on would under the pressure from the public and the White House and with the switch of one conservative justice to the side of the liberals the Supreme Court finally began to accept the constitutionality of popular new deal legislation\nWell traditionally the court has opposed restrictions on capitalist economic power it has supported restrictions on the civil liberties of persons who agitated against that power\nThe first amendment says Congress shall make no law of bridging the freedom of speech or of the press\nYet ever since the alien and sedition acts of Seventeen Ninety eight Congress and the state legislatures have passed numerous laws to penalize the expression of politically heretical ideas as subversive or the dishes\nDuring the first World War almost two thousand prosecutions were carried out mostly against anti capitalists who expressed opposition to the war including the U.S socialist leader Eugene Victor dads who was in jail at the time he was running for president United States\nThe high court's attitude toward the first amendment was best expressed by Oliver Wendell Holmes and the famous case of ... versus us in Nineteen Nineteen shank was charged with it\nObstructing recruitment actually all he did was distribute a leaflet that urged repeal of the draft and condemn the war as they wrong perpetrated by Wall Street

about evils that Congress has a right to prevent homes argued\nHomes was using the same old argument paraded by every rule or who has sought to abrogate A People's freedom\nNamely these are not normal times there was a grave danger within or just outside of our gates national security necessitates a suspension of democratic rights\nBut you see the first amendment was designed to protect the very heretical views that we might find offensive and dangerous safely also docks ideas really need constitutional protection\nThere are those who argue that revolutionaries and other radicals violate the Democratic rules of the game and should be denied their freedom\nThere are several rejoined is that could be made to this point\nFirst as a point of historical fact the threat of revolution in the United states has never been as real or harmful or dangerous drug liberties as the measures taken to supposedly protect us from revolutionary ideas\nHistory repeatedly demonstrates the expense of quality of repression and the name of national security revolutionary advocacy suppressed then inciting words then unpopular doctrines then irresponsible news reports than any kind of criticism that those in power find intolerable\nAmericans were never given their freedoms they had to organize agitate and struggle fiercely for whatever rights they've won as without bodily health so with the health about body politic we best preserve our faculties and liberties against decay by vigorously exercising them\nSecond the suppression is conducted by political elites who in protecting us from harmful thoughts are in effect making up our minds for us by depriving us the opportunity of hearing and debating ideas was revolutionary advocates\nAnd exchanges forbidden because the advocate has been silenced in which in effect silences us to\nThird it is not true that anti capitalist are dedicated to the destruction of freedom much of the ferment in United States history instigated by socialist anarchist and communist actually augmented out democratic rights\nThe working class ... of the early Nineteen century widened the areas of dissent and help to extend the franchise to property lists working people the organized demonstrations against repressive local ordinances in the early twentieth century by revolutionary minded industrial workers of the world known as the

disseminate does it does it an idea is\nThe role the communists played in struggling for social reforms peace and civil rights strength and rather than undermined democratic forces\nAnd the anti war protest against the Vietnam War challenged an immoral or illegal military action and try to broaden the spectrum of critical opinion and information regarding U.S foreign policy\nIt also inadvertently led to the franchise ... of Eighteen year olds\nForth on this question of whether we should allow freedom for revolutionaries or we should suppress these radicals\nSome future men is we should realize that freedom is in short supply in the present society\nThe construction of new socio economic alternatives would bring an increase in freedom including freedom from poverty and hunger freedom to share in the making of decisions that govern ones work in community freedom to experiment with new forms of production and ownership\nAdmittedly some freedoms enjoy today would be lost in a
