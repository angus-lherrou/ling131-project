the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd fears I usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blame the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this was who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the console or in chief or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is\nA when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy uh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using just belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I guess she doesn't have any of this is what I Am more than she does and I have no\nAnd says that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling you must be without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that\nIs that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\n... it's very hard to tell A People's views of Trump or as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so you really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of courses that maybe some lukewarm vote supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents to get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White House reporter Ayesha

of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first still do do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas ... uh barriers more razor wire fencing you're crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agents used more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter dissolves who a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so\nThese soldiers were also built camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all legal there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nIt well that that's where the officials say they\nOr their own leaders report roll again and the plus we've come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the eighties seventies and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used and former Confederate States and that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed [noise]\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would it be carrying arms or of any others are we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay the precedent for this job for sending five thousand active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border uh I don't recall\nThe president for sending active duty troops have been some sit in the past and again in a support role\nIn this case uh you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot these troops who were doing everything you'd get from constructing camps flying border patrol agents\nSo yet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks\nEven lawyers in public or the staff and uh again general are shown as he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the ... the same number of troops now in Iraq right maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside and again he said a border security is national security\n[noise] All right That's NPR's Tom Bowman getting us up to speed on the latest developments Pentagon thank you Tom\nYou're welcome in their quest to win back the house of representatives

they know who I Am I message but also getting them out to to voting types\nThe last few days of the campaign will come down to who's message voters beliefs and it might help her bellows case that

give us some context there was a rift between these two countries right that predates this incident what's going on there\n[noise] yeah absolutely some of the tension goes back to the Arab Spring of twenty ten when Turkish president then prime minister air to want assumed that like minded governments led by some of these Islamist parties\nWould come to power this fell apart for him in twenty Thirteen in Egypt when the Muslim Brotherhood elected leader Morsi who was an ally of turkey was overthrown in a coup by cc who was seen as a fellow by turkey and backed\nBy the Saudis so essentially a turkey has uh some enemies in the region now right including Saudi Arabia so uh what are they trying to gain in exerting basically pressure on the Saudi Government I think\nThere are certainly has always been a challenge in a struggle for a balance of power there in the region I think what we're seeing with air to one right now is particularly directed against Mohammed bin\nSell them on a known as as NBS and this was around prince right now\nAbsolutely of who can ... designated as the air and twenty Seventeen uh everyone I think never has really trusted him I think he thought that the west was buying into his reformist image while he was engaging and crackdowns uh he's thirty three which means he's likely to be in power for a number of decades\nAnd I think everyone always saw him as being particularly ah unfavorable to Turkish\nAir to one in his speech tomorrow is continued efforts to try and impose maximum damage on M. B. S.\nMeaning he wants them replaced a new air called\nIdeally I think you would like NBS removed or at least weekend in terms of removing his de facto powers on on the foreign policy side\nSo is this speech directed really at President Trump the U.S is that the the nation that could bring this pressure to bear\nA air to one certainly recognizes that turkey doesn't have the potential to do this on its own and so it really is going to be as you say the United states that is going to have to do this\nOr to one has been quite quiet over the last week and a half and a lot of the information that we've seen coming out has been leaked from Turkish government sources and I think it's not a Turkey's interest to have a complete rift with the Saudis\nBut I think this weekend when there was a very weak admission from the Saudis about what happened and as you noted some\nQuestions about their their claims about what happened that that effort has shifted from showing that it was a premeditated murder by a professional team who came to assemble a to providing a possibly in are the ones who remarks tomorrow more evidence of direct link of these operations to NBS himself\nWhich then it would put further pressure on Trump in terms of his response\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from indeed used by over three million businesses for hiring where employers can post jobs and use screener questions to build their shortlist of preferred candidate learn more and indeed dot com slash higher\nElaborate of meeting platform with over Eighteen million monthly users designed to connect people from anywhere in the world on any device learned more is go to meeting dot com and from listen like you who donate to this NPR station\nFrom NPR News it's all things considered I'm Audie Cornish and I know that Chang\nThe U.S military command in Afghanistan has acknowledged that an American general was wounded during a deadly insider attack last week in the southern city of Kandahar initially the command described him only as quote un American service member NPR's Tom Bowman has more details\nOn Thursday brigadier general Jeffrey smiley was in a meeting at the Kandahar governor's compound was senior American and Afghan officials just before the meeting broke up an Afghan guards suddenly turned his weapon on those present\nThe guard shot Kandahar as police chief general Abdul ... several times killing him that he sprayed the room with bullets smiley was hit twice in his looms Pentagon source is being treated at a military hospital in Afghanistan committed a grant Neely an American military spokesman in Kabul confirmed to NPR the journal smiley were shot\nBut said it would be no other details at this time adding\nWe will provide updates when appropriate news or general smiley was wounded was first reported by the Washington Post the\nAmerican commander ... did not release the generals name because of what it called privacy concerns the general was in charge of training advising the Afghan security forces in Kandahar\nThe attack also killed ... intelligence chief of dull moment in wounded governor Zalmay we saw initial reports from Afghan officials say the governor was killed\nIn American contractor and the coalition contractor were also wounded\nThe top American commander in Afghanistan General Scott Miller was unharmed who was leading the meeting when the gunfire erupted officials say the Afghan guard who opened fire was killed and it only been hard within the past two months to work for the governor\nAnd investigation is ongoing as officials provided more information on the Kandahar insider attack there were still another attack on coalition forces in the western ... one soldier was killed and three others wounded\nOfficials said they were not American but would not say which country they were from there have now been for insider attacks this year compared to one last year that killed three American Soldiers\nAnd they come as a Taliban has gained more ground in Afghanistan\nStill both Afghan and American officials were impressed with a large turnout on Saturday for parliamentary elections despite increased Taliban attacks voting in Kandahar was postponed until this weekend Tom Bowman NPR News Washington\n...

Tovia Smith reports on the new effort to keep students safe\nOne of the first things colleges are doing is teaching students to recognize an opioid overdose and what to do leave and you know\nOhio

opioids like sentinel unbeknownst to users\nHonestly I've heard a lot of kids are where it goes that's when problems can definitely happen and an overdose can definitely be reality\nI think it's good to make and arcane available but it's really tricky situation\nThis student from a different university says he spent about ten years battling addiction he asked not to be identified do avoid harming future job prospects\nDuring his college years he says he overdosed twice and kept failing classes but he says that was before schools were set up to recognize or support students with drug addictions\nDidn't want to acknowledge the problem like everything's fine at our school but I mean it was probably blatantly obvious honestly I was it was pretty bad\nNow one and a half years sober he's back in a new school and works in a campus recovery center the likes of which barely existed even a few years ago\nHis school is also just started giving free nor can to students but only if they ask for it he worries many users or their friends would be too afraid to do that but he says he also sees the downside to just leaving it out for people to take anonymously\nThe cons to that is you have no way of offering them further help the only way that we can help them as if we know who it is\nAs colleges struggle to workout best practices some say parents can't afford to just stand by in weight\nUnfortunately our colleges haven't really caught up and I think parents need to take it into their own hands\nJulian Bauer reached teaches at Temple University where two students died of overdoses last year she says when kids head off to college parents should send them with nor can as well as fentanyl testing strict\n... like they would send them on with condom junior encourage them to see first acts they can create like a fee for drug use can for them and here\nShe dismisses concerns that it may actually encourage more drug use\nLike I don't think that if you're in our student was planning on studying for their exam that having no packing strips and their drawer is gonna be calling their name to go out and buy drugs and tried\nBut others question such broad based strategies especially for schools with scarce resources even with school discounts and arcane runs about Seventy five dollars for two doses emergency kits contain to just in case at Bridgewater State University none of the kids put out last year had been taken yet\nAnd then the two years since the University of Texas at Austin launched a similar initiative several kids placed off campus have been successfully used the program director Lucas hill says all those on campus\nThe point that says that may not be cost effective and so we'll see maybe on campus is not the hot spot\nHills now considering placing kits instead at convenience stores in bars but he cautions not rock stone alone is not the answer colleges\nAlso need to beef up treatment in recovery programs preventing overdose

Christie's for helping to create the frenzy around it\nAnd given that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garnered the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so\nI think in terms of art the things that matter the most are the first and this is the first time and a I generated art work hasn't gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off and said this is the first is the absolute first time this has ever happened because this is a Kansas print\nIt is absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it in a smaller limited in numbered edition after the sale\nI don't believe that those will be valued as high as this particular one because this is the first\nAaron Murray Wallace is the c._e._o. of rare era appraisals just outside of Washington DC thank you very much thank you so much pleasure Elsa\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe warehouse retailer Cosco is going to raise live chickens it's part of a farm to table operation in this case it's a coup toured history\nCosco will compete with the small number of companies who now control most poultry production in the U.S grant girl off of any TV news has this report\nIf you're a fan of ... this is where your food comes from\nOr soon it will I'm On the south side of Fremont in the ... and this is where new chicken processing plant is going up right now it's a lot of steel beams and concrete walls\nAnd construction for [noise] is expected to be up and running this time next year and what is that capacity there'll be processing two million chickens per week fall\nAll of our barn in Nebraska and I looked collectively will supply about forty percent of ...

evidence of life in rocks that are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be\nRocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Herrera which is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from a sea floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of the total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures\nIn Greenland that was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland we're even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should follow up on that [laughter]\nHer ... and some colleagues did follow up\nAnd now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures are really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our for lack of a better word they kind of look like ... in bars they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist\nAt NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they use the proto type of an ...\nLook for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nIt pointing at at that point from the ... in the\nMain and such a lock on non\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take hold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils\nSo far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks that means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word Nell Greenfieldboyce NPR News\n[noise]\nAnd you're listening to NPR News\nI felt Sean I still feel Sean hundreds of thousands of veterans

which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency planning guy on the u._k. in case this happens talk of stockpiling of medicines there's the fresh food road could run out very quickly\nThere are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool that will be quite bad and the pursuit company will take a very big has\nSaid you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been a some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines\nOnce you've ... place where there are ... you can have she's running for miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile keys things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages certainly in more distant parts from the port so\nPretty serious ... some years of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasury has made an estimate of what would happen in the medium term if Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock it cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy in red tape out the board has not without to business costs\nWill make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because if you have less access to the European market the potential for terrorists as well\nSo the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big hit as ... as sort of an aircraft gradually losing height you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but I have a time person would be a poor placement otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe if you can't leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that you're a skeptic some person of clung to the idea that you wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because person as a major destination for European ... so that would be effect on all manner of European produces whether it's semi wine producers in France cop she says in Germany\nAnd you name it they they will be effective because you pay off the breaks it will become the biggest single export destination for all the all the European Union countries but the point is an asymmetric shock waltz it's true that some of the European countries would suffer as a result of the new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or is this sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\nI think it's more of a lesson to be honest I I mean we all question why yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides of not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere's another potential problem which is that it's the reason why the British prime minister doesn't deal in Brussels she then has to sell it to have very divided policy back in London and I think actually negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the positive and negotiating a deal with our European partners say\nAnything could happen but I think my base assumption still despite all the negative noises around as the common sense will prevail and that will be a deal at the

but\nWhat should accompany do when it makes a mistake a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith hosts the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nYou did this like really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nSo the study was partnered with Hoover we look we focus on the Ninety five percent pile of lightness all the most extreme ... mostly rides there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and its broader we've tested different kinds of apologies and we found that the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues by one to two percent\nBut the wrong kind of apology could decreased revenue I went to two percent which we tested apologies and involve sort of commitments to do better or or not what we saw is that a commitment to depend on the future it's it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology and we found that basically two or three months later these commitments to do better in the future\nActually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to depend on the future and then the ... so he didn't do better cars than maybe maybe for some of them they had another bad experience and I as a result the those people punished but more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever have a good effect I'm\nSo [laughter] I think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet still seems like we still want the same\nLevel of trust and accountability I think part of it is that our brains sort of works on script singer sticks\nAnd so you know we're entering a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripted risks triggering her brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company so what were the what were the apologies that really worked for ... like what was that magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\n[laughter] yeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we've we've which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones who sort of increase revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or was there are certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the best language but we found that there was no statistical difference between the different languages money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that actually might may have backfired a bit was a message to sort of committed to be more in the future\nDo you think this like carries over into personal relationships thing that I'm so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know here's a box of chocolates right or here's your editors and flowers oh\nEight flowers and candy to follow it takes on a whole new significance um does it hasn't changed the way like you apologize [laughter]\nWhen people thought always wanted to ask you this question how they do I'm curious I think the main way changes\nBecause all my friends and my family and know that I study apologies than they would always it's awfully skeptical whenever I apologized so I have to like go an extra mile sort of sound like Ernest insincere remorseful because people are always just like oh you're just you're not be with

want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters\nWho had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use are are around you found in the midst of all and in the United states so yeah that's awful\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis I reached out to win Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on\nWho you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the metric based upon that\nSo just to persist shot there would be an issue about whether they use\nThe questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that can be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with\nThe enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which is take a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\nLens ... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the

it's sort of a goes down as you go further north Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes on the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new

question about President Trump how do you view of the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise]\nYou know I think mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump pressure on immigration policy health care and other friends but he's a lot more measured and cautious about it the most Democrats running for Congress this year\nNear where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations I Will work\nWith the Trump Administration when I think it's good for this country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be a part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and former state senator note that well other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides he's got no choice Republicans have a Thirteen point advantage in this district the votes I Need\nTo win this election I've gotten twice before to see to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to change I'm going to be the same person or as a member of Congress and I've been as mayor\nHe's also got to convince them to dump Mia Love a two term congresswoman\nWho got immediate national attention by being the first ever black woman elected to Congress as a Republican love is conservative but running in a tight race she repeatedly frames herself as a pragmatist going into Washington I Know exactly why working when I build\n... relationship on both sides of the aisle love is aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act\nShe's also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump most notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program\nAnd was she publicly scolded him for using a slower to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration as a matter of fact the only one in this delegation that stood up to the president\nWhen he has done something wrong\nAnd it worked with him when he has done something right\nRepublicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years\nThat something McAdams keeps pointing out saying that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements don't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judge based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAt the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing of vote for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact macadam says he would not vote for ... to be speaker\nNow my opponent maybe not even saying he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this turns over and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams ... keep his independence in Washington when I see\nIs if the Democrats do take back the house is because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people from party does not come first a book solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like McAdams that many of the candidates and the swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift they aren't calling for single payer health care or\nThe the next big question is how the return a more moderate ships

S. dot ORG and the listeners who support this NPR station\n[noise]\n[noise] from NPR News this is all things considered I'm Audie\nCornish and I'm Mary Louise Kelly the search is on for the person or persons who sent at least ten suspicious packages to prominent Trump critics this week\nHere in Washington attorney general has condemned the bomber and said he is determined to ensure justice is done in New York police and elected officials are briefing the media here's police commissioner James O'Neill\nI can say with certainty that we will identify interested person or people responsible for these acts\nOK NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is here Hi Kerry hey Mary Louise so many moving parts that seems like today catches up on where the investigation stands\nThe FBI has confirmed it's investigating ten suspicious packages these are bomb like devices contained in manila envelopes and sent to a who's who of well known critics of President Trump they include former president Brock Obama former vice president Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan\nFormer secretary of State Hillary Clinton and congresswoman Maxine Waters and this morning we learned that actor and prominent Trump critic Robert De Niro had received one of the packages at an address link to him in New York another common denominator is that these all our people that President Trump himself has called out and campaign stops in speeches and tweets\nAbout the packages themselves and the fact that none of them actually exploded or hurt anybody which is great news of course but does that tell us anything about the investigation\nAuthorities are tight lipped about whether any of these devices may have exploded a or had the potential to explode and ... are at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia for review they're an FBI official says part of that review was already under way they're going to be looking for things like fingerprints or DNA for insights into how these devices were made\nAnd the FBI's assistant director William Sweeney says that powder and at least some of these aren't elopes does not appear to pose a biological threat important clue they're a former official at the ATF the bureau of alcohol\nThese devices say they don't appear to work\nThere is some hazardous material there he says but the images that he's seen seemed to lack a second power source that would produce an actual explosion and there's also a really big underlying question about the motive here if these devices were not meant to explode did the bomber just want to scare people in intimidate them\nAnd did that without happening for political or personal reasons all of that is a big focus of this investigation All right so if we don't know the motive do we have any clue as to who we are talking about who the who the suspect is at this briefing in New York investigators we're not talking about individual suspects here's what we do know\nInvestigators are focusing some resources on New York and some others in Florida\nRemember these packages had to return address in Florida specifically to the office of democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz shelters not actually linked to these packages she didn't send them but whoever did made her part of the story and there's another reason why authorities are focused on Florida at least some of these homemade pipe bombs may have been mailed from Florida\nBesides the FBI and the ATF\nPostal service investigators are involved here to trying to trace that and the postal service representative has just told us and the last eight hours or so they've seen no new packages run through the system and just briefly carry while this person or persons are still on the loose\n\nSupport for NPR comes from

diminished ration is sending them to assist with immigration and Customs Enforcement this as a caravan of about a thousand migrants tries to make its way to that border\nThat caravan and how the u._s. should respond have become a central issue in the quickly approaching midterms were going to dig into this with\nWisconsin Republican Ron Johnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you well Marilyn how are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system and then she was partly because we really reward\nImmigration we really need to have is the legal immigration system that works and where there are there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding in Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way north\nMexican officials say we are talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\n[noise] well I I'm nobody's called a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is unaccompanied children and I was failing units incentivized by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here our legal system allows them to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction or a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but a new one I toured the the northern Arab countries with Ben southern command General Kelly I hurt a new term I'd never heard before essays special interest aliens when was that were that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nI'd never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican and\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that now truthfully it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds as opposed we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty times so I I I'm definitely a very fact based individual absolute of course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this are and that's how I got\nI I Do not have any specific evidence in this chair bad but it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nEffect check up a second claim with the new President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this caravan might let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats want caravan they liked the care of it is a lot of people say I wonder what started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change\nIf you knew is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counterproductive\nI Do want to go to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from there to ask you the direct question that is on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufactured controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this a curtain Honduras or people opposed to a prison grand is down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I've heard read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of our products from homeland security most of these laws are under my major's diction we've gotta do to my community jurisdiction because that was able to move forward and and working with my colleagues adopt their agree with that I can start handling so I Try to go through this as a business person would\nBe a problem solver gather the information five years or agreement in our community where you know we all want to or that we have to have\nReasonable silence standards that are maintained that we want enforce our laws and then we don't separate families so try to go through problem solving process very transparent very open very detailed and see if we just can't fix one aspect of this and that may be successful breeds success\n[noise] senator thanks so much for your time every day it's Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin\nMany of the migrants now traveling north originated in Honduras and attorneys like that happen every year but this group is far larger than most and its fields competing narratives about how it was organized\nNPR's Carrie Kahn reports many of the migrants say they heard about it on TV and social media and jumped at the chance to flee and the safety of numbers\n\nThirty four year old ...

D. also the secret service and as you mentioned there are ten packages are found in New York Florida Delaware California, Maryland this is really sprawling\nAnd law enforcement of trying to put together all these different pieces that they've collected from these packages there either all center on their way to FBI's lab in Quantico, Virginia and they're trying to really look at the details here trying to figure out what they can figure out including looking at the powder that was found in a package that was sent to CNN the New York all of his\nUh uh the eyes William Sweeney talked about that really today let's listen to what he said\nThe powder in those particular ... did not present a biological for\nOther analysis is only ... however it is worth repeating that any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such until proven otherwise\nYou know at this point law enforcement are being very tight lipped about details of what they found out so far you know they're characterizing these devices as quote suspected explosive devices\nOr else imbedded away any questions that possibly any of these you know explosive devices could be hoaxes and said they're not getting into the intent there they're focusing an investigation or asking\nFor tips from the public are there specific threads law enforcement officials are pursuing right now\nWell one big question is were these packages sent through the postal system or some of them could they have been delivered by a cure your and also what were the materials used for these explosive devices I\nSpoke with a former ATF agents and he said that really they're looking at trying to find signatures that may be able to identify who who is the individual or individuals' behind this\nAnd also they're looking at a closed circuit TV footage to see if they have any indication of who may be involved and you really can't rule out that there may be more packages out there and so that's something that a postal workers and law enforcement or on the lookout for\nIn the meantime what more is known about the packages that were found today in Delaware and New York\nWell the baggage is in New York as we mentioned earlier was were sent to vice president former vice president Joe Biden and Newcastle county Delaware and there was one baggage that was sent to the business office of Robert De Niro here in Manhattan and what's really interesting is actually found by retired cop\nWas working for um the Sunni rose production company and he spotted it after noticing very similar resemblance to photos of packages found earlier this week and he called in a call that tip into the bomb squad New York city\nPolice orange bomb squad they came in and removed it\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and

NBC morning talk show may soon be off the air Kelly was hired away from Fox News and twenty Seventeen with much fanfare and a big paycheck\nHit her time at the network has seen some controversy including comments she made about black face just this week yesterday and emotional Kelly apologized\nShow I'm Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry now\nNPR's David Folkenflik is reporting her employment by NBC appears to be over David joins us from our studios in New York City hit or David ... so describe exactly what Kelly said that caused this latest controversy\nWell Kelly a obviously a host of the nine AM our ... she was having a chat a couple of days ago with a shovel panelists about Halloween costumes and talks about how she is not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody of a different race here's what she had to say\n[laughter] trying to get in trouble if you are a white person who was on the waiting for a black person a facade of white flight\nThat was okay as long as you were a character\nAnd that of course they're tapping into a rich vein of pain or in terms of the course of American history depiction of African Americans by ...\nHow did her fell NBC colleagues react to all this\nPretty sharply a is a notable in two ways one which was the significant coverage that was given to the story of both by a on the NBC nightly news\nUh obviously it's anchored by a Lester Holt the only African American anchor among the big three broadcast to American networks I and also on the today show and the hours proceeding her own show a tour for African American colleagues really weird and not first let's hear from our broker she noted that she'd apologized colleagues but said she needed to do more\nA bigger apology to folks and color around the country because this is a history going back to the Teamsters minstrel shows\nWasn't right and then also uh Craig Melvin perhaps the newest co hosted today show he waited as well\nThere was some criticism yesterday on line that this was political correctness run among um that's silly and juniors and it's it's it's just as ignorant and racist as the statement itself\nOr NBC News Germany Andy lack at a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refused to defend her as well\nThis isn't the first time making Kelly is his criticism while at NBC um why do people think this was the last straw\n[noise] well I think there are a couple of things going on a first off it kept in as well to our own history in terms of remarks on race or from her days as a Fox News host a much sharper edge parks and he's hosted she insisted that both Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ wore white\n... back in twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was at NBC but also her show has been ailing a it's a guide rather tempted uh a ratings are and she had her relationship it cooled with executives that she had really embraced at times me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment\nAgainst some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but uh the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much beloved figure who retain says that ties to the network\nWhat have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this a source would direct knowledge of the matter says it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a\nCool and conflicted reaction and and a welcome from a employees that NBC as she displaced a couple of popular figures in that town hall\nAnd a ... at that nine AM our and her ratings didn't do a heck of a lot for it in addition she was paid an extraordinary amount of money for a for the thing and she really took on a lot of fires a figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office\nThat's NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you you bet\nBegging Kelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation year after\nYear would um we do every year in ... which in fact we joke\nThat October is blackface I've been an advocate Halloween is Christmas at all companies and this one day of the year when all the races costuming comes out maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether blackface is bad but why so many of us have so much historical literacy about as bad as well walk us\nThrough some of the history of this when did we first started saying black face in America\nWe first start saying black face in the early Eighteen hundreds may become central to minstrel shows on which why people would dress up like by people by talking to this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course these missile shows depicted black people with levy as animal is to play on caricatures played the caricatures of course and that fits next to obviously this broad the human condition that allow slavery to happen at the time um and so these caricatures linger and the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twenty century ...\nIs the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and ... [noise]\n\n[noise]\nSo there's a whole history of you know read the paper trail the Native Americans and yellow face portrayals of Asian Americans think of Mickey Rooney character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it's those mocking\nTo be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nWell the people who are caffeine caricatured often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people and missile shows who are not wearing black with because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show ...\n[noise] to track us back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about this history ...\nWhat do you make of that [noise] [noise]\nI mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance without a defense\nNone of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly when she was talking about this and this panel is all white and I went to the port and\nShe seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who may dress up in blackface and that happens all the time of these conversations about race in history in power they always become conversations about intent and not about so this broader context we always start in a historical vacuum\nDoes intent matter since you raise it more is this something we should just degree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nI'm Glad you bring up the N. word because there was a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who it delivering something it who's receiving it so when you controversies tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party dressed in blackface usually there is not a black person and attendance and no one at that party me about an eyelash\nBut then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and men that video have to contend with\nA different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery as well maybe these conversations will be better served if we spent less time parts and go what's going on in people's souls and whether they're good people were not when they put on black face\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently prominent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team ...\nThank you so much Mary Louise season is over [laughter]\nI Hope not [noise] this is NPR News\nThere is an oil boom in ... Texas it's one of the most competitive congressional district in the country how politics are playing in the oil fields\nThat feel like it's going to dry up and you\nBut the latest on suspicious package threats that's tomorrow on MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nTomorrow morning from five to nine AM Ninety One point seven KLW San Francisco\nDoes\nHe do you is your take on music your passport that journey of the imagination to myth legend and ... and salads in June from ... I Hope you'll come along with me on camera in\nThis coming Saturday afternoon at two thirty here on KLW in San Francisco [noise]\nThis goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs helping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSo if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want\nTo leave yes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S I mean I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at their radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs in Central America violence prevention programs and Central America saying hey we have those needs here\nIn the U.S why should the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here you know each country\nIn the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day\nThat we need to be active around the world and these are places in our hemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars and other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to home\nFor places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars not billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is for the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back\nAmerica United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not just this aid the United states was uh\nThe contracts were there and we were big supporters of of those groups and then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now transnational in nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prisons and in our communities and so those linkages\nAre not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nation\nSo if you could wave a magic wand and tell the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would\nYou tell them you know I Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity\nBut I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America make those governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because it in the end it is the responsibility of the Central American governments to\nProtect their people ... of the council on Foreign Relations control much my pleasure [noise]\n\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nFrom KLW this the sights and sounds your weekly guy to the bay area art seen
