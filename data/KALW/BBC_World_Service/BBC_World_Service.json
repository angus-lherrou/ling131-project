speaking to our correspondent courage to have a ...\nAnd the last hour and a half or so vessels that the Indonesian search and rescue agency owns have reached the area where officials believe the plane had crashed into those waters off the coast of cut out long ah which is not too far away from Indonesia's capital city Jakarta where the plane originally took off from\nWhat to the section rescue agency which is responsible for these sorts of operations in Indonesia what they've been able to say is currently they believe they've found\nDebris from the aircraft as well as possessions that they believe belonged to those on board but at this point they still haven't found any survivors they both are sent helicopters to scour the seas in the nearby areas to look for any people\nAnd charisma I understand that the crew had asked to return to base shortly before the crash are the rescue officials or any officials\nWell the time of what they do say that they can confound the cause of the crash until they find the flight data recorder and obviously that's also something that they're looking for what officials have said is that they believed that the plane crashed some thirty to forty meat is into\nThe sea so they're looking for any remnants of the airplane one aviation analyst told me earlier today\nThat from the flight data that he's analyzed so no official confirmation of this analysis I I have to add but what he's been able\nTo analyze he says that the plane was traveling at a very very high speed when it made him packed with the water it's not clear what that would have done to the condition of the airplane\nBut he also added that from the flight data that he analyzed the plain look like it was in trouble from the very beginning he said that it had struggled to find some sort of level balance from the point that it took off now\nThose reports that you were talking about the pilot had asked to turn around soon enough to take off\nThat's being reported in the local media we don't have any official confirmation of that yet all officials have said though is that they will continue to look for that flight data recorder which hopefully will reveal more information about why this happened encouragement give us an idea when do we know about line air and there are safety records\nWell lion air is Indonesia's biggest budget and line it's the airline that you would typically take to travel from one part of the archipelago\nTo the other it has hundreds of flights every single day but it also has had a very patchy safety record I think it would be fair to say I was in Indonesia a few years ago covering the crash of an lion air flight\nWhich crashed in Bali luckily for everybody on board miraculously in fact there were no casualties from that particular incident but\nThe safety record of this airline has certainly been spotty to say the least over the last several years however an aviation analyst have also said to me that\nLion has taken safety most seriously over the last few years and has invested in safety procedures and that's been a statement that come in from the company itself saying that they are working in full cooperation with the Indonesian authorities to find any survivors and to find out what happened and why this plane crashed\nAnd doing Thirty years he remains like this to the point that when we had this car wash ... basically swept to wait ... great part of the political establishment he was one of the most vocal voice against the workers' party that\nWas on touched by corruption giving him an edge and this aura of someone that could represent a something new\nSo do you think the vote for him was actually a vote for Mr both an hour or was the vote against the leftist workers' party\nI think it's partially a vote for ... but above anything else they vote of rejection towards the workers' party and he was the candidate that can ... the most and in the most efficient manner does rejection towards the workers' party\nThere are also many concerns that some people have for example he expressed admiration for the dictatorship his comments against the ... que community and he made racist comments about slave descendants what is his presidency going to mean with all of these common some concerns that people have\nOkay I think that all those concerns are valid deans were appalling remarks\nProbably from an individual who never thought that he wanted to reach where he did a I Believe that the president institutions and the president political environment is strong enough to avoid and to prevent that ideas like this\nAre transformed into public policies and I'll do these remarks are are terrible\nI Believe that hardly they can represent anything practical in terms of a presidency because of the strength of their president legislative and judiciary system\nNow those who voted for him but as a vote against the workers' party justify that are saying well we want a better economy from Brazil and he's our best option for that well\nShe gained a lot of strength and support particularly with the president market when he chose polo gadgets to be his ministry of

twin boarded the possibility of economic recovery and economic growth in Brazil\nYou advise companies in Washington about Brazilian issues and I'm just wondering in your conversations what are you telling them or they encouraging signs are warning about something\nWhat I always felt that means that Brazil was the parliamentary system didn't guys that's presidential system\nOr the president parliament is probably the most powerful parliament in the empire of Latin America so the key decisions or they go through the parliament to so the key aspects to observe his relationship between the executive between both ... and his coalition be\nThe the indicators that these relationship give we gave us a da da Da Nang six months for when you go because\nUh if his relationship starts to tremble a little bit to show some lack of communication then they must be concerned about the ability of the government to deliver\nCan't go the other guy\nFor giant most ... then continues new president but also big challenges had\n[noise]\nCouple of years as being well it feels like endless bad news about plastic pollution with pictures of slugging beaches and trust the animals around the world\nNow some two hundred and fifty organizations including businesses accounting for twenty percent of plastic packaging produce politically assigned a commitment to get rid of the so called one use plastic in the next seven years of plastic the huge one time and then just go rattles\nNow one country that has a very real interest in this case the Seychelles which relies on his blue season Christine beauty the tourists donors\nBut which is struggling with growing mountains of plastic some produce at home much of it by those tourists and some which flights over the sea from other countries I spoke to ... vice presidents at the Seychelles weed out the conference with the announcement was made this morning\nLast year we have an ... two thousand tons of waste and exciting percent don't this is plastic waste so you appreciate the manager of the problem\nWe can show plastic but we do not produce any and yet we have such a large amount of glassy we also received a large amount of ... as a marine debris\nLending on a show is coming from other countries\nAnd other regions that is affecting a pristine beaches\nAnd also and they own a coat refund this is unacceptable for the health and the

debris on the beaches are just one island or south ... island um is this the social thing as well as harming the environment is pushing tourists away something so many people depend on their livelihoods\nBut they're not pushing tourists that women they have the potential pushing pushing tourists away but I must say that we have a number and you as a mirror of NGOs and I'm happy to announce that the U.S are very much part of it they are aware and conscious of the need for us to protect to\nA beach or sees a Walter from plastic so there is a constant battle by the NGOs\nOr to support or the government is doing to read a country of the plastic that we know ourselves but just about that lend up on our beaches\nSo this mission is just being a an ounce to get rid of the single use plastics a plastic container say they're trying to use once and can't be recycled how much difference do you think that will make to you when it\nWill make a um a lot of a difference because we we fight we made them run and only if we have a twenty percent on those words in ... joined up I think it's a beginning yeah I'm In\nThe beginning because there's still the deepest sense as you say who happens I mean it's a very small step towards sounds like a massive problem\nRegion and it begins with a very small steps we have done exactly that and we have a twin ... like minded but those who haven't joined us and I think the effects are far reaching beyond the twin\nDeepest and to have a who have joined in and I think there is a lot\nFor us to get from those we are sure that others will join in because we all appreciate\nThat plastic affecting the health of our planet we'll appreciate the fact that he does not only profit that showed ship humankind but also how we protect the health of our planet which is the only one that we have\nAs mentioned maritime vice president of the Seychelles trying to give a global perspective but if you look\nSteak waste is doing to his country say show\nIt's almost good night for me and James ... on the news they done Damon is here to tell us what's coming up on world up they're coming up shortly on the world\nSaying well we're going to follow

J. bear with me here judges studied economics at the University of Chicago in the U.S in the Nineteen seventies\nAnd other times Chicago's economics department was well known as a sense of for free markets theory led by the influential American economist Milton Friedman\nAnd it was in the Nineteen seventies that a group of Chilean economists later dubbed the Chicago Boys because they do say studied under Friedman\nSets about making rather cool free market reforms to chilies economy under the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet with dramatic consequences or find out more about what happened from total of ... as\nA journalist and film producer in Santiago in Chile\nShe recently made a documentary called Chicago Boys\nThese guys were very young when they went to the U.S and the fifties they learn something that they never knew before these his open market and free market economy\nWhen they came back in the sixties they try to implement these ideas that they learn from Milton Friedman but nobody heard them they were too extreme uh extreme in the meaning that they're free market we're going to ruin everything and that people would will suffer a lot\nSo they could go ahead with their abs of steel adequate at al even by the military and Pina ... came [noise]\nIt wasn't a fortunately for them to apply all they\nKnow that they get in their states under mixed on fragments a guidance in ...\nSo that the who and the takeover by a ... that gave them the opportunity to enact some of the theories that they learned about free markets economics in America\nRight because they didn't have any support among the tradition up all the ...\nSo they knew that they they made Terry we're going to be strong enough to go ahead with their extreme economy policies so they saw this as a window to get into power and to apply these extreme IDS being supported by the military guns\n... what were these extreme economical ideas what kinds of things where they do\nFirst of all days they thought that the state was mostly on usable that the power of the economy should be in their private hands there is one phrase that they said when things belong to everyone\nThey don't belong to any one day we a distrust the state so they wanted to have that small state as possible so what are they successful they were very successful um they came to power with Pina tip more or less the same day\nTwo years later they were in control of most of their government and their civilian side of that the military dictatorship\nSo they control the economy ministry the finance minister either social ministry and they weren't able to implement all their idea backed by the guns from the military at some point\nThey're poor ... race to an unbelievable amount by the eighties we we had more than forty\nA job so people were really suffering we had people living in poverty we doubt houses without shoes on these was because all the national industry went to bankruptcy\nSo it was a very very extreme way off implement their their idea bought by this the force by by their guns or the military if anyone wanted to complain the military's came within arm's on they stop any kind of protest on the street\nThat was the I guess the short term impact of these radical free market reforms\nSome people hold up chili is an example of free markets success though in the longer term the economy was very prosperous and more prosperous than other economies in Latin America\nYes this is very interesting because it's too\nWe became the richest country in Latin America but since two thousand ten

plenty on the agenda this year last week the European Union announced that single use plastic such as plates and cutlery was to be banned\nThe member of European Parliament behind this Frederick Greece I spoke to weld updates on that day\nPlastic was a great invention a but since the fifties I Would say\nUh the production has been exponential I don't actually see that in English and now are the oceans are beaches are are dying from the past take 'em at the species are dying I'm at the fish are dying and at the end of the day we are eating plastic things plastic everywhere\nSo we had to act Europe how to act\nAll of that important as people meet in Bali to discuss the oceans the MacArthur Foundation is one of the organizations taking pot and we're joined by its pounded the former soda young woman ... because the un and thanks for being with us on well long days\nYou know the oceans very well in plastic has become an issue only really in the recent yeah were you aware of this before\nIn my interest in action packed it doesn't come for failing at direct Kathy from what I saw in the same but it comes from the fact that when you want to buy\nAnd you're sending around the world what you have on the back seat or you have you have to really finite result is a night very quickly transferred towns like that like like calling me when I finished my second round the world and ... like that in effect was different\nAnd my interest in plastics come from my interest in habits\nThe packaging is incredibly high volume thirty like value at the material and a huge amount of it leaks out in the ... a very different root\nCauses industrial foundation going to work with the stomach and in the future to try and reduce that\nWell the goal of the foundation is to accelerate the transition to a second or economy which is an economic model which ... when I current is very lenient tighten might disposed we've taken a terrorist act the ground could make something after that\nAnd then the majority gets thrown away and plastic packaging is a great example\nWithin a secular economy you turn a straight line and you turn it into a circle that you design economy so that waste is\nEffectively designed out you keep products materials and use for as long as possible and you also have the potential to be generating natural systems what we're doing around plastic packaging never those three areas it's about being regenerative restarted it's about eliminating the packaging we don't need it to the innovating around the packaging that we do\nSo that is one hundred percent recyclable combustible or we usable\nAnd then the fed area is to circulate that material once it's been designed to fit within the system and we have over two hundred and fifty cigna trees that we've collected\nFor global commitment which we don't here today in Bali around shifting towards that model by twenty twenty five\n[noise] intentions are great it's the enforcement that's going to be the thing isn't it that's not going to be easy\nI intentions All right but I think intentions are important in the right direction and I think one thing that's been missing from the ... everybody innovation ... innovating sorry and the right direction what we've done is we've we've put together a specific\nSet of targets together with the organizations the government to the cities the regions and also some of the biggest companies in the world we have we reckon twenty percent of the\nPlastic packaging will buy vote him signed up to the commitment already\nSo these are ... that everyone has agreed on we don't have all the answers to how to get that yet but we do have these ... and ... and every Eighteen months will be refreshing them so this is about becoming one hundred percent responsible compulsive will reusable by twenty twenty five\n[noise] um ... the only issue which is living with the finite resources of the snowed expecting to have stories of Christmas\nWell over the last decade one very very visible example to all of us because we'll ... we'll use it to something everybody understands but within a secular calling me everything that face to the economy\nNeeds to be cycle so that are the design of little plastic to be recyclable it could be anything biological it could be those road race it could be floating in the form of costs and it could be in the design says it fits within that biological cycle and regenerate natural capital what\nWe've done at the moment since we separated that the ability to be um to be a dilemma here economy we have\nToday from

recently I was surprised people were banned from having long beards and undermining Islamic traditional dress but that's all changed\nAs well it really does because the about the motivations for those that banning it was still communist and the the religion was seen as a threat\nUh ... what do you now have is of an an allowance and increase the freedom of religion but with this threat being imported into those countries from abroad to the extremist threat so how do they allow\nFreedom of religion without a lie loose and freedom of extremism that's the challenge they face an end to be

suspect accused of sending fourteen devices to predominantly vocal critics of Donald Trump has not being arrested registered Republican an audience Trump supporter fifty six year old says a sale ... now faces five charges including mailing explosives and threatening ex presidents\nAnd that I think is the part that is being threatened by the rise of a populist politician like Donald Trump\nI'll hang on democracy is only a good thing when people voted in a way that you'd approve of\nYou know I think it's a good thing pointed is constrained by checks and balances and buy a rule of law\nYou know people can make lots of choices but their choices to not a include for example the depriving of minorities or you know unlike individuals' of their uh equal rights than a liberal society so that's really I think the issue in front of us what\nLinked D.C between demanding dignity an identity politics\nWell I think that the basis of modern identity politics is this feeling that we all have\nThat we have this inner source of dignity that's not being adequately recognized and that's why we go into politics because we want political recognition that a dignity we want the society to acknowledge that\nWe are the group that we belong to the religion of the nation the gender ethnicity than race that people with those characteristics be recognized as equal and I think that propelled a lot of\nPolitics in the world over the last couple of hundred years you recently got a voice mail from a supporter of Donald Trump didn't you know so did she was very angry at what I had written because I said the American constitution does not define who we the people are\nUh she said yes it does it says that it's the people that fought in the American revolution and their descendants and people that came later a including you are really trying to take that constitution in that country away from us\nI suspect that she doesn't literally mean the descendants of people that fought in the American revolution I suspect that something like you know we white Europeans are the real owners of this country and people that aren't that way are somehow you're not part of that National Community\nAnd by the way she told me I should go back to Japan which I you know I was born in Chicago so it's not it's as if this is really an option for me\nThat will be people all over the world and not just support is a populist leaders like victim oil dining Hungary who you mentioned in your book\nI'm like the alternatives that Germany movement that you also mentioned that will be loads of people who who listen to you and think\nWhat a ... view you know what a liberal Californian view your day mate has passed you know the days when liberal elites democracies rude and go to all the money you know it's over\nOf the biggest issues is the fact that we actually live in de facto multi cultural societies and if one of those groups you know says that basically where the gonna we're gonna be the dominant ones you're just setting up a situation of of perpetual conflict\nSo I think that there's actually a good reason to have a liberal order meaning liberal in the sense of\nBeing open to people or you know that are different nationalities cultures of religions and integrating them into a common framework by which they can make democratic decisions collectively\nA and that's really what's at stake and what's being threatened I think by these people that are you say her you know not California that that are rooted in one particular place or one particular ethnic group\nIf a clear majority of people in the approaching midterm elections in November in in New us\nVote for Donald Trump or rather vote for the Republicans surely that democracy is black and Latino people in large numbers cast a vote for the Republicans if gay people vote for the Republicans that is democracy in action isn't it\nIt uh is Chrissy an action or and I go I think that what it's going to threaten is not democracy per se is going to threaten liberal democracy\nOr because I think that Donald Trump has been trying to avoid accountability by basically attacking any institution that gets in his way and at the moment that's Robert Mueller and his investigation over the connection to Russia it's the FBI it's um\nThe Justice Department and I think that if he gets a perceived mandate as a result of the way that people vote he's going to you know go after all of those in a way that he's a little bit frightened to right now and I think that's not good for American institutions because the institutions really\nAre built around the separation of judicial power and the independence of courts independence of prosecutors\nFrancis Fukuyama and the title of his book is identity they demand for dignity and the politics of resentment what's your take on identity politics suit black yes\nIt's really interesting isn't it because it's the talk about democracy and I think it's in some ways a merchandise democracy it's about saying we're not comfortable with the extremes but what we've got some middle ground that doesn't feel as if we've got to anything stable to stand on\nSo I I think that balance between wanting to be able to have the freedom but also wanting to be able to ensure that we've got a quality I are always going to be tensions that that work together and work against each other in the same in the same set a sentence\nSo identity politics ... it's really saw shifting sons in terms of where we place ourselves within that spectrum and everything that has a spectrum becomes really interesting when you look at either end of this extreme\nAnd people gravitate towards the middle where we find unhappiness with it and that far won't say effectively have the freedom to go back to the extremes which then become uncomfortable and we moved to the middle so that much in isolation and that constant brand new in motion effectively in politics is really interesting\nDo you have political beliefs F cell based on your identity\nI'm not sure I Do a show with my identity is it's a multifaceted and so my political beliefs but I think this issue here is is really I'm very profound and I think a ... a stunted to debate which I Hope will be grab like people\nThat I'm the end of history that doesn't western liberal democracy is the way forward we are not going to do any ... ... ... it's not going to go way without even though he's so new indeed and a history history tells us anything everything has a sell by date\nAnd if it is if we do think it's the best system that we need to understand it in ... and change it to the manager who fashion\nThe tension that's who spoke about essentially the tension between the value system of liberalism and the democracy bed which says a ordinary people decide what they want to know the value system or his policy in the system\nFrom which the ordinary people are often divorced ordinary people the people that suffer economic deprivation most is that a few disenfranchised from the legal system and the power base and it is these these people that a hundred by extremists politicians who are anti democratic it's in the longer term\nSo we do have a a big issue here which does need to be addressed and thought about but much more widely than academics it needs to be understood by societies if they are to preserve and cross but in a democratic system otherwise it's very French\nOne problem assume we're wrapping up in the program here I'm afraid is that a liberal democracy in the ... which is\nFine as lots of people up you know there isn't the passion surrounding dinner and sort of liberal democracy is up ... am and I think that's part of the problem the fire comes in the extremes and the damn pens as they go

biggest single strategic challenge of the United states doesn't want to feel this in any way constrain perhaps actually from beginning an arms race with China which is then ended or at least reduced in scale under threat\nBy separate arms negotiations with the Chinese but the United states wants to be strong position\nTo confront China and it feels that way the limited treaty the IMF treaty dealing overly bilaterally with Russia than it is constrained\nWe think less say as a result of this is Russia claims all all bear any advantages to what America is doing\nWell and it's very simplistic does look to me that we might be less safe after all ... treaty does feel like\nIt doesn't it scrapping at least one speed limits on that particularly dangerous section of road something

Fifteen\nConflict escalated when a coalition led by Saudi Arabia intervened to help the president of rebel who's the movement seized control of much of the west of the country and for the president to flee abroad well over six thousand civilians have been killed and will ten thousand injured in the wool\nA correspondent older Karen has just returned from me and I asked her if anyone was putting pressure on Saudi Arabia to stop its bombing campaign\nIt doesn't appear to be the case I mean this has been a disastrous war for Saudi Arabia since it began when the Saudis originally announced their bombing campaign that was back in March of twenty Fifteen\nThey announced it was going to be a short sharp campaign to restore the internationally recognized government of president ...\nWell that's turned out to be anything but true by one estimate there have been airstrikes carried out by the Saudi led coalition in Yemen every Ninety minutes since then on the impact has been absolutely devastating in terms of the loss of civilian life in terms of the damage to infrastructure\nBut also I Would say in terms of the grave damage to Saudi Arabia's international reputation\nOn the longer the conflict has gone on to more instances have been identified by the un of civilian targets being has in coalition airstrikes hospitals weddings funerals schools\nWe went to the scene of one of the most tragic counted the notorious recent airstrikes in a place called die young and the province of ... in the north which is a who's the stronghold\nAnd that was where forty two school boys were killed on a bus we met some of the survivors we met their parents we went to the school and we saw the empty desks we saw the new grave yard full of children's bodies the empty graves that are waiting for the remains of children that still have not been identified two months on\nOn there are many who are asking if this another Saudi airstrikes actually among to a war crime so it's a deeply damaging inexpensive conflict for Saudi Arabia on his no indication that they have any exit strategy\nOr all fourteen million people in Yemen facing found them in twenty Eighteen what did you see there\nHad an opportunity over a period of about two weeks to see the scale of the men suffering in Yemen this was my fifth trip but\nI haven't been in Sana'a the capital in two years I did was really shocking to see how much things have deteriorated there has been a massive cholera epidemic the largest recorded in the world and not nutrition rights have soared there are four hundred thousand children in Yemen\nOur trip we met the un humanitarian coordinator for Yemen leaves grand day and she was very very long on stock in her warning that up to fourteen million people could be suffering famine within a few months if there is no political solution on and I certainly isn't one on the horizon\nWill solve the aid agencies able to do at the moment to look through they think needs to happen now\nI mean one thing you hear from the aid agencies on from Yemeni doctors and indeed Yemeni civilians the messages is really the same from everyone at the end the conflict what we need is the end the conflict\nAnd the great fear is around the red sea portion of a data that's in the hands of the who the rebels there has been an offensive since about June ...\nBy the Saudi led coalition on on the various forces that support the government of Yemen the un and the ... these are desperately concerned that any attempt that results and fighting and deport would be catastrophic\nBecause her data really is the lifeline about eighty percent of Yemen's age food supplies fuel medicine this coming in through the data\nThe UN is managing to operate their other organizations like save the children and so on they need permission from the two sides it's not always easy to get their operations are controlled and limited but undoubtedly it is the operation of of the aid agencies that have been keeping so many Yemeni is alive during the years of this conflict\nThe U.S is warming so rapidly that most experts agree that measures need to be taken suck carbon dioxide after the atmosphere to avoid the worst consequences of climate change\nBurning fossil fuels for energy clearing forest some demotion let plans all contribute to the problem [noise] CO two stops heat from leaving the planet one reason why the average temperature is higher than it used to be\nScientists in the U.S now say that some technology able to camp to count them is ready to be deployed on a large scale right now\nSo is this a solution to climate change I all star environment correspondent not McGraw the\nProblem with these techniques that they talked about here is that nobody's retry them yet because there's no real financial incentive to do them but on the basis of the calculations of the scientists of and others have done they are talking about the fact that by the middle of the century we need to be removing about twenty billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year\nAnd some of these techniques would get us about halfway there if they worked really well and everybody did as they were told everybody did have some joined up thinking\nThey are optimistic about some of the newer technologies that are coming on there you know we're talking about planting trees and changing farming practices brothers would be boring things more psi phi end of things where you got these machines that looked like washing machines with fans in the midst of carbon out of the year\nThey can do that right now the cost about six hundred dollars a ton of carbon that they are removed but the report's authors are actually saying well we don't know about them right now but we think about ten years time they can get down to about a hundred dollars a time if they do that\nA very successful and we could beat this problem the big problem with that is this what they philosophically called the moral hazard\nIf you have machines that can remove ... why bother reducing your use of fossil fuels and that's one of the big dangers the politicians and campaigners environmental is really worried about because people think there's gonna be a solution ten years down the truck they'll keep flying they'll keep using make to keep driving cars do all the things that are contributing to the problem right now\nTo the extent is carbon capture happening all ready and how can you make it more appealing\nOther lots of different things going on to the moments every country in the world is planting trees pretty much people are trying to change the way that they do for a station that the ... lengthen the time ... tons of trees grow or they changed you know when they have a massive kilometer you fire or something that we can't very quickly the bigger more technical industry\nOr fired stations they're all they're in theory but very few and practices and it's really a handful around the world and the big problem with that course all these big bits of kiss cost lots of money and nobody really wants to put their hand in the caucus to pay for all these things\nSo what's interesting about this report has come out and saying that actually you know there's lots of other things we can do blue carbon as it's called for one thing which is effectively mangrove swamps and marshlands near the sea if you can protect those their main using source of our sing for common they soak up more carbon than anything else\nAnd you can do it for about twenty dollars a ton of carbon and that is really really cheap\nTo bigger problem costs a lot of times we don't have enough of them you know the fight the number of coastal areas in the world is fine nice\nPeople want to build new coastal areas and you've got this thing called sea level rise happening as well which might wipe out some of the gains were making so\nThe big tech not really happening a lot of smaller take is happening and it's cheap and I'll just report things we do more but how\nDo you incentivize countries such as China countries such as India which have been industrialized in very very quickly and actually getting rid of some of the landscape ... was doing carbon capture\nYeah both China and India are taking a lot of these steps in terms of planting trees and doing other things that also obviously building lots of coal fired plants as well [noise]\nHow this works out no one really knows to be honest with you the hope and belief amongst richer countries is that if they develop better technology to capture carbon and sequester it then there'll be able to either share that technology with India and China nothing really happened so far and there are a number of intellectual property questions about all that\nThe big challenges but China and India they remain on salt at this point\nThat's it from the well this week for now don't forget to join us at the same time next week for ... months happened and the next

potential damage\nLater in the program we'll have the latest on the details of the ... case and All right James ... is in Wisconsin two weeks out from the mid ... he's been meeting a farmer affected by it but not against President Trump's trade policy\nWhere they can random but right now but\nIt needs to be done we need to be on a level playing\nField and uh I think in the long haul for all of them be better off\nFor more than that to come later but let's begin in Italy and the potential showdown with the European Commission\nToday's Italy at today its ally published it proposed national budget just fairly routine occurrence but as the third biggest economy in the euro zone which is already in considerable debt it's important\nTo take an ally as the populist coalition government wants to boost public spending which could punt ... into yet more debt\nYou rise and moves mean Brussels could reject the budget and demand visions the European Commission is due to respond on Tuesday or less at a time that economists warning that an economic crisis in Italy could seriously damaged economic health of the whole of Europe and perhaps beyond\nSpeaking to the press today the Italian prime minister set they come to say that it's any needed to raise the debt to sit in order to stimulate the economy but he said there was no chance it's and he would leave the EU or the European single currency the euro right\nWhen I leave [noise]\nForty there is no shame no way to get to tell a ... there's no way to get out the viewer all of those\n[noise] but in a moment we'll get the view of a member of the governing coalition says why should the state's ... economy worry the rest of the world yeah cup cook a God is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics think tank in Washington DC\nYou have a country in its ally which has a very large existing debt and doesn't because of structural features like an aging population et cetera have prospects for growing very fast in the future\nA country like that or if it's suddenly stopped running significantly larger deficits than had previously been agreed\nIt is a warning signal and that is why the European authorities right now are taking a very close look indeed at these new Italian budget proposals because they are actually\nMaking it clear that this government wants to run a deficit that's about one and a half a percentage point larger than the previous government\nSo let's put some pressure on the buttons of this and what makes it ... the economy in particular so vulnerable to that because some saying this could be the next flash points for the next global economic crisis\nSome of these are the signs it's a little bit like what we saw a earlier in the euro crisis if you get to the point where investors are no longer willing to buy any Italian debt that they basically\nBelieved that the Italian government finances are unsustainable well then you have a full blown crisis in the euro area once again because at that point in time either the euro area or more likely the European Central bank would have to intervene\n\n[noise] this is Rebecca it can be with news out lights from the BBC\nAnd migrants convoy of thousands of people including children mainly from Honduras continues to travel up through Central America heading towards the Mexican border\nToday in a two week President Trump threatened to cut aid to countries that failed to stop the migrants reach in the U.S southern boy that he also claimed that criminals and unknown Middle East in is these are his words all mixed

a mother to the gate for what the mullahs in Mexico shut up they were stuck on the bridge between the two countries that anyone who thought that it would be the end of the story was wrong\nSome did decide to turn back what most climate to run for free to white enterprise in Guatemala\n\nTo cross the river the forms of water from Ohio who got hurt the older\nWe're looking for a look in the usa because in our country we have enough dismantled those as the people's all the rest of the river bank [noise]\n\nWe don't all Trump's been demanding that Mexico stops them like we worked with the miles inside Mexico totally unhealthy\nWas one of the migrants says you can smoke started looking many days ago one stop here [noise]\nWe all know hundreds of miles from home after having left the door if he stays or goes they marched all day again today on tonight they rest in a square and the chocolate\n\nMexicans came out to give the migrants food and water and had to clear the journey is starting to take its toll on many like kind of in the late forties I'm traveling alone\nBut if you don't want to know that sometimes it's\nDifficult when you come without family members or friends I'm so tired my feeder blistered and in pain my whole body hurt and when I sit to arrest have to tell myself to keep going full yeah\nSo what is it that keeps people going many tell as the main driving force just to get food in their mouth\nAnd saying where you're going through when Trump says with criminals but that's the truth is twenty five year old I was like I'm going to want to work for the future of our families who wants to leave the crime in Honduras were risking pool to do that\nIt's a big sacrifice but we really have no choice and he also on the air [noise]\nWhat is striking look around the migrants sort of go to the square who are now\nSuddenly all come from the Knight laying out\nBlanket out cardboard boxes or just finding\nA place to rest and the square is just how many children have made this fall sick adventurous journey across the river the borders Marla Mexico\n\nRemains journalists and her young daughter to our children have suffered so much on this trip so God

correspondence and Lima bull which that Margaret ... in Mexican\nSo let's pick up on that point to President Trump's threat to cut aid to Central American countries that failed to stop the my income going his administration has already veggies funding to those countries now to put us is with the into America dial group which is a think tank and she explained the current situation\nTwenty Seventeen to twenty eight team that's funding has already been caught\nSubstantially for example in this specific case of a door as is it dropped from Ninety five to sixty seven million the other thing is that this funding is usually focused on attacking them what do we know are the root causes of this big migration pushes a basically violence and lack of economic opportunities\nOf the support or this cooperation from the U. S. I usually those Stuart security initiative on the other half towards various economic development and social development project so it is kind of counterintuitive to try to caught you know\nSo you know saying that if those governments receive age in the United states there's no reason for people to prosper and their own country\nThat is actually what has been happening the cooperation from the United states to this country have more and more fuckers precisely in this type of initiative that try to strengthen the countries\nAre it's not like now it's got to happen like and and some of this project's actually show advancement in this topics specifically so yes these are the things that we know that have worked and that starts as I mean this is a long process\nBut that are starting to work and caught in it or does not help but\nSaid President Trump's supporters would say that that aid has been wasted because it hasn't gotten rid of the problem corruption still rice across ... countries\nThe power of the criminal gangs is gripping city centers and towns around the whole region and this age issue as both of them as pets and the more you give them all the countries need where does it end\nFirst of all I think that the problem is that if you pretend to try to solve a problem\nThat is very long time and a very short term it's very complicated we're talking about countries that\nThere is that well we're at war the democracies are starting even if you and I'm not saying that I agree with it but there's a lot of people that actually could responsibility of the current situation on us and us intervention or do end as wars and afterwards\nI Do believe that this project how old do this is a slow process but this is the one process that works if you say well we're we're not close the border are we going to stop ate\nWhat is that going to do is that going to help you know what's going to have less that case the U.S\nHow able all the old ... in these various countries to stop this caravan of migrants posing through that countries\nThe problem is what's going to be the solution of what you can do about it if you're gonna you know accept than as refugees and try to establish camp center that I have support in order to those is because without support it is very limited what the government can do and\nWhat shape that takes is definitely going to be very political and that is the other thing right the rhetoric and the elections being so close also make this a little bit more complicated this is not a problem of today\nThis carbon is not the first carbon but definitely put in pension and more pressure because of its disability\nWhat other options on that are available to the United states to try to stop so many illegal migrants coming through\nI think a lot has to do with the conditions in the countries and promoting migration that is documented and that is legal the other thing is that we do see lower numbers of immigration there are more immigrants crossing and everything but it's in much lower numbers that it was\nFive years ago and it specifically for Mexico you see that a lot definitely what needs to be done is support this concrete on the other thing that needs to be done is promoting migration that it's orderly\nThat document that that is that it that is checked because of the other part of the migration he's the man and a real factor is that the U.S unemployment is under what it has been in decades and there is any mind for this labor\nAnd that was a ... with the into American dialogue group in Washington DC

liability\nIn Wisconsin we have our largest majority in the legislature since Nineteen fifty seven we have the highest number of legislature is controlled by the Republican Party for Nineteen twenties so we are really at the high water mark and an awful lot of ways so of course when you have a president who is controversial\nWho is opinionated and people are opinionated about him\nIs going to probably result in some give back all our high watermark it's really because of the person in many ways that people identify with the Republican Party\nI'm fascinated by your arms I thought I was

are maybe more on the fence it doesn't go on\nAnd so a lot of Republicans feel that way\nThey're looking at the president and once he does\nAnd that will affect the voting for governor for Senate races\nIt has a big impact and there's a lot of independents I think that's going to have a big effect on the election\nAnd and as your sense than the various people\nCaught a lot of them will vote

he's probably expecting you to fold a let's talk about the issue in white is such a big stumbling block ... bomb out as a senior research fellow\nOf the nonpartisan research group UK changing Europe she is professor of a new law so very well qualified at Cambridge University here's a guide to why the Irish border issue is such a sticking point\nThere is a binary choice and that says you have a hard border in Northern Ireland but that means that the u._k. is out to the customs union and can negotiate the free trade deals full we have no ... in ... between the no fly zones in the south\nUm but that means they stay in some form of customs arrangement which means no trade deals because the facts all that this is a binary choice said the real question is the new facts that it's actually a shift in political position\nAnd that's the problem and the moment to reason they has that she knew Rico room on any shift in position and that ... they used to\nAnd if there is no deal done by the time to not that much we will leave with no deal which most commentators believe will be pretty catastrophic for the u._k. come to me a note grades either for the you twenty seven particularly around [noise]\nCan I ask a legal opinion of water border becomes on the twenty ninth ... because of the moment we say the snowboarder\nWell actually the ... because you've got different currency on one side of the boat or the other you go to different tax systems there's different social services systems there is a kind of a border when people say no border they made the wrong check points there on the horrible business though I grew up with in the Nineteen eighties seeing the militarization of the border um\nIt is that legal concept of border which might help on the side tried to ... pounds of this this kind of double bind that you've described\nIs really tricky the the real problem lots what's going on here is um the physical infrastructure on the boat and that's the issue because the moment you have any form of physical infrastructure\nAnd by that means cameras all security post anything of that so the real concern as it becomes a target of terrorist interest\nWell you have to ... to pay any money to play the game went down to the game I think that's one of the reasons it's been so successful you know it's really accessible to lots of people if you want you can buy a thing called a season policy which is about maybe ten dollars and that gives you access to so kudos weapons and guns and outfits and that sort of thing\nAnd but yeah it's not really a a money generating game in the sense you have to pay a subscription or anything like that but obviously you know some people have super into the game and willing to buy that season policy and that's how the company generates money\nAnd now if someone is in trouble tell us about the videos posted online there and why the company at the games is suing that player Brandon Lucas\n[noise] so you find them Lucas is accused of making these hacks to the game and selling them\nAnd these are ... to cheat basically so he's made these include ... does is it makes it much easier to kid enemies 'cause you don't have to aim it than it does it for you automatically\nSo he's been sending these modes to the game online\nAnd for upwards of two hundred pounds in some cases wow and yet and people are buying those people are buying them yet because again it's a hugely popular game and and some people have got the money to access these kinds of things but overseas annoying for people who haven't got that kind of money because they want to play the game fair and square and these other people cheating\nAnd of course the the the issue that at the games I guess are having with it is essentially we're talking about hacking into the software Fortnite\nThat's right that base accusing the paper of copyright infringement that saying you know you've taken a product you modified it against the wishes without permission or that you have ... essentially for the other players and on and it belongs to us you have no right to do that\nCan he be the only one there surely at the games should be targeting everyone who does\nWell this is in fact because his argument is that he's being singled out he believes that some fat he says they're not some notes of other people doing this you know why they picked on him\nAnd you know I think epic haven't been care about the only thing they would probably argue that they're trying to make an example of someone you know they they have to stop somewhere and perhaps that trying to demonstrate with this case that if if you do this this is what the consequences will be\nAnd it's this tell us about the significance of this case is this the first in in in the industry\nI Know if it's not even a fuss for Fortnite ready to vote yeah they they had some people the rest of it I think in um [noise] uh this is a different game actually paranoid and bustle grounds and that it has to be arrested in China for hacking the game um yeah and an historic day it's been going on for years there's always been cheating in games\nAnd like many things he gets in their video games journalist joining us life\nWith retreating and all sorts of games um thank you I understand a bit mono a twenty two minutes possibly a about Canada has just become a the second country to fully legalized recreational marijuana full consumption on site you regard was pushed the person\nNewfoundland and the eastern most parts of the country to be moving across to great celebrations Chris O'Neal yeah each of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was that in the provincial capital St John as midnight struck so who was sending the first batch\nIt's a company called a calls canopy growth states actually whiter a large multinational company and ah they set up shop in St john's so they will be selling it you know over the counter here um there are\nAbout three locations here in in St john's area that you can walk in off the street by the candidate\nBut for for now for the most part\nYou'll be ordering it on line it's controlled by the same corporation of government that controls the sale of liquor and ah they brought in all the rules and regulations companies have to fly in order to be able to sell it legally there\nTwenty two locations off in a in the country right now that in ... in the front of it right now they can sell it\nAnd they will pay an excise tax the government so while it is regulated by government\nLargely a lot of private companies\nHave their eye on this already and treat got in first that if the big companies that already um\nHad already set down the heck with down roots than other parts of the world\nAnd I was the time zones move and midnight goes across the country or are we expecting the same sort of policy atmosphere and scenes that you'll see the\nOh I Would I Would say so St john's is a rather small city about a couple of hundred thousand people and saying this excitement tonight is it's quite amazing though I Would imagine across the country if you look at larger cities\nMillions of people some of them are Canadians of one of them for very long time and that when Justin Trudeau ran to be prime minister of the country\nHe promised people he would take 'em take marijuana out of the hands of of of the illegal trade of the drug traffickers and uh\nAnd regulated in an attempt to to grow an industry and I guess a lot of people in the world right now we're looking at candidates and the what Canada is going to do because\nArab way is the only other country in the world\nHas a federal law that legalize cannabis the United states has done so in in a number of states and some countries have done it within states but\nCanada is really a leader\nAnd a lot of people will be looking at houses on hold it will not be without bomb that hiccup\nFrom law enforcement to actually\nWhether there is even enough marijuana that's\nThe one thing we've been hearing that the last number of days that they expect\nThat demand will be so great in the beginning that a lot of suppliers are probably going to run out even within the first few days ago right\nIs it because it's such a stampede or the basically the country's gonna be smoked empty do you think\nWell exactly that's what it will be but people will have to take it and bring it home or take it in the smoke that in private because it's governed by the same rules as alcohol or smoking\nThat's Chris O'Neal yeah H in St Joe Newfoundland or she was reporting there was a a break Julie cue behind a queuing up for the legal kind of his uh for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\nNow it looks like the cash will start flowing into the massive Angus three dam project in the Democratic Republic of Congo now that of fourteen billion dollar deal has been signed a Davis of our business desk is here with us now match is just Thirteen year old project finally ... going to get off the drawing board an actually make some money\nSuddenly looks like at the English three hydroelectric projects has been delayed many many times but now deal who's been signed so last year deal sea government off two competing consults you to join forces company the bill the Three Gorges dam in China and Spanish Company called ac yes and no\nAnd and it's being money being delayed and they had those\nSorts of Nichols I mean it's been a long time coming two years ago the world bank of froze the displacement of Seventy three million dollars of H cash that it was putting into a helpful technical assistance because it said that country had taken the project in a different strategic direction than had been agreed\nTo tell us about the significance of the scale of it how big is this\n... it's a huge um I mean the idea for the youngest three is to compliment the two existing power stations on the Congo river there about two hundred and sixty kilometers downstream from can shocks and knew that in a fool's\nAbout those two power stations are pretty old no one was built in Nineteen Seventy two and one in Nineteen eighty two so this new project as well as a Jew or it's go fix phases\nWe'll take more than ten years to complete compete it'll generate four thousand eight hundred megawatts of power\nNow that's about the same amount of energy as three nuclear power stations China does the DR scene neater used that much well I\nIt doesn't but it means that the power supply in the deal if he can be expanded way beyond the ten percent of the population who currently have reliable electricity supply\nWhich is of course great for economic growth and also be a boost for the country's ... province in the southeast this is where will they mining takes by some mining uses a great deal of energy\nA and it also means that the deal is he can be a big power exposed to to the rest of Africa not just its neighbors but as far south South Africa ah which has actually already signed an agreement to take power from the industry project\nHuge prospects then for the are the match many thanks Matt Davis and out of our business desk joining us live that sit from us here on the news today

politician representing the governing finger Gail policy in Brussels our primary focus is bricks you know one of the nation stands to be as affected by Britain's departure from the EU as Ireland the only land border between the u._k. and the union is the frontier between norm island um\nThe Irish Republic it's what happens with that border and the stages of Northern Ireland post Brexit has become the biggest obstacle\nTo a deal as the torturous bricks negotiations into the final phase and the the Irish Question could yet Scott ... any sort of agreement but could either the you all the u._k.

with fish and game of I just described underway and it seems the issue of the Irish border and the parish breakfast status of\nNorthern Ireland are obstacles that cannot be overcome I'm disappointed\nTake this week because everyone's quite anxious about what didn't happen at the weekend um but what is happening is the talks are continuing so there's no sense that there's a breakdown but there's an impasse and it's not surprising that the issue of northern artist and the island of Ireland is the issue that the withdrawal agreement if\nYou like still has to be completed on because remember it isn't just the ... you or\nMe as an Irish MBP or the our government insisting on this the United kingdom the bushes prime minister\nLast December signed up to\nAnd I sort of commitment that there would be no hug borders no return to the past on the island of Ireland where patients that in March in fact the text on the table and draft withdraw divorce if you like agreement I'd be incomplete parts are around\nAnd northern Arctic what has troubling to me I have to say is that normally when we negotiate certainly I think you level the papers produced I don't talk what's on your paper for example but I'm going to propose changes I guess one you won't agree with all of them but you take someone board\nThat have not happened in these negotiations what is happening on this is a troubling part that I Hope we can get over is that the u._k.\nSide and that is their right to do they have said well we don't like what started we went to northern around where proposing that in the

if I making sense it is\nBut I I Am very aware that the people in Britain around the world there is a great deal of complications but if I don't want you seemed to be saying is that the British

runs\nWe're working on both battery based solutions because we've got a lot of expertise with batteries but we're also very focused on hybrid electric solutions where you've got an on board generator and the reason for that is really to allow our customers who are the aircraft manufacturers\nTo not have to design for the batteries of now but rather design for the batteries that we may have ten or Twenty years from now and then use the hybrid system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be\nAnd what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely in reliably right now or as soon as possible and an upgrade the batteries as soon as the battery technology is there\nDescribe who is in this game\nIt's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies and you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in the ... that can absolutely are thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angles to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where\nYou'll the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft\nSome of the start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they developed the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you can fly across\nNew York or London or Paris if you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus that's in Europe where you have maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board\nThere is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now what I expect to see is you're going to see the highlighted versions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric power train like the ones that vertigo is developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery technology has come into play and the diversity of aircraft types than grows\nWe took about taxes I think of a taxi is going to be picking me up for it\nThe first thing we're going to see with this kind of new model\nThat's correct you're not really talking about flying to and from your house you're more talking about flying let's say from London Heathrow to the city center or from JFK Airport in New York to Manhattan directly places where you have large amounts of traffic congestion\nAnd if you think is the most traffic choked cities in the world a lot of them are in the developing world on that you use it might have been all of a sudden they have ... regulations that perhaps they are the most likely places to see this kind of technology says\nOh absolutely and we're seeing a lot of interest in cities like Delhi Mumbai Bangkok Sao paulo Mexico City and it's really interesting because all of us in this industry are actually watching the Sao paolo market very carefully\nRight now today in Sao paulo there are hundreds of helicopters operating to and from hundreds of HeLa ports on top of the buildings around the city\nAnd so this type of transportation model isn't something that's theoretical it actually already exists in one city\nBusy business people five to ten times a year and we all find ourselves in the cities where\nOkay my flight was late getting it I really need to get to a meeting in the city center and at that point it's very easy decision to say I'm going to put this on my expense report I Need to get

describing so I think we're going to see the early services around twenty twenty five and all caviar by ... that saying that I think those are going to be the piloted aircraft it's perhaps more like a bus and less like a taxi\nYou're going to see a few cities in the world where you're going to start to have service let's say from the major international airport\nTwo two or three of the major business centers around the city so that you've you've started to deliver this rap and transportation option\nAnd then it just starts to grow from there\nAre a bunch of vertigo arrow hair on business

galvanizing industry employing everybody together to go after the common goal to get air taxi ride sharing on parity with owning a car which is well it's a brilliant goal and they've got a lot of technical hurdles to get there but brilliant but realistic\nUh you know people would argue with the realism but even if they're close you know there are still going to be people that have a meeting across town and there's going to be no other way to get there and they'll spend the extra money to to make that meeting and so I think that there's a market there even if it's not on price parity with owning a car\nThere are technical hurdles not just safety but also noise and other things and simply finding places in big busy cities to land I guess but it's going to start in Europe and America what was going to start somewhere else about the regulatory hurdles a less high\nYeah I think ... probably the number one city in my estimation is is Hong Kong\nRight it's water water bound in super

you know very shockingly you know stuff happens then you know we're doing our best and it's going to be sort of the big oil crisis just wakes you up because you notice it\nAnd then he's like oh you know we really had terrible the regulations before let's fix it but then the fix is really not quite right but then you just kind of move on and say well I did my best can prevent it stuff happens\nNot much of a comfort to think that the economists could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joe Stiglitz it comes down to the continued reliance recall them is on the totally unrealistic notion that the market is always right\nHe dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nThey were blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers the blind belief that markets work well on their own unfettered markets will deliver for wellbeing for all citizens has been\nAt the center of you might say conservative economics sings Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood that wasn't true\nI think it'd be horrified at the abuse of his\nIdeas he recognized that ah whenever businesses get together that conspire against the public interest to raise prices but somehow and the two hundred and some years after Adam Smith conservatives I'd miss used his ideas\nEven more astounding was the fact that beginning in the Nineteen fifties sixties seventies and my own work or in the seventies and eighties advances in economics explained why markets often don't work the reason that this will have often seemed invisible was that it wasn't there\nThe notion of invisible hand and supremacy of markets is\nBased on the idea that if everyone\nGovernment intervention everyone will be better off just sticking that's one of the Nobel Prize for economics by them to find some of the ways in which the key assumptions about perfect markets offload the presumption that everyone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple ... just that somebody know something that somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation\nOthers didn't the fact is that the people who want to believe that markets were perfect close their eyes and in Dr needed their students that markets basically worked perfectly\nWider economists expect humans to behave like rational calculating machines despite all evidence to the country\nFor some this tendency indicates a key problem with the hearts of economics which is to explain human behavior as if it were signs and the only works\nIf you imagine all humans are the same responding in the same way an old contributions to the economy can be counted journalist Katrin muscles book who cooked Smith dinner argues the traditional economic\nTheories and methods only makes sense if you imagined humanity be self centered so unlike humans is almost a different species in fact some economists have
