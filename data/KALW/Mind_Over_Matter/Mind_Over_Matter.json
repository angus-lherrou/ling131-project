before the show and the pain is currently all she could think about so anyone wants to call in with questions who answers our ouch or my freaking toe\nHere I Would consider it a solid it\nI think I tore the nail back like have you know it's weird you know that was the fear that I Know I just don't fall that's not a stone wall to wall to more than the stuff yeah no it's brutal itself very much over you know\nI I'm Laurie Fisher was surprised and a bit disappointed to learn that to day October twenty first is the official day celebrating things he doesn't much think should be celebrated national reptile awareness day and national pumpkin she mistake it cheesecake or is a cheese\nI I don't know what you wrote okay\nWhat are those uh cheesecake makes sense either way I'm with you that's not worthy of celebration I he's still lobbying unsuccessfully for a national mine's ever modern day he'll keep you posted [laughter] I mean that when you're in Orlando next she will not be going to gator land\nIt looks like I won't I certainly will go on October twenty first which is national reptile awareness day and it would be too loud it pay I thought all Florida was date or land

popular song from Nineteen twenty three with lyrics by Billy rows\nAnd also he de Jesus and horse feathers or two terms quaint in comic panels by what cartoonist\nOf only Jerry was here you know a little his little or from the end of the first one now oh okay I was really rose L you in the first one so it's a Nineteen twenty three\nThis song is from Nineteen twenties read the comic strip uh

rocking all persons Patti Smith now what's your guess is a good gas and it's not the right it's a little earlier than that really but um\nI mean she did have a career as a photographer but I think most people know her for other reasons\nWhere she married to somebody in rock and roll\nShe lives may just so many in rock and roll happily Paul McCartney his wife Lindy Lindy Eastman harassed\n[noise]\nAnd um or if you have\nA short question do among the final works of what\nBy the German army in World War one to camouflage artillery hiding them from our aerial observation is this a um [noise]\nSomebody who's well known in modern art circles and he's well known as ... as you know oh yeah oh he didn't\nDie in World War one cell that's why these nine types are his uh\nUh among

was\nOnce a month Nineteen sixty six time magazine published its first covered that did not have an image of a person or I'm a animate thing was it a solid color yes um I think so\n\nI teach sixty six oh so it wasn't that computer it was not okay so it was not an image of any\nThere might have been a big image in the background but it was not an image of a living thing so computer would I Would accept that isn't that the ... is it is God did yes that was the covers with they had as God\nThat cover [noise] and then I think there might have\nBeen an image lurking in the background or not or if you have another short question I Do think that it is I'm only two Supreme Court justices have ever appeared on currency who are they\nLegal tender one is ... chase yeah who's the chief justice center Lincoln and and I would probably have an Andrew Johnson yeah and what's what Bill was a young too you know which is really it's a cure it probably wasn't in her pocket\n[laughter] oh so they must feel like the ten thousand\n[laughter] All right [laughter] yeah I Do that is why she can never led me any money that we had like an ... well it's the other\nOne Taft nope I'm so is this person was this person their highest office Supreme Court justice\nYes\nSo they were never president or they were never president for ... or anything bigger than Supreme John Marshall yes very good he was on the five

the whole all the people in okay the basic plot of\nThe film is like grand opera only the people\nThe ... or music when I say I use grand opera and in terms of melodrama and they're like valley of the
