Gross\nAfter Robert Bauer shot and killed at least eleven congregants at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh Saturday we decided to postpone are scheduled interview with Jonah Hill we'll hear that tomorrow today we're going to talk about how Bowers views echo the rhetoric of the white nationalist movement\nAnd about the threat that this movement poses and I guess ... low as a Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter who is the author of a book about that movement titled rising out of hatred\nAnd focus is on the story of Derek Black\nTheir ex father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and created the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nDerek was seen as an Arab parents in the movement but here we now says racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties and a few minutes we'll hear an excerpt of the interview I recorded in September with Derrick black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded\nWith ... this morning he likes that slow welcome\nBack to fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that\nIn a God I thought about your book ... black as we knows his white nationalist views but his father Don black or white nationalist and still has the website storm front he did not pull the trigger the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that\nBut do you find Don black story relevant to the views that were expressed by the shooter Robert Ballard\nI think you can draw a straight line from Don views and ... work in this movement to the views expressed by the shooter um you know not straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooters body yet attached to a fourteen eighty eight am to white nationalist slogans fourteen refers to a a fourteen word\nSort of statement of purpose that is central to what storm front does about um you know securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children at you know in and saying things like I'm here because of a white genocide and I can't stand by and watch my people get\nGet murdered them as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language and the motivation that exist on storm front and that's\nThe way that they speak about this a quote unquote race war that they believe is underway\nYeah I'm a ... I had had said that um he believed the Jews were committing genocide against his people ... genocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believe the Jews are committing genocide\nThey do and both Don and Derek were central to the the sort of creation of that language even the term genocide that was one of the main things that Derrick and Don tried to spread and popularized on the radio show and and the idea behind it was that instead of speaking about ah you know\nMinorities and slurs or things like that that they could appeal to white people by the idea that their race was slowly disappearing and more than that that this was a genocide that somebody else is doing to white people uh you know it's it's\nA ludicrous idea um but unfortunately it's had huge purchasing this movement and and now\nWhite genocide I Would say is probably at the top of the paradigm of white nationalist ideas\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting at synagogue\nUm instilling front is the site that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the sound your son so so what are you reading on storm front now\nThere is some really file I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial or a A R A N and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm front um\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storefronts over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that's\nWell this probably isn't quite the way to go about it uh he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the\nPeople who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself\nBut our our global with and are Jews who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody's going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so you have you spoken with either done are guaranteed black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um you know and I think that he's\nHeartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels in small ways culpable and he wanders have you know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism\nPlays into you know incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating the phrase white genocide and said to popular I think the movement said to then have somebody going to a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio and for years and you're young wife is a I think it's it's haunting\nYou liked ... who is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Darren lack a former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm from\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Garrett black and ... will hear that interview after a short break this is fresh air\nNo Mm Mm\nMm Mm Mm\nMm [noise]\n\n\nAnd statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants and a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nWe're going to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Derrick black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we now and seeing those views when he was twenty two he helped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nGehrig's father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm from\nDerek Black as the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli such low who we heard from earlier in the show I interview with black also included sass no the first question was addressed to Derrick black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to like it's not that we're better than but we're all better off being separated by by race\nIs like my dad popular everywhere and white nationalism in so that was his thing\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was for it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he founded storm front and called it a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that was\nNot about superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that wasn't what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's is totally irrational how exactly think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nFor a second I've always wanted to know\nThe early people who rebranded white supremacy to white nationalism whether they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream movement and make it more palatable or whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did believe they were not\nDoing bad things to other people that\nThe uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and maybe unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better um\nThe the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not and gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race in their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confident way\nInception was everybody is basically all white people are basically racist they're just afraid to express it so let's give them a language in a safe space\nSo that they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insult toward they listen to\nThe Clintons to word [noise] um\nRacial ... over the years if you look at the language in terms of how\nMany people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist him so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think the the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy is that white nationalism\nActively pursuing an end cause of separating a\nYou know races into into different homeland and white supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is\nSo if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguished the movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures\nAre based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still\nEffective and useful for us as we talked about it\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick lack a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who has since renounced those views and Washington Post reporter Eliza ... who wrote a book about black called rising out of hatred we'll hear more after a break and Terry Gross and this is fresh

a around the world really will be the topic for one a at eleven o'clock this morning with Joshua Johnson stay with us\nWe're back now to your call with um fresh air with Terry Gross time right now is nine thirty\nI'm Talking about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme let it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kittens and the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against at every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire\nIdeology the end point to the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on what you mean that you want to separate people have different races into different places like ... percent\n... percent white is okay what ... percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and your racism nebulous thing that that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining there\nWas a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public\nUh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to are we going to do this or that and one of those with how are we going to define who is white because only a white person can be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to save the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white N's and where something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to as to who is white was that you had a\nGenerally be considered visually white by most people in America and you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands of posed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick black a former white nationalist leader and Washington Post ... ... the author of a book about

friday\nThis is fresh air let's get back to the interview I recorded in September with Jared black a former white nationalist leader who announced his views when he was twenty to his father Don black as a former KKK grand wizard and founded the white nationalist website storm front\nWe're also hearing from Washington Post reporter Eli ... the author of a book about Derek Black\nCalled rising out of hatred\nSo they're one of the things you did you have been home schooled so you were pretty isolated from any beliefs outside of your family is racist views\nUm but then you went to college and from the way you described it in the book it was a pretty liberal college in Florida that were Jewish people they're naturally tried to hide your identity and then figured you might as well [noise]\nLet people know a before you were ousted by somebody else you placed a magazine [laughter] you must of publication with an article by you and the gym so that people would find it and realize oh God that's their black\nSo after you kind of out of yourself and after having befriended people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were you know very upset when they found out who you really are um you had Jewish friends who reached out to you\nEven had a girlfriend who ... who didn't initially no was Jewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends said to you\nThat made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nBut I think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew ... dinners took the strategy that I think was a very very smart of ...\nAre not talking to me about it ah I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up ... every ... other thing that we were possibly interested in did\nA and I think the Matthew said that the reason for that or was that\nIt would have been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about something anti Semitic because we're not talking about swimming after we're talking about him or talk about his life and this is very human\nAnd he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish people and\nEffective like actually actually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know\nJewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nI think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that the Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts\nIn racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups that are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where either this is this is crazy we need to stop attacking Jewish people back off\nIn addition to being the story of decks transformation I mean I I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on this campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYou know profound change and they did that and a lot of different ways I mean there was a\nCivil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of cast Derek out and made it clear to him how how awful and how he'd for and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who\nAh who won one is trust built a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like\nPoint by point went through in and\nUh and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited Derek over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build a relationship hoping that\nJust by spending more and more time with them he would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes to the people into the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in of itself could be transformative\nAnd I think it's important to note that that did not happen quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the beliefs of this ideology and the things that Derrick headset Matthew in ... in between these dinners which sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site\nAnd they would see the horrible things that you said about Jews and and ... yeah\n[noise] uh Jews warm their way into control over our society Jews must go all Jews Moscow and you're in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid of beliefs Jews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe\nThe Jews have propagated a scheme of multiculturalism and are are are sort of the number one enemy of what white nationalist would define as the white race and\nSo Matthew in ... and also in their own lives experienced large degrees of anti Semitism in ... case he's a from a family of Hungarian Jews there was all but wiped out by the Holocaust that in Bergen does and that was the definitive experience of his\nYoung life was growing up in an orthodox community that was largely defined by a by by an an incredible history of anti Semitism and and the Holocaust and\nMoshe ... had had gone and traveled to these concentration camps and had had learned German to connect with his father's history and Derek and also learned German because of his very divergent family history and the fact that the two of them a week after week we're sitting at the same table sometimes having conversations and the Germans they learned because of\nBecause of these incredibly diversion family histories and began to have an effect\nThere's a lot of Holocaust denying within the white nationalist movement can you explain to me how it's possible to believe in the first place that the Holocaust didn't happen", "year": "2018", "show_name":

really different role for you you play somebody who is very funny in a caustic sarcastic that are way\nBut I wouldn't call it movie a comedy and there there isn't any physical comedy ... in it and you're very no physical comedy so I Know you start in St Vincent and a dramatic role but do you consider this movie a new direction for you\n[noise] um I think it's in it's a new direction for how I think most people are used to seeing me I I was in New York for many many years doing um dramatic place so\nI'm quite comfortable and I was kind of think if you you know\nPut all the all the things I've done together I I may have even done more drama than than comedy in its totality but uh if you realize I most people haven't seen a lot of that it was incredibly far off Broadway plays so you know the searching people at each performance joke [laughter] don't have much impact\nOn a memoir by Lee Israel who when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene [laughter] when\nThe ride on the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dressing them you know bridesmaids stresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of a of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross had comedy just as men can\nAnd it really wasn't a point of it oh okay and none of\nNone of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak get into the film\nKind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled data and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to ... more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what if the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it\nBecause we're things like this do happen and I said if it's less about gross for gross and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like ... look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my God just look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the facts of like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and and how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that 'cause the second half of my question [laughter]\nWith him to be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do gross out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality of by doing gross out scenes because your mother is really interesting 'cause you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but it wasn't intended\nAnd it was really talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for\nBathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible and wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character mhm and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all fall and said the wrong thing had some\nShaming thing done and I think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human next\nAction hasn't happened to most people\nMelissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for is I'm insults\n[laughter] insulting to do that and not real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know I don't know why are you not [laughter] but\nBut the most famous example of that is and this is forty and there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they're all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd the the the other ... couple have threatened you so you're all just kind of going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash that he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do hear him say or you know what I said was that we need to keep an extra ... kids because with all the technological advances or they need to learn to use them responsibly no no when he well he said to me was he called me or what language\nCatherine language me relay what they do not balls to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manager her thing next door\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake Kabul Bank commercial that's what you look like your bank commercial couple none of this talk if productive I Would like your room and my legs and kick you out in a job with my phone\nJust scaring me this is what happens in your corner you corner me I Will throw you out to you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty uh it's just you kind of ... improving insults in that scene in it and just go back on and on with more over the top insult is that something that you're famous for outside like and the real world being able to [noise] to do really funny and solve\nNo I Know I Do not oh go round insulting people um I Hope ever [noise] um I don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I get it all out on on screen but\nYeah one of the first time I watched that back I kept saying I didn't say that [laughter] I never say that and the first time a sitting with ... said for watching you say it you said all of it and I I didn't\nRemember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say ... anything that came off the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything so um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of logging into my memory\nHedging improv insults before\nYes I've had a\n... and only have played a lot of kind of very assertive um characters that you know I think in the heat\nOr especially part of part of the part of the characters DNA was just to literally say anything just to kind of ... ... people down and I think kind of try to stand her in her own authority so it was a big part of that character\nAt your very impressive detective and that\nAggressive detective um there is a fun to it I mean I Would never want to do it in real life but it's part of the fun of getting to act you do these things that you would never do your Boulder your harsher you know you're you're just ripping insults that someone\nHopefully you know you you don't do it in your real life\nMy guest as Melissa McCarthy she stars in

the deadly business of building oil and gas pipelines turns out a recently those construction workers\nHave died many times more often than the average American worker so we'll talk about the dangers but those workers and how this industry is regulated so hope you'll join us for the one ... one planet series that's coming up\nAnd how much it's regular you know much it's not regulated branch right ... you were looking forward to the show ten o'clock this morning when a half hour from now from right now is nicer\nGay clubs\nI did duplex was one of my favorite places to reform I just loved it also because you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um [noise]\n... when you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there is this element there was always one\nSo he's the one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go club to a club like are you actually the same guy [laughter] it was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like take your top off [laughter]\nAnd you're just like what like what does it ever worked for you is any woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my job off [laughter] like I just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shove now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to Hitler God\nI don't think it was my favorite I think the more work the more I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road if like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who\nWho is going crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off and like and I would do votes and then talk about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop to\nOh I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels like to his core and then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what\nFirst of all there's no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\n[noise] and they asked us if you go over time they're going to play you a fish is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like tapping his watch and sang times I saw\nThe light oh ... ever present uh not to ever not be heated\nLight that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the white men I wouldn't flashes like ... yes and when that light flashes is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explode it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics and ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a oh my God it's a really big deal yeah\nCertainly and other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they're going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch might surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booze\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager kind of ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great [laughter] so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I\nI got off the finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was yeah that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you you're one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act and material that means something to you that you care about and give yourself good rules because\nYeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles [noise]\nI think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where don't realize how lucky I Am and I've never mind it how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flood\nYou know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read ... kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant\nI was like I don't know how to play pleasant like ... who who cares there's nothing to sink your teeth into it's like the perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I was just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't I didn't want to play it also thought all the people I Love and like are\nFilled with quirks and eccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even disliked people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness as\nCharacter was really blend in and often a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like car all saying I'm Still I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and say the guy's name I'm like\nWhy doesn't she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why she always a bummer\nI just I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to play this because I don't know why she's doing it\n[noise] I'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement which you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors their careers or at least temporarily ended because they were outed for\nAssaulting Oregon Ratzinger Munnell behavior yet to two women so like a as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer a producer has the kind of\nChange and climate been meaningful\nFor you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more\nEmpowered in Hollywood now\nEvery little in ... I Will take every centimeter forward all take I think the more we talk about it and the fact that is is becoming less acceptable you know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be dismissed you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like me you know boys\nThere has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think is so important about me too it's it's branching out to everyone and it's all women that need help that need\nMoney for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and I think the more we we linked up and realize their strength and numbers it can't be for the worse\nWhen Melissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on our show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you and your new role and can you ever forgive me and let's continue the conversation some other time\n[laughter] I Would love to this has been a just a dream I Love the show so I think so much for having me on\nMelissa McCarthy stars and the new film can you ever forgive me as a writer turned literary forge or\nAfter a break John Powers will review and new BBC series about a police bodyguard assigned to protect a woman politician who may be a terrorist target it drops on Netflix Wednesday this is fresh air\nHelen Hogan threatening letter from election officials after registering people to vote and George\nAnd I got scared you know [noise] um and then test\nSo she got help if you want to go through to corral came to the right place shut out of the polls over the next ...\nYou can hear a veal today at twelve noon here in Ninety One point seven ...

Bob Blacksburg who's also the show runner seasons five is now a net flicks Comedy Central is now showing the first season\nThe Syrian satirized has Hollywood and deals with issues like access and failure ego power addiction relationships and sexism\nSeason five is set in the era of the me too movement\nBow jak horsemen takes advantage of the kind of characters that you can pull off in an animated series it's a world that to mix of people and talking animals with human characteristics bow jak is a horse who became famous as the star of the nineties sitcom horsing around\nBut one season one above jak horsemen begins they'll jak is washed up his celebrity has faded and\nHe spends a lot of time drinking feeling sorry for himself and watching old reruns of a sitcom horsing around and Myron how great he was on that show back then let's start with a clip from the very first episode of vote jak horsemen when Bo jak as a guest on that\nHorses around me or don't ABC Show which young bachelor horses forced to reevaluate its priorities fully agrees trace three human children was initially dismissed by critics is wrong and suffering and not good\nBut the family comedy struggle corporate America when on the air for nine seasons star of horses around ... is our guest ... ...\nIt is good to be here Charlie\n[laughter] ... Blacksburg welcome to fresh air time changes how we see things doesn't it [laughter]\n... wedding later when he did that Charlie Rose opening he probably had no idea that he would be accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to the loss of his job [laughter]\nSo let's just start with the surprise of that for you did you think that opening episode when the women step forward\nIt really dates the show doesn't it have Charlie Rose be the the voice of sober reason that you know look at bow jak who is such a mess and ... and unprofessional and Charlie Rose up played in this clip by pat and that was wild is are are straight person in the scene\nAnd uh yeah when the allegations against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nBecause there wasn't it was truly oh no Charlie Rose ... and and all the women that he allegedly targeted a that's terrible but it is interesting now to to go back to that first episode and look at it and think about how times have changed\nSo how did you come up with the idea of starting a series with a horse that can talk and walk on two legs and dress and be bitter like a human being and have him be the washed up star of the family sitcom\nWell the idea for the show really started from my friendship with Lisa ... who was a brilliant illustrator and cartoonist and I'd have been friends with her since high school I mean when I was you know ... in Los Angeles pitching shows around\nUm she was living in Brooklyn at the time and one thing she was doing was drawing these animal people on her own and posting them in her blog and on the Internet\nWell let's say it's a lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt a plausible deniability like he's not actively killing himself but he's\nAllowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a port and maybe minor distinction to us that he is so despondent despairing that he was willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself\n[noise] one of the episodes that you have in the current season season five which you wrote it I'm an unusual episode because it's one long monologue ... mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dementia and low tech does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her\nSo he's at a podium at 'em like her coffins at the side and he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in his family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was mean to his mother and they were both Maine to bow jak [noise]\nI I Want to play a brief part of\nHis eulogy and this is well or not as low jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called horsing around fiercely they'll hold your applause\nWell held it was written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named ...\nAnd it was about these orphans in early on the network out a note maybe don't mention they're orphans so much because audiences tend to find orphans sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they could imagine their parents to be anything they wanted something to learn for\nAny way we did this one season finale where Olivia is birth mother comes to to ... she was a junkie but she's got her so cleaned up and she was being Olivia's life again and of course she's like a perfect grownup version of Libya and they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted and anyway the worst rose to water\nBe careful moms have a way of letting you do but Olivia just thinks the horses jealous when the mom says she's moving to California Olivia decides to go with her the network really juiced\nBecause there is Olivia gone for good but of course because it's a TV show not gone for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and they had to go back to rehab facility had hitchhiked all the way home getting rides from Mr T. alpha ... stop of\nCourse that's what happened because what are you going to do just not how to live you on the show\nYou shouldn't have happy ending ... not really because\nIf everyone's happy the show would be over and above all else the show has to keep going there's always more show and you can call horsing around dumb or bad or unrealistic\nBut there is nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more show I guess until there is\nAn assay\nYou know his mother had told him earlier you were born broke and your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that\nI'm so he he really had a bad relationship with her and when he says early in that clip that um he indeed are are fans because they could imagine their parents anyway they wanted to um let me do you think about that\nWell you know I I I think a big\nPart of this episode and a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ... and his relationship with his parents is about\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but it's gone now and will never hurt you again and\nEven in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself and I'm really interested in that idea and that that question of\nYou know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think\nWhat's really interesting for me is the tension between that and to easy forgiveness of public figures right and and I want to believe\nOn a personal level level that nobody is era deem Abul or so far gone that they can't find a way to be better\nAnd be forgiven and how does that track with me where I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've heard so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption\nAnd I don't know how I reconcile those two ideas and and that tension for me\nHas been at least a ... a really interesting to explore over the course of this last season but also the show in general\nSo in this era of the me too movement was so many men have so much to apologize for [laughter]\nI'm One of the funny things that you've come up with for the series or you you and the writers is do we forgive you award you created a whole awards ceremony for people who need to apologize for saying would you describe the ... the lea for\nSure but we forgive you awards as presented on the show are awards that celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a we forgive you award from\nI think for time forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd it one of the sad to slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about house additives\nThat our industry is so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men who do awful things and they're able to kind of likes linked back into the limelight and we wanted to satirized that\nAnd then over the course of the last year it started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry and then just in the last month or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe more forgiving\nI don't know maybe this is sadly irrelevant a new um so it feels like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture news when in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening for years and years\nWhat makes you think that people are being forgiving again well\nUh it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers and I I don't know if we have we forgotten his anti Semitic remarks is homophobic remarks his threats against his dumb\nOf racial slurs and missed advise me in this area that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable but it still feels like we are not\nYou know really see Carrie did a stand up said a little ways back and got a standing ovation a there are reports that Garrison Keillor and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks I think that there is work with those men can be doing to better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I find it tremendously upsetting\nMy guess is ... the creator and show runner of the Netflix animated series bow jak horsemen after

Russian Jewish immigrants in the U. S. um tell us about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so my mother owned a a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob\nAnd it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto and the surrounding area\nAnd so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I'd sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books and and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish day school um you know I even\nAfter a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt\nA extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never\nOnce felt like a minority and the communities that I was in um\nShe would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of men that were chips um we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah that says\nHappy Halloween because it's missing an end to the misfit toys or Monica um it it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life\nUm and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWith the disconnect me between being told about anti Sam ... senators and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated times now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes\nUm and it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country\nAnd they're they have a lot of power and there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage\nUm and that's been very scary to me um but also scary\nHow little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening um especially big some for someone who you know as a Jew you hear the story of a Holocaust over and over and over growing up and the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing\nThere are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who were shocked when their own neighbors\nBeards and so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd you know if actually one of the Jews control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kind of feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nThey said it because it's the ... and like I think yeah and I and I would\nSay a couple of years it'll be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around then\nSo it was it difficult for you to concentrate long enough to to read books\nUm yes or sometimes you know I I I could always reading books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form\nOf ADHD where if there is something that really interested in me I I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took a pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I Love that audience that I Love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't you\nKnow and it was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize was inappropriate\nYou know like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants inappropriate inappropriate and and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy here watching the boundaries I did it because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified that\nOh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take\n'em you know or just a shouting out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's a well you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I thought I have I Want to say this thing so I'm going to say it\nAnd I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference I mean you know the problem with ADHD and other a mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not oh you have this thing there for you or this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this\nPrecisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas\nAnd it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have\nYou know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps and what does this mean I still am not quite sure\nWhat was to me like a safe space for you or you can like unless\nIn the world of what you were consuming than the natural world and the reason why I ask that is that like there's so many pop culture references and bow jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them\nSaid made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nYeah well TV made sense to me and you know there is a a correlation causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely\nWas a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate\nIf I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this seem that I was living in\nFeel like the scenes that I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful as being a writer and having an outlet and now\nIf I Am in a situation I think if the funny thing I can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold on to this and all I have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think of the funny situation you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or if someone came in here and did this\nI can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment\nI'll I'll get paid for it by putting it in a story later\nSo having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\nYou know I'm thinking now the comedy central as his running bow jak which has Netflix series now the comedy central is rain yet starting with season one um what's that like for you to ask\nYou in retrospect for like some of the jokes and season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter] cable\nYeah you know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks and making the right time for Comedy Central and you know we're obviously want them to keep their\nDignity as an episode of television not edited out anything too important but as we are looking for cuts one of things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or would this work without those moments and if it does sometimes we'll take those moments out um but I also think look this is the show and\nIt has to do exist on its own terms and\nHopefully people you know as they have embraced the showing that looks will embrace the show on Comedy Central and if there are flaws with it they will see those laws for what they are and you know we'll see what happens\nWhen it's been great to talk with you thank you so much\nIt is my pleasure thank you so much\n...

documents including confidential tax returns and financial records\nGiven to the times by a secret source the documents reveal that by age three Trump was earning two hundred thousand dollars a year

of four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's business as\nMuch of his money was transferred from father to son with the help of schemes designed to avoid paying taxes some of which

his lawyers disputed any of the specifics in the times financial reporting\nSuzanne crack David Barstow congratulations on this extraordinary piece of reporting and welcome to fresh air attack your pleasure to have you here get a sense of French from Donald Trump's father's real estate empire when it was at its peak for\nTrump was a remarkable builder and in New York's history he was the guy who had built and sold his first home before he reached the age of twenty by the time he was in his mid thirties he was building hundreds of\nHomes here by the time he was in his mid forties he was really one of the biggest developers actually in the country and what he specialized in was building middle class housing um whose homes which she built in his apartment buildings which he built and\nAlmost entirely in Brooklyn and queens we're kind of is no frills homes that he was able to\nBuild very quickly using a lot of the techniques of mass production um he was described as the\nThe Henry Ford of um of building in Brooklyn and queens and his uh and so we had enormous skill building middle class housing and she also specialize in\nTapping into this wave of federal housing subsidies that began to build in the thirties and forties\nAnd especially with the return of the GIs from World war two and a few would become one of the nation's biggest recipients of cheap federal loans to build middle class\nWell let me re introduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne ... and David Barstow of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece on a President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans he got from his father the tax evasion schemes the family had\nAnd that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk more

NPR News\n... consider three o'clock this afternoon here I Ninety One point seven KLW San Francisco rush air and if you're just joining us my guest or New York times reporter says and crack and David Barstow two of the three writers who report in just\nA couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how as a self made millionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred Trump Donald's father\nFunnel to him and his other siblings and\nHow they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time it was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax schemes we talked about um ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that he got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlay that antennas\nInto his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws\n[noise] ah we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans no one million I'm In today's dollars which two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct wealth that we saw\nTransferred to dawn what we what we also saw ... what is important also is the ... in many cases um these were loans that were never repaired him and he would take her out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to that in his barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run into\nTwo for Trump to get more money and we saw especially the the flow of loans increase those Donald Trump took on\nAnd she was suddenly in trouble you'd run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream that went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then being off to raise these were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nYeah he used the money for\nMany of his adventures he had Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support his ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars um in debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars\nUm he was in debt to his father was going to the father these very crucial times\nFor more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and ends up in debt in a lot of instances instead of making a fortune from its own investments\nCould also see that when his so you know when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety was there to catch them\nThere's one spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is a time\nIn the you know the background of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos they're facing a debt payment\nAnd Fred Trump as a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money ... million dollars worth of it was that a chat room and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's will sexually and knew well and the Scottish filter the wheel it's taken to Fred Trump's house in December of Nineteen Ninety and Fred Trump immediately sees\nThis caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire into potentially put at risk and ...\nImmediately says no he freaked out and he\nMakes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald list the soil executor fried Trump's well inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new well is drafted but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him that he makes this move

R. S.\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with that so it's true that the IRS actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe're describing the story and in fact the IRS ours did push back some and especially on the lower valuations they're placed on buildings who made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning if ... million more bucks\nOn that return but the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got\nAn agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families are the most expensive legal and accounting helping who engage\nIn these very sophisticated ah maneuvers to\nAvoid or their taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an honor their looking though at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just under state tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art video the art or the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us all is actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nOn public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David or the comeback [laughter] go for it [noise] [noise]\nOh well so he publishes the art of come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of\nYou know pulling himself up I'm Out of the mock of his casino collapse and through shows grit and determination and Wylie negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book\nSo happens to coincide with the time when he actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate tax schemes that we describe in the store it so at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of Kevin himself off the map it actually coincides perfectly with the moment when he's just taken\nPossession of twenty five percent\nOf this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of the\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money money\nThat happened in two thousand and four\nI'm right as the sale had gone through the you know hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from fat trap and yet when you watch not opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene from Trump belt and paid for [noise]\nYou have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making abilities and so many people still believe the mess and Donald Trump is still putting forward\nThan that it's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked\nAnd I think that we've ... I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken that I think a good first stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think that the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents up I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's absolutely true and the documents are there and in a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for this to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access into were locked up in this room [noise] um ... who cleaned it who was

tournament known as March Madness was seen by Ninety seven million TV viewers [noise]\n\nOur guest\nWriter Michael ... says the money and recognition the sport generates has led to a host of corrupt practices in the recruitment of players were the top college basketball programs talented athletes as young as twelve for targeted for manipulation by St agents soccer love described as dealers in human athletic flash\nMany of those corrupt practices were exposed in an FBI investigation which led to a sprawling indictment that rocked the basketball world last year\nIn the first of three trials in the case the federal jury yesterday convicted three men of conspiring to use cash payments to recruit players to college basketball programs including the University of Louisville it's legendary coach Rick Pitino wasn't charged but the scandal cost him his job\nHe's one of the subjects of ... new book the last temptation of Rick Pitino\nCase was still deliberating well my ... welcome back to fresh air you know any enterprise that generates large sums of money can be beset by corruption how much money to college basketball generate well\nBillions I mean it really depends on how you calculate it but directly to the universities into the NC double a\nBillions but if you figure in the gambling money and money that's generated by recruiting sites in all these crazy ways you know you're getting into the four or five or six billion dollars a year\nRight and what does the money go\nThe money largely goes to the adults who run the games very little of it goes to the players or the players get the value of their scholarships so if you look at a program like Louisville which is program that I focused on\nThey generate about forty five million dollars a year in revenue they give out search teams scholarships that adds up to about four hundred thousand dollars a year\nThe rest of it gets spread out to the coach who makes eight million dollars a year just the assistant coaches and make as much as a half million dollars a year\nAll throughout the athletic department people are making six figure salaries it does not go to the players and what I call the unpaid workforce\nHow big is the NCAA a championship tournament March Madness\nJust about a billion dollars a year goes to the NC double a itself\nWhich is the non profit organization that runs big time college sports but the money that that tournament throws off and all kinds of different directions\nIs where you get into the two or three billion dollars it's the kind of money that pro franchises are are making or generating the differences that they're actually paying the players\nYou're right about the University of Louisville which you say it was kind of a quiet commuter school\nUntil it a new athletic director guy named Tom Juravich came in and\nHad big ambitions and invested in big time coaches and new facilities stadiums and basketball arenas and and he made a ton of revenue from it did it have benefits for the rest of the school it depends\nAnd get their hooks into families and get into their inner circles and then to see what's in it for me can I deal this kid to a particular college can I\nAssociate him with a particular NBA agent\nAnd this is very much the scene on the grass roots circuit it's known and it's it's part of the background\nAre are there are kids who when they're you know twelve Thirteen fourteen kind of become celebrities kind of think of themselves as a business\nAbsolutely there are there are kids who you know this is their life and one of the things that really struck me\nWhen I have been around grassroots basketball is the kids who referred to themselves as being in the business of basketball because that's how it feels to them they may be twelve or Thirteen Years old but they're in the business of basketball\n[noise] Michael ... book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino story of corruption scandal in the big business of college

new book about corruption in recruitment in college basketball it's called the last temptation of Rick Pitino\n[noise] so and a lot of cases families will move uh they're promising young basketball player to a different city for a high school that's it's known for being competitive so it becomes kind of the family's lives to you write that on the college end of this it's the assistant coaches who are really involved in recruiting explain\nWhat they do how they're paid\nAssistant college coaches are the sort of ones who first make contact with a young player and his family they\nFly all over the country and there's a lot of pressure on assistant coaches it used to be an assistant college coach was a coach first he taught the game he mentored the young men\nA lot of them now if not most of them are recruiters first and they are charged with bringing the head coach the best players it's sometimes set in college basketball that you win\nIn July and that means you win games by getting the best players from the tournaments the grass roots tournaments in July in Las Vegas and elsewhere but the assistant coaches that's\nThe job get me kids the thinking in the industry and among journalists and many who follow this world is that many of the head coach who say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just brings\nAssistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep their hard to get back in the business if you lose the job the temptation to cheat is extreme\nBut you have these kids that are kind of showing their stuff in this amateur basketball kind of network and the street runners sort of pre agents that build relationships and hope to steer them to universities assistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government is charged in this case that we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities there is another really creepy part of the story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges [noise]\nBut then in some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players already in college to a certain financial advisor at the St runner has a relationship with what's going on there\nWell that's exactly right and I and I think that's the most insidious part of this so in the federal government's case there have been several assistant coaches charged with taking bribes from these runners or go betweens\nOn the grass roots circuit and the attempt of the bribe is to say okay you already have this player he's headed to the pros send them to me I Want to manage his money when he becomes a pro you know put him in my lap\n[noise] All right so if you're a financial advisor at ... this is what you do and you managed to have ... in some way or another and get an NBA player as your client what's it worth to you\nAnd NBA player over the course of a ten year career can easily make a hundred million dollars or more so if you're an agent and get two or three percent of that salary that adds up to a lot if you have five or ten of those players that\nAdds up to a whole lot if you were quote managing the money of one of these players\nI don't know what that might add up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting what a money manager might make there's a lot you're dealing in tens of millions of dollars\nIf I were a future NBA player or I were the family of a future NBA player I don't think that I Would necessarily send my kid to somebody who specializes in managing the money of sports stars\nBut there is an ecosystem of people who serve professional athletes\nManage their money or if you get traded there are specialists who will set you up in a new city they will go to private schools and figure out what private school your child should go to they\nWill find you designer for your new house and an interior designer\nSo sports is a very insular business and a lot of the players want to deal with known quantities and part of this is there's the money manager he manages NBA players money\nSo the game is to become one of those guys and then they have one of these go betweens set you up with\nA with players\n... new book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball after a

recruiting scandal in college basketball\nLast year a federal grand jury charged ten men in the case and the first three to be tried were convicted yesterday Pitino was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal\nWhen these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news were people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on\n\nAbsolutely were not shocked what the FBI did was put names and faces too\nWhat's going on but there was an element of shock and what that was was\nThat the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing parents and coaches and players into interrogation rooms as opposed to the NC double a if you're in college basketball\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double a it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be visited by the FBI and maybe looking at prison time that was a shock\n... and has it had a major effect on college basketball program some in Louisville certainly was turned upside down they lost their coach what about others\nI think overall it has not yet had a big impact on college basketball\nYou know I mentioned that they do well and a fantasy land and part of that just involves putting your head in the sand so the one of the most prominent coaches in college basketball the legendary Mike ... coach K of Duke was quoted as saying\nThis is a blip this is nothing you know this trial is nothing um it's a small sliver of what really goes on well nobody believes that but\nThe fact that coach K set it gives you an indication of the sort of institutional reaction to to what has gone on and\nA determination to sort of try to get past this without really changing anything\nYou know you're right that the question in the criminal case is whether this conduct violated federal criminal statutes but what what's really at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of the whole structure of college sports explain what you mean\nWhat kind of sports does not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars\nAnd it doesn't pay and at a certain juncture that's just not defensible maybe when the money was a little less you could say okay they're getting their scholarships now you've got players generating ten and twenty and thirty and forty million dollars for a particular programs and they're not\nReal students their loyalty and their their responsibility is to their teen first which takes up forty or fifty or sixty hours a week\nAnd you're not paying them you know you were you were having their elders just spread the money around and they're not all by the way going into pro basketball or pro football some of them are just moving through not necessarily getting a degree\nComing out with some injuries and yet the NC double a persists in the midst of the student athlete when everyone knows that if anything it's the athletes student you know the the athlete is what you're there for\nThem to come back to one thing you said earlier um you said a lot of people knew that that shady things were going on and that there was a risk of running afoul of and see a regulations it as a whole new game if you have the FBI asking questions do you think that'll make a difference in the future\nDo think it will make some difference but I think that difference will be\nJust in the way that people\nConduct possibly criminal activity I think people will be more careful you're already heard these people you know on the recordings that the FBI took them you know talking about you know we have to do this and some underhanded ways we have to get it out of certain accounts so they knew they were engaged in criminal\nI think they'll become more careful sunny the ... the former Nike\nExecutive the godfather of the grass roots circuit he told me these people forgot where the boundaries where you know they got too greedy you also saddened by the way you never do this kind of stuff on the telephone so there's an element of all of this that makes\nThis look like just common criminal activity it makes the three shoe companies seem like crime families on the on the ... circuit so to the extent that oh this is true and I think it is whether it's criminal we don't know\nIt will continue to go on because there's too much incentive for it to go on I certainly think with the FBI on that case people would become much more careful\nAnd just so we covered this I mean ... you said that in some respects shooting apparel companies look pretty bad in this what do they say about their role in in college recruitment in these charges\nThe apparel companies have been very quiet they've put out sort of vanilla statements that this is not what we do um but they've been very very quiet\nThere is a Adidas executive who is one of the three current defendants his name is James ghetto he's being represented by\nA lawyer hired by Adidas and if I like James ghetto who ... executive his father was a high school coach\nHe's an insider he's a basketball inside or\nAlmost all of these defendants are well liked well known insiders they're not people who operated you know outside the system I think one of the scariest things for people in the basketball industry to the extent that that they are alarmed is\nThese people were them they were family they were part of the basketball fraternity and Adidas\nAnd Under Armour and Nike are part of the corporate basketball fraternity and I don't think they are planning on much to change either if they can help it\nMichael ... thanks so much for speaking with us thank you it's great to be on with you\nMichael ... new book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball\nWe spoke yesterday later in the day in the first of three trials which sprang from an FBI investigation a federal jury convicted three men of conspiring to steer cash
