rushing conceptual artist political activist and founder of the art collective Pussy Riot ...\nShe joined in conversation by writer and musicians Sarah market [noise]\nAnd now joined Maggie grab Meyer onstage at\nThe Jaycee the EFF staff as she introduces ... and Sarah market [noise]\nArtist in political activists Nadia ... is founder of the Russian our collective Pussy Riot which has emerged as\n[noise]\nIn two thousand twelve Nadia was sentenced to two years imprisonment in a Siberian labor camp following an anti student performance by Pussy Riot in Moscow\nSince her release she's remained vocal advocate for worldwide social justice speaking against corruption and injustice her protests actions include jumping over barbed wire kissing police officers giving gorilla performances in crowded subway cars and going on a hunger strike to protest the abuse of prisoners\n... new book read in riot Pussy Riot guide to activism outlines or ten rules for revolution including things like be a pirate take back the joy and make your government pan [noise]\n\nWith the rise work is vitally important especially today and teaching us new ways to speak up against injustice and make political action exciting ... joined tonight by right girl historian and activists Sarah Marcus ... is the author of girls to different the true story of the right girl revolution a definitive history I mean Ninety funk feminist movement\nIf we want warm welcome from the audience silicon Tacoma and fair market [noise]\n\n\nAlone I think it's becoming\nYeah thank you for coming I'm at the time\nOf your arrest and trial in a two thousand twelve I was at the time I'm traveling around a fair bit talking about right girl and suddenly at my events everybody was really excited to talk about Pussy Riot your feminist punk performance collective uh came as an indicator that the feminist punk\nCould be useful and even influential to people decades later and a half a world away it was an encouraging reminder that when people set out to do something original visionary and prophetic\nAs the radicals in the nineties had the landscape of effects and after effect can never be fully accounted for an advance let alone mapped out you make something you respond to your own time and place\nAnd it travels and we use you never anticipated and I think that's also plainly been true of the work that you've done over the past several years hopefully [laughter]\nAnd I'm In twenty twelve Americans looked at a Pussy Riot and rallied to your defense you're abominable treatment and the courts and in prison was for many Americans are first occasion for paying closer attention to the repressive conditions that held sway in Russia\nAnd things have changed a little since two thousand twelve I'm here in the U.S and so without pain just a little [laughter]\nUm we don't painting overly broad equivalent says between our two countries that it's safe to say that\nWe now in the United states are living under an ultra nationalist ruler with autocratic aspirations however [noise] um [noise] dot dot dot a\nWho openly reviewers your president to gin and seeing [laughter] interests jags were talking about all the credits\nNo real real an aspiring yeah and um and I was just going to say that while the um well and we'll ... we'll get into talking about president is more a as we as we talk but [noise] um well the injustice\nOf our prison system here is generally more about the organizer oppression of black and brown people than it is about show trials for political dissidents as in Russia we are right now seeing a troubling rising the demonization of activist with feminist protesters being characterized as hired guns and angry\nMobs [noise] um so all of which to say that if Pussy Riot began by taking inspiration from us feminists\nI suspect that many of the people in this room tonight\nAre here in hopes of taking inspiration and insight from\n\n\nYou and the people that you collaborate with have been opposing unaccountable cynical truth destroying strongman regime for much longer than we have [noise]\nI usually have some insight\nAnd thoughts on strategy to offer as well as just reflections on where the journey has led\nYou so far anyway much much of this is contained in your galvanizing new book read and riots has your guide to activism and I and I suspect everyone here looks forward to discussing and perhaps whoever's calling right now wants to be on it\nUm we're looking for discussing it with you in person here thank you so much for coming\n[noise]\nSo um\nStart a toward the beginning of things your work uh wasn't widely known especially not in the U.S until you're asked for performing your punk prayer at the cathedral Christ the savior in Moscow which suddenly brought\nInternational attention to Pussy Riot what do you think it was about that action that sparked so much love and support internationally and in the U.S\n[noise] [noise] so my parents and injure is like the mid ... in this way [noise] um [noise] you know I I I don't have a good answer to this question but I like we've we discussed it up is a bit of a in a U.S um\nFor ... they're not the last political prisoners in a Russia [noise]\nBut um [noise] aside from medical ski who doesn't the um got as much attention as we got 'em all the great um\nI think unfortunately ah um people didn't pay much attention to the political prisoners in Russia but um he brought us to conclusion that maybe the deal\nIs a an art and uh that's I'm just making your own life so now knowing people ask me here in America\nLike what what what's a bunch of it too I I think\nAh that the answer is art and that's the reason why our message resonated and people all across the world especially when western world\nBecause you didn't have to know a Russian language you know just to understand what what are we doing because of the picture of all goes to send the flag on their heads where\nI'm surrounded by all this folic um 'cause the drill on things you know it it it's it's pretty straightforward or you know our\nPunk prayer in church like quarter when we were doing this kicks up with\nOur legs and and then just to get her would come to us and ... Luke I can see your underwear do think it's all ... underwear and my mother was really a monster was will be peace but I'm just to get it trying to just ...\nBut um yeah uh so\nAt the time I had no idea how to stick in English like I learned English out later but you know I think that when you use language of ours who don't really have to ... and other languages\nSo it's like you know a puzzles of Christ um they didn't learn many languages but in fact may be um [noise] they learn just one language and it's what's art\n... I'm not comparing\nOurselves [laughter]\n'cause it was the thing and how do you remember Ford trial we would crude cries and exposure nice and then the state of ski and um and then um you know people who were ... just a really just compare themselves with separatists [laughter] no no just clothing [laughter]\nRight that this was actually something that's so striking throughout your new book is that you're you're constantly placing your thoughts and your art in conversation with thinkers from uh from ancient Greece at two up through fruit co up through contemporary Russian dissidents and in fact a\nAnd um their reasoning was pretty clear in ... because I was the one the one person who had lawyers and the access to media\nYou're listening to Russian conceptual artist political activist and founder of the art collective Pussy Riot ...\nWhose new book is read and riot a Pussy Riot guide to activism she's joined in conversation by Sarah markets on Dina a series featuring creative voices from the Jewish community center of San Francisco [noise]\nBeing is also available as a podcast and you can find it at K. A. L. W. dot org [noise]\n[noise] ... really sad story about um women in Russian prisons that for some reason or\nThey are much less supported than men in Russian presence is wrestling women they tend to stay with their husbands and even when they are in prison but it doesn't work other way around um husband a will\nLeave and woman shovel a find ourselves in prison so sometimes her ... parents are still alive I'm going to support her but I'm just little like maybe ten percent of women that get some support from the outside [noise]\nAnd the reason why they end up in a prison there was a it is our were on drugs because we have our own where drugs and you can end up in prison just because you have a few grams of lead in the pocket\nOr or\nDomestic close because we didn't have any specific ... a law against a domestic violence and the Russians will we don't think the domestic violence actually something that you um you should consider seriously\nSo when a woman close to the police and say that I'm I'm about to be beaten ... I was bitten\nThe nursing homes just cause when do you will be killed and then we'll continue and didn't get to murder\nBecause that's something that may or we may be interested in a theater and a ... case that happened to me since the um it became really a\nBig gun pop older because I'm conversation on this woman was recorded um\n[noise] and I mean there are many many cases that just not a vegetarian and then then the recorded says so despite with stick look them they're not that shocking [noise] is that you know when the policemen killed somebody and somebody's making veto of it is just the same sets thirty so she calls\nAnd please come here because I'm about to get killed ... people killed me and the woman police policemen on on the phone she was like oh I was going to define ill defined ... he's a ... and a off for half an hour\nShe's killed right ah and yeah\nSo women end up uh in prisons as they decided to defend themselves right\nThey heard people who'll be big down for dozens of years and um [noise] yeah\nSo after [laughter] after I heard oldest are is a I decided to go on hunger strike and I started a hunger strike was demands\nTo um make a president work they shuttered from six to nine hours a day to eight hours a day and the two\nKey prisoners real the right to complain about what's going on in prison was dealt a cure to be punished for that\nI Know it's quite a daily sick but\n[laughter] if there was nine to ... [noise]\nHow can\nThat I was referred to as like they were quite scared of this hunger strike I was transported from a central Russia to Siberia and for one month nobody's heard of me and I'm not my reality some media the nine lawyers they didn't know where I Am if I if I'm Still alive [laughter]\nBut uh it was actually interesting time for me because of what I learned from that is that you shoot a show she's to the system that wants to wants to press youth you should be loud he should be angry should protest because before\nUm prison system treated me I'm just you know the prison really terribly because I didn't I didn't show my fingers that is why this thought that um week mhm\nI was thinking that I Will not be angry and that's my power in getting angry but the thing is that when somebody has power over you they will not leasing they will not look at your own yeah I'm proud and I'm proud and I'm called it they just didn't work in didn't work so at the point when I started\nTo actively resists they started to respects me ... and they would even do to listings like buy food like order food from the restaurant and bring to me a while and all I was still in prison because they were scared\nThat our right to complain about their prison ... inch idealism point like for the last two months I found myself just lie on the bed a [laughter]\nI was reading through your goal and um I I was around food the grapes and melons [laughter]\nI was like I\nOwe and I'm jeans and a on and on and I wanted to make a giant picture and took it then that that will have everything from ... floor of his crafts\nBecause they were really scared that start complaining and put them up for this position where did you want them to be right because people you were because\nPeople are actually I'm paying attention to what you said and and you were able to draw attention to the conditions there um and so then and that was a power that you that you had\nFrom the moment that you became incarcerated but that you only began to use when you stop trying to follow the rules\nYeah that's that's a big ...\nBut the thing that I should follow the rules and even I other punk and that was arrested I 'cause I was thinking about myself with the rebels Jill I like it's deeply inside us like I should be a good ... ...\nAnd when you know the big men\nPrison warden told view like [noise] your your behaving bad and the ... yeah I'm ... I'm following the law and you don't realize at that point that actually they use the law to oppress cue and\nYou shouldn't care that much about the law they're law in in this instance when it's just\nUm [noise] I\nMean it's the magic seek that they used to kill you basically\nI mean you mentioned anger and um they're angers a lot\nIn the public discussion about politics right now and specifically around feminism and there's\nThere's anger that's coming up but then it's also being used um against feminists saying oh there's angry mobs and we're going to you know things so much for coming out and being this angry mob and now we're going to use this to the right the the right wing is saying you know\nThis is the best thing the Democrats have handed us this fantastic tool to\nLike to win in the midterms because the feminists are being this angry mob and nobody likes that and um I I guess we'll we'll find out in a couple of weeks but how true that is or whether it's just um another attempt to sort of like Seamus back and to not being angry but I've been thinking about this anger thing and I'm curious about it because\n[noise]\n... like anger can expressing anger can as as the story you just told us like get you things and get you um make people take you seriously as someone to be reckoned with 'em\nAnd at the same time there's if I ... I keep wondering like but isn't there a way in which being consumed\nBy angers sort of also shuts you down or or burns you out from the inside and I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the what on\nWhat your experience of anger has and [laughter]\nOh okay um so you should um\nYou should cook your anger in Raceway [noise]\nBecause I'm coming back to that story and it wasn't just anger it was anger\nPlus organizing plus like activists and political recognizing structuring on and I'm a shape preparing infrastructure you've heard this anger to be under the food and to be um articulate it and it's\nReally important to make this public relations effort when you're angry you can kind of just screamed so it's always like you wanna you want to be heard you want to be understood but at the same time we want to express emotions so it's like\nIt's a mixture it's as if it's an act the salad so we\nMaybe two or three big cities but\nWhat is like you know you you know the change is coming when you see that\nPeople even in small potential citizen in countryside disturbed to question whether our part is um corrupt during the day and they started doing it and um minors school teachers um labor unions\nIs all happening and you don't hear about it a lot but yet we were trying to make a list and everything and monitoring what's going on that's fantastic [laughter]\n[noise] this is Tina KLW series featuring artists and thinkers who spoke and at the Jewish community center of San Francisco\nToday's gas is Russian conceptual artist political activist and founder of the art collective Pussy Riot\n... whose new book is read and riot a Pussy Riot guide to activism\nShe joined in conversation by Sarah Marcus\nBean a is also available as a podcast and you can find it at KLW dot org\n[noise] so and the one hand you're involved with these NGOs that you started on the other hand you continue to make art and make music or these ... how do you see the connection between these two zones of action and you're like ... [laughter]\nI mean [laughter] mhm\n[noise] I never separated um when I was I was like sixteen or Seventeen\nI always uh replied and a question like what is more important artist politics out of the it's the same for the art and politics there they're equal and I think just I'm just trying to be\nTruthful at this to myself and um yeah maintain those secured in my life and uh they're interconnected and most of 'em were inspired by um meat is on it and done the\nMusic video boats I'm president Peter ... who's known 'em\nSo yeah he's he's supposed to he's supposed to go after all the criminals in Russia but it turned out some point or that he's the main criminal 'cause he killed people in order to get their property and ... and I'll just get the factories and give give it away to his sons [noise]\nAnd uh so we were writing about it and meters on it and then I was just a ... motion only\n[noise] um heard this thirties and I decided to make this a ... music video where um people are being tortured\nBy um [noise] us in a ... right\nSo so that video is made under the name of the riot and several others many others that we can\nSee online including make America great again as you mentioned um\nBut who who or what is the riot now who's in it or is it a a is it a flowing concept mhm is anybody opposed the right is there a a collective\nStarting anybody starts [laughter] not only six really we can Stein's thing like you know that it's it's not it's not there is no one definition of\nThe threat like you can and should really family resemblance staying and\nYou can start your own proceed right and you can start your own threat and then nobody really in control of of it but [noise] just historically\nI'm among\nPeople who are motivated to nose of doing something under the name of the ... are people who were in the beginning of this group like I\n[noise] I Would really be happy if somebody else would come and view to really accept fall under the name of ... right now but for some reason or it happens that the ...\nMuch either cannot and up through the ... river and the roots of a procedure right they are I'm\nMaking the most I didn't know visible projects but at the same time you know sometimes I or\nMake other fish red and embrace it could come to the country and then the being approached by a group of people mostly women and they said we started a branch of ... and our town and um some testicles it's it was a bit of\nGold from the way the beginning [noise] um we wanted to create a movement that's why we didn't want to show our faces\nAnd ah eventually our faces for um opened when we ended up in court because it was really hard to uh keep masks when you when you're in court because they just take it away from us\nRight [laughter] and he was actually the biggest problem for me at you know the first two weeks if my ... because I was thinking now that much about myself but about a A R identity was revealed [noise]\n'cause I didn't believe actually there's this for a long time I I Believe as a subject maybe we'll spend in prison for months and\nSo my biggest concern was identity and we were mentioning bright new future was lots of uh you know hundreds of women in different cities all around Russia in this colorful masks\nAnd and and so\nOur is part of what you're saying that you think that um\nThat that got a little bit um\nThat to actually come about because at this crucial moment in the in the history of the group suddenly these three members were instead of like it could be anybody could be you you don't know who this is it was like oh actually it's an audio ...\nAnd ... and that that you can put a brace on on the possible proliferation of masked Pussy Riot squads\nIt didn't it actually caused probably you sell some of them I ... I was in prison I was just getting photos from it is included in American cities of um actors who call themselves but you're right and dancing or in\nAnd just be nice and so it happens but obviously the nature of it changed when our dentistry revealed definitely [noise] and um when everyone who to repeal it and well as a matter of fact ah we wanted to um [noise]\nAnd our personal involvement in this project I'm like in a year so the the lot of this project shouldn't be longer than a year and then we\nWe had to be in prison for two years and uh I I couldn't say that go on the ... ... it didn't sound like me trying to and that means being [noise]\nA week or trying to keep from\nWhat I've done which wasn't\n... check the the points so we kept saying that fear is that right and we want to cut out of jail always trying to do it again I think no actually like since it's my face and not the threat\nAnd more some they they started to call me and wash a expert ... which was even worse it's\nLike [laughter]\nLike you know you can be an ex life skills or something but it's just [laughter]\nIt's so cheesy and so terrible in some something from like entertainment mainstream industry so we decided like real ... [laughter]\nSo now is just part of her name sick more Lakers or name [laughter]\n\nWhat's next for you artistically creatively this book has come out um are there more videos more songs in the works

welcome you to be now KLW program featuring creative voices from the Jaycee fiesta [noise]\nIn this series we bring you remarkable artists and thinkers to come to speak at the Jaycee CSS as part of our arts and ideas program\nOn this edition of being at our guests are ... world renowned chef and co owner of no my in Copenhagen and David Silver director of the new fermentation lab\nAnd now joined me onstage at the J CCF as I introduced her ... and David filter [noise]\nI'm so excited to be hosting ... and David Dilbert tonight\nThey're working their butts in him a guide to fermentation had such an impact on me and my whole team that we were inspired to frame our entire fall season around the idea of fermenting change\nOur programmers and educators were struck by the fact that fermentation is by its nature transform it if you take an agricultural product and through microbial action it's turned into something wholly different uh an irritation of what it once was\nAnd the timing for this event also coincides with the Jewish new year just started a new year which began over a month ago a time for reflecting on how we might make real change in our own lives\nJust like the philosophies of tonight's gas Jewish tradition appreciate the extraordinary in ordinary and that the applied wisdom of the physical world can teach us something very deep about our own lives\nSo deeply moved by all of this we have focused on hosting change makers and many different worlds a season yes of course the ... but also change makers and other spheres artistic political social including Pussy Riot founder an audio until the ... parents creator Joe Sala way and many more\nAnd with that we're thrilled to welcome or ... and David Silver to San Francisco tonight Renee is of course chef owner of no man Copenhagen which has four times been recognized as the world's best restaurant and David is the director of NOAA's fermentation lab they are here this evening to show us why fermentation is both the driving force and the soul of ...\n[noise]\n[noise] my name is run to reject the thank you for being here\nFrom attention to us at the restaurant has become ... the blood line for us but I Want to tell you just a little bit about how this all started\nA how fermentation entered the lack of no my daughter to understand that\nWe probably need to go back into the beginning of DOMA so DOMA is fifty years old this year ah it opened in November twenty three of two thousand and three I was twenty five years old and\nAnd you know we're planning this for more than a year and we saw let's open up and let's focus on local ingredients and um you know saying that Fifteen Years later\nAlmost doesn't make sense to talk about how different that was back then in Copenhagen Fifteen Years ago who can remember how life was what how the world was Fifteen Years ago ... years ago you could smoke in every restaurant Fifteen Years ago there was no Instagram [laughter] a life for so much better back then of course [noise]\nUm but back then in in in Scandinavia is you know it was a just a wild thing to say let's focus on local food stuff\nUh and so there was a cold winter and then we try to do menus and it was like wow we may have we may have made a mistake here [laughter] you know a ... is it going to be a is our life can consist of onions and beats and and kale ah for for the rest of our lives\nBut what happened then was that in ... desperation you started actually investigating things that\nNobody had ever told you to investigate before including school we started reading books that nobody had ever showed you before and uh well into her life came things like the idea of forging the wilderness what is a season what the season I let you mean\nUm we learned about the this idea of preservation we understood that we are from a cold climate region and our ancestors they really had to preserve in order to survive the cold winters\nBut what we did first of course was that we um we stepped into into the wild uh fall and spring it was about march in two thousand and four or early spring for us um the ... or ...\nAnd and we found ourselves or you know in a well these are on the shoreline in a forest trying to look for all these things that we've been reading about and at one point there was a pivotal moment\nThat uh it was mentioned because it's truly laid the foundation to a restaurant and it was on a on a beach uh and I mean you guys from California and ... [noise]\nWell how can I say this I mean our beaches are not California beaches you have to imagine a beach full of rocks there's lots of reckoning seaweed is seaweed all over nasty biting flies and of course a lot of greenery\nLots of of a fresh seaweed so we're walking into this a space and\nOur feet to sort of stopping into this a knee deep in in in the rock name seaweed and then we find this patch of green intuitively you're drawn to it we go there we snap this ah this greenery\nAnd it you know cracks like when you when you cut into a watermelon and we bite into it it looks like a ... a little thicker than a child and then the flavor hits us and it was a flavor of coriander\nAnd again going back Fifteen Years ago coriander to you guys hear you're such a diverse community and and you know you have Mexican nearby coriander probably all of your cilantro as your caller here\nThat's probably a common place but Fifteen Years ago there was one of the most exotic things in Denmark it really was it's hard to imagine but it it truly truly was you just never got it and most people if they had they thought it was like soapy no don't give me that if these exotic thing\nAnd certainly we were in the cold north\nAnd you know up a few months before that it was all beats and onions and suddenly we're chasing coriander from a beach plan\nAnd it was a pivotal moment in which it was like you know wow what else is there that was sort of thinking and then we really went full on and we wanted everything and we were so enthusiastic because nobody ever told us about this as a cook including her school you learn techniques of sorts\nThat type of clothing their cooking and so we discovered you know you can actually each trees beyond the sap or if you how's the pine cones in their first season they can be so delicious they can have the same picture as a toughie as a colonel toffee\nYou can similar some of them and sugar and they become these perfect candies\nYou can solve some of them and they turn into our lives\nBut the tastes like forest it was like a complete revelation for us this wilderness\nWithout a force quickly we started also wanting to have\nThis wilderness er into the next season and into the next season and and we were specifically looking for having it in the winter uh so we could\nSpice up the beats something wouldn't it be nice to have slices of salted a pine cone without beets\nUm and then we started dabbling into a\n... at first called preservation or ... I think we call it the pickling cuisine at first I liked to have labels for things and so that label I think we call it first was pickling and then of course as we dabble interred we started reading and reading more and more and you start investigating you figure out wow\nThere's a a a whole world is ... out there um there's people doing it in very sophisticated ways and have been doing it so for centuries we started to learn from everyone we started to travel or and it grew and grew and grew and grew in us until a I'm a very certain\nMoment where we were playing around with sauerkraut I don't know if you have cemented anything but sauerkraut it's kinda like the first level of a of a\nA fermentation I mean it's an every single for imitation book that's already out there it's the one thing that most people know\nOr that's fermented cabbage\nAnd so as we are dabbling into this we started reading about the science of affirmative action actually which proved to be incredibly useful for us\nBecause then we could figure out what what is actually that goes on and then you didn't you stopped seeing ingredients you just saw a component of it and they realize that can take the salt and I can put other things into it and and the lactic acid fermentation will happen\nAnd so we did that with the goose ferries\nAnd um one day or one of the cooks are it's a a longest standing cook in the kitchen he's been with us for eleven years\nAnd he comes to me any ... presents me this or ... or the spoon with is murky liquid in and he says taste issues and you know it's like most things or if I meant it it's not really Instagram friendly I'm [laughter]\n... world renowned chef and co owner of now my in Copenhagen and David filter director thing now my fermentation lap whose new book is the ... guide to fermentation on Dina series featuring creative license from the Jewish community center in San Francisco\nBeing that it's often the Alamo as a podcast and you can find it at ... dot org [noise]\n[noise] and so uh so we decided to build a lab and at first it was a old shipping containers are bought cheap and we went to a key and bought the second cheapest a kitchen and ikea um\nAnd we just built it together and and we read some books and suddenly we had this lab a but it was a it was a big moment where we said we have a kitchen we're going to take the idea of ... out of the kitchen and make its in its own complete\nSection with his own team and they do nothing but just that we need to exhilarated here and of course doing that so in doing so if you have the right people doing it it will make things explode\nAnd since then it's only gone up a for us and that ... leaves me with the idea of this book here because\nI'm\nAs we're developing all this as this was becoming really truly the DNA of who we who we are as a restaurant\nIt is for us today are completely impossible to have a flavor DOMA in any season and not have anything fermented it's much more easy not having anything forged in it a fermentation heavy clips forging a long time ago for us\nThe main pillar um and\nI actually believe in this quite a lot that this is a way to make a cooking easier or it is for us it has fueled or creativity again I always say that ah before um fermentation we had like a handful of legos\nWhen the fermentation came into a world we had a basket full and all these leg goes up to us to and I'll learn how to play with them and figure out how to build with him but truly um it is or something that is transformed or a restaurant\nUm and we have more than a hundred different things that we have developed a in in the over the years\nThey won't be recipe that for instance another sauerkraut recipient is what I'm because we wanted to try to be true to to what a restaurant is and we also for the first I Want to do a book that people could actually use at home or to open up and cook from\nUm as we're planning this book it dawned on me that had never ever ever heard anyone say hey a coup that dish from your from one of your last book [noise]\nOne has a finger up here [laughter] which one [laughter]\nWell I'm a crazy [laughter]\nUm yeah so so um [noise] so that has now become this book and and as you will see there's a as you can see in the book there is a different name than myself or on the cover and ah it's ah Mr David Silber he's from\nCanada or the Canadian over here [laughter]\nUm and\nUm and he's going to come up here on on the stage and who's going to introduce some more about what is that we do because he is a specialist and ah I'm not a specialist in the way that he is a specialist he is truly truly truly\nSpecialist in this field and ... I Am just a little insect uh in comparison to to what he knows\nIt is also a the first time the ... ah is stepping onto the stage so to speak on this journey here he is in our kitchen normally a big part of our kitchen but\nNow he's stepping onto the stage or this is the third event that we do on a tour here um but um it is still only the first time that he's really trying and so please be can be very kind to him when he comes\nWhen it comes on stage for now and ah and also a take pictures of him because I think you're going to be hearing a lot from David ... in the future if he's going to be one of the greatest I don't believe that to please welcome the David Silver [noise]\nSo [noise]\nWhy do we prevent oh we from it because the juicy part of a friend for so much better when it's ... with crunchy sauerkraut we prevent because a cold effervescent kombucha is incredibly refreshing on a hot summer day we prevent because me so soup\nWarns our souls and the winter we for men because ... cheese right Mina Gratz luxurious champagne and crunchy sourdough bread or all\nDelicious\nNow all these things and hundreds more are white people from it today but if we really want to get to the crux of the matter we have to go back in time and ask why people started fermenting in the first place\n[noise] now\nPre history human beings have strive to make food last in our age in days as hunter gatherers a thousand calories of energy spent looking for food in the field would yield about a thousand calories a food upon a return to cap it was actually quite hard work to stay alive\nSo it's no wonder then that about ten thousand years ago all over the world independently of each other cultures began to make the switch to agriculture\nThe domestication of different crops like rice Mays soybeans barley weep sorghum\nFuels humanity like forging number could these were calorie protein nutrient rich plants that we teams intended to [noise]\nWas the fact that the crops that we were growing or seller of all\nThese were seeds impulses and grains that we can dry in store for use it a later date when nutrition was more scarce in effect we finally found a way to make food last we could make caloric surpluses but not all foods can be treated this way\nWhat about leafy greens or fruits and vegetables or the meats and milk of the animals we hunted are herded how can we keep those foods from going off\nIf agriculture revolutionized human survival then fermentation stepped up\nTo be the next step in that revolution we discovered that\nA bit of unseen help and some salt one a long way to keeping those foods around longer\nBit by bit accident by accident our ancestors discovered that they could actually kind of steer these processes they could\nHave some modicum of control over them and make the things they wanted to make turn grape juice into why take fish from the ocean turn that into their sauce turn cabbage is into Kim chi\nFermentation provided humans with the means to hold onto foods that would undeniably spoil if I'm treated\nNow our scientific understanding of fermentation has increased exponentially in recent history the entire field of microbiology is only been around for a bit more than a hundred years meanwhile fermentation has been serving mankind for millennia and millennia go\nWe can never really know what was going on in the minds of our ancestors but we know that when they tasted about a boiling\nOr bubbling juice or or moldy beings they enjoyed it and we know that because we still do it today is the ferment are living artifacts these are processes that echo through time\nThey're handed down from generation to generation through hands both human and microbial\nUnbeknown store ancestors they were ... with the unseen agency fermentation microbes and to this day we still are\nSo it begs the question\nWhat actually is happening in that crop of plant matter as it's transformed in your kitchen counter over the course of weeks you appear in and see a change well it varies from protest to process but the gist of it is this microbes microorganisms works to break down organic matter in doing so they garner useful chemical energy\nTo fuel their own life cycles and multiply and then leave something else behind in the process the something else gets left behind is often an exclusionary chemical [noise] think about it lactic acid bacteria citric acid by certain fun guy or alcohol by these these are chemicals\nThat have been designed to blindly by evolution to eke out the competition and make these environments safe for the microbes to produce them or by the microbes that produce them in them alone or so they think\nThe hopes that maybe some view will\nCatch that kind of magic spark and you know tell us about it and that will spur us on even more\nThat's the beauty of\nOf this everything we've done in the restaurant has always been in the pursuit of flavor we can't stress that enough\nThat these things will completely change the way you cook\nBattle in tights you to keep doing it and get you hooked try just a couple of recipes and you want to do more\nThey sent me now KLW series featuring artists and thinkers spoken at the Jewish community center in San Francisco\nToday's guests are David sapping world renowned chef and co owner of now my in Copenhagen I'm David shelter director of that now my fermentation Rob\n... new book is now my guide to fermentation [noise]\nBeing as often as annabelle as a podcast and you can find it at ... dot org [noise]\nNow us telling you all this might just seemed like another but on the bandwagon yes that whole foods pile is already there\nIt ... it is fair to say that fermentation is trendy than ever but I don't think at all it's fair to talk about something that's been so essential to human existence for so long is experiencing a trend and that's because I really\nTruly believe that fermentation today is experiencing an understanding\nI guess that it might seem scary but we try and guide you through it in this book we try and explain the principles because the principals are far more important than one hundred and one recipes for sauerkraut\nThe principles will lead you for its discoveries even your own home kitchens\nEven once you get that far it's not enough to just make these events and have them around we want you to actually put them to good use something that she has and I definitely discuss when we were planning this book is the fact that most fermentation books out there will give you one hundred and one recipe\nHow do you incorporate this magical amazing thing into your everyday life\nSo we guide you through it again just giving you very off the coast recipes of what we do when we take for men's home from a well\nThat's the beauty of it\nAnd I uh for me though I Would say if you're going to put this into use in a ... I mean you really showed\nUm\nI'd like to say that for him and for many fermenting people that some of the coolest people in the world [noise]\nI mean [noise]\nBeing a mentor that something\nIt is it is a big community it's a ... and it's a community of people that share I mean that's it's pretty amazing\nAnd it's like really ultra like or if you think those are ... with the no I don't know sugar in the coffee or a or annoying try talking about ... mother is a\nWay that was for mentors um but they they share everything um and um and in this book we we actually put in everything that we got that we think is special even though that some of them we've been working at for proof\nTen years some of it some of it five years\nUm and if I could hope for one thing is that all of you go and you attack and and you find one thing that you can't live without that you keep producing um some of some of them will be easy and others will be more difficult but say the chicken ... it's one of the best things that I've had\nI mean it's simply perfect\nAs a as a condiment on your kitchen show and the ones who was thought experimented on how to build further can make a spicy one as it's brewing just put a little bit habanero in it and when you have this you know imagine Tabasco that just tastes intensely a roasted chicken\nYou know intensely intensely intensity\nAnd pure clean and then with a hit a spice so that's one that I could would recommend you guys um\nTo start with because I Know that it's it's it's a it's going to be amazing um and one of the things that we're also hoping or actually which is a bit selfish in this sense but um\nYou know the idea that people would go and everybody would start fermenting and there were ... you know not just doing sauerkraut um\nAnd then they would pop up all these ideas on the Internet you know people showing what they were doing and we would learn like that would be something for us with a man these white people in San Francisco [noise]\nThey did this thing my uncle go the Mason\nJars today for breakfast at this coffee ... we actually saw a couple of Chino being served in a Mason jar with a handle on [laughter] that was a that was the first one\nFor me or [laughter]\nBut it's funny when you land in San Francisco you know it's also the first place I've ever seen where it says this is science to the baggage and then there's a yoga room as well as\nYou I think this is the perfect place for fermentation I really [noise]\nI think you guys are going to help\nUs and be better at what we do I'm so pleased ahead and do that and I think it's time for us to um go into a little bit of a Q and a\nUm have you done anything with spend ... was that was spent ... absolutely\nAbsolutely um\nOh yes of course so\nBrew beer and made your warts what's award\nOkay I'll real fast as explain something comes up in the book but\nTo get the sugar out of a grain you have to break down and starts not as the process of molten you take a baby plant you start sprouting it and then it starts producing its own digestive enzymes to break down all the starch and that grant that liberate the sugars and then you roasted to kill the plant in ... sugars\nOnce you have that sweet ... which is ... you put that into water men bring it up slowly to a few successive degrees temperature or an old though sugars leach into your water\nNow that mash can be prevented with these and then you can strain off the liquid get beer\nLeftover matched up wet grains are then totally useful for other things\nWe've made other or we ... them and made vinegars from them um\nBut anywhere you can extract flavor you could totally dry them again and then use them or as like the cracked wheat in a source of soy sauce if you want a you'll you'll start seeing the slots in which they can fit definitely once you once you start getting through the book but there are a lot of places you can do it you can use it rather\n\nThan you know it's not working with ... I Know that's like asking for happening again or I mean\nIt's it's so so so common and it's really a treat when you grow up in Scandinavia because it's such a hearty plant and and it's one of those things that come ah\nIn the very first signs of of real spring and I'm most Danish kids grow up\nWhen they start coming out of the ground that your mother or grandmother will cut them and then you ... they dip and we should be just chew on them actually\nUm but that that's what you do okay [laughter] um but er er\nVinegar is very good with it or it's very good as a quarter you'll which is easy to do um [noise]\nThose are the things that we ... it was too sour\nSweet and then but then we have it as a base for sure or just do like half and half juice like rhubarb is with something else and stuff\nI mean it's it's very traditional and it's the typical for jams and stuff like that um I Love the raw juices a little bit particularly a wind seafood are good when they do if you use them and you can sort of ... seafood in it\nIt's very good that they're welcome\nSo Heather some as Christian and found when she was having a new mom so I'm thinking like how you sound like something comes from Saudi ally during that fermentation fermentation things or just just by something like you just want to do something for people they don't ...\nIt was for people that didn't want to consume alcohol and it basically started almost ten years ago when we first put a juice menu on and a lot of income also because I don't drink very much alcohol myself\nUm [noise] uh and uh\nYou know if you go to restaurants you have this tasting menu and then you also have a wine tasting and and so at first we saw that we did make a mix um whereas a little bit of a juices and wine but\nThen we just made a full menu and they were very simple at first\nIt would be just a cucumber juice with you know a little bit of salt and some men steep in or something like that and that was ten years ago we were a tiny tiny team but today is actually a section of its own yeah like it's a real real a pain in the ass", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Binah", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "25", "locations": [["San

least gets passed and there is no longer the number one I saw that on the country by gala so here's the gala [noise]\nOkay so yeah so I guess my yeah my point is that I'm at the apple is this incredible entity that has this incredibly wide range and we haven't been asking enough of it it can do a lot of different things\nUm it's almost it's like ... it's almost like if you had Robin Williams on your son will cast and he's all I'm just be the straight man I don't do any voices the apple can do all kinds of voices and it's really entertaining when it does so uh I'll talk a little bit about some of the voices they can do\nIt can be mysterious it can be adorable it can be classy\nIt can be sexy it can be surprising like that things surprise and it can be downright freaky\nI our our ancestors two hundred years ago would have totally known that the apple could be all kinds of different things because they actually depended on it to be all kinds of different things\nRight from the early colonial day is the apple was partnering with the colonists to make life on farms a whole lot sweeter than it would have been otherwise not only was it for fresh fruit which is what we tend to associate it with and for baking\nBut it also gave them a source of fruits throughout the year there were certain apples that would come right in June and July\nAnd there are other apples that you would pick them off the tree in November hard as a rock ... there's no way you could have eaten them there were so sour at the time but you put them in your root cellar for three or four months and took him out in the spring\nAnd they would have just started to mellow up and become really nice and develop some interesting flavors that you wouldn't taste and normally in a fresh apple so they really gave them a source of fruit throughout the year\nBut even more than that they also gave him a way to get drunk throughout the year because of the ah\nThe apple until Corning really came along and was grown in significant quantities and ... and I'm beer came along with that the apple was um site or was the a standard typical for everybody man woman and child it was low alcohol maybe four percent alcohol and\nSafer than the water and that was but everybody drank also another one that people don't think about is er vinegar cider vinegar was really important preservative back in the days pre refrigeration so the apple can be all kinds of different things and it typical home said would have grown probably doesn't varieties\nAnd the store I did not want to deal with tons of different apples coming from different places they wanted one apple that they could stock everywhere\nThat would last for months and months and months in storage and what did they come up with\nThe enemy of our story the bad guy the or the evil red empire took over and invited sixties Seventy five percent of the apples growing in America we're red delicious and we all know what they tasted like they they were sold because they are bright red and people bought them\nPeople consistently bought the red or apple over the better tasting apple so that it gave us what we want it or what it looked like we want and\nI think that's very sad why because I I've been arguing for diversity and I tried to think of what would be a good what's a good way to think about what the loss of diversity brings 'cause it's kind of I mean you can get by without a lot of different apples but it's better with a lot of different apples\nThing about Shakespeare we could probably get by if we just had three plays of Shakespeare's that have come down to us King Lear hamlet and you know a light comedy called Honeycrisp or something but isn't that nice that we have thirty seven different sizes Shakespeare's\nIf you are listening to a food writer Raylan Jacobson says buckets apples uncommon character on Dina series featuring creatively says kind of a Jewish community center in San Francisco being that it's also available as a podcast and you can find it at ... dot org\nEven better thing about dogs\nWe could probably get by with three dogs to write if you've got like\nA great Dane a border collie and a toy poodle but everybody gets something pretty close to what they want it might not be exactly what would be the best one for you but everybody's covered\nBut thank goodness there's a lot of sharp pays an Australian sheep dogs out there you know thank goodness there's a a a type of dog that's just right for everybody and hopefully there are are going to be a lot more apples out they're\nEasily accessed and that's happening now because Apple's are extremely patient long lived beings there's nothing for Apple tree to go a hundred years it'll even go to a hundred years just kinda like waiting for us to come to our senses and turn around so there are still apple trees out there\nHundreds of varieties that have been lost to us or nearly lost and all you need to do is find one of those trees and take a few shoots and you can ... shoots and bring that\nVariety back into commercial circulation and that's happened there's a lot of apple collectors out there there's actually some people right in this room who are part of that\nWho have all these apples available apples that are unlike any other ones we tend to taste and grocery stores and stores are starting to come around and be willing to to work with these apple so it's a pretty exciting times what this means is that\nAs heirlooms now have this new or the renaissance that's going on we're going to start seeing Apple's so much better than what we've seen before for certain things all the apples you tend to see out there in a store are desert what's called an industry desert apples they're meant for eating fresh\nThere isn't a single apple out there maybe you could with the exception of Granny Smith\nThat's intended to be a baking specialist but back in the day they were apples that were baking specialists you wouldn't want to get them fresh but they had us firms to them and acidity and flavor that made pies ... better than anything and we see today with with the ... we have to work with\nSo there are on the goals arise somebody today at their mentioned that belt Abbas coup\nAn incredible street all apple from Holland that is turning out more and more farmers markets\nAre there we're going to see some baked apples implies that are truly phenomenal\nSide or two is cool again ... acceptable that for instance the Hudson Valley has seized on it as a way to save their uh orchard culture that they still have because they haven't been able to compete on the commodity market but they're they're going heart into hearts either\nAnd we don't know what is going to happen with side right now the whole side of the world is kind of in the trajectory that the craft beer world was Twenty years ago it's following that same pack straight up like really exploding lately\nSo it's pretty exciting time to to to pay attention to side or because it's wide open because we lost that tradition there are no rules and so everyone is all over the place trying barrel aged fighters flavors that writers and ice fighters\nCan sort of a English draft style fighters cider effort seats that are almost more like a vermouth\nWe don't know what's going to end up being the the right side or are there is not going to be a rights are it's gonna be everything sweet dry ... and that's um I haven't seen a brand new beverage come into being like that not brand new brand new to us\nAlso we don't know what the right apples are going to be for it this is a pretty exciting experiment or that Harris and apple that I mentioned was not quite last we thought it was gone and then a fruit collector guy in the Nineteen eighties found one old tree and New Jersey grafted it\nGave the ah the samplings and the sign would to a few people\nAnd now the first um commercial crops of Harrison in probably a hundred and Twenty years are just coming into fruition a few people are getting Harrison fruit like no one even knew what the fruit would be like so it's ... it's almost as if we lost you know when ... disappeared from\nFrom our our culture and then somebody found one and started growing and um\nYou get to taste the wine for the first time so look for Harris insiders and maybe two years\nThe ... is alive and well not just here but there's a big nonprofit were not being a very tiny nonprofit who's got a a big plan to bring the tipping back and make it the official apple of New York city so they're young fifth injuries planning all over New York city now back to its roots and back to Capitol Hill where where\nTo read growing pippins and making tip insider right where his plantation was\nSo my my point is that uh we're in the second age of the apple and it's going to be a very exciting thing to watch and I hope you all will have a seat at the table and enjoy it [noise] ...\n[noise]\nThank you so much I Know we all have questions and then if you raise your hand outcome to\nCan you graft multiple um ... types onto the same trees for that so you have four ... growing on one tree yeah and actually all the old farms that used to have that it was called the family tree\nAnd usually it would be right in the front yard every branch would be a different variety and you'll see some of the of the collectors they do that today it looks crazy you know like the bottom of the tree will be read apples and then you'll get a stripe of yellow apples and the green apples on top it's really fun to do that actually I've done some of that in my house\nSo you said that\nAll apple tree assert from graft ... not from seats all the apples yeah\nIsn't that an officer um every every grabbing skiing on earth is a clone of that first grabbing steam that was found somewhere in Denmark and the sixteen hundreds\nSo if we take the seeds from our apples it's a whole new we're going to get a phone new variety if it even grow and then you get to name it after yourself cool\nSeriously\nSo what kind of apple would you recommend for Apple cake\nWell do you want from apples and your apple cake or do you want a mushy tender apples\nI think for I don't know I I if I definitely for although ... to make a great apple pie you really want like five different kinds of apples that's the key to a goodbye is some from some sweet some tart one that's a little more gloomy we'd kind of glue everything together\nBut each one's gloomy well randomly seedlings ... somebody's drunk rarely see going out there right hidden star orchard there growing brand new seedlings which is the pie apple in England\nBut like the French like really from apple and their pilots we do but in England brand Lee ... is a really gloomy apple that it kind of breaks down and make some more of a taste so\nWhen you're ... randomly seedlings are already in a couple of years I'd I'd drop one of those but Macintosh actually breaks down pretty well too\nSo when I was a kid in Pennsylvania we used to go out to the country and get golden delicious apples and they were just restaurants the tree and they were wonderful I have no see those apples anymore what happened\n[noise] yeah you uh you know the golden delicious which\nIs now one of those other apple we kind of make fun of what is considered one of the greatest apples that are ever been found when it was considered so good that the nursery like this one farmer discovered it showed it to a local nursery\nThey bought the apple off of him for five thousand dollars and a nine hundred foot plot of land around the apple and they put up an electric cage around it so that nobody could produce field you know to get a graft off of it so they would have a monopoly on the golden delicious and they did they made a million dollars off the apple\nI Can't totally convey it all the things that I've learned on a deeply personal level and then in this kind of um [noise] in a collective sensibility for the type of community we've been able to build\nAround the farm I mean I think to me when I started I think as an adoptee and not growing up in Korean culture um [noise]\nYeah there is this way that in gauging with plans was like the way that I knew how to kind of explore\nMy identity and my sense of place within Korean lineage\nUm and so I Know that in a lot of indigenous languages on this continent like plant roughly translates to a those who take care of us and I feel like that has been my sense of things like growing plants [noise]\nI'm really guided me toward like these connections with different people or it felt resident in a way that I could connect with others within Korean community and I think in the bay especially back Korean community is so diverse um ended in braces and is very accessible for a lot of folks that\nSo I just feel very lucky in that regard\nYou're listening to farmer community organizer and environmental justice advocate Christian leach from now move farm she joined in conversation by secure assembly on Dina a series featuring creatively says from the Jewish community center in San Francisco\nBeing at is also available as a podcast and you can find it at ... dot org [noise]\n[noise] but yeah I sort of reverse\nUm and through learning about plants\nHaving um a context to start with I had to ask questions and I'm\nBeing fairly inch reverted just in general like it was good to kind of have the plans push me towards like needing to be curious no way that made me talk to other human and not be alone on the farm pretty educational plant yeah\nYeah definitely and so I think you know like do he is already sort of resident shopping on the farms are like extremely blessed in that regard\nUm but when I heard that music at our first you saw and\nJust thought I was like oh if my plants can have like a heartbeat that sounds like the way do he plays the strong men my farm is going to be really really healthy\nUm and the thinking about that music and what she explained to everybody is like it led farming be this kind of very vast inexpensive conversation it's like a conversation with these plans and like trying to figure out how to adapt to a different climate scenarios the conversation with a path in his conversation with the future [noise] um\nSo it really does feel like once you get into this weird seed brain you know like everything is connected to seed which makes for very boring happy hour conversation with me sometimes\nBut on the other hand you know if you want to go down a very weird biology worm hold and\nWe're good yeah\nI I'm One of our conversations before this event we talked about you know the story telling that happened ... so you know I'm\nYou know we're both folks of color and even though we come from different parts of the of the ... you know my ancestors brought over many sees you this hour on which help propel an entire industry and said folks for hundreds of years which is now mostly forgotten um\nAnd you know there's a lot lost in that when you don't mind fully cultivate and safe\nSo I was wondering what sort of the stories are locked or fountains do you find yourself wanting to tell or is he needs to be told through the cultivation mhm [noise]\nI mean are the line that we curate their kid is always called second generation beads because it both has this reference to lineage and for folks living in diaspora an immigration\nAnd it also is a very nerdy seed reference because I'm so we like saying second generation is also a nod to just like getting back to our biology that has any sort of reverence for the intelligence of plants and actually taking our cues from them\nAnd so I think that\nUm I'm not like putting my ear to a seed and listening for the story but I Do think that there is a story telling nature to that and when I look at the history of some of the seats that we've collected some of the seeds that we've made it our job to kind of reproducing duplicated like the story that they're telling is one of like\nCenturies of farming that was like\nYou know like didn't require a lot of capital it didn't require a lot of off the farm inputs it was designed around the nature of like things working in a symbiotic way that had a respect for like our place within a natural system\nAnd so you see these seeds they can perform and like these types of very minimal system like subsistence farming systems and the way that they behave in reflects like kind of this relationship\nAnd then I think during the field trials like we see a very different story unfold like what hybrids looked like when they perform and what's the story they want to tell is which is like a story that is hard to compete with who are hard to argue against because farmers are so strapped\nAnd so the type of march and if the outcomes and that kind of control that it offers is very desirable for the way our food\nFind for long term success for farmers and so with returning to airlines is kind of like trying\nTo\nBe like what is the story we want to kind of tell to the future and if these plants are so valuable if there are just plants that we just know we could not live without like we brought all these love letters that people from our normal program on the farm wrote to plants with the Korean diaspora for like oh there's plants that are really significant to Koreans in Korea\nAnd what does that look like and why is there are significant for folks living in diaspora\nAnd we're like let's have you write a love letter to them not just talking about their role in your memories but talking to them as like this you know the president's in your life and thanking them for their struggles because a lot of plants have been cultivated for like ten thousand years\nAnd for some of those plans that means a ten thousand generations of some things um and I think that that sort of given take like felt very compelling to see the way people responded on the farm because\nIt was like the less you're able to objectify something and the more you're just like learn to love it it's like you can never put a dollar amount on that and they can't just be a commodity you know and so I think that that may be one of the parts of the story that we do want to tell on the farm\nI'm so even as a farmer and we're using seat as voice seed to tell a story um you're still working within the constraints um because sometimes those fees for how they get ... states is controlled by industry with a specific agenda\n'em and targeting certain countries in certain um jak spreads for success\nNot to preserve culture heritage but to turn a profit so wondering if you could talk about kind of that tension um and and give us some insight into that and and how the impacts your work as a farmer [noise]\nI mean Korea has been subject to the green revolution very similarly as most places around the globe and so\nYou know kind of starting with Jack ... Japanese colonialism where it's sort of shifted agriculture to be more focused on export\nLeading into kind of the Korean War and Korea being like the top consumer of us are fuss during that time like being billed as like kind of emergency aid and then transitioning to being like a consumer for export and then that\nRelationships still exist to this day to her variety of like free trade agreements and trade liberalization over the past two decades um so when I went to Korea there was the constraints that you speak about like salt so palpable\nBecause we would travel with these seats that we were kind of collecting and talking to other small farmers\nAnd we got the it's like really beautiful sleepy and and\nI was just so struck by like how incredible this was in soil being something that is so maligned you know because of the way that it takes its form currently in our society um\nAnd so we had these beans and we show people and it like everyone really responded oh yeah I remember those beans like oh do you want to grow them and just by and large people just felt like no you should take them because they'll be safer and like you can protect them in the states and it's also sad to just be like oh everyone\nLike remember these things but the incentive for them were just like just not possible given the nature of like how much land is being lost and Korea how much the kind of shift to just being under cut by foreign imports how much labor is shifting to be in the industrial sector\nOr so when you're looking at the kind of bigger landscape politically of like", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Binah", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "11", "locations": [["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Dina", -20.3, 57.58333], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["kinda", 58.01315, 15.73373], ["Holland", 52.25, 5.75], ["New Jersey", 40.72816, -74.07764], ["New York New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Denmark", 56.0, 10.0], ["England", 44.0, -71.0], ["England", 44.0, -71.0], ["Pennsylvania", 39.95233, -75.16379], ["Dina", -20.3, 57.58333], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["Korea", 36.5, 127.75], ["Korea", 36.5, 127.75], ["Korea", 36.5, 127.75], ["Korea", 36.5, 127.75], ["Korea", 36.5, 127.75]], "not_found": [], "ep_coords": ["San Francisco, CA", 37.77493, -122.41942], "in_country": ["America", "San Francisco", "New Jersey", "New York New York", "England", "England", "Pennsylvania", "San Francisco"], "out_country": ["Dina", "kinda", "Holland", "Denmark", "Dina", "Korea", "Korea", "Korea", "Korea", "Korea"], "in_state": ["San Francisco", "San Francisco"], "out_state": ["America", "Dina", "kinda", "Holland", "New Jersey", "New York New York", "Denmark", "England", "England", "Pennsylvania", "Dina", "Korea", "Korea", "Korea", "Korea", "Korea"]}, {"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "Reno is next year I'm Ninety One point seven K.

Robin San Juan\n... and ...\nAnd now joined me onstage at the jaycees yet that as I introduce our gas [noise]\nFirst we have Sarah trail the woman who started social justice showing academy\nAfter graduating from the Harvard University graduate school of education she created SJSU a as a platform where you create art that engages and educate communities and we'll talk a lot more about that soon\nNancy Williams is it bay area based long arm quilter she's been selling for over fifty years and is the long arm artist for all of the U.S Jesse quilts next to her is Colleen ... who pieces all the quilts together so you can talk more about that\nAnd then we have three SJSU a artist year we're so lucky an honor to have them we Brian Robin ... in the middle and an Eighteen year old\nUm who's starting at UC Davis on the twenty third very soon he will major in theater and dance with a minor an architectural design and hopes his artwork will be able to speak to people and show them what is

science and a minor in she kind of studies and he hopes his artwork can shine light on the social issues and living lived experiences of those in his community so were so excited you're all here\nI just want to start up by walking through the origin of social justice showing academy with Sarah and some of the steps of the process with the group\nSo can you tell us a little bit about yourself\nAnd how you started the economy um I've been on ... for my grandmother taught me\nUm I was placed in like intermediate closing classes from like the age of eight till twelve and then I'm Around the age Thirteen seeing the publishing offered me a book deal to teach kids how to sew so I did a book deal than ... followed up with a DVD deal\nThan fabric will it made me an offer to design a fabric collection than simplicity contact me flew me out to New York and I do find the simplicity pattern collection all before the age of Fifteen um\nYou're like a quilting prodigy feeding 'em and your parents are here we get a little shout out\nThank you mom and dad um\nWho took me around core classes and consistently even though I'd get kicked out sometimes um it's still pay for ... classes and Joanne and prom dress designed and drafting patterns in like from a to B from paper piecing to making a wedding ring ... like I I could really just I'm kind of focus and\nKind of do it all I'm not necessarily excellent but I could I was a decent grass and lots of issues but it wasn't until really my senior year in high school\nUm that when Trayvon Martin was murdered it was like he was murdered February twenty six his birthday was February fifth Nineteen Ninety five mine is my birthday is February nineteenth like Ninety five\nSo he was literally two weeks older than me um and when he was murdered I I think it just hit home I've always been you know these things decently socio politically aware but really that murder which just like wow and\nAnd then wants to move and walked often compounded with just other issues it really like I'm getting ready to spend a hundred hours sewing making the double wedding ring quote making a prom dress for a friend\nI didn't think that my son was having like a message wasn't that it was important it's like I still love sewing but if I'm going to be something that I loved regardless needed to have a message bigger than just making something for the love of making it so at that point um\nI was like I didn't renew any simplicity I didn't know any contracts and I was like I'm going to make social justice article those aren't things that have patterns because you make like it's ... it's kind of raw organic Sacco techniques as opposed to buying a pattern and you know creating someone's pattern so my sponsors weren't very happy with me but it was okay\nUm I made the Trayvon Martin quote which is hanging on the wall\nAnd after that like I showed her to churches and just like not not as a you know like when to do something needs to be bigger than this this is the memorial is she's gone but not forgotten we still need to be doing more um the fact\nThat this happened to stand your ground law there's policies we can challenge there's there's lots of action that we can be taken so it was kind of like as a talking peace to spur people to action not to just admire look say oh that's great but in\nBut in the day people were admiring of quote with a dead boy's face on it like it wasn't something that people just wanted to\nYou know people didn't all I Want to make that it wasn't about repeating it was about let's not forget to do something so that was kind of I guess the call and then as I talk to the younger kids they're like well I Want to make a quote about you know sex trafficking or\nThis stuff happening international or you know kids getting human travel from Costa Rica and I'm like well then let's all have a platform to make social justice art but my sponsors were like well we want you to be selling patterned and making stuff for other people do and I'm like well it's OK let's make it free\nThat wasn't something that they weren't necessarily on board with either so talking to my ... the mentors and the people that I knew um they were able to donate fabric and has to be able to have a free\nUm I guess more equitable space to create art not just with the intent of sewing but\nGreat art about issues and things that we were really concerned with and so we had a six week summer program and in that six weeks on the program Brian and won made their first article um and so it was just six weeks Monday through friday all summer and get them\nSo that was the very first social justice selling academy workshop that Brian and won participated in and where was that and how did you even set that up at UC Berkeley on so I graduated and I wrote a grant and they funded it and they were just like a not only can have a grant but you have space so and what year was that\nSummer twenty sixteenth okay so you got money from UC Berkeley where you had gone and just as an as it can you tell us what how old you are when you started at\nBerkeley because I was sixteen right just in case\nWe weren't sure how incredible um okay so you're you graduated from Berkeley\nYou were how old twenty okay Twenty years old you get a grant you have passion and a plan and then how do you actually go about setting up a six week workshop finding people to participate\nReached out to high school instead of program curriculum proposed ... trio gotten partnership with up or down trio funding established groups with like I Need to kids to be there it's selling something you can't start a quote in not decide to come back\nI Need the same demographic to becoming back all the time 'cause it's not a pick it up drop it like kids wouldn't finish another kids quote so I had to work on some partnership upper bound partner with me um UC Berkeley give us a space we had lunch with bart stipend with lots of stuff so\nAnd so maybe it will take a little side\nAside journey into that workshop because we have Brian and one here who participated so I'm Wondering if you can each talk about how you found yourself in the upper down program in what you're sort of initial thoughts reactions were when you have you heard about the court workshop that you'd be participating in it\nUm well basically up around program they gave us a class schedule one on one of the causes of social justice and that's the first time I met Sarah and she basically with a closer relationship with me open up and\nExperience with our fellow social just shoot social justice and how can I express myself in it and with a six weeks or she's I didn't I didn't never so before she taught me how to do everything from scratch and her Robin and from there we made a whole group and in six weeks and you\nLove story was a little bit different they told us to pick our classes like the least\nThe least favorite and the most like the one that you want the most and I ended up doing it backwards and I end up getting put in her class and it was like I I didn't I didn't expect that there'll be is when is it was also like my first time so and so it was cool when\nThen wanted to you could do any of it just makes you ... stitches or small um but after that\nYeah so I think other people I didn't have the block I Do get so they didn't necessarily make blocks they just the other kids in electric class like why can't I make my own quote in the cars I see you an hour a day and I see them like four hours a day mhm [noise]\nSo okay so then where what was the next big leap of a ... a big leap so honestly what that was it was going to be that was going to be at one time summer program I went to Harvard in the fall um it was a grad program but then when I got up there\nI was kind of like a little bored so I started to workshop just just to be clear so you were\nHarvard graduate school a little boring plenty of free time because I didn't get to like I didn't get to see kids in the graduate school it's like old people so um so I was just like I didn't have any access like I didn't have high school friends like you don't go make fun just under grads and people at Harvard like their perception fun was like go to a wine bar and drink or like\nLike knowing when to Six Flags for Halloween like it was just different the east coast versus Berkeley you just really different\nYou're listening to members of the social justice selling academy including founder and executive director Sarah trail corps members Nancy Williams and calling Herod in an artist Brian Rob in San Juan ... an anti em on being at a series featuring creative voices from the Jewish community center of San Francisco [noise]\nTheir eggs edition connecting threads quilts from the social justice telling academy is currently on view at the cat Snyder gallery at the Jewish community Centre\nLocated at thirty two hundred California street in San Francisco through November fourth\nThe social justice showing academy will also be holding a drop in quilting workshop on friday October twelve from three PM on as part of our second friday Shabaab series at the Jaycee CSS\nCheck the J. C. C. S. F. website for more information\nBeing a is also available as a podcast and you can find it at ... dot org\nAnd Harvard it was just it was just it wasn't the same community I had was like OK I Want to do more I should say stuff so um I did workshops that high schools are kind of came up with the a block ... method where instead of having one group of kids for like maybe a hundred hours like maybe we had that in six weeks we had um just for a few hours and you can make a block\nBut then it's like well I didn't have the capacity to teach kids how to in border and it to our workshop because that takes a long time to two hours of spent in the activity including the blocks then became of the idea of having an border he volunteers who like sign up\nAnd then they can take the kids are in a broader and then mail it back so it's still gets the same hand sewn element without 'em like having the kids have to be there for five six hours to learn how to embroider\nSo we just want to make sure so this is like a pretty significant different way to approach\nInitial workshop one student one artist one big quilt hundred hours of work and in this new method new model you're working with kids for just a few hours and maybe at a time and they're making one ... or ...\nAnd then how and then um [noise] how are they attaching it to how are they like\nMaking it oh with scissors based thing blew 'em and then we iron mhm so it's more of the conversation it's more of them understanding of like what do they care about how can they visualize the social justice issue and connected to a visual image it's more about the learning the habit and the workshop and far less about them getting an absolutely amazing our PC ... volunteers are really\nLike the motivating drive for what makes community quilts beautiful okay so how who are the embroidery volunteers where did they come from [noise] there's probably a bunch yeah rate raise your hand if you've ever and boarded fresh yesterday [noise]\nSo it's like they I mean they can come from Instagram they can come from I don't know I don't necessarily know where they come from but they're great\nSo they sign up on your website anyone listening or in this room can go to the SJSU a website and sign up to be a volunteer embroidery volunteer and then what\nHappens then they get their address and I mailed them a block a company with an artist they ... if the kid for example can make a block on this and they they ... out of the street science and they'd like international in bordered on the street sign to really solidify it for\nThey meant it was Oakland home like okay so they can put it if you wouldn't mind could you please and border the word international on the street find that I cut out little things like that\nAt hair or could you add eyes are like any little detail that the kid necessarily couldn't cut out in fabric\nUm and then they mail it they get it then they mail it back to us and then we have a team of volunteers who will take all the blocks that have come back in the mail from like you know the one word shut that we did and then we'll put it into a community quote that'll have twenty quotes and Rosa for by five face featuring all the issues that the kids cared about in a certain group of okay and\n... year I think that this is maybe where you you come in to you\nWhat happens you get a bunch of blocks yeah I'm a piece or um that means I take all of this community box and put 'em together and\nAnd the scientists [laughter] and so\nI sometimes I get an option about I might have opportunity to choose Bach say we did one recently that was primarily focused on black lives matter and so I went through the block selection and made sure that that topic was loud and clear\nUm and then I I'm more of an improv quilter so I don't not you know just big blocks of fabric straight lines and kinda\nJust start selling and so I started to PCs together actually the three of us spend a lot of time initially like laying the blocks out on Nancy studio floor\nTo figure out the order of things and what's going to look best not to have too many faces next to each other so a lot of thought goes into it with the three of us or redo it through texting what do you think about this move that went to the right move this to that and so we do we kind of collaborate through the whole process\nAnd then I piece that together and then I pass it on to Nancy where it gets top quilted and how did you first hear about the social justice Tony academy I to get involved Instagram and I volunteer to embroider and um I I actually didn't really know how to embroider before him like a high\nCould figure it out and uh had a good time to and what was the reason you signed up what sparked you to participate in the young woman in the back of the room with the iPhone is one of my children\nUm after the previous presidential of this current president's election\nI it was a little disheartening and there's only ... [laughter]\nMany letters and phone calls you can make and and I do art to make myself feel better and so this was a great avenue for me to do art and then\nBe an example to my children that hey I'm trying to make the world better for you so thank you sir I'm All right and then Nancy\nYou to then un Sarah and Colleen or having everything on your studio floor and then you're along our culture and I don't think we all know what that is it sounds very exciting can you tell us about it\nSo um you don't have to have long arms to be a long long quilter but I Do have a cartoon with somebody dragging their own um\nBut um ... who's a quilter here it was quilter so quite a few of you for those of you who are not um a quilt consists of a peace or not peace talks but a top it consists of batting which is what makes the quilt give the body and give it some warmth um\nBad in can be anything it can be made of wool it can be an old blanket it can be\nUm part cotton part polyester can be bamboo so it's batting and then it's got a backing so that it's called a quilt sandwich\nSo in prior times you've seen pictures and there may be some pictures up um where there's a quilt and there's a lot of mostly women around the quilt and they it's called a quilting bee and their hands stitching so what they're doing is is is through stitches\nYou know making that quilt sandwich putting it together and adding some strength to it but also just generally putting it together\nUm so that's one way to do it is to handle it and there are some artists that do they still do that\nIt would drive me crazy but I have done it um but it takes a long time um and they do some beautiful work amazing little stitches as you guys you know experienced um\n[noise] so that's one way of doing it another way of doing it is with a domestic machine which is just a regular sewing machine and the machine is stitching you're moving the quilt\nWhich is fine for smaller quilts when you look at a large size quilt\nThan it becomes really an act of strength to and coordination so you have to kind of role would do a little quilting on roll it move it and so if you've ever done that you know how difficult that is\nUm so I've always I've I've been um [noise] I I've tailored um suits I've made wedding dresses I've done a lot of sewing over the years a lot of quilting over the years and I did most of my quilt on a domestic machine um and then I I acquired a a along our which I I got the space\nUm I think at the space first in the long arm second I'm and I'm so now it's a long arm machine which means that is the quilt is on a frame it's on rollers and I moved the machine\nSo it's an industrial sized machines a frame is twelve feet and I moved the machine so it's kind of like painting with red\nSo I'm doing what\nI'm the quilting bee did what people did on on domestic machines but I'm doing on a long arm machine so the closest stable and I'm moving a machine so that's what long arming is\nSo it's a little bit of a story but um so I got involved with um social justice I was I was following the Instagram account and this has been about Eighteen months two years and that long yeah\nDifferent platforms of cool things that will show how issues can be put in art officially and be shown all over the country and I just thought like descent opportunity for me to actually show what I think about what's going on in the world right now\nAnd from my Quil I'm just a piece there that's well when I made the quilt it wasn't that it was pretty recent one that Las Vegas shooting happened\nAnd that kind of like inspired me to actually like want to put that in my ... well at first my coat was originally supposed to be about mental health which is also a big part of my quilt and having my call beep east into different types of issues that's happened\nIn America which kind of made it perfect to just put them altogether\nThis is Tina KLW series featuring artists and thinkers to spoken at the Jewish community center in San Francisco [noise]\nToday's guests are members of the social justice selling academy including founder and executive director Sarah trail\nCorps members Nancy Williams and Colleen Herod and an artist Brian Robin then ... and and yeah there I used to fish and connecting threads quotes from the social justice selling academy\nIs currently on you let the cats Nader gallery at the Jewish community Centre located at thirty two hundred California street in San Francisco through November fourth the social justice showing academy will also be holding a drop in quilting workshop on friday October twelve from three PM on\nAs part of our second friday's Shabaab series at the Jaycee CSS\nChecked Jaycee CSS dot org for more information\nDina is also available as a podcast and you can find it at K. L. W. dot org\n[noise] so you're close is on display in this exhibition is called America the beautiful and um can you describe it for us\nUm that name was kind of ironic [laughter] I'm American a beautiful uh\nWell\nThe more I see you know it's kind of like mind blowing so\nBasically a classroom and had students just looking out the window I'm so it's a classroom with children and and the window pain that's just\nBasically showing what the world's like will has what's been happening in the world outside the school and as a student I've always just looked up we always hear and know about what's been happening in the country and we don't really get to\nPut our own bases on it and actually do something about it and this was a making the ... was my chance of putting that issue in it and\nThe other pieces are on there were some Boston Marathon um bomb and the also the um the one from North Carolina the shooting in the school to\n\nThe world Trade Center nine eleven and yeah\nCan I add to so and quilts amazing one of the things you left off as the classroom setting\nI'm is actually the American flag upside down which is an indication of distress for it's a really moving piece and I just want to make sure and I thought it was amazing I actually got the quilt that quote so I'm really familiar with it now\nThank you [noise] um yeah clearly clearly as to say I'm was started by someone who is I'm just a\nSpecial in the universe I'm a lot of uh Sarah has um a lot of vision certainly a lot of energy um she sees possibilities but the but um most of all\nShe has um a real ... it's it's it's all coming from the heart she has a real desire to provide\nUm opportunities for folks that wouldn't have an opportunity to do something like this um I think you can in talking to um [noise] the students said here you see that this really has changed them and so um\nTo to think about when you look at the exhibit and we have many more quilts and many more blocks and all of that\nUm the impact that ... had on um young people and allowing them both the artistic um\nOur freedom and opportunity but also to have them think deeply about you know the issues that they have and um so this is she she is the heart and soul and I'm the driver of this we all know that very well and I'm anti the Energizer Bunny um but um\nSo I I feel very fortunate to have been part of um disorganization and to have the ability to artistically contribute um to these works of art\nAnd Sarah actually I wanted to ask you about where social justice feeling ketamine is now and where where your vision for it for the future and\nCan you tell us about um I Would definitely have to say it is really possible because of the community who cares because at the end of the day I'm bored we skills are quite pathetic so um I think yes it's fun when kids having a vision but at the end of the day they couldn't even make any court shows about ... volunteers on the border is like\nI mean you put your fingers you bleed it's hard\nUm I Know that in and out stitch but like there's a stitch that's like the blanket stitch and like their stitches that just it's really nice the amount of mentor ship that comes from us you say the amount of people that you know whether they're tired or whether they just you know take off time the amount of people that'll come in and just like it the last workshop we had a workshop at the beach which is East Bay heritage cultures the amount\nOf adults that every kid had their own adult and that are dealt with like a professional like you know in in there\nSoldiers conversation with kids I can help them come great ideas of being able to have a volunteer that can take their kids passion and run with it in a way that you know I'm not able to because I'm not that great it all off things well um I think the community that has come back to these kids in such a humble way and sense of the costs are all beautiful but like the amount of hours\nYes it was a couple of hours and creating all the art with kids but the amount of hours that have gone hind the scenes and peace in the ... one of our that have gone to the border is like the embroidery volunteer like\nCommunity called have hundreds of hours of work because\nI mean including mailing like ... like it's just it's really a community effort and it's a guess use voice is like at the forefront\nBut it's like behind it is really the community that that backs and sports young kids and I think that level of empowerment is really I think critical and crucial in the sense of the quilting world if you go to traditional coach not most not many calls have messages and not many culture all political so I think allowing the court were not only making space for these quotes\nBut the the cultures of themselves making time I'm In Florida is a labor of love and so to have that many volunteers like at this point we have over five hundred volunteers that will take a block\nYou know spend ten Fifteen hours do the block and then mail it back it's like I think that\nThe love the community has four is definitely a way to like keep pushing forward to the in the day if we had a bunch of glued art by kids wouldn't be quotes like [laughter] it really wouldn't like in their messages are great but it's like not ... I don't necessarily have time to be able to teach kids from start to finish southern border I think the amount of time that a border volunteers and community and that's the I mean\nI it's like here's a quote a week like it's it's a lot\nLike everyone puts in a lot of effort in at the end of the day it's off from a leftist used voice shine let these issues shine um I think the community has been doing like just an amazing job in terms of backing that but I think the vision or the future\nI think in one way I really want as you say to disrupt the quote world and the sense of what's allowed who's allowed what's pleased with not pleased if you go to even P. I. Q. S. as much as I'm appreciate that we have a special exhibit in the ... and you tell us what ... the Pacific international quote festival and it's like the largest quote shown California\nThey don't have that an injury spot for youth cultures like at all\nUm so I think the court world and general\nLots of court shows don't have like under Eighteen and it's like at the end of the day regardless of technique kids first quote cannot enter against an artist who's been quilting for fifty years even if it's the same like it's ... it's all adapt okay but like\nI don't know Tina's Raj applicant quote and she's been calling for you know I don't know how long couldn't compete against Brian's first time right after they close I feel in general as much as the quote world might be one in young kids to begin picking up\nIt's not supportive in the sense of it doesn't give access it's like I'm so many court shows even even quote con they had an entry fee for for they had an access point for youth but it was like twenty five dollars for each kid to some of the quote was like a couple of emails they definitely made made space but that was because ... it was like\nWe're going to waive the fee but it's like at the end of the day you can't say yes we want young kids to do it but you're going to have to pay that basically means you need to have a mom or grandma like I was fortunate to have two parents who can pay all the entry fees for me to be able to take classes\nI just think I'm a lot of kids that would have like love for sewing don't have parents willing to spend two hundred bucks and sewing machine and the rotary cut her kid and even if they find a coup machine at a garage sale you still need someone to teach you how to read it need someone to run through you might need oil change my does need to quit\nI guess ... trip to a shop I think at the end the day sewing is really I'm not an equitable but it's just it's an influence fluent craft and flew an art form of not all young people have access to that so I think providing just anyone who wants to learn how to soak in and be able to have a mentor ship pool like Palin that can come and help and support\n'em that means a lot but I think if I could have the vision for as you say would be able to have it like it's like a curriculum where it can be fulltime run in you know urban high schools that can be tailored to the curriculum that values lived experiences um a cool aspect of as you say is the amount of critical I guess really like", "show_name": "Binah", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "04", "locations": [["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["Dina", -20.3, 57.58333], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["San Juan", 18.46633, -66.10572], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Costa Rica", 10.0, -84.0], ["Berkeley", 37.87159, -122.27275], ["Berkeley", 37.87159, -122.27275], ["Berkeley", 37.87159, -122.27275], ["San Juan", 18.46633, -66.10572], ["San Francisco California", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["Oakland", 37.80437, -122.2708], ["kinda", 58.01315, 15.73373], ["Las Vegas", 36.17497, -115.13722], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["Corps", -20.25694, 57.44556], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["Dina", -20.3, 57.58333], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["North Carolina", 18.38078, -65.95739], ["Florida", 28.75054, -82.5001], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["Tina", 41.41256, 22.67231]], "not_found": [], "ep_coords": ["San Francisco, CA", 37.77493, -122.41942], "in_country": ["America", "San Francisco", "California", "San Francisco", "U.S", "New York", "Berkeley", "Berkeley", "Berkeley", "San Francisco California", "San Francisco", "Oakland", "Las Vegas", "America", "San Francisco", "California", "San Francisco", "America", "Florida", "California"], "out_country": ["Dina", "San Juan", "Costa Rica", "San Juan", "kinda", "Corps", "Dina", "North Carolina", "Tina"], "in_state": ["San Francisco", "California", "San Francisco", "Berkeley", "Berkeley", "Berkeley", "San Francisco California", "San Francisco", "Oakland", "San Francisco", "California", "San Francisco", "California"], "out_state": ["America", "Dina", "San Juan", "U.S", "New York", "Costa Rica", "San Juan", "kinda", "Las Vegas", "America", "Corps", "Dina", "America", "North Carolina", "Florida", "Tina"]}]
