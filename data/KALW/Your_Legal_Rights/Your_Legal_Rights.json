point seven in San Francisco\nThree months ago on July eleventh\nWhen discussing we begin discussing a series on the Supreme Court when we are to show what the topic\nA new nominee has been named to the next to me the next justice of the United States Supreme court what is the process but comes next and what difference does it make last week we continue the series with the political discussion new term new court\nOr with a new justice a program this week is the final in the series new term new cases a look at the cases on the upcoming Supreme Court docket we try to answer the questions just what's in the score card and what does all this mean for me now\nIf you have questions for my guest our phone number to us here in the studio is for one five eight four one for one three for\nThat for one five eight four one for one three for if you're calling from outside of the local dialing area we're outside of San Francisco please call us toll free and eight six six\nSeven nine eight eight to five five that's eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five\nMy guest tonight is Chris who of course is an attorney with the mosque what's a ... team in San Francisco who having served as president of the Stanford law review went on to serve as luck but to Ninth Circuit judge Kim wardlaw then served as clerked\nWithin the California Supreme Court for justice good when Lew Chris let me welcome your legal rights\nExtra and again if you have questions our number in the studio was far one five eight four one for one three four and again that's for one five eight four one for one three four or if you're calling from outside San Francisco please call us toll free\nAt eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five five\nAgain that's eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five five and I really like to start with this\nOf course you were listening last week and my guess last week commented that uh there's not much happening this year there's really not much of great impact do you agree\nYes I mean in in relative terms um last last term had quite a quite a number of blockbuster cases and looking at this year's docket at least so far um there's really nothing that jumps out as you know kind of case that would\nImmediately grabbed the attention of of all a person of course every case it to the Supreme Court is\nHugely important to the people involved into people who practice in that area of law and this year actually I think there are some really interesting cases that will have a big impact on our society but there you don't necessarily have the same kind of\nCases you last term when you had a challenge to Trump's travel ban and you had the metric ... piece of cake shop case um there's nothing like that so far on the terms docket\nOne of the things we discussed last week 'cause whether there are some high profile cases that suggest justice Kevin I should pay a pivotal world do you feel that as my gifted last week perhaps he wouldn't have a role this year different lead than perhaps Justice Kennedy ...\nYeah I actually really you know agree a hundred percent with them the comments that dean made a lot last week if you look at the cases the court has on top so far for this term\nIt's hard to really see any case where Kavanaugh will likely I'm vote differently than Kennedy in a way that would actually make a difference to the the outcome of the case um that said looking forward to perhaps the end of this term or or\nYears into the future certainly there are areas where we can expect that Kavanaugh will make a big difference but I'm In the immediate term you know it it's hard to see in any case where I'm cabinet was going to be the difference maker [noise]\nOne of the things that we talked about before going on the air was the courts public perception um what do you think is the ...\nWell I think ... as you know for a long time the Supreme Court has enjoyed much higher public approval ratings and high levels of public trust and um it's um sister branches of government I mean year after year um\nThe Supreme Court has much higher approval ratings than Congress or the presidency and um it's power derives you know from that legitimacy that it's had in the public eye for so long\nUm and so I think no matter what your personal views are about um what happened in the cabinet nomination um that that process was so controversial that uh [noise] get really threatened to affects the public perception of the court\nAnd we happened to have a chief justice chief justice Roberts who\nHas been very conscious and very savvy in um shaping and maintaining the courts public image so I expect that certainly this German and probably going to the future um he'll be using every tool at his disposal to kind of lower the temperature\nAvoid taking really controversial cases or decide potentially controversial cases and narrow ways in order to kind of\nRestore the that the courts public perception\nAnd ultimately to make sure the court doesn't suffer the kind of a hit in terms of respect and credibility that perhaps Senate didn't last few months\nAbsolutely I mean I'm you know a cynic might say that the Supreme Court is the only major federal institution left that that enjoys um popular support and and um I think will be it would be in in real trouble if if we lost that one as well\nSo in a moment I'd like to turn our attention to what I'd like to focus for most of the show tonight and that is specific cases really what's coming up what does it mean for us but I did want to ask you you mentioned about using tools to really protect the court and\nChat with you a little bit about what some of those tools are\n[noise] yeah so some people might know the U.S Supreme Court at um is a quarter of discretionary review so with a few very limited exceptions that are nice and really we're talking about of the court has complete control over what cases it decides to here\nAnd again when you say discretionary review that's the way and a nice way of saying that basically the Supreme Court's going to decide the cases that wants to decide you don't have any right to be heard by the Supreme Court it's really up to them what they hear\nExactly and so you know in order for a case to end up in the Supreme Court a lot of things have to happen you have to have proceeding in a trial court either federal or state that has to go to an intermediate appeals court that has to in the state system go to a state Supreme Court and then there has to be\nUm a what's called a cert petition a petition for a bit of ... out in the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd that again says when you come and take a look at this that a cert petition\nExactly and um one thing that you often hear people say about the Supreme Court is you know it's not a quarter of error correction so it doesn't\nNot only do you don't have a right to be on the Supreme Court and really when you're trying to get a case into the Supreme Court it's not enough to say oh the lower court got it wrong it helps us a lower court got it wrong but\nIt really has to be some dispute among the lower courts generally um that that only the Supreme Court can step in and solve\nSo if a court in the ... circuit went in one direction and really believed in issue goes a certain way in a court in the eleventh circuits somewhere somewhere in the south besides the world looks differently they don't get up and see things the same way in the morning it might be the U.S Supreme Court's going to step in and say well boys settle down this is how we deal with it\nReally controversial social issues where you might expect the Ninth Circuit to go to a liberal direction and you know the eleventh circuit go a different direction but justice commonly you have circuits splits involving totally arcane non controversial issues where I'm\nReally there's not a liberal answer or a conservative answer there's just an ambiguous statute people read it differently and um you just kinda need someone to step in and say this is the correct interpretation\nWe're about to turn our attention to specific cases what these mean to you and really shift our focus tonight to why these things make a difference to you listening what cases are likely to affect how the world looks to you tomorrow morning because the Supreme Court decided today\nWe know some obvious ones such as ... versus Wade there's others that may be less obvious such as\nA look at the short run back and we'll talk about those things but again if you have specific questions from I guess this is your chance nuts and bolts from five thousand feet\nAgain our number here in the studio is for one five eight four one for one three four again that's far one five eight four one for one three for if you're outside of San Francisco call us at eight six six seven Ninety eight\n[noise] so you know I listen to this argument as well and\nIt seems to me that I'm a majority of the court is inclined to to\nSo again you're listening to your legal rights on K. A. L. W.\nNinety One point seven FM in San Francisco\nMy guess tonight as Chris you attorney with the mosque what's a ... team in San Francisco\nOur phone number to us in the studio so you have questions for my gas is far one five eight four one for one three for that's for one five eight four one bar one three four or five you're calling from outside the local calling area are toll free number\nIs eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five and again that's eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five\nWhen we were talking I'd like to shift gears a little bit we've been talking about\nSome interesting a constitutional issues that um they may not look too important but they may have a big impact\nOne of the cases that uh you discussed with a Tim's versus Indiana what's all that about\nYes the tens versus Indiana is um like a lot of Supreme Court cases a case that brings together really strange bedfellows so um it's a it's a case of that's you know it exemplifies a pretty common fact pattern where um\n... you know someone who's involved in certain criminal activity and um the government decides they're going to do something called civil asset forfeiture where they ... they um see is uh the property of person who may have used that property in the commission of a crime and\nI'm definitely has become extremely controversial these days and so in this particular case you have the ACLU and libertarian groups and and then do a double ACP\n'em all lined up on the same side um to challenge a particular application of civil asset forfeiture you had a guy who um came into some money ... purchased a Land Rover and then he\nUsed a landlord revert to sell drugs um and even though this was actually a very low level drug crime that a carry the maximum fine of ten thousand dollars government decide they're going to see is is very expensive landrover\nAnd we could have a whole discussion we could have a whole episode on civil forfeiture in which as a defense attorney it has huge problem civil forfeiture where\nThe government does not necessarily giving your same due process right this is not a consequence of your conviction we're talking about whether they just simply take it away they take the money or out out of your pocket and say well proven SARS ... privy earned it the way we like will return to that in just a moment Holly from San Francisco you're on your legal rights welcome [noise]\nHi I just had a I just wanted a clarification on the case is talking about a four where\nI'm at that that um [noise] agencies couldn't we just given carte blanche to write all the regulations and who is bringing that case and and what are they are what are the other issues involved it wasn't clear to me but that's about\nOkay thank you Holly appreciate that and think what I think Ali was asking about the origins of the Chevron doctrine which is at play at some of these other cases\nWell Holly actually where you were used I'm asking you about the Chevron case or about the the second one I mentioned about um the sex offender registration law\n[noise] ah ... [laughter] I'm Sorry I didn't they maybe they blended together [laughter] is that a principal whereby that they you they can't just say do something and give the agency carte blanche to write all the rules and and so\nYeah I didn't I couldn't share all the details sure I may be an easier way to do this instead of\nSecond guessing ... question and flushing it up let's give a broad let's give a broader answer where we take a step back\nTalk first what Chevron is and then talk about the newer cases a bit maybe better explain it\nUm yeah so I think in in this particular case that that she's referring to um it's actually not shove on it it's it's a non delegation doctrine and\nI'm just doctrine which is the one I which I kind of in shorthand said as a no carte blanche I'm to the agency doctrine a\nThat is no no law has ever been struck down under that doctrine since Nineteen thirty five so people have not really taking it seriously um and so it was very surprising to me when it seemed like this particular challenge looked like it might succeed and\nThis is a case where um there was a federal law that I'm pertains to sex offender registration and um when the law was passed there were um a bunch of um people who had previously convicted of of of sex offenses and\nCongress didn't really want to figure out what to do with those people they basically told us attorney general you figure it out\nAnd uh the case was brought by one of these people who had been convicted of a sex offense prior to the passage of the law and what his what his challenge says is a well this law is unconstitutional because um you can't have a lot it's so broad that just tells an executive agency go figure it out\n\nSo ultimately the doctrine says you pay a lot of difference but there's gotta be limits\nYeah and so it's it's close to ... I Would say is closely related to to um to the shower on doctrine where in the short run this is the one where\nYou know if I'm if Congress writes a statute and then says the there's a particular agency charged with interpreting and applying that statute if the agency goes ahead and interprets the statute that that it has control over then\nI'm a court might can review that decision but it's really going to have a kind of hands off approach and get a lot of difference\nHighly I don't know if you're still on the line but I Hope that\nGave me some some direct and some some idea of where we were coming from if we\nLost people turning a little chocolate you left [laughter] and without Alan from Berkeley Welcome to your legal rights\nOh hi I just want to hear more about that for for for and uh [noise] you know and I'm In is and what what kind of a rough time that happened\nWith more and um [noise] you know how effective a few far and I'm\nGetting a fair [laughter]\nI'm Sorry to interrupt you can you turn your radio down just a moment we're getting a bit of feedback\nOn at all I don't have it on at all\nOkay that's coming from some other source seems to have stopped that I'm Sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you and I can promise you if you knew my practice as a as a criminal defense attorney ... I was not going to let\nAsset forfeiture [laughter] go by the wayside that has to\nAll be patient I just know sometimes these programs and kind of get on tens of maybe organized than me so\nI Know I'm actually offering that no I Do it's my pleasure and I'm very pleased that you circles back to that point because I did want to talk about that yeah when you're with thank you thank you I'll I'll take it off the air okay thank you around civil forfeiture for those that don't know\nIs a punitive approach to pre judicial determination you have somebody who they\nSkate property they confiscate money it may be drugs it may be many other arenas but that's where we see it most often and at the same time that somebody is facing a criminal prosecution or looking down the road of the ... criminal prosecution that may be coming\nTo the police have taken their assets or the administrative agency has taken their assets and said well we're taking this until they prove otherwise\nYou have a limited time to step up and yet how can you prove otherwise you have this criminal case and you have to face the specter of making statements that will impact your criminal case while at the main at the same time as opposed to be protecting your assets and they use that money\nFor other purposes whether it's purchasing equipment or simply to turn to conduct\nSo that's the backdrop we're talking about forfeiture is a serious it poses serious questions about due process and whether people are really being treated fairly with that ... backdrop let's circle back to the Tim's case\nAnd you were starting to describe that in terms of forfeiture\nSure I'll Try not to get too arcane with this description but the the question that's presented in this particular case is whether the excessive fines claws are is incorporated against the states so what does what does that mean um there's a there's a clause of the U.S constitution that prohibits um excessive fun\nUm but\nIt has not yet been decided that that that individual right actually is applied against the state's which means it prohibits the states from doing something um\nWhen the constitution was um was drafted in an acted it was understood to apply to constrain or what the federal government was doing and it was only after the passage of the fourteenth amendment which talks about states not depriving people of\nEight eight to five five\nSo we don't see any real blockbusters coming up nobody is looking to throughout the exclusionary ruler suddenly outlawed the death penalty and another\nAnother substance that may be going away in tiny little cats um\nSo\nWhat do we think is the impact of the Roberts Court when it comes to real people if if we don't see any blockbuster cases is he going to make the kind of changes that perhaps a justice Warren did with the Warren Court [noise]\nI Would say he's been just as impactful if not more so and will continue to be um depending on depending on your perspective that that's a that's either cause for celebration or or cause for concern\nIn what way that we did we think he's going to have that kind of impact\nUm someone one area that interests me personally is the area of affirmative action and\nIt's an area where we've seen already incremental changes to make affirmative action more and more difficult um actually that just this week in Boston I'm a ... a Harvard um undergraduate admissions process is going on trial I mean a case where Asian American plaintiffs are\nChallenging the Harvard admissions process that among other things includes an affirmative action policy and to me that's the case that could wind up in the Supreme Court um in in um you know maybe two or three years and that could be the case it ends affirmative action\n\nIs is a case where you think that the change from Justice Kennedy to justice cabin on may shift the outcome\nYes I I think affirmative action is one of the key areas where you can really pinpoint a situation where Kennedy all do far from a liberal was\nWilling to um vote in favor of will specifically wanted to ... live action program the one at the University of Texas that were challenged and I'm a lawsuit that was heard actually multiple times by the Supreme Court in the last two years or he was a crucial fifth vote upheld the University of Texas policy\nUm it's likely or not inevitable that he would have upheld the Harvard policy but um I really can't see Kevin a voting to uphold that\n... that art from San Francisco welcome you're on your legal rights\nThank you um we're hearing a lot about um\nAllegations voter suppression in places like Georgia can you review what's been going on with cases on them running voting rights and what we can expect kind of just a court with a new addition to it\n\nThank you are and I I think what are asking is what there might be heading down the pipeline in the way of either voters depression or voter writes something that might have an effect on the impact\nYes so last term um the ... court had granted that a couple of cases that would have allowed it to 'em finally addressed this issue of partisan gerrymandering looking at um can ever be a situation where um\nGerrymandering not based on race but based on party affiliation everybody so extreme that it offends the constitution um court ended up not deciding that issue\nUm but I think that's one that might come back to this term there was a challenge to North Carolina's an electoral districts on on partisan gerrymandering ground where\nThe federal district court I'm struck it down went up to the Supreme Court and back\nUm and we may see it come back yet again to the Supreme Court in a way that um where they were they wind up addressing that issue\nArt thank you for joining\nI see another call working its way this way very slowly perhaps Robert waiting let's talk about some other areas where\nCases in the pipeline where the shift from Justice Kennedy to now justice Kevin I'm may make somewhat of a difference I'm One of the things we mentioned was the discrimination cases are there to such cases that are coming down the pipeline that might cause a paradigm shift\nYes so one that um there's one issue that really interests me right now is this issue of whether title seven which is the federal um in in uh employment discrimination statute of prohibits employment discrimination based on sexual orientation I'm\nOf the law lets face prohibits racial discrimination and discrimination based on sex um but there's long been kind of divergent case law about whether because of sex includes discrimination against gay lesbian transgender employees\nAnd\nFor those books that don't work in this area of work the court\nMay look at the law may look at one particular question\nAnd in applying that law you see all kinds of different areas where it applies they may say you can't use this level of somebody talking somewhere else outside of court because it offends\nUs some legal principle and it's applied in a completely different way because by analogy it tells us that applies so is that really what you're talking about here the ... talks about or perhaps um or gender or racial disparity in there being applied to other ...\nYeah so that the statute talks um directly about a discrimination because of sex those it that's the language of the statute and so\nI I don't think anyone would would argue that you know at the time when Congress was passing the law they intended to prohibit discrimination against gays and lesbians but if you just look at the language of the law there are a lot of situations where anti gay discrimination looks a lot like\nDiscrimination because of sex and ... what the language of the statute says arguably that's illegal\nAfter must get us welcome you're on your legal rights\nThank you I I Am calling because\nI understand that they you were having a conversation about uh the lead paint case and the decision the court not to grant Cirque\nA and this is the case that is of great interest me and I'm Wondering whether you thought that the decision of the court and I'm Sorry because I didn't hear that conversation\nWeathering thought that the court a bird or whether or not I do believe that I it's inappropriate for a public entity to believe ... requiring remediation of a thing\nAs toxins by a private company [noise]\nBefore before I ask ... answer that question [noise] the way you framed it\nMay be a good illustrator of another point and that is you talked about a policy issue about whether an who should be required to pay for that um [noise] for for correctly and that and\nWhat I what I'm going to ask my guess is whether that decision per se is even been put before the court a lotta times when a case is brought before the courts even the U.S Supreme Court\nThey're not saying if laws ... is\nConstitutional not they're not addressing what the policy is they're addressing one specific question within that law\nAnd a and it may be a different question that comes up as to why it's constitutional or unconstitutional another way\nHelp flush anything out a little orbit just confused it so much the better\nOf thank you yeah so and I'm Sorry to disappoint you I I'm not actually not familiar with that particular case ah I Know that the court denied the cert petition earlier this week but I'm not actually familiar with 'em but within the petition and so I'm not really able to comment on\nWhether I think it was a good or bad decision but I Will say that building off of just point I'm just as when the Supreme Court decides to cure she is on the merits of it can decide the case based on one particular facet of of the facts or the law without reaching reaching the policy aspect of it\nOr that applies even more so at the search stage because the Supreme Court has almost complete control over what it hears and so when this do not denying a cert petition\nIt's really not passing on the merits of whether um\nIt's not even really saying whether the lower court um got it right or got it wrong it could simply does have decided um we just don't want to hear this case right now um we don't think it's interesting we don't think the issue was raised in the right way totally independent of whether they thought the lower court was correct on the merits\nAnd it may be that we need to do more work a little more argument in a couple of other cases before they take up the issue in order that they get it right yeah and thank you for joining us\nPam from San Mateo welcome to your legal rights\nThank you I don't know I had a question about how um Supreme Court decision that regarded\nI'm Native American and North Dakota and um the state law parent required a road address for somebody to register to vote and I guess a lot of the reservations don't have\nI'm rather stay in our rights Nance I'm and I'm Wondering\nI'm kinda wondering how that's fair I guess in the first place\nBut the second thing then as it seems that with this case and with some of the others they air that you described earlier that the trend I on the court seems to be", "show_name":

members of the family law section of the California Lawyers Association if you have questions for him I guess our phone number to us right here in the studio\nIs for one five eight four one\nFor one three for that's for one five eight four one for one three for\nIf you're calling from outside of the local dialing area that's outside San Francisco can be you've call us toll free at eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five again that members eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five\nJanet BJ you've you've been most generous with your time participating on this show for several years as well as in our color nights let me welcome each of you to your legal rights and thank you Jeff it's good to be here again thanks Geoff happy Halloween\nAnd happy Halloween to everybody and I'd like to start with this so you're looking at getting a divorce exactly what do you have to expect is what's looking out there in front of your let's start with procedure give me a sense of what's out there who would like to start\nWell I guess I'll start and I think the the best thing is and I I think generally agree on this if you're even starting to consider splitting in a divorce you may want to go see an attorney before you actually separate and and get things prepared [noise]\nBecause once everything starts in the first thing to do on a divorce is filing some some petition and there's a lot of other documents that are required to be followed in California there's automatic restraining orders to go into place and everything has to stop so you may want to see a lawyer first to make sure that\nFirst of all you really want to get a divorce and then how are you going to proceed\nSo just to follow up on all of those forms that need to be filed um the the law in California requires it in order to get divorced you have to fully disclose\nAll of your assets all your debts all of your income all of your expenses and there are forms you can find on line\nTo guide us through what exactly that means but what I suggest that you do first if you're even thinking about maybe ending unfortunately your a partnership your marriage or your domestic partnership\nIs [noise] start gathering some documents get bank account statements\nAnd if you think that something is your separate property as opposed to community property\nYou're going to need to be able to prove it so you want to get documents right away as far back as you can so that you can what we call trace\nYour separate property I'm to something that came from your separate property yeah it's a legal issue but all you need to know is that banks only hold on to documents for so long\nAnd um [noise] so start getting that gathering that sooner rather than later because as time marches on those documents in the past will become harder and harder to get\nAnd that may be true whether it's the deed to the house or whether it's the gift card that came with your set of China or you'll want to be able to trace that but what I was wondering is\nI'm married my wife and I are going in different directions um but it's all amicable everything is friendly you think we still need to do think we still need to get that legal by day you're smiling you're laughing but that's not about that\nThat's because I've been doing this for about thirty two years and I don't know how many times and Janet's laughing to we have our clients come in and say we agree to\nAnd I wish it was um but sometimes it is and I think one of the things you have to look at is is again you dial it back a little bit and just to give an overview of the first thing that I tell all my clients when they first come to me and start discussing that I think I Want to split my marriage isn't working [noise]\nUm I think as attorney is the first thing we do is there any way to repair it and I have had reconciliation ths which are nice but then we have to talk about there's a couple of things you know in California it's a no fault state so that means if one ... one party wants a divorce you're going to get it\nAnd you may want a legal separation and there's a difference between legal separation divorce but also you may come in and asked for a legal separation if the other party comes forward says no I Want a divorce or getting a divorce the other thing that you have to keep in mind that's really important is we're a community property state\nAnd what does that mean that means that any property acquired from the date of your marriage until the date of your separation is presumed to be community and has to be distributed equally\nThe exceptions to that is going to be an inheritance kept separate or give to one particular spouses comes up or and so when we started talking to people about the ramifications you want to get a divorce for you want to get a legal separation where you want to terminate your domestic partnership\nOkay let's look at how this was all going to fit in and then go from there\nI Would say it's a lot easier to get married than it is to get divorced\nUm you go down and you get your license you get married and um I I Can't speak from personal experience it took me Thirteen Years before finally I I was able to get married to my partner but um\nBut I Will say it's much harder to get divorced and um even if it's amicable and even if you have\nActually agreed on everything and they're genuinely is no dispute about anything at all getting the forms filled out correctly so that the court clerk and gives you that stamp saying yes you've succeeded in ending your marriage\nCan be complicated and I've had attorneys who don't practice family law\nWho got a were doing their own divorce and and a friend of mine and said you know my my divorce paperwork has been rejected three times can you help and I looked at it and thought well here's why and and and was able to help so it is possible and many people do it themselves but\nUm it can be in the end much more cost effective to have an attorney help you\nAt least get your paperwork right um I Would also say one thing you should consider is whether you want to um what do you do have anything to fight about\nAnd whether those things that you're fighting about can be resolved in which case you might want to meet with a mediator and there are a lot of family law attorneys who did mediation\nUm and there's also some mediators who aren't attorneys who can help you uh\nI Would recommend that you if you do use a mediator you make sure they know about family law but there are a lot of people out there doing mediation\nSo and then I Do mediation what I Would say is\nUm I prefer if you're going to mediate the actual issues especially financial and property you should seek it through an attorney that's a mediator if you're talking about custody and visitation issues there's a lot of mental health professionals out there that will help mediate that aspect of it\nBut um even if you come to an agreement on everything as Janet was saying to do a proper marital settlement agreement and then to get all the proper documents together even to get it through to disillusioned\nCan be a little bit daunting 'em and\nOr they may have gone and gone to a legal document prepare a good example is I I had a client come to me years after they had the divorce\nThey had a marital settlement agreement and and it was like three or four years later and she said well we still haven't distributed our property and I look at the marital settlement agreement and all it says is we agree to split everything equal [laughter] that was the agreement and that was the judgment for\nYou use the phrase a little while ago distinguishing between a legal separation at a divorce can you tell us a little bit about the difference between a legal separation in divorce\nWell sure ah the legal separation means that everything except for your marital status will be a divided by a court or by your agreement so you'll have a judgment dividing all of your property it can address support it can address custody it can address\nUh everything except for the marital status so\nSome people may be for religious reasons don't want to actually be divorced and want to stay married and or maybe the only other reason that I Know of\nThat people sometimes seek legal separation is for health insurance coverage because people can continue to be covered as a spouse or you know the laws changing on that but that's been a traditional reason that the uh\nIs a child with the mother is a child with the father is a child with another parent who where does the child spent time and that's really what physical capacity is so when you're talking about disputes over custody I generally think that that's disputes over um decisions about health education and welfare and if your\nTalking about the time share where does the child spend their time and um both of those in ... in both cases California\nReally is always trying to keep the best what's in the best interest of the child at the forefront\nAnd often you know you have parents who come in and say well here's here's what works for me in and here's my work schedule you know and so I Want to see a little Johnny on on these days so that I can have date night on Thursday and be able to go to I Love going to the movies every other weekend with my friend Sally so\nYeah and that's not about the parrot right and if the child gets lost in the equation then I think you might be missing the point so when you're\nGoing when you're thinking about ending your marriage or any relationship and you know try and think about what's going to be best for a little Johnny look what's going to be best for the children\nSo what steps of the court go through to figure out what's in little Johnny's best interest do they just simply a hospital Johnny maybe you've done he's not so little but it can get into bed and so the\nCourt has a lot of um steps in place to try that because the the ideal situation as the parents make the decision for the children they will always prefer that the parents make all of those decisions\nBut in the state of California what's really important is before the court can even make any orders regarding long term custody plans or visitation orders that the parties have to go through mediation\nAnd then we get split up by counties because every county then deals with mediation different some counties are what we call confidential non recommending in some counties are um non confidential and recommending\nSo that means that before the court will make any decision at a decision at all you have to meet with we have to meet with a mediator so if you haven't already engaged in private mediation about your child you're going to be talking to someone\nSomewhere before you can make the court get a court decision and what I um when I find is is a problem frequently and in the custody issues\nIs that people are really thinking about really thinking about financial issues and they're not thinking about the child they're thinking about well if I have this child more than\n... percent of the time then I'm going to get more than ... dollars from my soon to be ex spouse or the other parent and child support or spouse will support\nSo um [noise] I Would say that that's a a a suspect\nMotivation for wanting to spend time with your child\nAnd according to the court is is a little bit uh cognizant of that the other problem that I'm seeing especially in the bay area because of the cost of living here wants to parties have split up and especially if one particular spouse either was non working\nOr was much lower income than the other\nTo try and remain with the children here in the bay area is harder and harder as a result I don't know about your job I'm seeing more and more where they're asking for what we called move away is um that they need to one of the parents wants to move out of the area out of the state and take the child with them\n[noise] [noise] ... Howard from San jose you're on the air welcome to your legal rights\nI was talking about which would be that aren't\nAren't that joy and when would that very often the lady that ran for the child\nI I think it's very rare but um I act as minors council and a lot of cases where where there's a high conflict the parents can't agree the court will appointed attorney just represent the child's interest and there are times where miners council may come in and actually file a petition\nTo have the child I'm dean it puts it puts them in dependency court in deems them a ward of the court or we join a and I've done this before we joined another party could be a grandparent aunt or uncle and plays the child in their custody it may be temporary it may end up be permanent\nThat that some unfortunate when that happens because up until the time that the party separated the child was living with these two parents but if that time that the child was spending with both parents was really not in that child's best interest anyway then\nIt it can be a good solution for the child and there'll be there'll be sent a dependency court and put in foster care usually though is what I've seen often happened with a grandparent or an uncle Arnett they try and\nPlace with a relative first if they can't place but there is a code section in the California family code that says that before the court can place a child and the custody of a non parent they have to find that it's detrimental for the child to be with other parents first\nI think it's ever been in a situation where the ... or so that like that or they get [noise]\nI'm sure a lot [laughter]\nThe children all the old adage staying together for the kids is I I get that from a lot of clients and the one thing that I tell my clients that because I'm a parent\nSo you describe how your marriage is is is the kind of marriage you want for your kid when they grow up because that's what they're going to model so a lot of times\nThe children know exactly what's going on in a marriage and if you don't want them modeling and finding a partner that is going to mimic what your marriage is I mean that's that's what's gonna happen\nWhen when children see unhappy parents all of the time it it affects their quality of life and if they are are happier separated then I'm I'm always sad when people come and say well I stayed together you know for for our for our children and\nAnd then I have to say do you do you think that that's been better for them and often thinking about it differently they have to say well maybe maybe not\nThank you very much guy how are you like to be joining us in our did\nBring up an interesting point and that is it sounds as though the\nFamily law in the family courts are very parallel to the dependency courts so you want to try to keep the children with their parents or reconcile the children's ... one of the other parents and when that doesn't work you start looking to relatives when that doesn't work you start looking at non related extended family members\nAnd putting a child in foster care as independent records you have to be the last\nThe last option that the last thing people want to do\nIt it is in and you really want to keep the child if if possible out of the dependency court dependency court actually has ... their orders are superior to family court if the case ends up independence he the family court proceedings or state\nAnd you have to wait until the dependency court does what they're going to do that is why would I Try and do if I see something like that happening in a case the first thing I Do is try and get a relative to join to the family law case\nAnd see if we can do it that way the only advantage in bringing it to a dependency court depends on the different parents is there some services that can be offered 'em through social services to the parents\nLike a reunification type of program and these services that could be a plus but the problem is once you're stuck in the dependency priests process can be a very long time and it is a taint on on the parents are and it follows them for a long time\nFor the goal is for the children to be with the parents unless it's it to the child detriment so to meet that goal a lot of efforts will\nBe made to reunify the children with the parents if if they have had been ... had to\nBe separated because it was to their detriment to stay with\nEither parents and then um I I have seen a lot of\nReunification hearings and proceedings happened and it's a slow grind and like you say they get stuck in that system for a long time and\nYou're listening to your legal rights on K O W Ninety One point seven in San Francisco will be back right after this\nSupport for KLW is provided by the bar association of San Francisco if you live in San Francisco or marine county the bar association lawyer referrals service can arrange for you to meet with an attorney experienced in the area of law related to your situation\nGo for one five nine eight nine one six one six or visit S. F. bar dot or for more information\nOn jet paid them and you're listening to your legal rights we've been discussing ... one on one what do you have to look forward to it affirmative action I guess the studio tonight are both very law specialist certified by the California board of legal specialization\nState bar of California Janet Franco with offices in San Francisco and B. J. faith based them with offices in San jose\nWell you're married Bianca I'm okay wherever you got married you're you got married and uh you are married and California will honor or a marriage that was properly done in another country I think they're\nI I Can't think of what might be an exception to that but I can imagine that there may be some exception to that depending on if if the marriage wasn't properly done in that other country but if you followed some other countries procedures in our properly married there then you're married here\nThat's generally are that's generally the law I mean I Can't the only thing I can think of is if there's some of the small Middle Eastern countries where they don't even register and the um the marriage there's no registration where it's just the uh the husbands says okay you're married to me now and I there are a couple of those countries\nThe only time but other than that ... California in the United states is going to acknowledge that marriage\nDo I have to register my marriage or an automatically should be considered as I said I married you know you know\nThe charm addict you're married but the problem we may run into from the international standpoint is if you're going to follow for your divorce\nAnd if you file here in California and you get your divorce decree depending upon the other country\nThey may not recognize the California divorce decree\nI'm a perfect example is in I I Do a lot of cases with India and because India doesn't acknowledge no fault divorce you have to have a fault if you get a no fault divorce and California is not recognized in India and you're still married in their eyes\nAnd so you have to go to India and get a decree as well and there's a couple of other countries that way because they won't acknowledge the no fault\nYou\nYou're welcome back thank you for joining us\nWe have another call but it's on its way and but as it's working its way here it's time to\nShift the shift from talking about custody issues to talking about financial issues and of course when we're talking about financial issues too big ones are child support and spousal sport\nSo let's start with cells would support how was ... it depends\nOn which spousal support so there's two kinds of spousal support in ... in the state of California\nThere's will be called temporary spouse will support and that's exactly what it says temporary pending the disillusion to try and maintain some kind of status quo\nAnd almost every court will pretty much established the amount just temporary spouse will support the way they do is child support and it's just based on guidelines the input of the two gross income and so forth and we use a software program [noise]\nThen we have what we that's only because attorneys don't really like to do math exactly we we we could do it if we wanted to but we would have to do algebra and everything else [noise]\nThen you have permanent support and that is only available to marriages of ten years or more where there's a long term marriage for permanent or long term support and then you can't\nRely upon this'll master or that type of guideline a calculation and you have to follow these various factors under family could section forty three twenty\nI think of it this way um the temporary support is the support between when you've separated and you need some support until the time that the um judgment is find on the property is divided and permanent support is support this ordered after that so even in a short term marriage you can have permanent supportive\nDisordered um and the interesting thing about temporary and permanent support is that although both of those words refer to time it has nothing to do with time it's just they're just legal words\nThat were attached to spouse will support to confuse people aren't lawyers [laughter] that's true because there is technically we don't follow permanent spousal support because under California law\nThe intent is there and it's a statute parties that are getting divorced or to become financially independent of each other within a reasonable time that reasonable time his presumed to be no more than half the lengths to marriage but that's not a bright line\nJeremy from San Francisco you are with us on the air that come to your legal rights [noise]\nHi I'm I have an odd situation uh Fifteen Years ago I was married for a week well legally a month [laughter] and um we did it on a whim when you're intoxicated anyway um\nSo uh we got a I heard deal with all the ... and everything and she got an an all men I started getting she lived in another state I started getting papers via FedEx it was all taken care of and that was that a few years later I met my ex wife\nAnd we were may are together and married a married a total of just shy of five years uh we got to California summary disillusioned or no hassles or anything they present the whole time\nAnd um and then I I remarried I married now and I come to find out you know the federal government that my first divorce is invalid because it was done on a tribal court in Nevada\nAnd they apparently had no jurisdiction and looking online they did this to a lot of people they decided to start granting just solutions\nTo non tribal members and non try residents non reservation residents and uh they were allowed to so subsequently long I've I've since just recently just a few weeks ago a pain to\nDivorce a second divorced from that first wife and I am going to uh immigration proceedings with my life if you will um but my second wife or is it I have no idea where you know we don't talk anymore and and\nThis is the second one is the summary dissolution wife\nDirect okay correct so so the federal government said that my marriage to my current wife wasn't valid so we just got remarried the other day just just as a city all over and Oakland and a good um\nAnd and we didn't we didn't bother getting a divorce um 'cause the people at the state level that we didn't have to 'cause I'm remarrying the same person\nThe federal government hasn't told us anything and they won't basically ah I tried that they won't but my second wife\nI don't I don't know what the deal I mean we filed taxes you know for five years I'm married uh jointly and I don't know is is that going to come back and fight nice hadn't come back and bite me you know\nHow many em says Jeremy you know how many years ago did you get that summary dissolution\nI got it in two thousand eleven so\nYou know you're you're just a little bit outside of my expertise as a family lawyer went but I I think you should be okay as far as the taxes go well yeah it\n... your second your second summary disillusion you would have been deemed a punitive spouse anyway at this point because you thought you had an an omen so that summary disillusion is\nUm and I heard about what I I I've actually heard about some of these ... and the divorces that they were doing\nAnd uh some of them we actually got\nWhere we called it none pro tonk where we had back dated the judgment because it was by air and it should have been entered on a on a particular earlier date we were able to get that but in your particular case you're fine now um you got your divorced from the first\nThe second would have been deemed to Putin spouse and you have your judgment a disillusion so you're good and he remarried your wife so climbing graduations where\nDo you get another I think you get are entitled to another honeymoon\n[laughter]\nUm we're still living our we've always been a three year were ... honeymoon phase will I'm but I'm not wrong\nWe went to a judge where we got a lawyer and went to a judge and ask for non pros honk yeah on the tribal divorce because it would it would facilitate our immigration stuff yeah um but they denied it yeah it depends on the judge or you're just 'cause they said they weren't allowed to do it\nYeah ends on the judge to yeah it's at the discretion of the court saying we're not allowed to do it is sometimes code for we're not going to do it\nGot it I don't know where did you get it done I mean where did you wherever you are granted I ... I Want to go there [laughter]\nIt it it's not always just the county and happens to be the judge said sitting at the time to so and I ... all over California so but it's a couple of ... counties you've\nDone everything that you needed to do I think to protect yourself now so\nThey don't pro drug thing would have my immigration stuff because it's ... it's basically they're they're ah they're saying that we have to file apply all over again because the divorces dated prior to divorce was a host\nMind marrying my current wife now proton hell I mean you know we're doing it you know but if\nI could I could say well I don't know actually the government so they don't um [noise] so I just thought maybe if I could try again for the number of heart but if you think it's just the judge and thank you for your time", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Your Legal Rights", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "01", "locations": [["Dina", -20.3, 57.58333], ["San Francisco California", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["San jose", 9.93333, -84.08333], ["San Francisco California California", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["China", 35.0, 105.0], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["San jose", 9.93333, -84.08333], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["marine county", 42.71948, -82.49213], ["S.

seven Ninety eight eight to five five that eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five five and again Ellen Gina welcome I'd like to start here we've been talking about public employees\nDo work for private companies [noise] um [noise]\nShe was in the first ... issue or the first differences of public employees are protected by the state and federal constitutions in relation to their in their employment relationship with their employer\nAnd Gina can tell you what rights sure\nSo that comes with ah\nSome specific rights I'm particularly though are the ones that were most familiar about hearing of a First Amendment rights and it's funny because uh all of her social media people are fond of talking about their First Amendment rights well you only have a First Amendment right against your employer if you're a public employee [noise]\nUm there's also a property rights a that public employees have most public employees a that says that you cannot be deprived of your job without due process\nUm and then there's a number of other um [noise] other rights again coming from the the state and federal constitutions including privacy rights and\nSome others and for those that are listening that perhaps don't have a legal background or very strong background in civics\nThe constitution tends to be a contract\nBetween individuals' gotten their states and or the federal government doesn't necessarily apply to things going on between you and your neighbors\nThat's right ... the constitution constrains the government is a good way to think about it\nSo in this instance the primary difference of of the constitutional protections apply to the employment relationship which in the private sector they wouldn't\nRight and of course there are a whole host of other protections that private sector employees have but those are mostly by statute one exception is that the California Constitution does provide a right of privacy to employees in both the public and private sector\nUm but that is a that is unique\nAnd the privacy protections also differ in terms of of public employees\nFor instance their First Amendment rights are our shirt from scribe\nDid in the way that if they if they're talking about their job a broadly\nThe employer can you can control their speech in relation to their job duties ah\nThe the case that deals with that there's a Supreme Court case ... follows involved they a district attorney who revealed things about a search warrant\nPublicly and was disciplined and complained that he could not be discipline because he was protected by the first amendment\nAnd the Supreme Court said no no if you're speaking about your job duties your employer can control what you're saying even if it is a public entity a and the contrast is that Google case the guy who published a something about\nComplaining about women and the they weren't capable and\nAnd Google was going to fire him and there was a whole media onslaught about whether he could be fired and as a private employer Google can fire you for writing an email that they disagree with a\nMan and the public eye the private sector I'm Sorry you\nCan be generally filed fired for any reason or no reason to\nLet them as long as it's a it's not it's an illegal reason there are some protections there and it's interesting you mention the ah the James day more matter uh\nAnd just his termination 'cause he brought it to the national labor relations board\nA under one of the broadest protections for a private sector employees a which is the right to engage in concerted activity under the national labor relations act and in this particular case the national labor relations board\nFound that his speech was not protected by the act um which was [laughter] I think the right outcome and certainly helpful for employers who were trying to find the balance\nBetween protecting concerted activity and also protecting a the the the rights to their employees to not be discriminated against in the workplace\nSo in a moment I Would like to ask you a bit about what specific rights that gives the employee what specific rights if any that gives the employer I Do see that there's a call working its way through and one of these days we may see the name of the color so I can actually announced it um but obviously you're\nTalking about a different basket of rights for the employees and potentially some limits on the employers maybe some additional right some some limited instances as well and that's really where I'd like to go if that piece of paper ever makes it over here [noise] okay\nTo to ask this person not to take that sign to their clothes uh\nDid you say it was a call center so this is somebody who ...\nThumb bickering between employees and the large number of them for ...\nWell that that's a problem in the workplace and that does sound like it's something that and\nOften employers to sidestep issues like that\nOr rather than having a real shame can't have a shirt saying black lives matter or you can't have a ... a hat that says make America great again they'll just say you can't have clothing with words on it\nRight and that was there actually some police cases where they were wearing pins on that will tell I forget what the pins were and they were limited I imagine that law enforcement's a slightly different because it's a uniformed workforce\nBut a ... and ... you know the question would be is disruptive\nIt sounds like it's having it sounds like it's a workforce with trouble to begin with\nThank you thank you for

one hundred for either be sure to tell them you're calling from color Chris from San Francisco welcome to your legal rights\nThanks um I have a question I'm I'm curious whether your guest has any comments on the public employee pension cases that are currently pending before the Supreme Court\nWhich which cases are yeah I Know you have a specific question\nUm the my understanding is that there is there is a one main case that are pending and that a bunch of other one has been I've been um grants that un held a Hyundai not to um and that it's going to involve some sort of issue about um where the public employees right to a particular benefit or cruise\nYeah those disputes have been going on for some time and um [noise] um my my ... been involved in some about letting Haitians we've got a we've got some clients with interests at stake so it's probably better that I don't comment directly on ah on that litigation\nIn most cases and and the question as to what benefits accrue shine a lot of the cases that I handle involve people who were terminated while their applications for disability retirement don't are pending\nAnd ... and ...\nOnce the once they're no longer an employee\nThat you no longer have a right to a disability pension\nI'm so that ah [noise] I Know that\nThat is generally where the law is now or the other question is can they take away pensions a an ideal quite a bit with those cases too We're ... says like cancelling a disability pension awarded\nUh the the avenue in those cases is to go through the office of administrative hearings and have a hearing and a\nVery difficult to win and\nI'm On the\nThe public employee pension world is kind of an upheaval because they can't afford to maintain itself\nAnd pepper has made a huge difference I mean there's been an ongoing discussion about\nVested rights and ah it ah it remains to be seen where ah where that will\nUltimately wind up that's true well my my my remedy is just hire more employees\nWe need more public employees [laughter] All right thank you very much Chris thank you for joining us\nAnd I'm selling for a moment as another call makes its way\nPerhaps not [laughter] [noise]\nGabriella from San Francisco [noise] reasons one\nWas asking if there is more info on the Scalia case on that Shelly hearing process\nUm well it's really not a hearing it's an opportunity for the employee to say why he or she should not be terminated I have had scali hearings at which I've brought witnesses to testify some times useful\nAnd and and once the ... has decided that had there should be a written decision from which you can determine why the termination was upheld and then from there the employee has further appeal rights and\nAnd and just to back up a step ah for people that are not familiar with the process\nIs Kelly hearing is actually with usually be management of the government employers are not Ah yes yes and it's not until after the scaly hearing that either side can appeal to a neutral fact find or whether it's an arbitrator or the union or whoever might be under a collective bargaining\nRight or ... or whatever and and just for background or scaly the ... the name of it comes from scaly the stay personnel board which was in Nineteen Seventy five California Supreme Court case in which it was established that public employees do have a privacy interest\nOr in their employment so that's what we call it a scaly hearing because that was the case that established that right to begin with\nSo in essence a government employee would have a property right they have certain vested rights that don't exist at the public sector the public sector equivalent I'm Sorry the private sector equivalent would be when your boss calls you into his or her office\nFor you to try to make a case or their sledding papers across the country\nWell uh uh the the scaly process is meant to be a bit more substantive than that and of course when you're private sector employer does that um they're my may already be made up and uh they may you know what if they\n\nSure you're listening to your legal rights on K O W Ninety One point seven FM in San Francisco will be back right after this\nSupport for KLW is provided by the bar association of San Francisco if you live in San Francisco or marine county the bar association lawyer referral service can arrange for you to meet with an attorney experienced in the area of law related to your situation\nCall for one five Ninety eight nine one six one six or visit SF bar dot org for more information\nSo with that we've spoken about the fact that private employers are presumed to be will\nUnless the reason is a bad reason\nBetter there'd be no reason at all\nIn the public employees they have a property right therefore they have this Kelly hearing and those hearings that follow it before we go further let me call in with him from Belvedere welcome to your legal rights\n\nI Would like to know whether a sure that the guy the\nLawyers um know what goes on in other countries\nAre say the Scandinavian countries where there is not and in hearing contentiousness\nThat exists in our legal system and in our society as a whole a say in orange Germany oh where at least from what I hear a labor and management are not at each other's throat is is there a difference [noise]\nBroad picture protection the national labor relations board has um said that basically any communication um between or among employees about\nThe terms and conditions of their employment counts as protected concerted activity um and there's a common misconception out there that the national labor relations act only applies to unionized environments it doesn't it applies to all private sector employers\nSo if someone is trying to start a union campaign\nA that is that the the statements they make in favor of a union are protected by that act you want to talk about public\nHealth would do in terms of the public employees\nAnd it will be protected under the Myers militias brown act government code section thirty three hundred can you get a little closer to my sunshine government code section thirty three hundred protects\nPublic employees organizing and operating under the ... and the union context if their activities or to undertake and\n... and further and serve organized labor they have they are protected by the California government code and it's the public employee Relations Board\nThat ... that would adjudicate disputes are related to government code thirty three hundred Myers militia brown claims\nAnd once again I'd like to remind everyone that are color night lawyers are standing by if you have questions for color the number that will not place you on the air is eight hundred five to five nine nine one seven that eight hundred K.

A. L. W. Ninety One seven\nMore over to take your calls tomorrow in bankruptcy law Leon bear certified specialist in Los Angeles will take calls tomorrow Thursday October twenty fifth between nine AM and Noone at eight hundred for seven seven three one one one\nIn workers' compensation law\nRobert Wyman certified specialist in San Francisco we'll also take your calls tomorrow Thursday October twenty fifth between nine and eleven in the morning\nHis numbers for one five three eight seven eight one zero zero and in either case be sure to tell them you're calling from your legal rights\n\nSo there's quite a bit of difference in the protection that the government employees have free speech from one source what the government can do in order to keep the trains running which is gives them some ability to somehow limit in some arenas would in ways they couldn't do\nWith private people that aren't engaged in trying\nWe talk briefly about the Fourth Amendment Jeff that would be a an area of your interest in the criminals a practice\nThat would be of great interest to me [laughter] of course we could probably go on for a couple of days if we're going to tackle the issue of privacy rights that\nThat's true well in terms of the Fourth Amendment I think it's important that people know that the employer I everything that set the workplaces basically belonging to the employer and that they can search or computer they can search your desk uh\nThe fact that a government employer is a government employer does not prevent them from going into an employee's computer or a desk\nIt might prevent them I was thinking about this in the way here it might prevent them from searching a private cell phones\nWell funny you should mention that [laughter] actually [laughter] it's still the case involving not not so long ago um well ... well the employer did the ... it was concluded that the employer did have that right um [noise]\nAnd ah in particular because of the circumstances and because uh the employees understood that um their their cell phones could be subject to search\nNow when we're talking about the Fourth Amendment Fourth Amendment is usually disgusted in the context of a criminal case in criminal law which is my area of expertise [laughter] and\nWhat might add some greed and some and actually support what you're saying is that even when we're talking a criminal case there are certain areas that are carved out where you don't have an expectation of privacy everybody knows you're subject to search when you go into the airport [noise]\nEveryone knows that will schools kids don't have an absence of constitutional rights their rights are somewhat diminished and balanced against the needs of the school so\nHanging a sign outside your apartment windows that the school can see it that says bomb hits for Jesus probably isn't protected speech according to the uh reasons in the U.S Supreme Court case um but the point being their carve outs from the area where we have an expectation of privacy\nWell that's exactly right and and you know Fourth Amendment ... analysis does apply in the area of government employment um and and it's it's cousin which does not stemmed from the federal constitution but but stems from this\nPatchwork of a statute and also the California Constitution which does cover private employees in California\nUm they all kind of come down to the same thing which is whether the employee had a reasonable expectation of privacy to begin with\nNow you mentioned Fourth Amendment rights and of course when you're talking about the Fourth Amendment you're generally talking about the United States Constitution but are there are some differences when we're talking about under the California Constitution\nYes some of the California Constitution provides for a ... general right of privacy of employees in personnel information that would generally be considered private one would have a reasonable expectation will be kept private so that means private employers as well as public employers\nA can't go Blagden about you know someone got fired for this or someone got accused of that or I demoted Jeff because he was you know goofed on the air I [laughter] I couldn't go telling people that if I were your employer\nThat isn't that correct but then that and then again those rights are shortcomings cry didn't\nAnd the cell phone case that you just discuss for the employer could search a private cell phone that was left in the offices that crap\nWill there are ... that the cases the cases turn on you know a a lot of it turns on the rules that the employer sets out at the outset so if you have a rule saying that um\nYou know your your backpack is going to be inspected on the way out so we can make sure that you're not stealing anything you've got advance notice of that ... that rule then you don't have any expectation of privacy you can't because you were told you don't\nSo a lot of it gets established at the beginning of the relationship ... and there's a question\nYes and before we get to that while we're still on this topic private sector employees have some other privacy rights do they not under various federal and state statutes\nOh absolutely I mean there are things that don't turn on whether there's a reasonable expectation of the most prominent of those as medical information ah so both state and federal law\nUh prohibit employers from asking for certain information ah and if they do have certain information they have to keep it secure they have to keep it locked a there is um\nThe prohibitions under under a the California family Rights Act and under fie huh I'm asking for somebody's diagnosis information or the treatment information employer can't ask for that\nUh there's also a federal\nStatute called Gina my personal favorite the genetic information Nondiscrimination Act\nOr that prohibits a employers from collecting are using certain types of genetic information\nUm there's also a state law that prohibits employers from asking for A People's says social media passwords and user name so there are some very specific prohibitions that protect employee privacy\nYou're listening to your legal rights on K O W FM Ninety One point seven in San Francisco I'm Jeff ... we're talking about selected issues of him in employment law in particular related to government employee put at my

listening to your legal rights on AOL W. F. M. [noise] Ninety One point seven in San Francisco I'm Jeff Hayden [noise]\nThree months ago on July eleventh ear to show what the topic a nominee has been named to be the next justice to the United States Supreme\nCourt [noise]\nWhat is the process that comes next and what difference does it make\nTonight we move on to part to\nHave you have questions from my guest or ... us right here in the studio is for one five eight four one for one three for that for one five ... for one for one three for your calling out settled local dialing area that's outside\nOur toll free number is eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five five that eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five five\nMy guest tonight is dean Johnson dean is an Emmy nominated commentator on both legal and political matters as well as a practicing attorney and our program this week we'll continue this discussion new term new court\nThe United States Supreme court begins and new court year with a new justice ... Johnson let me welcome you back to your legal rights so thanks just glad to be here and again our phone number to us if you want a Dell direct in the studio for one five eight four one for one three four\nOr if you're calling from outside of San Francisco are toll free number is eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five five\nAgain that's eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five and I'd like to start here\nDean at the start of this process some months back seems to me it made some pretty bold predictions about the nomination process and here we are how do you ...\n[noise] well we fared extremely well um if you go back to the transcripts of that program you'll recall than I predicted Kavanaugh's confirmation a by a vote of fifty to forty nine\nOr the actual vote was fifty to forty eight with Lisa Murkowski from Alaska voting president she later announced that uh had she not voted present but rather voted on\nConfirmation itself she would have voted no so that would have made the vote fifty to forty nine which is precisely um what I predict\nOr more importantly more significantly\nWe talked a lot in in in the last show in part one about the paradox that some of the senators faced in that\nAre particularly for Democratic senators in red states facing close elections that if they wanted they they had a choice they on a trade off if they wanted to preserve\nUm the chances of the dumber of Democrats taking over the Senate again and taking and we're taking over the house um that even though their consciences might tell them otherwise the rational move the strategic move would have been to vote yes on Kavanaugh\nUm those senators the Dems and in red states are facing toss up all actions didn't do so and exactly as as my model predicted um that has I I I won't say a cost this the Democrats the Senate but it is made the Senate\nA very very long shot and now I'm the changes in the voting polls and those senators states I'm a McCaskill I'm In Missouri Donnelly in Indiana and especially Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota the changes\nIn the postures of their elections um has been one of the reasons that the chances of the Democrats taking the Senate and now has dropped from about two two and seven to two and nine which is exactly what I Would predict a based on the numbers I was looking at\n'em if you'd asked me pre Kavanaugh what the chances were of Democrats taking over the entire Congress House and Senate\nI Would have answered about twenty four percent tonight the answer would be about Seventeen percent\nYou know I I\nLike to ask you about a whole bunch of different arenas individual in Tennessee where you what your thoughts are and where this goes through um\nLitigation from amid a one of the big questions that people up and asking leading into the leading into the vote on justice cabinet is roe versus Wade and this means what are your thoughts on roe Israel in danger\n[noise] I don't think roe itself is in danger but the the word you always hear 'em is chipping away and that sort of a vague non legal term ... being more specific\nUm the battleground on roe versus Wade and reproductive rights right now is is what\nLawyers referred to as an undue burden on cases come before the court where there has been some restriction uh placed a not not a bar on abortion butter restriction that makes abortion more difficult for example\nIf a state were to pull funding from any hospital that provided abortions that would be a burden on the right of abortion\n[noise] and\nThe questions before the court now are these undue burden questions when is a burden reasonable and when is it not\nI'm In the past um the justices have been willing to consider these undue burden questions and in many cases strike down of various legislative actions that put a burden on a woman's right to choose um\nThere's a real question about whether a judge a now justice Kavanaugh will do that I'm In the past um he has he has talked to in dissenting opinions\nAbout what we call religious freedom which sounds like a very good thing um but it does impact or things like reproductive rights and to which well we'll talk about later gay rights I'm because I'm\n... religious freedom says that there should be accommodations for faith based claims even where those claims contradict a general public policy so for example justice Kavanaugh has said um that a Catholic hospital run by priests\nCan still receive federal funding even though it refuses to provide contraception or abortion saying this is simply a an accommodation to the priests and the Catholic institutions a religious freedom and how far that goes is a real question and it's one of the air is one of the few are as I think\nWe're a Kavanaugh will make a real difference\nA that being said there are no I'm roe versus Wade type cases on the horizon a justice cabin on the rest of the court will not hear any of those cases\nThis term probably not next term what will happen maybe two years or more down the road is we'll see state legislatures enacting\nA various types of measures that will place burdens on a woman's right to choose and those cases eventually making their way up to the\nUh to the Supreme Court and at that point I think we're going to see\n'em just how far a Kavanaugh's concepts of religious freedom extend and how much\nUm he believes that as he told the Senate to the roe versus Wade is is a precedent that has been um sustained by the court many many times and therefore are entitled to a great way to under the doctrinal story decisis or precedent\nWhich for\nFolks that are listening in the ... outside the stadium that are non layers when we talk about starting to sites as we talk about the idea of the older case should control what comes after it so that the law is steady and dependable and we don't make bad decisions because we're relying on\nYeah exactly as Alan Dershowitz once said law is the only proposition is the only professional um where you're actually rewarded for showing that lots and lots and lots of people before you have thought of the same idea\nAnd if courts have said the same thing over and over and over again\nFor many years the chances are if you say the same thing again you're going to win and the more the idea is the more a case of sight and the for the the longer the period of time that a case of sided um the more it becomes set in concrete as part of\nUm the court's jurisprudence and of course roe versus Wade has been cited time and time and time again and more importantly it's become embedded in our culture in our politics um this is a harsh way to phrase it but people take reproductive rights for granted we assume\nThat women are going to have those rights and to change that to uh to go back and restrict those rights or take them away by judicial fear it would be something that would cause and obviously a great deal of strife\nUm in our society would take us back to an era that none of us want to remember and the courts look at that a justice Kavanaugh said you know political considerations don't enter into my decisions but trust me that they do I mean it's the Supreme Court\nOn correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't it just a few years ago we had the same conversation on the airwaves when a Justice O'Connor retired short list by conservative and it it has that been pretty much the rolling doctrine\nGorsuch was confirmed um\nBut what I thought I might do is go over some of the more significant cases that had been decided um post Gorsuch confirmation and before Justice Kennedy\nI'm retired in other words when the court was fully staffed with all nine justices ah we we can look at those decisions\nUm and we can say to ourselves what would have happened given the spread and given 'em how the court came out what would have happened if we took out Justice Kennedy and we put injustice Kavanaugh and the answer is um it's pretty clear that it would have made\nLittle or no difference in fact in those Fifteen cases it would have made no difference whatsoever [noise] um so for those those listeners who um\nDidn't care for justice Kavanaugh who thought he was a bad appointment or the message would be don't panic for those of you who thought justice Kavanaugh was the greatest thing since sliced bread and was a brilliant appointment\nDon't pop the champagne corks just yet\nUm that the Supreme Court as an institution works very slowly it works generally incrementally um it's a passive institution in that it can only decide the cases that come before it and that it wants that that it chooses to decide um\nAnd we typically you know we remember Justice Kennedy fondly I think because of\nOf over ... um which we discuss generally the same sex marriage case we were we remember Kennedy as something of a liberal as the swing vote who was sometimes on the liberal side but that's not really accurate a Justice Kennedy was quite a conservative\nHe like a justice Kavanaugh is very pro business um he had questions about reproductive rights I'm questions about immigration rights I'm so the the Kavanaugh court if that's the proper term is not going to be a whole lot different\nFrom the Kennedy court um there are few areas where they may be different uh one area we've talked about it we touched on a little bit already the area of religious freedom which I think may become a\nSignificant but to expect sudden changes or to expect that the right of privacy is going to disappear or that defendants rights I'm as articulated by the Warren Court are going to disappear or a B significantly taken away all of\nA sudden I'm it that's just not going to happen the other thing to think about is that um and I've had interns who became Supreme Court clerks and I know that um [noise] when you become a Supreme Court\nClerk regardless of your radiology going and you learn a lot about how the court functions and how you should function within the court from your justice justices are very very much men tours of uh of their clerks and justice Kavanaugh clerked as to justice Gorsuch\nFor um Justice Kennedy so I suspect his approach is going to be very much like Kennedy's and I think the court is going to [noise] to stay the same with certain exceptions that we can talk about\nThe last time we were here and I see it calls on its way too much but the last time that we're here we're discussing whether the court was truly stepped in to the right and who if anybody is left as a swing vote\nUs about that theory on that if you like to refresh us\nYou're as the as the median voter theory which says essentially the guy in the middle almost always gets his way if if you have [noise] if you have nine people\nVoting on a proposition for swing one way and for swing the other the guy who takes the middle position um is the deciding vote\nIn the Kennedy era Kennedy was traditionally the deciding vote 'em now um if you look at the histories of the various justices Justice Roberts now becomes the median voter the center guys so\nIn a very real sense I'm this becomes the Roberts Court are typically I'm you referred to a court uh as you know by its chief justice so the rent when Rehnquist was chief justice it was the ... court Earl Warren had the Warren Court\nThis has always been the Roberts Court because he's chief justice but now in a very pragmatic way it is Justice Roberts' court because\nHe holds the swing vote 'em that swing vote is somewhat to the right of Justice Kennedy so in a sense the whole court shows to the right\nBut his chief justice not only holds the power of the swing vote but he holds the powers of chief justice um the ability to decide whether he is going to write the majority opinion or he'll sign it out to somebody else\nWhich dictates how broad the decision is going to be whatever whether the reach certain issues and so on\nAnd of course that presumes that he's on the majority because they'd be on the minority that would follow the senior most justice absolutely um let me interrupt you just that we have a call coming in Nancy from Berkeley what your legal rights hey Nancy\nNancy are you still with that\nI had an editor here on the air welcome to your legal rights\nThank you um I wanted to ask your guest um he said that um because at least ... [laughter] that\nI'm that I'm\nKind of like Heidi Heitkamp Claire McCaskill\nUm voted for um Kavanaugh that um they're going to leave the Senate fate\n[noise] um but what makes him think that they were going to win the election anyway [noise]\nI mean you know I ... and Democrats and Democrats are going to vote for them no matter what so I don't understand that if they voted for Kavanaugh all of a sudden they're going to accumulate all the votes [noise]\nNo actually what I said was that because they voted against Kavanaugh a man that yeah yeah they vote they voted against Kavanaugh right on it you know it's funny if you are listening I was talking about what we call the median voters here I'm the same idea applies to senatorial elections\nAnd when you have a democratic candidate with a largely Republican constituency as you do in those cases\nUm and the election of at least historically is very very close\nOf the way those candidates act on a high profile very salient very controversial issues like the appointment of of justice Kavanaugh\nOr or the confirmation of justice Kavanaugh can really a shift the election one way or the other if you're an incumbent with a solid see that's not going to make a lot of difference but if you're election as a toss up as were those three elections than your decision on on one issue like this can shift it from a toss up\nTo um to a problem a possible or even the probable loss and in fact that's what's happening\nVote a occurred but I don't understand\nI mean I I don't understand if they had voted for Kavanaugh wow I think all these other countries and going to vote for them I don't I don't think you know and the Democrats and if they had voted for him I think they would have lost a lot of Democrats votes\nNo actually not the Democrats Democrats who are going to vote for them would vote for them anyway um but you would pick up a number of votes as you move towards the center of Bill Clinton was actually a master of the strategy when he was seeking\nThe presidential nomination he was way out to the left but as soon as he got the nomination he moves towards the center to seize upon those are some of those voters at the center and and to the right of where he was previously\nUm and it's just the the the math works out beautifully and sometimes I like I Would rather do this on TV because I can show you exactly how it works but um I mean the facts speak for themselves um the the the probability of Democrats taking the Senate\nUm have dropped from about two two and seven to two and nine which about twenty two ...\nGel Manson because he voted for Kavanaugh is going to win his seat\nUm he was he was rated as a probable when any way his his election was was rated as leaning democratic but he certainly enhanced his chances now\nYeah I don't know if I Am glad I don't know if I Would have voted for anybody who voted for Kavanaugh\nSassy Nancy I'm I'm gonna ask you to hold that thought we need to stop for a break for just now that you're walking down the line won't be gone for more than a few seconds Pam I Know you're on the line please stay with us in a month for just a moment you're listening to your legal rights on K. O. W. F. M. and we'll be back right after this\nThat come up that are coming up before the court one involving um have a florist who refused to serve\nA same sex couple and and some others um that may bubble up and may give us an indication and this is an area where I think justice Kavanaugh's vote may make a difference and he may very well find\n'em companions to follow along with them on on the right side of the Supreme Court patch was that way more information than you wanted about that\nActually it's not so let me give you a couple of hypothetical and let me let me play play with a little bit\nOkay how do you play judge and give me hypothetical 's\nOkay you're on Mormon and say you drink alcohol it okay for it at work in a bar and is there a chance to alcohol even though you're a cocktail waitress\n[laughter] okay yeah I mean I\nI go there and and for a little more serious still kinda\nUh-huh if you're up there and say yeah sorry hanging down face yeah is it okay if you work in a barbecue place and you're not going to serve the ...\nWell that you know that's the question and I think you know your hypothetical indicate that the problem with this concept of religious freedom it's\nIt's so ... that it it can include anything if you could claim that you that you're the churches fast drivers and so ... your religion dictates that you drive more than a hundred miles an hour or you therefore exempt\nFrom the speed limits I mean you can multiply absurd examples um as Justice Scalia used to say until the cows come home um I think it's very problematic area [noise]\nUm and I think it would be extremely difficult to develop a coherent ... jurors prudence based on this notion of religious freedom I mean it was originally as one of those cases are one of those cases of unintended consequences of legislation\nThe original purpose was very Salvatore was to protect the sacred burial grounds of Native Americans in their religious rights but it has it has expanded into something far beyond what the original legislature like legislators intended and may go even further\nOkay that fully intended it mushrooms [laughter]\nIt it certainly has exploded in and we're just waiting to see if it explodes and and you know washes over a lot of a jurisprudence I mean the concern here is obviously\nThat the notion of religious freedom um interfaces with notions like reproductive rights I'm justice Kavanaugh\nUh for example has said and I think I mentioned the study Catholic hospital can based on claims of religious freedom can refuse to provide contraception in abortions and still obtain federal funding um so you know how far does that go\nYeah that's a good question thank you very much I'm not really good discussion the other hand I thank you for joining us thanks Jeff thank you Bye bye\nDavid from Berkeley Jonathan from Oakland you're on the air bear with me just a moment I Do have one listener question that was called into us rather than coming on the air but this this ... thing\nAn injustice Kavanaugh what's his opening remarks and that's part of an angry he was in the corner of going back to the second portion of of the nomination hearings where he spoke after professor for after professor Ford and\nHis words this whole two week effort has been a calculated orchestrated political hit filled with a parrot pent up anger about President Trump and the twenty sixteen election fear that it's been unfairly dumped about\nAbout that I've got a stuffed about its usual record revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left wing opposition groups a number of law school professor of also expressed alarm that\nThen judge Kavanaugh now justice Kavanaugh was no longer a so called neutral umpire calling balls and strikes that based on his remarks he was not displaying the requisite judicial temperament set on the Supreme Court\nI'm Laurence Tribe committed that it's personal attacks and Senate members as partisan tirades do more than simply display of striking in judicial temperament they disqualify him from participating in a wide range\nOf the cases that may come before the Supreme Court case involving individuals or groups that just as Kevin has now singled out um\n[noise] I guess this list and wants you to tell us your response to all this do you think that he can be that neutral umpire do you think that he should be or could be recused for some of these cases\nUm well they're always cases where a justice can be recused but as I see it there there are a couple of different questions there first of all is he a neutral ... higher\nAnd the answer is no no justice is a neutral umpire every justice comes to the bench with a certain ideological preference with the certain notion of\nA jurisprudence to the importance of precedent and so on so they all bring baggage um to the bench or the other question that's always raised is a is justice cabinet does he have\nThe demeanor of a judge and I have to say that I I was appalled by\nThe display a at the Senate confirmation hearings I mean even if you're going this was a job interview and even if you're going to interview for a job flipping burgers or if the interview starts with you know I really like beer I drink beer and sometimes I drink too much beer\nChances are you weren't going to get the job and I remember a there's an old saying when you want it to describe somebody who was very sober and had his wits about and you describe the person as being ... a judge and the implication there is that sobriety\n'em and patience and calmness and equity um are all part of a judge's tool box on the judge 'em should exercise those um I I think just justice Kavanaugh\nOn may have a hard time doing that on the other hand\nUm he's managed to sit and now for several years on the DC circuit court of appeal um which is that considered the second most important coordination\nUm and he's managed to survive\nOn as a judge without any sort of behavioral problems I think he's able to keep it together on the bench\nUm how he does a back and chambers I'm how he does in the conference room I was the other justices we don't know but I sort of have the feeling that Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the others on the court can that can hold their own against him\nSo I you know even though I I I I think the display was was\nCan survive on the bench and even if his demeanor is not that great I'm Jeff and and I both know that often we encounter judges who demeanor are not perfect I mean both of us are in our many years of experience of encountered\nTirades from judges irascible judges angry judges indifferent judges um so that happens I I don't think that's necessarily going to be a problem even though you know you worry about somebody who comes to a job interview\n'em and talks about\nHow he loves beer ... well let's let's let's hope you had a tic tac or something before he came in\nAnd also the ... the notion that he buys into conspiracy theories and especially when he buys into conspiracy theories when a woman like Dr Ford is testifying about something\nThat obviously happened to her I mean that accusation that somehow somebody like Dr Ford would come before and not just the Senate Judiciary committee but before the whole world and under penalty of perjury testified as something that happened to her\nAnd she is somehow pond and some giant conspiracy I I think it is very disturbing and there's a lot about that mentality that does disturb me\nAnd with that David from Berkeley Welcome you're on your legal rights yeah thank you very much can you hear me yes\nYeah absolutely I I'm so says he started the program with er an assessment\nOf your predictions regarding the nomination I Would like to um have you consider a prediction that I recently made that first of all I should say that uh I Love your example of the of the church if that's\nDriving a with respect to religious liberty I Am a a I'm a member of that organization myself a and I\nBelieve in scrupulously of aging all motor vehicle was with the possible exception of the of artificially low speed limits\nOh you you might want to repent from that David\nAdvisable yet I'm here's my prediction that within a couple of years with regard to reproductive rights there will be at least twenty states in

landlord tenant law\nYou have questions from my guest our phone number to us right here in the studio is for one five\nEight four one for one three for that's for one five eight four one for one three for if you're calling outside of the local area or if you're calling outside of San Francisco call us at our toll free ...\nEight to five five\nThat eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five five\nMy guest in Studio ... tonight is might go to landlord tenant attorney south implanted with offices in San Francisco Sal is of course the frequent participant in color and frequent guest right here in the studio as well let me welcome you back to your legal rights\nThank you Jeff it's pleasure to be here and while we may be talking about specific areas of landlord tenant law you can call regarding any landlord tenant question\nI Want to encourage you to try to dumb I guess but any landlord tenant question you have from my guest is welcome and again the phone number to us right here in the studio is for one five eight four one for one three for\nThat for one five eight four one for one three four or five you're calling from outside of the local dialing area\nAre toll free number is eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five and again that number is eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five and I'd like to start here or\nSo before the show we were talking about proposition ten just what is proposition ten\nSo a proposition ten is a\nA\nInitiative to remove\nCoastal Hawkins from California state law and the coastal Hawkins\nA provisions ah prevent\nCity\nAnd county governments from imposing rent control on all the properties within the jurisdictions they can only imposed them on certain properties and and not the others\nSo as I understand coastal Hawkins that limited to older properties are properties that are perhaps more than roughly Twenty years old\nThat's correct and and for example or the way it works in San Francisco I'm no rent control on anything built after Nineteen Seventy nine June of Nineteen Seventy nine no rent control and there's also no rent controlled regardless of of build date on single family homes and condominiums\nDoes this actually change the local ordinances are only enables local ordinances to go to older homes good point Jeff it does not\nProposition ten does not end itself change any local ordinances all it does is repeal the California coast to hop in state law that's that's all it would do and then the local jurisdictions would then\nI'm\nImpose their their rent control as they see fit because it's within their jurisdiction to control to control rents and vacancies so they'd be able to control both of those without any limitations if prop ten word to repeal coastal Hawkins\nSo if I live in a suburb for example that doesn't have a rent control scheme it sounds pretty unlikely that this would change anything for me\nI think that's correct if the I think you're correct that probably would not change\nEarlier tonight when we were talking and as the there's calls coming in so if you're on the line please be patient with you in just a moment um but earlier tonight when we were talking we talked about proposition five proposition five is not a landlord tenant ... per se but what is proposition five and\nI'm simply would allow um\n\nHomeowners fifty five years or older to sell their homes purchase more expensive homes and essentially keep the same\nA percentage of tax on the more expensive home\nI'm so it's an incentive to them not only to ... to ... to\n... it doesn't a disincentive eyes moving but it's also an ... it's an incentive to buy a more expensive home and and not have to pay the the are more expensive tax on that home they still take take their percentage tax from the old home\nNow I'm not a real estate attorney but\nMy understanding of prop Thirteen is that it allowed somebody fifty five or older\nTo sell their home to downsize without paying a tax penalty that's correct and as I understand proposition five is that lifting that requirement to downsize and basically letting somebody has been grandfathered in keep roughly the same tax rate it\nIt does it does allow the purchase of a more expensive home without the if I don't want to call it a penalty but what ... without paying the same tax that somebody unfit under fifty five would be paying\n\nAre there any other issues that you see coming down the pipeline whether it's on the ballot tonight or next month whether it's something that might be coming up and bill\n[noise] well you know I I hear a lot of talk of um\n\nPerhaps the state should consider subsidizing\nUm housing with with\nState funds rather than individuals\nAre being required to subsidize housing to rent control uh but I don't know you know that that that's probably come up before but I you know I don't know how\nHow uh how close that is but that's that's something that I've been hearing a lot of lately surprisingly I thought it was a novel idea I don't know where it's going to go and I haven't thought it through but but I Do hear about that Jeff\nNow the governor has signed a flurry of bills last week or you are any that were like the landlord tenant that there's a whole host of bills that were signed that relate to criminal law but ended that relate dilemma tennis that your way\nIf there are Jeff I'm not aware of them I I haven't heard of anything that somebody did that affects landlord tenant law are particularly in San Francisco or or anywhere really I just haven't heard of any\nI see the lines backing up our first caller though rather than wanting to be heard on the air our first caller actually left the question behind wanted me to read this off the air um this caller is a landlord\nAnd the question is I have a duplex in Stockton and it's recently been for sale it's fully rented\nOne of the tenets has been there for three years the other for over Twenty years\nThe buyers had made an offer that I've accepted but they require that I'd give both of the current rent or the sixty they notice as they want to occupy both units for themselves and their family members\nAnd the caller's question is what if any financial obligations does he or she have towards these tenets that are going to be forced to move out\nUm if the settler who's the current landlord a surf sixty they notice is one financial obligation will be to deal with a security deposit\nAnd uh also uh\nThe sixty they notice I mean the attendance may not move they may have a basis to to fight the notices and then there would be a financial obligation there and also time because the eviction process [noise] although an expedited process still takes time\nSo that may frustrate the closing you know maybe prevent the closing I I don't know\nIf the landlord has to return to a security deposit how's that calculated\nSo a state law requires that a landlord returning the security deposit or I should say let me back up requires it the landlord provide a and accounting for the security deposit within Twenty one days of the move out of date\nAnd uh um\nTypically landlords will include the security deposit refund with in that Twenty one day period but what's important under the California state law is that the accounting is provided within Twenty one days and the money should be too but it's that the statute isn't so clear on that but most landlords will just provide a refund at that time\nUm and and the refund is for a damage to the unit not for regular wear and tear but for for damage um and it's up to the landlord it'd be reasonable in in how they charge for those things if\nThey should be able to system and finding somebody for somebody with limited means to be able to find a lawyer in this area that works in that\n... than we can on the air when we can't see any of your documents or see or what's happening in your apartment or my suggestion is you'd call the Contra Costa county bar association there telephone number is nine to five eight to five\nFive seven zero zero and they would be very helpful for you to have somebody that could look at your letters and really give you a sense what to do next and do it tomorrow first thing in the morning ...\n... ... ... for a pool for the whole\nYes the phone number two the Contra Costa county bar association lawyer referrals service is nine to five eight to five five seven zero zero\n... who wore and Tara Tara um if you stay on the line\nThere'll be somebody I Know me by friday ... okay well I understand\nI understand and if you stay on the phone somebody will come on the line and just a moment that will talk to you off the air can take a bit more time with you and give me the number is okay\nMake yo ... thank you for joining us and best of luck and tough and Steve from Oakland welcome to your legal rights\nHi there how are you I'm well thanks how are you very well thank you I have a quick question I have the building\nSix units in Oakland and homeless have moved in the area there's the who live under the overpass and my tenants say that they've been breaking the mailboxes and stealing mail\nI've gone over there changed locks a few times I Know it's my responsibility but at what point do why is is that enough is enough where they need to get a camera or some security 'cause I Can't be watching over the building I don't live there\nAnd I'm Steve is that yes so if a if the mail boxes are in the common areas it is yeah then if you are the only one that has control over the common areas the tenants don't um would they can\nGet in it's like right in front of the building it's an older Edwardian style building and I don't want to change the integrity of the building in one of those ugly big boxes and everyone has their own little mailbox yeah Home Depot kind where I can pop Locke\n\nSounds like I'm going to last year devious still with us and can you hear me yes yes now you're back so yeah\nIt's one of those crime where they're just they're older and mailboxes they're not super cheap but I can replace the locks so what I'm trying to do is just figure out is it my responsibility at this point if I have to go over there you know once a month twice a month to change these locks\nWell I I ... with respect to security cameras in my opinion that would be your responsibility because it's just going to be in the ... so if you're going to go that route\nI think it's it's your responsibility to put up the security camera or the the perhaps you can keep those mailboxes there it sounds like they look nice where they are but but maybe a you know\nPut a mail box somewhere else I don't know how feasible that as I understand you want to keep the integrity of the building and and the aesthetic value but um there's got to be a fix to this obviously you should you know let the police now I should encourage yeah and it's to let the police know so it's a you know a building wide effort but if if you're going to\nThe lady to do if that's necessary you know I I don't know that it's necessary maybe you can put a mailbox\nSomewhere else you'd have to alert the post office and maybe put signs on those mailboxes as say the male is now you know to be deposited southern place you might actually have to go to the post office and and tell them that so they know where to place the male ah but you know I'm sure you've considered that already but maybe look at it again or anything else I can uh\nWell yeah I'm just wondering is there any with the homeless situation that's happening in Oakland and they're moving in everywhere\nUm is it possible I I don't really know I mean maybe just to put up a locker or some kind of gate in that common areas what I'm thinking\nUh as long as the advantages I'll have keys to the gate and edited the security gate um you know without seeing the building I I'll just I'll just assumed that it would be a security gate and and be welcomed by that\nMight be the only solution then\nI could give you another one that might help I don't practice landlord tenant but the one thing you might you might consider is they have security cameras you can pick up fairly inexpensively whether at home depot Lowe's or even online than Amazon for a few hundred ... or something\nI've seen that\nWell they'll go back to your cell phone so it'll alert you of something changes and you could even give the address or the specifications the attendance so that they can monitor their own mailboxes on their time with the camera that you put in and that might pose a partial solution mhm\nThat sounds good to me I didn't think of it that way I didn't know that they could so if I'd either system each person can monitor it on their phone\nPrecisely a you should be able to set that up that's a few different ones out there I Am not sufficiently familiar that I Would advocate for anyone but it might be a place to start looking for a solution\nMuch appreciate it thank you and have a good night thank you for joining us\nTonight\nAnd again you're listening to your legal rights I'm Jeff Hayden tonight we're discussing proposition ten and landlord tenant law with San Francisco landlord tenant attorney south tempo while we may be speaking about proposition or specific areas if a specific people you should feel free to call regarding any landlord tenant issue\nWhether the landlord side of the Senate side or any issue that may be pressing for you um again our phone number here in the studio is for one five eight four one for one three for\nThat for one five eight four one for one three for if you're calling from outside of the local dialing area feel free to call us toll free\nNumber eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five that eight six six seven Ninety eight eight to five five\n... mark in San Francisco welcome you're on your legal rights\nCould evening a so I have two questions the first relates to propositions and so I live in San Francisco and I also own a a condominium that I read out to a couple\nAnd so I understand that with the repeal of Costa Hawkins was the last two individuals who has the power of this to a set standard\nI'm Wondering if we could look into a crystal ball if your guest has any um thoughts about what would likely be the course in San Francisco and specific to my case\nAre they going to extend rent control to single condominiums um what what might I expect because I'm I'm a I'm I won't say wary but uh I'm concerned [laughter]\nUm you're not the only one on both sides of the issue um the San Francisco board of supervisors up until very recently maybe a few days ago um they were silent on their position they now are supporting prop and then they're supporting it\nThe way um they they specifically included condominiums in in what they would control as part of what they were control if prop ten repeals coastal Hawkins so what you could look forward to in that circumstance\nI mean it's it's a gas at this point the you know they haven't made any decisions but they're probably start off by just imposing the same rent control that San everything else just rent controlled\nAnd they can see controlled so depending on when you're condo was built you may not have vacancy control but you would you you could potentially have vacancy control on it\nUm you know if ... were repealed\nOkay thank you my second question is I'm\nAs a result mark before you get there I'm going to ask you to hold that question for sure the moment it is close to the half hour or so we do need to break for just a moment you're listening to your legal rights and we'll be back in just a moment\nSupport for KLW is provided by the bar association of San Francisco if you live in San Francisco or marine county the bar association lawyer referrals service can arrange for you to me within the journey experience in the area as a law related to your situation for one size\nNine eight nine when six one six or does it s S. bar got still RG for more information and that will get that ... your legal right here on a on a leash Francisco [noise] thank you\nTo base plus all the on paid interest in ... a yearly interest amounts that will become your full security deposit and then to any subtraction is will be from that\nNumber that makes sense\nUm whole okay to pay for the painful um\nAte it it'd be a ... year whatever he did in the insurance where for that year correct and and you add that to the security deposit habitat for ...\nIt gets added but it doesn't get added in for the second year it's always the base that that the interest rate is added to the base security deposit doesn't increase for purposes of adding the interest rate\nOh yeah yeah well the ... the the the security problem which I've hundred dollars for example if you're going to be five hundred dollars cut the interest for the year ... every\nCorrect if it was it was and I'm just going to choose a random number to make a map easy if it was five hundred dollar deposit and the industry was ten percent and you were there five years you went up to five hundred dollar deposit\nAnd ... dollars a year for the for the five years so you would have two hundred and fifty dollars coming back for those five years in addition to the five hundred dollars yeah that's a good example\nOkay All right but already okay thank you for joining us they don't they're not they're not required to pay that and yeah they\nWell they should be paying it every year if you want him to you can ask them to pay it to you and and they they'll pay it to you you know that they they're supposed to pay it every year if they don't then it just gets handled at the end when you move [laughter] yeah\nThey design You're welcome thank you for joining us and Omar from Oakland you're on your legal rights welcome\nA high yeah they are ... on ah my daughter leaves say I well first I have a ... flying um uh my\nDaughter who live at home or we were thinking of gave in a city did they know it is to to the lower than that it's a two bedroom apartment and so she can leave them there\nBy now the upstairs you own a cat like K they because they bought a house that is a three bedroom two and then what will be my\nI mean nothing has happened yet this this all happened in ... was speaking\nOr so since the unions is same the has the or at least a three bedroom these kind of a big unit would pay a load of a lot of money for the mortgage I mean we can't afford to have my daughter fares so the idea was to have the cheaper your name\nFor her so that you can leave there so what would\nBe my\nWould be in my ... my colleague or or you know ... or whether the pain that Iraq would be in because the unit upstairs the same the rain now could I have read them I mean and even the ... did they notice\nTo the lower unit\nLaw where you were in that ... per unit the upstairs now is more expensive here in his bedroom so you know we we like to keep it ... you rent it because it's going to help with the the mortgage\nBut the lower your new ... one of my daughter to um buddy you know before there was a dentist and now there is more than an upstairs\nIn for wanting to lower unit unfortunately I'm not familiar with the details of the Oakland rent ordinance so what I can tell you is a you should call to rent a rent board in Oakland\nPose that question to them and then perhaps called the ah local bar association\nAnd get a a referral to an attorney and Omar al ... for your benefit the Alameda County bar association also maintains a lawyer referrals service and pay their number is five ten\nEight nine three seven one six zero\nHay and sitting seven one six said okay I figure if further west related to what the color of their ... and you know from Britain control for whatever\nThe exact right and that's where you'll find your answer I was writing thank you very much I think if you're joining us welcome and we're going to stay with the Oakland our next step is Sabrina in Oakland welcome you're on your go writes\nYes hello thanks for taking my call mine's a commercial rent a commercial space\nCan you handle that one probably okay good so anyway um I two years ago I had ... and they'd my business and because I have a a caterer that's white behind me and the past two years I have lost\nMy wife's earnings there and so my businesses have gone and uh the landlord tried to give me an eviction notice I Do have the least and I'm as do I have any reason precautions can I what can I Do their way I can collect some of the money that have lost\nA you know the answer to that question is going to be primarily in your leash or what you're responsible to do with the landlords responsible to do and then the facts that you can\nA show for how these rodents are getting into your unit that does the landlord also own the building in which the catering business is located\nYes it's a huge building to cater had just come at a time like within nine months and I got infected with Iraq I mean I have videos and pictures and he had just inherited like in your two years ago\nAnd so he he inherited the building I called them in September and he gave me an addiction though there at that time the real estate wasn't in the news\nSo I didn't even know my own leaf and that so I have to hire a lawyer just to maintain and I figured it out and got rid of the lawyer because he was doing whatever the landlord wanted so he raised my rent five times within two years\nBecause his father didn't raise the rent every year it's a huge building so it's commercial and ... have been in the entire buildings but he took care of all of them and I met the end\nSo all direct came running to my place but I deal with ... it's a beauty shop so I deal with people all the time so I lost half my visit they didn't come back\n... show rats were visible from your sales floor\nYeah absolutely and they died on my floor on they ate up my wires my phone my my towels my I mean you can hear the moving so that's why I lost a lot of customers even though I never told them I have ... and instead of the landlord helping me he just threw me a notice of addiction\nAnd told me that he has a renter already have them I have that recorded what does the VIX you notice\nThe time he gave me six days to get out\nAs the days past\nOh yeah this is this is like two years ago so it's already took care of that and then I hired a lawyer because I realized I had at least just kicked me out\n[noise] yeah\nThey only became a bully and the lawyer agreed with them where they know anything it badly about real estate law and um so he raised my rent five times within two years like I said and didn't raise any other neighbors just my um so they got scared so he was using me as an example so nobody open their mouth\nBut I'm the only one that lost clients\nThey have a different kind of business and he did take care of their ... but he never took care of mine and I did bring the um exterminators and um I had several of them come out so I Do have written proof that where they came from they located the area that came from\nSo I had nothing to do with it they came into my business\nWill Sabrina I think you've got to get familiar with your lease and see who's responsible is now I
