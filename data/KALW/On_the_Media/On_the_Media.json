[noise]\n[noise]\nThis is on the media I'm Bob Garfield when election day Massachusetts citizens will weigh in on a referendum known as question three a yes vote preserves existing protections for ...\nSo it's a no vote returns the state to it's pre twenty sixteen status quo in which transgender was not illegal a protected class\nThe messaging on the no side of question three has Fisher the sort of scare tactics you might expect in such a key battle within the American culture wars including this attack ad produced by the no on three campaign\nWhich is not simply mean\nOr woman can enter a woman cannot\nDown to the man\nIt's almost comical a anti trends video but in a remarkable exercise in political hold me out but see the activists on the other side of the question many themselves trans went door to door to share that ad with potential voters\nIt was not a random tactic it emerged based on the work of Stanford professor David Brockman who a few years ago in Florida on another trans related ballot question began applying his research findings to super charge the age old political process of door to door canvassing\nBut just plain talking to the person who answers the door\nA lot of people have skepticism about this kind of approach because they say well there's\nNo way that you could knock on a stranger a store and get them to talk to you much less tell these kinds of stories but well we actually found in the research is the canvassers who had just gone through a simple morning training were able to have conversations where the vast majority of voters who were home open the door how the conversation and told a story from their life so\nI think our fellow Americans are actually remarkably open to reflecting and thinking about their political views about these kinds of topics if they're approached in such a way from a friendly person who is open and wants to have that kind of conversation with them\nSo once you initiated the perspective having what's the effect that person becomes suddenly more open to other groups like trends citizens\nJust like clinical trials for medicine where you'd randomly assign patients do a blood pressure pill or a sugar pill we\nDid the same thing in this study where we randomly assigned voters to either get the kind of perspective taking intervention that I mentioned or a control group\nThat got a door knocked about recycling what we find when we do a series of follow up surveys three days three weeks six weeks and three months later is that when we compare the group that we had that conversation with at the door versus the group we could have but did not\nThat treatment group is significantly more accepting of transgender people across the variety of items the average effect is on the order of\nAbout Fifteen percentage points if you had to put it in those terms another way to think about it is it if you look at the change on items that measure attitudes towards gay men and lesbians and the average attitudes in Nineteen Ninety eight and twenty twelve\nWe see a similar effect from these ten twenty minute conversations as we see in the public in general from Nineteen Ninety eight to twenty twelve so that's a really really big effect\nDoes this and knock you lay them against political advertising that engages in hateful hot button pressing one\nThing we actually did and one of the follow up surveys is actually show the voters in both the treatment and control groups one of those a trance phobic advertisements to say well if we show them these ads is the effect of the canvas going to say go away as everyone retreats\nInto a transfer the corner although we do find the ad has some immediate effects we still find a treatment group we campus is much more supportive more over several weeks later it seems as though the effect of the ad has completely Evan asked what we find time again is that the effects of those kinds of\nMass media advertisements are very ephemeral\n... know doesn't your research fly in the face\nCampaign theory\nWe're actually entering the really interesting period which is sort of like when medicine move from putting leeches on people and telling anecdotes like well I put a leash on Mary and Mary's got better so you should put a leash on yourself to where we are kind of still I Would say in the early days of using these rigorous\nWorld randomized trials that revolutionized medicine so there's different versions of orthodoxy depending on who you subscribe to but my personal view is that we actually just know remarkably little about the real world impacts of this kind of campaign activity\nI don't think our study is going to be the the last word on the matter it's much more like one of the first words on the matter this particular kind of intervention but we're doing lots of follow of work on other issues like immigration abortion to kind of flesh out or understanding of this\nTV campaigns reach a lot a lot a lot of people\nAnd a door to door canvassing is limited to a number of volunteers you have to fan out and the community which is why the campaign industrial complex is built around\nTelevision advertising so let's just say the effects that you found in your studies hold true through subsequent studies and become the received wisdom\nOf political campaigning there's still the problem of of seeing enough individual voters at their door steps to really have any effect\nThere actually are plenty of political campaigns the Bernie Sanders' campaign in twenty sixteen the beta or ... campaign right now in Texas and many others\nWho have succeeded in recruiting just a huge number of volunteers to go talk to their neighbors and knock on doors so\nFrom my perspective if campaigns don't try and really think about the art and science of recruiting volunteers and building a team to talk to their neighbors then it's no surprise that if they don't make a good try at it they're not going to have much success\nAnd in terms of the dollars and cents of it I think it's also a vision of American democracy the normative leap we might like a little better too you don't need a big campaign budget or to do lots of fundraisers with rich donors to able to bankroll a serious field team\nWhat you need is a candidate or a cause that many kinds of engaged individuals' want to go volunteer their time to spread the word about\nIn two weeks' time will know how Massachusetts voted on question three will that tell us anything the definitive about inoculation\nIs there some way that we could find ourselves on sound or statistical flooding on the subject of inoculation or are we going to have to wait for still more peer reviewed social science to materialize\nI wouldn't really resist the temptation to generalize too much from any particular election result that's kind of the trap that the research on campaigns and elections and campaigns consulting has been for a hundred years but we really would like to know is what would have happened in the campaign\nIf they had done something else which of course we can't know because the campaign only happened a particular way so that's why we need these kinds of rigorous clinical trials to randomly assigned voters or districts or whatever else to say we can actually see what happens when we do this and when we don't\nYeah but just between you and me should I'd be like investing heavily in clipboard futures [laughter]\nWell I think what we tend to see in other industries that as new ideas and innovations\nCome out of academia they diffused over time and relatively slowly into the real world so I don't know that I think that campaigns will or even necessarily should\nBe taking this one study we have and never reorientate all their activities around it within the next year I Hope on the scale of ten or Twenty years we'll have built up the kind of evidence based that is very persuasive and rigorous and the prejudice reduction advocates uh will be interested in applying in their work\nDavid thank you so much ... thank you David Brock man it's a political scientist\nMatt Collette has been reporting on the question three campaign for the WNYC podcast Nancy\nMatt welcome to Adrienne thanks off I'm All right so in the late summer you went up to Massachusetts and you tagged along which the door to door campaign in support of yes on question three

that extends far beyond politics\nThere's a running joke in Indian country where people say oh yeah some other person told me that they have a Cherokee great grandmother a Cherokee princess and their lineage and so when we're out in the world and we meet people and they say oh you're native oh my great grandmother was Cherokee our first response was to try not to roll our eyes\nKim Paul ... is a professor of native studies at the University of Alberta and author of Native American DNA tribal belonging and the false promise some genetic science\nThis story for us has a much longer time line that I think many Americans understand\nElizabeth Warren's appropriation of native identity despite her disclaimer is I don't mean to sound cliche\nBut everything that taken from indigenous people will be an actual lands and resources or be it you know an image that can be marketed and used for a football team or taking claimed to ancestry and making those part of the identity that one is a spouse into the world\nOur understandings of kinship and family and tribe or not govern so strongly by the idea of having distance unnamed ancestry\nWe have a much stronger sense of what it is to be Native American that is governed by our family relationships by lived social relations that matters to us\nWe now in the fifties Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA and ever since talk of blood is lineage chance fate have given way to conversations about mitochondrial DNA and all the rest\nAt the same time there are old metaphors that persist you can still be related either by blood or by marriage so talk about how the contrast between scientific jargon and traditional blood talk plays out in native culture\nCaution people against equating blood with genes these are pretty different ideas when you weren't looking at the tribal citizenship rules even if they talk about something like blood quantum\nThese are fractions on paper that point to very particular ancestors but Don Wildman act with the turn of the twentieth century distributed hundred and sixty acre parcels of land to heads of households and of course only men and settler ideas a family at the time to be has a household\nThey would get another eighty acres if they had a wife women become economically tied to men that's not how it was in many indigenous communities women were not economically tied to men\nAnd then the man gets another forty acres for each child but in order to manage those land allotments you had to have a register of Indians well tribes and first nations and other indigenous community didn't necessarily have lists with names of their people and their can these are fluid kinship groups right\nBut now we live with the legacy of those registers and that's how tribal enrollment to govern\nOn the base role that was constructed during that time\nAnd by the base role you're talking about families that were listed at the end of the Eighteen hundreds\nYeah when you see on the back of my traveling Roman card that I'm One thirty second this one's sixteen this one quarter of this tribe those are all particular ancestors that they're pointing to that one quarter shy and Rob a whole blood quote unquote\nIs my grandfather Randy tall there it's not as if blood the physiological substance is being examined\nWe're really talking about symbolic blood and were pointing to named people and so this is the problem with Elizabeth Warren taking a DNA test that's pointing to some distance probable unnamed ancestor that nobody knows who they were affiliated with or who they were for us it's who is your mom who's your grandmother who's your great grandfather who are your cousins or your aunt and uncle's\nYou say your daughter doesn't get to be a citizen of the tribe because of these blood quantum rules\nSo in my tribe the ... they will enroll you if you are descended from somebody on the base role but in my tribe in addition they have a requirement that you must meet a total one quarter Indian blood quotient\nThey will accept the blood there's always scare quotes around that word from multiple tribes so even though I don't have one quarter quote unquote Dakota blood I have shining a rap the whole blood\nThat's where you begin to see the racial inflection I think\nSo my daughter if you were to calculate all her ancestors because I'm supposedly Thirteen thirty seconds Native American my daughter would be one half of that because her father's non native\nNow my tribe decides to move to a one eight total Indian blood rule instead of one quarter my daughter and her a couple of cousins who can't get enrolled will be able to get enrolled and we debate this every year we've got you know debates and conversations on our reservation should we go from one quarter total Indian blood down to want it\nAnd I think eventually we will you do see tribes across the country moving away from a blood quantum standards more towards ... will defend rules to try to make our roads more inclusive but that's up to us to debate we don't need the rest of American telling us what we should do and how colonized we are by race everybody's colonized by race\nTribal governments and tribal communities are doing the best we can to try to tweak those rules to include our traditional notions of kinship but within a structure that has been deeply shaped by colonial power word severe power imbalance with the U.S federal government\nDo you think that Warren was basically played by Trump drawn into this because it doesn't seem that she got any kind of educational or financial advantage by her association with the Cherokee and it may have been part of her family lore [noise]\nDo you think that she just got played into a discussion of race and and blood then the women then this is something much she got some set in the New York or you know all the things that Trump loves to talk about\nIn order to defend herself against his ... you know\nI don't think he has the intellectual ability to play somebody who is as intelligent as Elizabeth Warren ...

profiled other twins that have been shaped by extreme events could you tell us about the subject of your book accidental brothers\nAccidental brothers follows the life histories of two sets identical male twins who were born a day apart in Columbia South America in Nineteen eighty eight one pair of identical twins was born in Bogota the capital city\nAnd the other born in a small remote town a hundred and fifty miles to the north\nBut one of the little babies up in the north needed immediate care at a good hospital so his grandmother brought him down to Bogota at the same hospital as the other twins were born\nAnd somehow is an amazing twist of fate got exchange with one of the other twins so the wrong baby was brought back to the small town a week later\nSo they were essentially raised as two sets of fraternal twins when in fact they were unrelated and they didn't know this until they were twenty five when the brothers up north moved to Bogota\nAnd somebody confused a twin and one pair for twin and the other\nI went to a Bogota two times to study them and they are wonderful guys\nAnd there were similarities in many personality traits between the real identical twins despite their separate rearing but you could see that the effects of the different environments had a role\nThe twins in the city had gone to high schools and colleges the twins up north didn't go past fifth grade but I have to say that living with them you could see the similarities really popping out and the medical life histories were amazing\nThe one twin born in the city and raised in the city was basically symptom free as was his identical twin brother raised in the north\nThe other twin who was raised in the city who was not born there had a long list of medical costs\nEven the different environments and the different access to medical care did not make a difference in their medical histories and physical health which I find quite extraordinary\n[noise] so what does this

anywhere in history\nYeah so the ... story is a an origin story for money that you know has a a very long history Aristotle actually use that story to try to understand himself where money came from and what the kind of good and bad functions of money could be and in the nineteenth century as economics was becoming professionalized\nEconomists picked up this barter origin story\nFor money and kind of set it forth into the world\nUm the thing is that we just don't see that situation ever happening if you go to a New Guinea village and the highlands and see people exchanging shells for pigs you might think a ha there it is\nThis is for instance you have to ACT UP plated string decorated with calories and other precious objects which was used by the Danny people in New guinea to determine and to pay for the exact price of a pig\nThat's barter but but what you're really seeing is part of a much more complex series of relationships that people are engaged in\nThat generally you have to do with some pretty serious social concerns concerns over birth over marriage over death over the continuation of a lineage or a tribe where the pig in this case isn't just any old pig being exchanged

contemporary interests so if we want to believe that the market as it exists today and that money as it exists today is natural normal inevitable\nThan something like the barter origin story helps us justify its continued existence helps to say well look you know this is a rational response to the problem with a double coincidence of bonds which is what economists call that problem when you know
