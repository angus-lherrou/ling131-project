I Know as we are also exploring gene editing is there an argument that we should start to consider patenting or gene profiles you know should we start having like an ownership conversation about our most basic identity\nThat's a really interesting question if you look at the customer agreements of these different on line genetic testing companies it's kind of a big open question as to who owns your data\nAnd the agreements today I think are pretty clear that at least for twenty three me that you know once they do something with that data\nIn this case you know partner with a pharmaceutical company and develop a drag on its basis you sign an agreement saying you have no rights to it or you have no property interest in the outcome of it you can't go to them later and say hey you need to

to judge the red eye [noise]\n\nOttawa today the minister of public safety announced that he is ending solitary confinement in federal prisons Roger Goodell is making that move in response to it\nSmith and then there's the bc judge who ruled earlier this year that keeping prisoners locked up alone for twenty two hours or more a day is a violation of their constitutional rights\nUnder the legislation introduced today inmates will be presented with what is being called the opportunity to leave their cells for four hours each day reporters asked whether that is just a solitary confinement by another name here's what minister Goodell had to say\nIt is not a it is a fundamentally different approach would you go to the to the definition\nOf what young nations would call administrative segregation or solitary confinement it's of those two hours that are the key threshold when you're able to provide more than that as we're going to be doing under this new system with the proper kinds of interventions this will lead to the accomplishment of two objectives\nKeeping the institutions and the people in those institutions including the style\nSafe and secure but at the same time being able to continue the programming that will have the impact of contributing to the long term rehabilitation of prisoners so the key question\nIs are they going to be released in a condition\nWhere they have some prospect\nA leading a law abiding life\nOr are you just going to leave them in a condition where they will undoubtedly re offend again and there'll be more victims and there'll be less safe community was\nRough Goodell minister of public safety speaking to reporters in on a walk earlier today [noise] Catherine Latimer is the executive director of the John Howard society which has been challenging the constitutionality of solitary confinement in court we reach ms Latimer notable\nThere's an item and we just heard minister Goodell he says this is the end of solitary confinement in federal Canadian prisons what do you think\nOh you know I really hope minister Goodell is correct in terms of this being a significantly different regime than what we had seen under administrative segregation but I have my doubts I have my doubts about how this will be put into place\nHe says that the key to making this not the same thing is the amount of time that the inmate will be able to be outside of that confinement and so\nUh the two hours is considered by the United nations to be\nA not enough and that that's the key threshold that had to get past and that so that they're doubling that so four hours it would be the amount of time that they would be be able to be out of their cells and so able to get the mental health services and the other services they need what you make of that\nWhat does that do to either the rogue agent as a theory or the botched interrogation theory\nIt makes it all a charade it it it makes it makes what we've seen\nYou know everyone who looks at this has an understanding of what likely occurred it doesn't matter if you're a Senator Lindsey Graham Senator Bob Corker Senator Marco Rubio all Republicans all think democracy Yogi was murdered but yet again the one single person not coming to that conclusion as the president the United states Donald Trump\nTo come to the point where it doesn't matter that ... we we know they're lying there saying these things you know it's not too and it doesn't matter that deadline doesn't matter we're just going to at some point to that that don't accept that this is what is going to give you the truth even though everyone knows it's not and\nAnd Donald Trump and the the crown prince and the king just hope the world loses interest\nI think that as a gamble that they may be taking and I think would be a mistake on their part um I think it's very hard to imagine that Mohammed bin some on will\nEver get an interview with any other global mainstream journalist and this not be the anchor of that interview where they start you know our own my own magazine the Atlantic Jeff Goldberg writer in chief at a very wide ranging interview with ... and saw him on when he visited the United states in Washington\nA recently I Can't imagine him ever having that opportunity again without being directly\nAh challenged about um ah what Saudis ah allegedly did a against Jamal crush of having this part of it and and that's that's the future that that they're going to have if they think that they can you know try to exhaust the world with this and turn away and act as if nothing had happened\nJust finally because democracy ... was your friend to sit and said that he suspected he lives in this kind of danger\n[noise] Jamal could show the I've known him for a very long time\nI Can't speak for him now of course any more I don't think he ever conveyed that he thought it was life was in danger story that we don't know we don't see is that there is grief inside Saudi Arabia there is frustration inside the royal court there's anger\nAround Mohammed bin so I'm On that he puts them in this position because they actually like an admired and respected ... much of what Jamal was doing even as he was criticizing um their government on occasion but I think Jim all\nNew and had reached a point where he felt the pressure points were so severe um I never had a talk with him about whether he felt unsafe\nBut I think he realized he needed to take begin taking precautions\nHave I leave it there is Steve and of course will be following the story I appreciate you talking to

of the candidates culture and community and have been from coast to coast for Thirty years so I feel that it's a win for for me and for the candidates culture and people who are involved with

had the odor baby wipes and we went back to that area that we went the very first ticket we've cold and that the whole reason we went back there first was because there was a woman in the first

on billions of dollars in foreign debt the value of the Icelandic krona plummeted the stock market took a deep dive\nAnd almost every business went bankrupt\nIceland's courts doggedly pursue those responsible for the crash and last week marked the final prosecution of a former bank CEO\nAnd one of those caught up in the prosecution's was Iceland's former prime minister Gary Hart as it happens spoke with miss a Honda in September of twenty ten after Iceland's parliament had recommended criminal charges against him Carol asked him how he felt about that\nI think they are politically motivated and I think some of my old political opponents are secular political scores by criminalizing the political process and I think that's a very sad development\nThat's going to show was about but I said that are in the show to the restaurant the politics of course the banking crisis was a very serious matter\nI think no one is more aware of that on my show but the research for the crisis we're not a\nPolitical they were largely mistakes made in the system itself Barkley a sharp of outside developments but it was a set of complicated a complicated set of issues than September October to have it we have is that if a crisis\nBut you know longer in politics so what's to be gained by people in parliament voting in in to see you taken before this this court\nWill face a very good question I ask myself the same question it's a criminal charge up has been brought against me what are the charges\nSeveral different kinds of of negative ... but I have not been crushed to come up in a criminal investigation my point of view have not been brought forward\nYou are looking at what's been called the largest collapsed banking collapse in economic history it happened on your watch how should you be held to account for that well\nI have accepted my political responsibility by leaving politics\nBut it was on your watch those banks accumulated external debt that was many times last year the gross domestic product of your country was in Maine and see that didn't happen overnight to acquire a billion euros guy\nAnd aligned it was completely in line with European roads clearly this was unwise something should have been done about it we all realize that by now\nBut I don't think we could ever worked at the financial crisis it had been brewing for a long time and the problem of course was left in the early months of ... and throughout the night none of us show this company and not cited member no we're political leaders show it either\nThat was Iceland's former prime

chews up a book launch event in London we return in Cardiff, Wales\nAlison I Know that uh to Mr ... children are at the book lunch yesterday what did they tell the crowd about what this book meant to

hear some of\nThe quotes from the book read out by Steven himself it was recorded before he passed away and it was an incredibly emotional thing to listen to especially for his children\nAnd for you how how how emotional was for you\nIt was I'm ... I'm not afraid to admit that I cry policy that way he was talking about the future\nSpecifically talking about the difficulties we face I'm In climate both political and environmental\nAnd I'm One of the things I Do is is that she was trying to reach out to people especially young audience says specially young girls and trying to inspire them to become scientists and I'm One of the parts that he read out during the ... launched it was played specifically said about inspiring the next generation\nAnd hopefully by doing so we can increase the chances of inspiring the new Weinstein whether she

science making show\nThat the ... the next discovery don't know whether whether next discovery is going to come from or who's going to discover it and the next Einstein could very well be a woman exactly exactly and she might be a small go at this point in time and we just need to buy I had to stop off off getting these questions\nLike the ones I don't sit in the book you know will can be achieved time travel Cal them we populate space and things like that we need\n... in in young children to be able to answer these huge questions of all time\nI Want to get to some of those questions in a moment and how he answers them in this book but just because it it is a posthumously published book does he actually finished with himself or or how did this come about or that this this book should actually exist\nSo the book is essentially a response to the response of his first book that brief history of time because you know his his first book was so well written and even as complex

percent of Americans believe big tech companies like Amazon apple or Google have a good amount or great deal of influence on the economy\nWhat's surprising is that fewer Americans more like sixty eight percent of people think the president or Congress have that much influence over the economy here to break it down at me they're heroes and co founder and president of Edison research\nI remember a survey from the Nineteen nineties that that's the question who gets more credit for the good economy Bill Clinton or Bill Gates and Bill Gates one strongly um I think the American public definitely thinks the president has some influence on the economy definitely blames the president of the economy does badly\nBut I think there are savvy enough to understand that it's really these companies

that affect the economy to get a sense for what people think is really responsible for what changes the economy ... people were very likely to say large financial institutions as well have an influence on the economy obviously people saw what happened\nDuring the global financial crisis about ten years ago and so they can see the influence of those kinds of companies have on the economy and in general they saw that all kinds of businesses have more influence than politicians are Congress or president or many other things that we looked at two\nAnd then obviously politics is very polarizing and divisive right now and yet the strong majority the Seventy eight percent who said tech companies and banks had a lot of influence across political age and gender lines what does that tell you is it are they unifying in a positive way\nWell I think it's important that we clarify that the fact that people say they have a lot of influence on the economy doesn't necessarily mean they think it's a good influence they just see that the influence lose their and yeah this was absolutely one of the few areas in our poll where there's almost no difference between Republicans and

people convicted of possession to receive part and I would guess though wants his record wiped clean\nBugs out of the system forty years after their last visit to a Puerto Rican rain forest to biologist find an astounding drop in a number of insects and the number of creatures feed on them\nKingdom come up in a British MP says it's telling that the apparent murder I'm Jim ... has prompted outrage against Saudi Arabia and the Saudi war in Yemen killed thousands not underground\nPhenomena in the world's first all female mine rescue team to compete in an international competition is Canadian and deep down their founder always knew they make it\nDown [noise] he went through the grinder and now everyone's using one met Myrna thought all the way to the Supreme Court to legalize pot and years later the new law seems like a pipe dream\nAm high priority [noise] our guest made sure to be the first customer when a new Finland store started selling legal we'd tonight he'll tell us how it felt to buy that we'd from his own son [noise]\nGosh it happens but Wednesday edition of radio that expects the blunt assessment [noise]\n\nPerhaps you have heard marijuana is now legal in Canada\nJust checking for many Canadians today marijuana legalization has simply been water cooler talk for others it was an historic event outside of licensed marijuana shops across the country here's how Canadians reacted\nMy main goal was to be the first one [noise] buying\nMean like it's a it's like Christmas and New Year's and all in one\nDay so it's a big day for me how I wanted the variety 'cause it's gonna be a lot of different kinds of different smells in Turkey and all the different strains so it's a good idea to cut\nWhile you're really looking for\nI think it's like a big deal it's like a moment and it's like [noise]\nIt's like a crack in like the like puritanical ideals of like\nBall now that I can purchase it legally my money will go to the government set of going somewhere else or for another nefarious purpose right\nAs some voices from across Canada today which is a people purchasing legal marijuana for the first time\nFor others today is bittersweet\nAccording to a group called ... amnesty there are half a million Canadians who have convictions related to marijuana charges on today in the federal government announced that it would be pardoning knows who's carry simple possession convictions\nBut that does not go far enough for and BP member of parliament Matthew ... who address prime minister Justin Trudeau during question period today\nBy taking action to legalize and my stating clearly that he believes that the war on drugs fail and recognizing a historic injustice way it's been pointed out so clearly\nIs worried fish and the fact that we see vulnerable Canadians racialized is indigenous people\nMore disproportionately affected by that so I asked the question again Mr Speaker will they yesterday will favor explained to me\nReally and there's discrimination\nMarginalized some racialized communities across the country we're\nThat will be free\nIn order to make sure\nFollow a decent proportionately marginalized people for the rest of their life\nThat was an exchange on pardons for marijuana convictions in question period today ... is a Toronto man with multiple marijuana possession charges on his criminal record we reached him in Toronto\nMr personality to think that less than twenty four hours ago marijuana was illegal in Canada and now it's not what do you make of that\nI mean a a good step in the right direction it get\nFrom that needed to happen quite some time now I don't think it's the final step that we need to take I think there's a lot more that we can do to address what we consider drugs and drug addiction and how we ... them and how we police people that use drug for recreation or on the other\nTo believe the faculty is when they say they are not targeting innocent civilians in Yemen\nThese arms sales you referring to in Canada is part of that we are selling armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia\nBut at the same time we heard a Donald Trump say well that is as bad as it is what happened to to denounce showed me a are we really going to jeopardize a hundred billion dollars in trade ... much of that with arms\nTo add to complain to to protest the death of one man\nWell that is exactly why we shouldn't just be focusing on one man although it is important to use the tragedy of anyone's death ah to talk about the wider issues and is it important to say the city's not to protest for one man to to protest for the\nThousands of people innocent people who have died because if you are in which case providing the um avid planes providing the navigation providing the servicing of those planes\nUh the reality is the teacher's not supplying just these big ticket weapons eighties person and the allies NATO allies particularly conducting this war and we have to take responsibility for that\nYou think though that did Great Britain or will learn take a lesson from what happened to Canada as you know\nOur foreign affairs minister recently even before the case of a general ... she complained about the treatment of human rights abuses going on in Saudi Arabia and Canada received very severe diplomatic sanctions from Saudi Arabia is a huge\n... we didn't get much support from other countries as well and you mentioned that dust up do you think that that may stand as a lesson to other countries that might stand up to Saudi Arabia\nWell I Hope that it shows that we were cowardly and not supporting a commonwealth ally in Canada and we\nShould actually follow suit a there is always a danger if you don't stand up then you find you a next on the firing ... and yes there will be some\nTough words and some of it sent back to go forward either way but it's all I Would prefer to see a country's\nStanding up for it to dry and having a combat pay all their eggs bold than um find we have unwittingly supported the ethnic cleansing of a particular group of people in the Yemen do\nYou think that the war in Yemen will ever be the focus of our criticism of ...\nFor lots of people have asked to fight it out of mind and the Yemen is an incredibly complex and difficult comfortably that means that uh um is it easier for people to forget about it\nDo you think though that it's easier to wrap your head around our heads around the violent deaths of one man then to contemplate an impending famine is they're now saying is the case in Yemen and Thirteen million people\nIt it's always the case isn't that the the the two um rally around the example of one\nLove one thousand I'm ... and as I say it is the ability of politicians\nAnd journalists to to expose the example is about the pattern of behavior of an aggressive or violent state\nThat has been a hotbed of many of the MEK snuff the ideology is that we see it in a world today and that full it must be a wakeup call to stop 'em a conflict and cooperation with um with the dangerous regime\nIs there a similar they proceed speaking with you thank you thank you very much\nLloyd Russell ... is a British Labour MP we reached in London and then a U.S president Donald Trump was asked yet again about what he's going to do about the disappearance and apparent murder of Jamal ... here he is speaking at the White House\nSecretary of state ... going to be back probably late tonight or early tomorrow morning he went to ... all over\nBut he spent a lot of time with the crown prince\nAnd he's

want a big step for we took away that ridiculous deal that was made by the previous administration if you look in Saudi Arabia they're an ally as there was tremendous purchaser\nOf not only military equipment but other things what I was there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty million dollars worth of things and a hundred and ten million dollars worth of military\nBut those are the biggest orders in the history of this country so there are an important ally but I Want to find out what\nHappened where is the fault and we'll probably know that by the end of the way for my ...

I gave you both\nNames yes now how about the the other one is what\nAces teams are THC okay\nAnd how do you sound sold your product yet\nUnfortunately I haven't because I've just come back from holidays and I haven't been doing any aid for a month and when I tried I got sick but\nThat's because of a a medication that I'm taking for osteoarthritis and so on then I have a respiratory problem that uh it was exacerbated by doing vertical ... stairs in Portugal [laughter]\nAre you a regular user you just trying to support your son's business\nMy regular user and um have been for fifty years not not not starting after breakfast or anything like that\nBut at the end of the day at the end of the work day usually before supper I Would I Would have a joint and or maybe a ... show before going to bed to help sleep\nDoes it feel good to be able to actually tell the world that without having to kind of hiding sneak around have\nNo idea what it's like short to come out of the closet 'cause it's it it it's just a relief whereas before I Would be very circumspect and only talk to my friends who I knew\nAnd uh but now it makes it all the different sort of the world because\nAnybody who says to me ... this that well you know it's two thousand and eight gain this should have all been done fifty years ago when the true do you know they should have said I'm going to legalize cannabis watch may\nOkay well and you had you actually have a story about how he had to do the father the man who actually now has legalized that that\nIs correct ... went and worked and worked for him diligently at no charge to organize the largest political capital trade ever held in the province of land and I'll tell you one of the key organizers was Mr rex Murphy\nUnderstand part of this story takes place in the woods\nSo that was in a place called carbon there and it was at a hotel and they went first stroll with the security people you know behind Trudeau\nWho's that initial ... rex Murphy and here today\nAnd fear and whether rex let down is a good and tell you about that I have\nHow consequential you research is is that scientists who have we do or responding to what you published are\nIn shock that this is around the world and extremely disturbing a research report did you has released and and ... and we've seen this everywhere we're seeing declines in all kinds of\nAnimals and and parts of the food chain why is it so much more significant in spite of Puerto Rico\nWell that's a great question yeah I'd like insects are declining globally um frogs\nHad been crashing and going extinct for the past Fifteen to Twenty years\nThat's thought to be primarily a fungus and affection but the consequences I think are so somewhat unexpected\nOf our study in that if it's replicated and we'd need more data keep telling everyone that but it's true on these are complex systems we just did a little kid a rain forest um their indicators and in Mexico in the tropical dry forests Andres and I studied before\nThat a similar declines insects as occurring but we need more data um so the implications however are truly frightening because this has been overlooked central a phenomenon that has profound implications for the future of tropical rain forest\nIf the insects are found to be decreasing and other tropical forests and we are getting the effects on the food Web that we noticed in Puerto Rico then that is a major major another major negative\nComponent for the future\nOf by a diversity and the preservation of systems um I think it was unexpected it's a it's a rather unknown effect in tropical rain forest\nBecause people don't measure insects and I'm like that's just been true I think they just take it for granted it's the tropics they're warm they're doing fine maybe logging um in some cases no pesticides would have an effect\nBut not this kind of extreme collapse\nAnd so why why why do you think is happening in ... yes well ten years ago actually colleagues\nThat tropical insects would be exquisitely sensitive to increases in temperature and that was counter intuitive for many biologists including myself because you'd think oh wait a second they evolve and how's it going to affect it by a couple of degrees of funny\nBut they showed it probably is a very narrow range thermal tolerance\nFor that was their predictions born out many laboratory experience but Andres I went down to Puerto Rico to the first truly happening in the tropical rainforests and as far as we can tell the story chewy predict should have been born out\nBad and it's just devastating do have this News I'm glad you went there and ... back this research and I appreciate you towns thank you thank you so much take here\n... lister is a biologist with the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute we reached him in West Stockbridge, Massachusetts\n\nHe made a bid for some freedom was swiftly reject it Paul Bernardo had a parole hearing today the convicted murderer and rapist has been in prison since Nineteen Ninety five\nThe mothers of Leslie my happy and Kristin French to have Mr Bernardo victims red impact statements that the hearing a third woman who was raped by Mr Bernardo and survived read a statement as well\nMr Bernardo spoke on his own behalf he admitted he had quote hurt a lot of people but claimed that he no longer poses a threat to the parole board disagreed Mr Bernardo will remain behind bars\nTim dancing the lawyer who represents them happy and the French is spoke to reporters after the hearing\nEven before today um and it isn't the victim impact statement on O'Donnell referred to it specifically in her victim impact statements that there's never been an apology by ... never any indication whatsoever of remorse and uh\nYou know I think some self pity that we saw today and there was nothing that we saw a ...\nYou know reached out to the family to say I'm Sorry and that he's remorseful when he talked about was he knows that what he did was wrong and it was terrible but that's something different than reaching out to the families and and apologizing to them directly\nMr dancing was also asked for his impressions of Mr Bernardo statement before the parole board\nI thought that he was exhibit age to be Frank I'm\nHis explanations about justification\nAnd his self esteem I don't think that he had an appreciation\nThat he wasn't helping himself\nUm but as I said and I mean this sincerely I thought the parole board\nWere was very well prepared and and and and had really done their research and understood the file and asked important questions to bring out a some of his responses so you know we really do applaud the parole board for that [noise] um [noise]\nSomeone like Paul Bernardo talks about well what what my ... my trigger is is a is low self esteem\nLet me just take that by itself in light of his his history\nThere isn't an expert in the world of psychiatry and psychology that wouldn't tell you that\nHis explanations where we're proof positive that he represented a very serious threat to public safety and even more so for the board as they did do reaffirmed the dangerous offender designation which is ...\nDangerous so\nI don't think he did himself pretty good\nTim dance and his lawyer for the families of Leslie my coffee and Christian French Paul Bernard has been for parole was rejected today he's been in prison for twenty five years\nMm\n\nThey are a Canadian mine rescue team called the diamond in the Bronx and they just made history the diamonds are the first all female team to compete at\nThe international minds rescued competition even more impressive than not the competition was in Russia where does actually illegal for women to work in an underground mines Terri Lynn too which is the founder of diamonds and the rough we reached her in ... beach just catch one\nCarry what does it mean to you to do so well in this competition\n[noise] um I guess that's the opportunity to raise awareness on diversity equation with a specific focus on emergency response which has been a dream of mine for eleven and a half years so it was a lifetime\nAnd how to others in Russia at this competition how did they react to seeing an all female team of mine rescuers\nIt was it ... it was positive all around from the time we arrived in were introduced at the opening ceremonies we receive nothing but a warm welcome we received standing ovations anytime we went up on stage during our final like a relay race we\nReceived a standing ovation and can't pay chairs from the crowd yelling Canada a diamond ... than it was just\nAmazing I've never felt such a warm welcome anywhere so it was it was overwhelming and diamonds are there are that's the name of your team yet but I mean when the team and also the name of the nonprofit that money\nBut in Russia as you know this is a country where it's actually illegal for women to work in underground mines\nYeah it is and our team was the first women to perform and work on the underground workings of a mining operations in Russia\nWhat does the men say about that\n[noise] well you haven't received any negative feedback so far it's been positive with the other competitors it was nothing but positive reaction there with a few competitors that actually came to us and told us when you were that\nThey were so impressed with us that they were going home to their daughters that they could do anything to\nDo so and the competition itself what did you actually have to do describes some of the events in this competition\nThere were seven events total one living underground formulation where you go underground and you're actually perform work to address the problem or whether it's finding people and putting out fires that kind of thing it was a separate firefighting competition where we had to go to\nA confined area and address a fire which relation we also had a virtual

should be taken with their design Jamie it's us into the lawyer and author of the new book future politics living together in a world transformed by tech\nHe argues that we can actually design algorithms that reflect our highest ideal\nWe all building these systems they all controlled by humans they all owned by humans they all designed by humans\nIt is not to be on the Ken of Google to make a system that doesn't come up with criminal background checks every time you search for the name of someone who sounds African American because it may well be that if people have clicked on that\nSo why would you build a system to replicate that rather than one which activity count as it\n... it does it gets back to the who decides question though right I mean you are asking humans to make value judgments in order to create better algorithms and some of those value judgments might be obvious but you know we don't agree on much apparently anymore ever\nI completely agree with you but let's just break this down\nJust looking back in the grand sweep of human history there was always being contested values bought humans have struggled for for\nThousands of years is with some degree of oversight or at the very least some degree of transparency about the decision making abilities to affect our lives and in the past they may be kings will conquers today parliament and in the future there'll be increasingly those who write the code the shapes all day to day lives\nI look forward to a time where we can debate in good faith\nThe political implications of Google's algorithm traces algorithm but the truth is most was kept secret just now and if we can get to the last two well the one that I just described I think it would be an improvement on today's because at the very least then we can try to agree that the papa shouldn't just be the enrichment of the ... the Robin the common good as a whole\nIt feels like when you look at all of this the distorting force here is going to be capitalism right like the the reason not to make the algorithms transparent is gonna be competition and that seems to be a hard forced to overcome\nAnd that's a key argument in my book what we have is systems that are being generated developed and deployed pursuant to the logic of capitalism which is fine but actually the consequences are kind of political\nI'm the logic of politics would say at you they should be more used for the common good they should be regulated in the scene where is the logic of capitalism says they should be used to compete and they should be used to enrich\n... author of the new book future politics living together in a world transformed by tack on that enrichment note Google recently canceled a contract\nTo develop a I with the department of

back the nine years of her life that we took away but we can go some of the way in acknowledging that she is an innocent woman and she would be freed\nCan you remind people of this story and what she did this is all goes back to a neighbor accusing her doing something over a couple of water a dozen\n[laughter] yes a few I had a dispute with someone\nWorking on the field and as a result of that dispute that person\nAccused her of committing blocks from me and it took him a bogus accusation to the civil courts five days later with five witnesses all of who was a witness testimonies war or

or or hurt or or or understood perhaps and that can be a real struggle\nAnd I'm Glad I mean this is something you you walk down to your job because it just burned you so much that this was the case and so we have what have you heard what are you hearing some other journalists of color about you exchange the globe\nYeah so since I published a piece on Monday I heard from\nDozens of journal so colored dots majority of whom work in this country and they shared the same experiences of not feeling as though the representative of not feeling as though their voices are valued and and you know some people have left\nJobs over at some people have taken on different roles just so they don't have to write and so you know what I've heard is that the struggle is is a lot more widespread for journalists of color then people might might recognize\nEvoked as a journalist who ten years and you write in this piece that you say there are solutions that are pretty obvious what are they\nYeah I mean I think sometimes there's a tendency to talk about this issue as though I'm well how are we going to fix it it's very complicated but actually I think it's actually very simple I mean you you know you hire more people of color\nYou hear their voices and and and trust them and empower them to to report on what they see as important and you know you elevate them to positions of power on them so there are\nPeople of color higher up in the chain who championed those stories and I had to help with their framing and I just think that the solutions are are fairly obvious\nThat what do you think's last with your departure I mean at some level you thinking well maybe I should stay and fight the good fight and that if you leave then you know you just once you have people of color in your newsroom\nYeah I mean I think that's sort of part of the struggle if you leave you can feel like you're letting other people of color down and that's one less forced to fight for you know the issues that you've you as as important but I think to me ultimately I felt I wasn't really providing that much help anyway and that might experts have been\nSort of few tile and so it was probably time to go but I just I didn't make that decision lightly\nSandy ... de ... speaking to you thank you thank you\nSunny Dylan recently quit his job as a reporter at the globe and mail we reach Mr Dillon today in Vancouver we did request a response from the globe we did not receive that response before we went to air but you'll find more on this story on our website CBC don't see a ... a I H\nMm\n\nWhat if somebody took your average paperback and shrink it to roughly one quarter of its size and then turned it linked wives who made the words read horizontally you could put the pages ... instead of left or right or left to right\nCongratulations if they did that you have a device of the books are known in the Netherlands where the format was born in English there cold slipped box on this month ... North American publisher released the first slip back here\nThere are many versions of four young adult novels by John Green do Strauss ... is the president and the publisher of ... books for young readers we reached ms Strauss cable in New York City\nThis just gave a what's it like for you the first time you have to have one of these flip back in your hands\nUh they were pretty much a revelation to hold in your hand or you can explain then describe them as we've been trying for a long time but when you really hold one there is just a perfect balance of design and mechanics and they feel like something really special when you see them for the first time\nHave to say when I haven't had one in my hand because I just saw the images today but it looks like something whose time has come we should have come a long time ago\nWe hope so well and they've been doing this amazing ... and the Netherlands for so many years and they've been introduced in various countries in Europe but really in in their home countries where they've done the best\nAnd it it really is the ... to me that they haven't made their way over to North America yet but I'm delighted to to bring them here and they they really are sort of an answer to a question I think a lot of print readers have in terms of\nJust the portability that were used to and our lifestyle but with the luxury of print that so many of our readers we know prefer\nJust to I Know it's hard to do because you do you see them you can't have that kind of oh my gosh yeah of course yeah as as best you can you describe what one looks like four hour radio listeners\nThere there are several things that make them really special in terms of construction so they're really not just teeny tiny books shrunken down a they're a horizontal format which you can tell when you're looking at it and so they're very genuinely easy to hold in one hand and flip the pages\nThe spine is not a traditionally so inspiring it as a hinged fine the can truly flipped the top open and hold it more or less flat\nSea you have the ... aspect plus the sort of top to bottom horizontal reading of the flats finding the hinge and this ingenious flee special nailed paper that's just paper thin but has almost no show through and super sturdy\n... closed it was about the size of a smartphone\nYeah it's almost it's almost the exact same size as my smartphone and so in in the case of some phone smaller in fact a little tiny bit sicker but easy to slip into it back pocket or even a front pocket\nSo it really is a pocket book I was wondering why they call them pocketbooks I never had a positive yes and the taxes and to smell\nThe text is not small at all it's not shrunken down really so\nWhen we went into it we broke down the text I worked with my art directors here I'm at ... and we read ... pages of paying attention to lie in town and they sang and the best fonts you could really read it so we worked really hard\nAlmost any print book and the trade\nBut now that the paper it's different because in order to have as many pages as you would for a book you need to is a different type of stationary ... would describe that for us\nAnd it is very similar to and in fact is um it is like Bible paper um the publisher the printer that we work with and the Netherlands is historically by trade a Bible publisher and this is an innovation they came up with many years ago\nUm so it does have that same thing paper but they get it\nFrom this one single meal and Finland I Believe where it is reinforced so it really doesn't or if it's quite sturdy\nUm we had a a laundering of one of them in my household\nMy son left one in a pocket which\nMost folks would not survive and yet came out a little soggy on the other side but the paper was completely attack so they can put up with a lot\nSo they'd been you've tested they have been used tests that they have made a trio an adolescent boys laundry\nAnd which is a good thing because you're the first of these books are going to be for young adult readers is that right\nYup we're launching John Green with for us has back list titles and he is you know his historical young adult author though his readership is very broad and cross it's a lot of demographics and one thing we know about young readers and which is across the whole spectrum of people who read our titles is they really love print books\nWe know that they are looking for print title if they're not migrating to eat\nAs some adults have so we know it's something they're looking for\nWhen we know that people would turn to the readers because it had that ... nature and that was easy to just carry uses light\nBut then people were then returning to books but again frustrated sort of caught between the two world so are you suggesting that this is something that could be the happy compromise between the compatibility of an e reader and and the the tangible thing who book\nThat is definitely the hope that um it it is definitely true that it is not particularly hard to carry around a paperback\nBut the reality is that the ability to you could slip in a pocket or handbag her purse or a tote you know book lovers like to always have a book at their side I'm at too great way to always have a book with you there just perfect for travelling at all the amazing to see\nYou know people use them traveling and we know that that's the way they've worked before so\nHave you tried doing it as they say you can do it just flipping the pages is just as you read horizontally\nI have and we've had some people take them out and they seem to manage to read on mass transit and hold on at the same time um so yeah you really can pretty much do it with one hand\nAll right we'll be watching for them I'm sure we're going to see them a great ... thank you thank you bye\nJulie ... who's the president and publisher of books for young readers we reached her in New York City and if you are dying now to see what a device ... book looks like flip over to CBC ... age\nThat might have a life\nAnd yet we have heard from none of them just a big puzzle that we've uncovered as well\nAnd we tried to contact them I don't think we've done well maybe that's the problem that is right that might be the problem can you just take us back to the day this launch march of two thousand nine what was that like to do that on to what was it like to be there\nWas absolutely marvelous to actually see this big rocket and see the you know our space telescope on top of that that was marvelous and I had an opportunity I was told you could be in the control room bill and say your name over a fire\nOr you can spend your time with your family watching the launch well away from the large\nI spent so much time away from my family building that mission so I said no control room would be a wonderful experience probably rather be with my family and so my family and I\nAnd some of our colleagues from the measure were sitting there watching this magnificent missile was ... a far ... go into the sky it was absolutely marvelous I used to talk about how wonderful that was at night was the most exciting night of my life\nMy wife said no it was the second most exciting night in your life\nFor the most exotic ... I Would presume that you got married however you interpret [laughter]\nWould you win which is over the years and people said you know what we had a lot of pushback and and you you resisted you if people know credit you with having done that you hadn't been so resistant wouldn't be there\nYes we ... we proposed five different times you know only the fifth proposal was accepted and it takes a tremendous amount of work and I'm from a lot of people to put together a spacecraft proposal Carl Sagan was one of our members our team members I don't know if you remember Carl Sagan of course\nAnd every time we would fail I Would have\nLetter from Carl Sagan yes yes I Want to try again I think it's a great mission and I'll be feeling better so\nA few months later yeah I have a letter on my wall\nSo the Kepler telescope is now retired and I understand there now says project called taps his lunch this is the satellite is going to be watching those dies\nIt's actually on orbit it's actually sending data back down but they've already found several planets and the nice thing about tennis Kepler was a discovery class mission it was a probe into the galaxy\nOur plan is common or rare earth comedy or rare just give us those numbers so we can build a new mission which is what kept her get now test comes along and says let's look at the whole\nSky and find the closest planet to start to throw the closest stars and so we can examine them with the James Webb telescope and we can examine them with ground based telescopes the new big telescopes coming online and find out more about these individual planets\nSo that's the next step in our exploration of our galaxy\n... appreciate speaking with you thank you\nYou're most welcome by by\nWilliam ... is a retired NASA scientist

up coral evolution and create stronger reaches her goal was to breed what she called super coral coral that could withstand the effects of climate change\nBack in March twenty sixteen ms gates was on this program to speak about that super coral here's part of that conversation\nWe're approaching this um it it is true but the umbrella time it's the assisted evolution and what that really means is accelerate seeing what nature does\nI'm On long that timeframe and the time to do that in a shorter timeframe\nAnd there'll be ... to do that but the climate is changing much more quickly than coal can keep up with so\nWe do that really through using things like selective breeding when we will will identify the most recently in oil resistant Carl's on the reef fan and and really read those calls that we have offspring that happens best genetic underpinning for\nFor future resistance just stress and we're also using conditioning experiments way we really are trying to\nExpose calls to conditions of the future if the goal of triggering the memories the epigenetic Hoff ways that will then ultimately the cost down from generation to generation\nBut then this is a kind of survival of the fittest\nIs that that means that if we encourage survival of the fittest we reduce the diversity others corals are the ones that aren't strong and can't adapt to these conditions that we stressed upon them aren't going to survive\nWell and if we do nothing that's exactly what the outcome will be and I think that that's the pulling back from the context about what we've observed and we continue to observe the call leaks in Nineteen Ninety eight to the media we lucked Eighteen percent\nOff will three in a single warming event that is enormous so\nOpposite effect it is if we stop and stand back and just let things take that course we will have the most severe genetic narrowing the ...\nThe entire collapse of reach for them and I'm not willing to tolerate that and so as a biologist I'm going to throw everything I can possibly throw\nThis problem and and off the question can we come up with climate change adaptation strategies for corals that could potentially allow us to stabilize

voting standards and gave election offices a bunch of money mostly for new electronic voting machines but within a few years election security officials were asking for a good old fashioned paper trail\nAnd so at that time around two thousand six a couple of vendors quickly designed a paper trail if they sort of just slapped onto the equipment and it just didn't work\nThat's Dana ... she runs elections in Travis County Texas which includes the city of Austin\nIt was a rather gigantic failure if you can imagine a voting system with a cash register tape under glass this was now most of the

so Dana divorce set out to design her own\nOr secure transparent auditor bowl and reliable\nSo we start or what we said was let's try to fix several of the problems that we have with electronic voting including the fact that it's too expensive so we we wanted it to be an open source system\nWe wanted it to be very easy for voters either so it had to be something that they could take the paper out at the machine and look at and examine themselves\nThat system would let both voters and election officials verify that votes were cast correctly after some heavy lifting on and designed to before I went looking for someone to build her dream voting machine and there were no takers\nLast year she went back to the voting machine vendors to see if they could meet just two of her requirements\nOne of them is we must have a paper trail that actually work and we not had the capability to use that paper trail we have to be able to conduct post election audit\nAnd it turns out one company was able to make that work\nThat's good news the marketplace has come a long way even if it has taken a Fifteen Years and the incredible patient says voters to get this far\nUnfortunately the new machines

creator has died at the age of Ninety two darkest Riley was the supervisor at the camels Test Kitchen when she invented green bean casserole in Nineteen fifty five\nLucy long into food folklore ... who has looked at the enduring popularity on this particular casserole we reached her in Bowling Green Ohio\nProfessor long hounded door kiss Riley come to invent the green bean casserole\nShe was at work is Riley was trying to come up with so just shown to help people could use a product that Campbell Soup was already producing so she came up with the idea of using this as if it was a white sauce\nPeople were already making God for all types of things so it was just a matter of you in the canned food and sort of making it from scratch\nAnd was it always intended to be a Thanksgiving dish\n[laughter] oh you know I ... I don't think so and the Midwest history quietly news for everyday meals as well as ... bought a family gatherings in general so by is not only the Thanksgiving here\nNow as a kid I had a lot of frozen green beans and cream of mushroom soup but never to gather um what what does what does the green bean casserole tastes like\nA it's a it's like green beans next done with that [laughter] so\nYeah it's a and I think if people didn't call it a casserole they just think of it is green beans with white sauce\nDo you like it more than in small quantities [laughter] so\nAnd there are variations we make the heat and very Asia and then you can do it very upscale\nSomeone described the original recipe on Twitter as tasting like what cigarettes would you agree\nNo it's not that bad [laughter] if\nIf people don't like their food mixed together they're not going to like ... and ... and a casserole are kind of stereotyped as being something that\nHealth wise and and the west may they became very popular in the night and have you here when those magazines all sorts of stereotypes and jokes about casserole is in general\nRight now the dish only has a handful of ingredients and it involves less cooking and more combining of these ingredients this recipe get to be considered iconic when really it's not much of a recipe\nIt doesn't require any polling Harry training at all which is part of the reason many people dismiss it as not being real cooking but it's also part of the reason that it changed so popular it's something that anyone can make\nAnd you're guaranteed to have an edible out on\nUm it might not be as hate is some people that liked but people who don't have a lot of money to experiment or they have expensive ingredient by take we're making some done very elaborate and then it doesn't work and they have to throw it out we bean casserole always works\nIt's hard to think that a recipe like this would be a hit today\nObsession why do you think the green bean casserole was such a hit in mid century America\nIf you keep in mind that the Nineteen fifties was following on in the wake of World War two\nThere was a sense of everyone wanted to be eating this fall I didn't want to have exotic or things that were censored too to Bahrain\nMuslims have to cut cut across all socioeconomic level so if you wanted to make it add things that were very expensive you could you know but the basic ingredients were very inexpensive\nPills so this is a very democratic type of dish\nOn as very conformist which is what people in the Nineteen fifties wanted\nAnd and it became a tradition and in this one that is still popular today a particularly around Thanksgiving isn't mainly ... do you think\nI Would say in in some places it is not at all because\nIf it's something that you know the mothers and grandmothers from the Nineteen fifties were making and then it just became part of family tradition um I think in in the mid west that it represents the industrialization industrialized agriculture that characterizes the region\nOn a lot of the food processing factories are in this area you know so that when people say eat local you know then the the Campbell's Soup factory that ... there's one that's about thirty five minutes away from the ... local\nTime usually\nWhat wouldn't even know if it is part of the local scenery and as part of people's occupation is part of the landscape\nDo you think it's important that people know about darkest riling that she was the one who came up with a recipe\nIt's always nice for people to get recognition but I think it's important for people to realize that food is that our invented for commercial reasons can become something that is personally meaningful and it can be part of\nFamily tradition mhm and it can be part of a regional tradition\nWill you be making the green bean casserole is Thanksgiving\n[noise] um we usually make a ... version and they get from scratch so\nYeah what substituting the milk with ... ... what are you and\nWe usually we do to use all and then the milk little mushrooms fresh green beans we prefer like coastal flavored all known although although

were seven hundred Ninety six babies in those ... both an every babies being identified\nBecause I Believe that my sister is affecting the five year old woman living her life them what may be counted to maybe America who has no idea of a history a wet she literally comes from\n[noise] if you do find her remains in the graveyard what would you like to see happen\n[laughter] but when my mother died two years ago we never put a new headstone on the grave because I don't want to have stone\n... No Child but not with telecom I'm married now but it's where you know if we can offer\nLike hey I Wish you the best of luck in finding your sister think probably they not thank you thank you know by that was a net McKay we reached her in Barry England\n\n\nIt has been a bumpy year for the former leader of the Ontario progress some conservatives Patrick brown\nIn January he looks set to sail into the premier seat here in Ontario and then to see t._v. news story described allegations of sexual misconduct by Mr Brown against two women Mr Brown denies the allegations pot was made to step down as leader\nAnd then on Monday Patrick brown was elected mayor of brampton Ontario the period in between had been a roller coaster as Mr Brown failed to get his old job back and then sought a new home in Ontario politics\nA metro morning host Matt Galloway summarize the ride in an interview with Mr Brown this morning\nHere's the last nine months for you you went from being a progressive conservative leader to the former leader to a progressive conservative candidates to a former candidate to the ... chair candidate that pill a chair candidacy was cancelled and now you're the mayor of brands and how would you describe the last nine months in your\nPolitical career [laughter] it's almost like it could be a movie I obviously I taste a lot of opposition from my own party over the last year a and I'm\nTry I'm you know ... in the face of adversity or do you get knocked down your you get back up and that's exactly what I did and I just said to support a I'm a decent\nHow generous that people have granted have bad has just been incredible you know as I went door to door or um that I Want to read that too that uh uh people are really gave me the courage and the energy to keep on going\nYou also arrived still under the cloud of sexual misconduct allegations against you you're assuming C. T. V. for defamation for reporting those um you've denied this do you think that the two women who made those accusations are lying\nSo I wouldn't wish false allegations are on anyone I Would have wished on my on my a worst enemy and so um it does\nDo I I'm I'm sure there was a a political angle to this of how people were convinced a or cajoled to make up false stories but I think it became very clear in the weeks afterwards the Sox completely fell apart a um [noise] that ah that that they were fictitious are stories\nHave the allegation by women been withdrawn\nI sold a ... well not a I and I I don't want to go in the past but but obviously the people that made the false allegations disappeared in in some cases sent sent out of the country and so but having said that I I I don't want to get\nInto those details day was obviously\nI'm a political um uh attack job and um he TV's gonna\nHave to defend not and that is before the court says so I'd be careful not to get ... get too much into those details but there's a reason there's ... million dollar defamation lawsuit for what was very sloppy journalism the fact is forest all apart so quickly shows that they they could have easily have been fact checked I'm having said that um\nI Want to stress my focus now is not is not going backwards my focuses entirely on getting branch and back on track\nWas part of an interview with

known as Lucy how old is too much call us in the Americas it was one of the items that staff members feared was last for ever\nMurillo Bustos was the first museum employee ... we reached him in Rio\nMr Boston is when you spotted the bones of lose the for the first time since the fire what was that moment like\nWell I wasn't quite excited when I saw was here for the first time because we didn't know how she was\nBecause of notify was very strong and she was very fragile so I was expecting the worst and of course when I saw her when I started bonds when Assad that she was in a specific spots but she was meant to be a much very very happy but at the same time\nThat I was worried because she was pregnant\nAnd I wanted to remove her the best way possible [laughter] so it was a big responsibility for me for you\nYou talk about her in a very tender way um what what does she mean to you\nOh actually she's every floor tents for all of us 'cause she's part of our history in Brazil she's the oldest human remain found in Brazil so she's very important for me because I work with human bones\nAnd just like the the pioneer for our so everybody knew her and everybody knew that I worked around her [laughter] I never worked with her specifically but I was working next to her and I had to carry her from someplace and so\nShe must parts of my life so [laughter]\nSo you're at the site of the museum you're surrounded by the ash and runes after this devastating fire how did you find her\nWell I had to answer to abusing of course to finance and the the room she was inside\nI had to cross all the museum at first it was impossible to the days but after the the company there's actually stabilizing abusing\nThey were opening some some of the grown so we could reach her we were a little bits of course because we didn't know if you were in danger but for us we had some of the the university I'm responsible for Dr tour of the university so they told us it's not very unsafe you can go there but of course we were little beach where to go\nThere and there were lots of twisted metal in the room where she was found so I had to cross to jump the ... to to reach the place where she was\nWhich he located in some sort of um a container or wishing lying around her bones lying\nWhatever cabinet tonight or cabinet than I of course the box was broken but I the door was partially
