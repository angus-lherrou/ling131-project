Jared J. ... and his official author name as a tribute to his late grandfather who was named Joseph jak because ask a welcome to fresh air and congratulations on being a finalist for the national Book Award\nOh thank you so much Terry Gross\n[laughter] so did you know out of your way for many years not to tell people that your mother had been a heroin addict\nOr throughout my childhood it's something I definitely kept hidden when when my grandparents are finally told me I was in the fourth grade and I I'll never forget sitting me 'cause they called me into the living room\nAnd I remember thinking oh maybe we are going to go in another family vacation because the last time we had a family meeting they told me we're going to Disney World and it was fantastic [noise]\nAnd my grandfather he sat me down on the couch and he said it's time we tell you the truth about your mother and she's in jail and she's a drug addict and that's that's why she's been gone all the time now that was a fourth grade now she had been gone and in and out since I was two years old\nSo I didn't tell anybody for the longest time I trusted one friend my friend Patrick my best friend I grew up next door to\nAnd I I didn't tell anyone I mean it when you when you have these addictions and your families I mean you sort of live this duality you you have this thing that that you should hold back from people and then you you put your best face forward\nUm you know as I got older sometimes I I Would share stories with people in high school somewhat but it wasn't really until I delivered what I call an accidental Ted Talk in two thousand twelve that I share that story more widely\nThat people must have asked you kids must have asked you all the time like how come your grandparents are raising you as your parents\nThey would and I would just make up stories on my my father he he travels a lot for business or um you know I Would just you just find ways to to sort of deflect right to say uh I mean maybe my story telling skills began by by making up excuses for where my biological parents were\nMiddle your mother was in jail and halfway houses your father you didn't even know who he was\nI didn't I didn't I didn't learn his first name until I was in sixth grade\nSo you've written about your childhood and your mother in the form of a graphic memoir for young adults are though I'm an adult and I really liked it\nNo\nAt the time I was in third grade and it sounds like such this like Great Depression World War two put down and here I Am in the eighties [laughter]\nAm I going to go back to school [laughter]\nThey were so lovingly crafts though you know they curse around but it was never directed towards me and I remember they want to say like you know we're okay if you cursed but if you ever course at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men you know\nUm they smoke two packs a day each nah or and my grandfather just be moans this movement of uh having places be non smoking\nYou know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like what an inconvenience it to the point we said Jesus Christ by the time I die I'm going to get to heaven and they're going to say sorry no smoke\n[laughter] he died of lung cancer you die yeah you'd actually well at eighty one [laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years there's also heavy smoker also heavy smoker yeah and I should say to\n'em you know she she died the summer before my wedding and that unfortunately she died ah she got on a friday on my wedding shower was that Sunday\nAnd in the months leading up to that you know my fiance at the time gene I'm now my wife she'd be over and and my mother my grandmother is hooked up to oxygen and we always have thought that she just had a bad bladder 'cause she was always excuse herself to go to the bathroom and you know like you know she's smoking\nRight with the oxygen around her and oh gosh that's dangerous as though they were so lucky the house didn't explode\nYeah so\nWe're raising in the family they were raising your mother\nI Know they were I Know that my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and I and I think a part of it was uh my my mother was their second child there first daughter\nAnd I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother felt this that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had for my mother Leslie because\nThat took Joe's attention away I'm\nJoe when Leslie always at a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always frauds [noise] ah ... surely was also drinking to a lot of them um she should drink quite a bit when I was young but she was never really drunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit when my mother was young\nYou know had recurring nightmares as a town about monsters would you describe a nightmare [noise]\nThis recurring dream where I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know where they're just force\nAnd these tall lanky monsters like like almost like naked alien zombies would would slowly come out but if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters\nAnd so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but then of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping in every dream ended the same way in which they were just on top of me\nAnd I I vividly remember those dreams and and yes there there in the book and and those were difficult to drop because um you know you're writing out scenes is one thing I mean you have a series of letters that make up words and makeup sentences\nBut visually they don't look like anything but catching out this book was difficult because you're facing these fears are facing these these nightmares or you're facing these people once again\nWhen do they stop these nightmares [noise]\nProbably some time just before high school I imagine I'm ... I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know ... the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then was kindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same school same building for all those nine years\nYour grandparents later told you that that they'd often open up the bedroom door and find your sleeping right outside of it um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone that any of the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and so we certainly were the kind of people who thought he should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help uh you know distant ties you seeing someone is talking to somebody\nOr on a professional level um and that's where for me are was such a saving grace because I I did work out some of these issues in my sketchbooks and and in my drawings\nWhen you took art classes when you were in high school at the list or art museum and your your grandfather paid for these classes because he knew how absorbed you are with your with your drawing\nYou were really proud to carry your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have that reaction you expected what did your teacher saying\nOh this is the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I I brought in this book\nThe whole book and without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just\nAdd like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned\nAnd and by that what he meant was that the that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive ... this is how you have to draw muscles this is how you have to ask\nAnd so he as an as an educator of the arts and specifically use teaching ... classes you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that a ... a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artist or drawing them professionally and this and that moment ah and and back then this was the early nineties\nThe thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and dress somebody else's character\nSo that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh I could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that's a possibility\nAnd he tells you you had your own style and that you should develop that he did that upsetting but did you learn anything nevertheless [laughter] from the marvel comics books Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics that that was actually useful for is\nCertainly a there's a lot about gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know the the punches like really real back or the punch has been fully blown but not right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise]\nYou know framing you're shot you know there's still a lot of value in that book and I still have the book um\nBut in regards to art style I think any sort of how to draw book I think one should be you know [laughter] route one is just have your own style [laughter] donate you ignore everything about her [laughter]\nMy guest is Jared J. ... his new graphic memoir hate kiddo how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with family addiction is\nNominated for a National Book award in the category of young people's literature we'll talk more after a break I'm

I live in North Hampton I live an hour from western no agency the paper what happened and uh my mother was arrested for expressing false prescriptions at at pharmacies\nAnd I I went in person to talk to my mother had of her court date and she she is she assured me that she was not using she was just selling it to a guy to make extra money and I said well that's really not going to convince me to bring my kids around here\nAnd I really had to put some distance between us at that point you know what I had a three year old a newborn and they needed their dad and I needed to be fully there for my children\nAnd uh and so yeah there was the way I Would keep track of her she would she would get arrested um and then get arrested for driving without a license or or or you know she would be driving and the a police officer tried to pull her over and she would try to outrun them\nShe did spend a little bit of time in jail again ah the last time I saw her without a family funeral\nAnd that this was this would have been in spring of two thousand six team and we had a we had a nice connection you know and she said I Love you and I always will and I said mom I Love you and I always\n... ... I Would worry I wake up in the middle of the night thinking what if what if I'm wrong what if she really isn't using you know but then I realized that she wasn't alone because she was with she was running herself with other people just she wasn't making herself accessible to me\nAnd you know I was she knew I was writing what would become hate kiddo and I was getting to the point where I thought you know I'm a long in Detroit process where I'm really going to need to talk to her about when I'm writing about and will she wants her real name or or should I come up with a pseudonym standing\nAnd I received a phone call one night it was march of two thousand Seventeen at the end of the month\nAnd it was her it was her younger brother Steven and he informed me that she had died of a drug overdose she'd she'd already on heroin and it was heartbreaking to be right\nYou know and it it it affirmed for me what I I did what I needed to do to protect my new young family\nAnd on Monday morning I went into the funeral home in Stephen who's got the again he's like he's my uncle buddy is like my brother met me there [noise] and I know I really had the feeling of you know she's going to be cremated but I don't want to see her one more time\nAnd and the funeral director pointed out like you you don't want to see her now like I hadn't signed off to get the body to be transferred from the work to the funeral home [noise]\nSo I said you know what well let's let's have a viewing and I had in my mind that you would wear the dress she wore it to to my wedding and so I had in my mind that I Would just turn up at her house I would open a closet and sure enough there would be the dress\nAnd Steven company me and now it seems the afternoon\nAnd ah there's a man in the house then she she had claimed that was response or you know I later learned that you typically would not have a sponsor of the opposite sex 'em and they certainly will be living with you till later I later came to learn that this this man was her boyfriend and so\nHe opened the door and uh he was just completely out of his mind I mean he was high on heroin his eyes were blood red his skin was white as bone he had a T shirt sweat pants no no socks her shoes on and he's talking a mile a minute\nAnd I'm Still ... tunnel vision that I Want to see my mom make my mom beautiful again that I entered the house\nAnd um went to her bedroom couldn't find couldn't find the dress for the night my my my glance went over to her bureau\nAnd it was just filled with ugliness it was filled with metal spoons and turning kits and and all all of her drug paraphernalia [noise]\nAnd so her boyfriend at the time said oh you know there's there's the cedar closet and this other room right now of course I dress that was that important to her she would preserve and the feed her closet\nSo I ... I stepped in the other room where the cedar closet is and on a little nicer than I saw a handgun and then on the lazy boy there I saw three handguns and next so that was to handguns and now I'm realizing I'm On a room filled with handguns with my back\nTo someone who's high on heroin and I said this is exactly why I didn't come to visit my mom his last two years because this is exactly what I figured I'd step into so now I'm thinking what if I'd done\nWhat if I die here my children need me\nSo I I made the boyfriend like I just need to be alone with my mother's things could you just give me a moment so he he moved and you know as loud as I could I said well Steve and you know the the dresses in here I'm just going to go to Macy's and uh by her address and the and he just looked at me

things I wanted to hold onto in the event that the house blew up the next day\nUm wow and so now I'm I'm making preparations for my mother's memorial and we didn't publicize the memorial I didn't put in the newspaper till afterwards\nBut now I'm really fearful this guy's going to turn up with with guns and so I hired security\nBut the ... in the interim between that moment and and the memorial\nThat ... was arrested for impersonating a police officer so he had shop lifted a number of items from a Walmart like dog for the paper towels and he brandish a gun and said no I'm I'm with the police it's good and and and and come to find out all of those handguns were Bebe guns made to look like real guns\nUm and that but that didn't change\nMy heart was racing in that moment

created by my gas ... Blacksburg who's also the show runner seasons five is now a net flicks Comedy Central is now showing the first season\nThe Syrian satirized is Hollywood and deals with issues like success and failure ego power addiction relationships and sexism\nSeason five is set in the era of the me too movement\nBow jak horsemen takes advantage of the kind of characters that you can pull off in an animated series it's a world that is a mix of people and talking animals with human characteristics bow jak is a horse who became famous as the star of the nineties sitcom horsing around\nBut one season one of bull jak horsemen begins bow jak is washed up his celebrity has faded and\nHe spends a lot of time drinking feeling sorry for himself and watching old reruns of a sitcom horsing around admiring how great he was on the show back then let's start with a clip from the very first episode of Bo jak horsemen when Bo jak as a guest on the Charlie Rochelle\n[noise] in Nineteen eighty seven situation comedy horses around here don't ABC Show which young bachelor horses forced to reevaluate his priorities we agreed to raise three human children was initially dismissed by critics is wrong and soccer and not good\nBut the family comedy struggle with America someone on the air for nine seasons star of horses around ... is our guest ... ...\nIt is good to be here Charlie\n[laughter] Raphael Bob Blacksburg welcome to fresh air time changes how we see things that isn't it [laughter]\nYes we were later you when you did that Charlie Rose opening you probably had no idea that he would be excused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to the loss of his job [laughter]\nSo let's just start with a surprise of that for you did you think of that opening episode when the women's step forward\nIt really dates the show doesn't it Charlie Rose be the the voice of sober reason that you know we'll get bow jak who was such a mess and all that far into and unprofessional and Charlie Rose or played a clip by putting Oswald is are are straight person in the scene\nAnd uh yeah when the allegations against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nBecause there wasn't it was truly oh no Charlie Rose and and all the women that he allegedly targeted a that's terrible but it it is interesting now to go back to that first episode and look at it and think about how times have changed\nSo how did you come up with the idea of starting a series with a horse that can talk and walk on two legs and dress and be bitter like a human being and have him be the washed up star of a family sitcom\nWell the idea for the show really started from my friendship with Lisa ... who was a brilliant illustrator and cartoonist and I'd have been friends with her since high school and when I was you know ... in Los Angeles pitching shows around\nUm she was living in Brooklyn at the time and one thing she was doing was drawing these animal people on her own and posting them in her blog and on the Internet\nWell let's say it's a lazy suicide attempt right as a suicide attempt a plausible deniability like he's not actively killing himself but he's\nAllowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a port and spoke maybe minor distinction to us that he was so disappointed and despairing that he was willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself [noise]\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season season five which you wrote is um an unusual episode because it's one long monologue ... mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dementia and low jak does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her\nSo he's at a podium at 'em like her coffins at the side and he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in the family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was mean to his mother and they were both mean to bow jak [noise]\nI I Want to play a ... part\nOf his eulogy and this is will or not as low jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called horse around fiercely they'll hold your applause will held it was written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named ... and it was about these orphans in early on the network\nThe fight orphans sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they could imagine their parents to be anything they wanted something to long for\nAnyway we did this one season finale we're Olivia's birth mother comes to town and she was a junkie but she's got her self cleaned up and she was to be in a live your life again and of course she's like a perfect grownup version of Libya and they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted and anyway the horse to water be careful\nMoms have a way of letting you do but Olivia\nJust thinks the horses jealous when the mom says she's moving to California Bolivia decides to go with her\nAnd the network really juiced the cliffhanger is Olivia gone for good but of course because it's a TV show should knock on for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and had to go back to rehab facility had hitchhiked all the way home getting rides from Mr T. L. from the gas stop\nOf course that's what happened because what are you going to do just not handled Libya on the show\nYou shouldn't have happy ... not really because if everyone's happy the show would be over and above all else the show\nHas to keep going there's always more show and you can call horsing around dumb or bad or unrealistic but there is nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more show\nI guess until there is\nAn assay saying until there isn't he's looking at his mother's cough and you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broke and your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that\nI'm so he he really had a bad relationship with her and when he says early and that clip that um he ended our our fans because they couldn't imagine their parents anyway they wanted to um let me do you think about that\nWell you know I I I think a big part of this episode at a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ... and his relationship with his parents is about\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but it's gone now and will never hurt you again and\nEven in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself and I'm really interested in that idea and that that question\nOf you know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think what's really interesting for me is the tension between that and to easy forgiveness of public figures right\nAnd and I want to believe on a personal level level that nobody is era deem a ball or so far gone that they can't find a way to be better and be forgiven\nAnd how does that track with me\nWhere I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've heard so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption and I don't know how I reconcile those two ideas and and that tension for me\nHas been at least a ... a really interesting to explore over the course of his last season but also the show in general\nSo in this era of the me too movement west have so many men have so much to apologize for [laughter]\nI'm One of the funny things that you've come up with for the series or you you and the writers is do we forgive you award you created a whole awards ceremony for people who need to apologize for saying would you describe and forgive ease the we for\nSure but we forgive you rewards as presented on the show are awards that celebrities gets when the industry has the\nIn a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a we forgive you award from I think for time forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd it one of the sad to slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about house additives\nThat our industry is so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men who do awful things and they're able to kind of like swing back into the limelight\nAnd we wanted to satirized at and then over the course of the last year\nIt started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry and then just in the last month or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe we'll forgive me\nI don't know maybe this is sadly irrelevant a new um so it feels like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture news when in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening for years and years\nWhat makes you think that people are being forgiving again well\nUh it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers\nAnd I I don't know if we have we forgotten his anti Semitic remarks is homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her is use of of racial slurs\nIn mystified me in this era that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable\nBut it still feels like we are not you know Louis CK a stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation a there are reports that Garrison Keillor and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks I think that there is\nWork that those men can be doing to better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know we think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I find it tremendously upsetting\nMy guess is ...

S. um tells you about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nSo my mother owned a a Jewish gift and book store called Bob and Bob and it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto in the surrounding area\nAnd so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books and and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish day school um you know I even\nAfter a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt a extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never\nOnce felt like a minority and the communities that I was in um she would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of money that we're chips um we have we have a band\nSee an end to we have the the misfit toys in a while ago um it it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life um and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWas there a disconnect me between being told about anti Sam ... senators and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh\nThe Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live and sophisticated times now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes um\nAnd it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country and they're they have a lot of power\nAnd there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage um and that's been very scary to me um but also scary\nHow little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening\nUm especially big some for someone who you know as a Jew hear the story of the Holocaust over and over and over growing up and the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing\nRight there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who were shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd you know if there's only one of the Jews who control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kinda feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nThey set up because there's the ... and like I think yeah and I and I would\nSay a couple of years ago to be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around them\nSo it was it difficult for you to concentrate in long enough to to read books\nUm yes or sometimes\nYou know I I could always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there was something that really interested in me I I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in it\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took her pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience that I Love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't\nNobody was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize is inappropriate\nKnow like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my pants or everyone can see my underpants and I don't fit inappropriate and and I remember at the time\nBoundaries I did it because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified that oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take\n'em you know or just a shouting out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's a ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I thought I have I Want to say this thing so I'm going to say it\nAnd I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference between you know the problem with ADHD and other a mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not oh you have this thing there for you or this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this\nPrecisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have\nYou know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps and what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat was TV like a safe space where you where you can like unless yourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of what you were consuming than the actual world and the reason why I ask that is that like there are so many pop culture references and blow jak horsemen and some of them like\nJust like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them um so it made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when he was growing up\nYeah well TV made sense to me and you know there is a a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely\nWas a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate\nIf I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this scene that I was living in\nFeel like the scenes but I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful as being a writer and having an outlet and now\nIf I Am in a situation I think of the funny thing I can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto this and I'll have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think it was a funny situation you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or if someone came in here and did this\nI can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment I'll I'll get paid for it by putting it in a story later\nSo having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\n[noise] you know I'm thinking now the comedy central is is running jak which has Netflix series now that Comedy Central it's raining it's starting with season one\nUm what's that like for you because you in retrospect feel like some of the jokes in season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter] cable\nYeah you know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks and making under the right time for Comedy Central and you know obviously want them to keep their\nDignity as an episode of television not edited out anything too important but as we are looking for cuts one of things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or would this scene work with\nI'm In the house um but I also think look this is the show and it has to do exist on its own terms and hopefully people you know as they have embraced the show on Netflix will embrace the show on Comedy Central and if there are flaws with it they will see those flaws for what they are and you know we'll see what happens\nWhen it's been great to talk with you thank you so much it is my pleasure thank you so much\n...

Court has changed during the Trump Administration the court now has to Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch who replace the late Antonin Scalia after Mitch McConnell block President Obama from choosing Scully a successor and Brett Kavanaugh who replaced Anthony Kennedy after Kennedy retired\nNow the chief justice John Roberts is also considered the most likely swing vote in a court that has five conservative justices\nMy guest David Kaplan says the court has reached the point where justices are often seen as political proxies of the Republican or Democratic Party\nHis new book is about how the court became so politicized and so powerful\nIt also includes profiles of several of the justices the book is based in part on Capitol interviews with several of the current justices as well as past justice is sixty five law clerks who worked at the Supreme Court and congressional and White House officials dating back to the Reagan Administration\nA lot of the interviews were done on the condition that he not named the source Kaplan is also a former legal affairs editor at Newsweek where he covered the Supreme Court for a decade his new book is called the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution\nDavid Kaplan welcome to fresh air so one of the main themes of your book is that the court has become so politicized you can predict which justice will vote it's become politics by another name elaborate on that idea for us\nWell on those hot button issues like abortion and same sex marriage and voting rights and gun control and campaign finance you pretty much know ahead of time where they're going to come out so the larger question I'm trying to ask in the book is whether the court ought to be as interventionist\nAnd as involved in American Life\nAs it is and during for example the recent Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings you heard questions about specific issues like abortion or presidential power but nobody asked\nWhether the court is properly involved in so many of these political and social issues because everyone pretty much assumes a that it ought to be\nIn what sense do you think that the court is overstepping\nThe court docket is almost entirely discretionary the justices decide which cases they want to hear and too often\nThey choose to hear cases involving issues that I argue would better be left to the political branches that cheaply means Congress or state legislatures and they do so\nFor a variety of reasons but I I think the thread that runs through the\nViews of most justices most of the time and I interviewed a majority of them for this book I interviewed them on background and I can indicate which once I interview that was the terms of the deal I the attitude you get is if not us who will do show some will look out the window in point that the capital\nAnd say look at the dysfunctional Congress they'll make reference is veiled and otherwise to the presidency of these days and that is a kind of arrogance that is remarkable to me I don't recall any part of the Constitution's stating that hurts\nSuch dime store psychology is beyond my pay grade they're certainly isn't any indication in his opinions to date of a bias but you know his performance after Dr Ford testify\nTalking about how this was a vast left wing conspiracy the Clintons and all that even if he apologized for or try to in Wall Street journal op ed piece I think that in some respects\nA leaves him\nIn an even tougher position than he might into sexual harassment\nCase there are a lot of cases that if they don't involve the Clinton specifically obviously they involve politics and a cabinet or you could argue showed his true part is and self in that twenty minutes of testimony I Would be justice concern in that area\nWhat kinds of cases you think that might influence\nYou could imagine campaign finance\nAppeal coming up they're going to be more of those and depending on who brings it\nAre are the Republican interest where their democratic interests I think even if he's not in fact biased the appearance of by a bias is a real one\nHaving said all that they are all kinds of reasons of course to criticize justice Thomas's performance on the court for the last Thirty years and I do so in my book but I'm not sure you can point to a lot of cases in the area of of\nA sexual harassment or regulation of the workplace 'em and say that\nThomas ruled the way he did out of ... or bitterness from his hearings back\nIt or not but last February they lived in New York magazine cover story headlined the case for impeaching Clarence Thomas with stories of other women besides Anita Hill who had stories of sexual harassment ... um regarding Clarence Thomas so it's um it's a story that keeps you know coming back to life\nIt does and\nSome folks could argue that maybe it was truly generous it was unique and it was dated but the Kavanaugh stuff brought that all back to light and as you point out now we've got two justices under a cloud separated by Thirty years that is really bad\nFor the court it's bad for the courts prestige\nI think it helps to an end feeble Congress we have a lousy Congress for any number of reasons but one of the reasons as various congressmen and senators would tell me they don't act is 'cause they know that the justices across the street\nWill act and I also think it it distorts presidential elections and the way that we saw in two thousand\nSixteen twenty twenty five percent of Trump voters said they didn't like Trump's temperament they didn't agree with the with a lot of what he said but they voted for him simply because of the Supreme Court\n[noise] so um it in terms of how politicized the court has become\nI'm President Trump supported Brett Kavanaugh through the hearings and Trump insulted Christine Blasey Ford who made the allegations of sexual assault [noise] are you concerned are their concerns out there that Kavanaugh will feel beholden to Trump and therefore\nCome to conclusions in ways that support the Trump Administration when the Trump Administration is involved in the case\nI think they're all kinds of\nLegitimate bases for criticizing Cavanaugh I thought his testimony\nAfter Dr Ford was appalling I thought Kavanaugh's performance of the press conference the White House was a ... of a justice but I think the notion that now that he's on the Supreme Court he's going to feel beholden to the president who appointed him is misguided one of the great aspects of the system\nWhich has lots of laws is that once you're on the bench and have life tenure you really don't have to look down Pennsylvania Avenue with any degree of loyalty because the president can do anything\nAt that point other than tweet so I think by and large most justices a throughout history have\nSuccessfully proclaimed and demonstrated their independence from the president's so pointed them look at the Nixon tapes case in Nineteen Seventy four were unanimous court ruled against Richard Nixon that doesn't mean you kind of a friendship\nWith the president various FDR appointed justices remained friends with FDR butter on my list of criticisms of and concerns about Brett Kavanaugh the fact that he's grateful to this president I don't think will affect his decision making I think most justices most of the time\nOnce they're up there they're free and clear\n[noise] I hadn't known of Brett Kavanaugh before he was nominated to be a Supreme Court justice but you write that some people some insiders were surprised that he wasn't on\nTrump's first list of a potential nominees the one that the one that that ended with the core such nomination and you say some movement conservatives called Kavanaugh\nApprove Eric ... milk toast to lacked guts and again this was before his nomination this was during the course ... nomination why was he called ...\nBut say he was such because of an opinion he wrote in one of the Obamacare cases where he didn't reach out and strike down the statue which is what the movement conservatives wanted instead he said\nThat his court the federal appellate court in Washington or should not be hearing the case deciding the case at that moment on procedural grounds there was a technical issue that we we don't I Will go into details on but he wrote what I thought was a measured\nScholarly legal opinions saying the case isn't quite right for us it's a timing issue I thought it was a good solid opinion do I remember that doesn't matter but I think he was taken out to the woodshed by a lot of movement conservatives who said why didn't you do\nOr the right thing here and that was the chief strike\nAgainst them now I happen to think that cabin on the court will wind up being less of the arch conservative that Thomas and Alito\nHave been or that Gorsuch will be I Would predict the capital will be closer\nTo what passes for the center of the court that chief justice Roberts is now the swing vote and I think he's institutional ism his affection for the court and for its own reputation may\nLead him in ... on some occasions to rein in the courts power in the way that chief justice did decisively show\nThe Obamacare ruling upholding the statute back in two thousand twelve I think Kavanaugh will\nVeer on occasion closer and then ... in that direction and for example Neil Gorsuch\nMy guest is David Kaplan former legal affairs editor at Newsweek and author of the new book about the Supreme Court\nCalled the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court assault on the

Sonia Sotomayor for example was chosen by Iraq Obama and you know you can blame presidents that are blamed the Senate but I I think you in the first since that you need to blame the court because it gets involved so often it raises the stakes\nOf who sits\nOn the court so if the court is in effect going to govern the country on so many key issues then you really need to look at how you think individual members of the court are going to vote when you do that politics the role of a politics necessarily becomes heightened it wasn't\nAlways that way when John Paul Stevens was picked by Gerald Ford in the mid Nineteen seventies\nAnd it wasn't for that reason and I could give you half a dozen a dozen other examples those days are long gone I Would like to see the return of those days\nSupreme Court nominees that includes how Mitch McConnell blocked Merrick Garland from even coming to the Judiciary Committee after he was nominated\nAbsolutely and and listen if the Democrats get control\nOf Congress ah this this time round or in two years twenty twenty I think you'll if they can get their act together because they're not really good at playing dirty or you may see them raise the stakes you know they talk about ... about getting rid of life tenure at the Supreme Court that would require\nA constitutional amendment but if you want to increase the size of the court pack the court as it were all you need is an act of Congress if the Democrats control the house in the Senate or the White House\nAnd twenty Twenty one I don't think\nCourt packing is off the table at all and if you want to get back\nThe Merrick Garland seat and if you want to take back control of the court\nJust add to more seats a point to liberals that an eleven member court you have a six foot majority do I think that's possible yes\n[noise] being a Supreme Court justice is I'm a lifetime appointment you leave when you say you want to leave and how old is your third against but now eighty five and how it was a John Paul Stevens when he left\nNinety yeah so ... you can say for a really long time um so a lot of people\nAlready good is it pretty good gig gig [laughter] yeah\n[laughter] um so the lifetime appointment issue has been challenged by many people because now that people are living to such\nOlder ages than they used to when the Supreme Court was first created you know and when the constitution was first written\nUm the president's power to appoint a Supreme Court justice that's become a much bigger power than it ever was ... cousin part of the extension of\nThe lifespan of Americans [noise] um so you know some people including you have proposed changing the lifetime nature of the appointment why do you think we should consider changing it and what are some of the suggestions you have\nWell would lower the stakes of any particular\nNomination if for example there was a single term of Eighteen years as many others have suggested in which I indoors I think that would lower the temperature it would allow once you kicked in the system over time because she couldn't make current justices leave\nIt would allow every president to get your nominations you'd have a new justice every two years I think that would be a great idea it will never happen\nUm I mean I think the most creative idea that I came across was not so much a single term but by staffing the Supreme Court randomly I'm with a rotating series of nine judges picked among the chief judges\nOf the twelve lower federal appeals court in the country\nIf it was just any bunch of judges picked and maybe it wouldn't be a nine of twelve maybe it will be five of twelve then you might\nActually give forced to the idea\nThat the court has a neutral body it rules based on law not personality not based on the political views of this or that justice but that these more anonymous lower court judges and the chief judge is of course are rotated based on seniority the system might look\nMore like we have long imagined it to be the idea that the court is politicized is not\nThan it used to be and it cuts against what we all learned in civics class which is that the law is supposed to be neutral or government of laws not men and women and so forth I think shuttle that any of these changes are incredibly unrealistic\nBut they have a Kevin thank you so much for talking with us it's a pleasure

remains probably one of my favorite in any book ever so I was sort of immediately in just as a reader I mean not my I'm going to make a film but Wilder's book is for me\nAnd sort of just helping to create like a space where we could all kind of go to work together and you're almost like parenting like you're just trying to get the best out of every body and I found that really gratifying\nIf you're just joining us my guest is Paul dino he probably know as an actor from films like there will be blood Little Miss sunshine and love and mercy now he directed his first film at an adaptation of the Richard Ford novel wildlife the movie's called wildlife too will be back\nAfter a short break ...\nAll\nThe\n...\nThis is fresh air and if you're just\nJoining us make guesses Paul Dana a great actor\nWho's films include there will be blood love and mercy Little Miss sunshine he's in the new Showtime series called escape at Dannemora\nAnd he directed his first feature film and it's called wildlife it's adapted from Richard Ford novel at the same name\nLet's talk about your acting and let's start with there will be blood you gave such an amazing performance in this year you're a teen evangelical preacher in a small port town in Southern California turn of the twentieth century\nUm during the early days when they are discovering that there's oil there and\nUm there's an oil man played by Daniel Day Lewis is a bit of a con man and also incredible capitalistic comes to town and wants to get as much of the oil\nAnd you and he become antagonist and in in one scene in Oregon here\nHe's basically told by one land owner that he'll sign over the oil rights to Daniel Day Lewis is Daniel Day Lewis agrees to be baptized by you\nAnd your makeshift church mhm so this is a scene where you're baptized seeing him and I should just say parenthetically that the Daniel Day Lewis character earlier in the film he's taken in a boy whose father was in was killed in a mining accident\nAnd then when the boy goes deaf as a result of another uh oil accident I'm Daniel Day Lewis sends him away\nOkay so here's the scene with my guest Paul day now and I know they let us\nWith a sheer well wishes for celebration or ... or\nOr ... he was\nA truly I'm going\nTo be damage All right\nYou're on the knees\n\n\nWhat do you want me to [noise]\nCome here and you wrote and ... and ... but you have also brought your bad habits as a badge lighter you last year to after women and you have a\nBand in your child is your child that you raise your band in all because she was sick and us in just said now I Am a sinner should say it loud I ever since I'm a student\nLoan Daniel I'm a I'm a center I I'm\nSorry hold on shore lord I watch law and applaud you abandon your child\nOr the bugs and much I Will never backslide whenever it was last for now I'm\nOn my ...\n...\nBut I'm much Shay it loud oh\nOh oh\n\nWe get on your give me the number that you know what do you watch that Jesus Christ lord I save your do\n\nThe rules\nWow [laughter] I suppose you know and Daniel Day Lewis in a scene from the two thousand seven film there will be blood I'm actually mentioned you are the slapping sounds that you're hearing at the end of that scene that's Paul ... character like slapping the devil slapping the devil out of Daniel Day Lewis a\nAlso getting even with Daniel Day Lewis was beating them up earlier in in the film that that's seen as almost like this incredible operatic do wet did you think of it that way when you're making it [noise]\nIt was sort of intense just to hear that you know no time for me\nI I'm I was sort of cast the last minute mess and I started about four days after\nThe preachers brother\nYeah and then they moved to be yeah the the teen preacher is that why those two characters became became twins were they not ... ... they were just brother and they're just brother and you know that you were playing both of us so they saw something in you where they wanted you to play the bigger\nPart yeah I said I suppose so but you know ... sort of sort of why it was going back there is is just listen to that clip you know gave me I'm a feeling which was I just remember the the two days before I started\nSpending on up to sun down in that church alone um you know he lives church and\nThat was a really sort of um\nBeautiful couple of days just sort of trying to learn\nThe script and make contact with the the the the character and in in in this empty church I I don't know why that is when I went back to\nLose your idea to to learn your part while sitting in the church\nWhen I was just suddenly on location and I was like what okay how one day one is Monday and okay I'm going to go to the church and learn like [laughter] you know it seems um [noise] it's funny because that quip to quite a long scenes so that was a sort of seeing me film for all all day long and uh\nI Believe our first set up was probably some kind of wider maybe some kind of master shop and uh\nI I slapped Daniel as you said in towards the end scene and\nI think we were supposed to once we get to that part just stop you know 'cause we're we're going to be doing this all day and and I remember ah the first take forgetting and just slapping him many times and as soon as we cut I remembered that I was supposed to stop and I went oh God\nUm and I think I ... I even had a little bit of rent on time and you know\nOh my God what does that and he just said\nYou know and I was like okay [laughter]\nMy guest is Paul dino he co wrote and directed the new film adaptation of the Richard Ford novel wildlife we'll talk more after a break and you hear about what it's like to be beaten up and films including and there will be a blood\nAnd Kevin White had will review a new reissue of music Nino wrote a composed for Federico Fellini movies and Terry Gross and this is fresh air [noise]\n\nAnd you know our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air and it's a commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation support for NPR comes from the station\nAnd from Amazon Prime video with the Romanoff a new series from the creator of Mad Men starring Diane Lane Noah widely Christina Hendricks and Andrew ran on a new episode every Friday on prime video\nAnd from home advisor matching homeowners with home improvement professional for a variety of home projects from minor repairs to major remodeled homeowners can read reviews of local pros and book appointments online at home advisor dot com\nEmmy winning music supervisors Susan Jacobs elevates films like American Hustle and TV series like sharp objects by curing them with the perfect so music as a lot more than just some background thing in the restaurant or some ... some video it plays a huge important role\nSusan Jacobs later on sound [noise] flooding o'clock\nThis evening on Ninety One point seven KLW San Francisco [noise]\nShe lives of a new shows said without music life would be a mistake high I mean one doing the door of Africa mix with it when the Congo soon in terms of even begin to up nine pm for an evening of music\nFor example to music from Africa and the African diaspora including voices of Africa the hospital runs on KLW Ninety One where I've been a cure a W adopt or\nYou know and we found that totally I ... yeah unseen their core changes in love and mercy are so beautiful and so unpredictable and um so what did you have to learn those words like you to know how to play those scores let alone the sequencing of them\nNo no no no and I really started from basics and um and that was just so beautiful to have the piano opened up to me through Bryan I'm because the voice things did he teach you to quit not Brian or a guy named area and his in his bad um helped me out and uh you know just started practicing day by day\nAnd sing with doing vocal exercises you know and and and that's a really nice routine for somebody preparing for something let's say let me do thirty minutes a day of of singing at first and in this amount of piano and slowly you know learn your learn your chops sort of build them up get comfy\nBut I'm the other really fascinating thing about learning through ... through Brian is his left hand the bass notes\nReally incredible um and that's really what changes the court off and he's not always you know emphasizing the route note um would you would say if you're playing a genealogy she's often emphasizing a different um note or in the voice thing and that changes the entire sound of the court and it's actually something that I Believe Paul McCartney\nGot from the beach boys and started doing as a bass player which was kind of quite revolution\nYou know necessarily be landing on the roof no really changes the feeling behind the cord and uh so I learned so much uh and and and I miss it you know listening to that I don't listen to him often because it really sends a chill through me and you know I Do miss listening to his music\nWell let's take a short break and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us I guess as actor Paul ... who is now also director Paul day no his directing debut is an adaptation of the Richard Ford novel wildlife in the movie\nIs also called wildlife we'll be right back\nThis is fresh air\nAnd hello I'm Jeff Hayden tonight on your legal rights San Francisco attorney elemental them from the form of ... attorney general ripping over will just stuff employment law as it relates to public employees and we will once again operate our poll lawyer feature right here at KLW on or off might get to walk you through your case from beginning to end\nWe'll be right here to answer your questions that your legal rights\nTonight at seven o'clock right here on K.

well yeah I Am personally you know even as a viewer and I've always myself chosen to look at it like\nThe wide part of it so yeah but you know film like prisoners has violence right but I think that there's a sense of morality I actually think it's conflicted you know your lead character is responding in a violent way and I don't think it's looked upon\nYou know with shiny eyes um that's I think maybe it's okay you know I Hope I'm not just justifying it but I mean I Try to look at things and go what is the cost of this you know twelve years a slave there's a lot of violence but this is you know a story\nThat has a value [noise] and and also frankly like actually a little squeamish even though I Do a lot of dark material emotionally I um\nI don't respond well to to to just pilots for

recruitment of players for the top college basketball programs\nTalented athletes as young as twelve or targeted for manipulation by St agents ... describes as dealers in human athletic flash [noise] many of those corrupt practices were exposed in an FBI investigation which led to a sprawling indictment that rocked the basketball world last year\nIn the first of three trials in the case the federal jury yesterday convicted three men of conspiring to use cash payments to recruit players to college basketball programs including the University of blue of all it's legendary coach Rick Pitino wasn't charged but the scandal cost him his job\nHe's one of the subjects of soccer ... new book the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball I spoke to soccer club yesterday when the jury in the case was still deliberating\nWell my ... welcome back to fresh air you know any enterprise that generates large sums of money can be beset by corruption how much money just college basketball generate\nWell billions I mean it really depends on how you calculate it but directly to the universities and to the NC double a\nBillions but if you figure in the gambling money and money that's generated by recruiting sites and all these crazy ways you know you're getting into the four or five or six billion dollars a year\nRight and what does money go\nThe money largely goes to be adults who run the games very little of it goes to the players or the players get the value of their scholarships so if you look at a program like Louisville which is program that I focused on\nThey generate about forty five million dollars a year in revenue they give out Thirteen scholarships that adds up to about four hundred thousand dollars a year\nThe rest of it gets spread out to the coach who makes eight million dollars a year just the assistant coaches and make as much as a half million dollars a year all throughout the athletic department people are making six figure salaries it does not go to the players and what I call the unpaid workforce\nHow big is the NCAA a championship tournament March Madness\nJust about a billion dollars a year goes to the NC double a itself\nWhich is the non profit organization that runs big time college sports\nBut the money that that tournament throws off and all kinds of different directions is where you get into the two or three billion dollars it's the kind of money that pro franchises are are making or generating the differences that they're actually paying the players\nYou're right about the University of Louisville which you say it was kind of quiet commuter school\nUntil a new athletic director a guy named Tom Juravich came in and had big ambitions and invested in big time coaches and new facilities stadiums and basketball arenas and and he made a ton of ...\nAnd get into their inner circles and then to see what's in it for me can I deal this kid to a particular college can I\nAssociate him with a particular NBA agent and this is very much the scene on the grass roots circuit it's known and it's it's part of the background\nAre their kids to when they're you know twelve Thirteen fourteen kind of become celebrities kind of think of themselves as a business\nAbsolutely there are there are kids who you know this is their life and one of the things that really struck me\nWhen I have been around grassroots basketball is the kids who referred to themselves as being in the business of basketball because that's how it feels to them they may be twelve or Thirteen Years old but they're in the business of\nBasketball [noise] Michael ... book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino the story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball we'll continue our conversation after a short break this is fresh air\n[noise]\nThis is fresher and we're speaking with journalist Michael ... has a new book about corruption in recruitment in college basketball it's called\nAnd a lot of cases families will move uh they're promising young basketball player to a different city for a high school that's it's known for being competitive so it becomes kind of the family's lives to you write that on the college end of this it's the assistant coaches who are really involved in recruiting explain\nWhat they do how they're paid\nThe assistant college coaches are the sort of ones who\nFirst make contact with a young player and his family they\nFly all over the country and there's a lot of pressure on assistant coaches it used to be an assistant college coach was a coach first he taught the game he mentored the young men\nA lot of them now if not most of them are recruiters first and they are charged with bringing their head coach the best players it's sometimes set in college basketball that you win\nIn July and that means you win games by getting the best players from the tournaments the grass roots tournaments in July in Las Vegas and elsewhere\nBut the assistant coaches that's their job get me kids the thinking in\nThe industry and among journalists and many who follow this world is that many of the head coach you say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just bring them to me there are things I don't want to know\nAssistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep their hard to get back in the business if you lose the job the temptation to cheat is extreme\nBut you have these kids that are kind of showing their stuff in this amateur basketball kind of network and the street runners sort of pre agents that build relationships and hope to steer them to universities assistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government is charged in this case that we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities there is another really creepy part of this story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges [noise]\nBut then in some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players who are already in college to a certain financial advisor at the St runner has a relationship with what's going on there\nWell that's exactly right and I and I think that's the most insidious part of this so in the federal government's case there have been several assistant coaches charged with taking bribes from these runners or go betweens\nOn the grass roots circuit and the attempt of the bribe is to say okay you already have this player he's headed to the pros\nSend them to me I Want to manage his money when he becomes a pro you know put him in my lap\n[noise] All right so if you're a financial advisor at ... this is what you do and you manage to have for in some way or another and get an NBA player as your client what's it worth to you\nNBA player over the course of a ten year career can easily make a hundred million dollars or more\nSo if you're an agent and get two or three percent of that salary that adds up to a lot if you have five or ten of those players that adds up to a whole lot if you're quote managing the money\nI might add up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting what a money manager might make there's a lot you're dealing in tens of millions of dollars if I were a future NBA player or I were the family of a future NBA player\nI don't think that I Would necessarily send my kid to somebody who specializes in managing the money of sports stars\nBut there is an ecosystem of people who serve professional athletes manage their money or if you get traded their specialists who will set you up in a new city they will go to\nPrivate schools and figure out what private school your child should go to they will find you designer for your new house and an interior designer so sports is a very insular business and\nA lot of the players want to deal with known quantities and part of this is there's the money manager he manages NBA players money so the game is to become one of those guys and then they have one of these go betweens set you up with\nA with players\nMichael ... new book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball\nAfter a break he'll talk about some earlier scandals

wrongdoing it would seem and Pitino\nDoes not take responsibility for either hiring the wrong people or for hiring people who don't listen to what he says\nAnd right now coach Pitino has a pending case against the University of Louisville athletic association which technically paid a salary and he's seeking be thirty five million dollars which was left on his coaching contract\nMike ... book is

and we're speaking with writer Michael ... whose new book the last temptation of Rick Pitino is about a recruiting scandal in college basketball last year a federal grand jury charged ten men in the case and the first three to be tried were convicted yesterday\nPitino was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal\nWhen these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news were people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on\n\nAbsolutely were not shocked what the FBI I did was put names and faces to what\nMany people had assumed or knew was going on but there was an element of shock and what that was was\nThat the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing parents and coaches and players into interrogation rooms as opposed to the NC double a if you're in college basketball\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double a it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be visited by the FBI and maybe looking at prison time that was a shock\n... and has it had a major effect on college basketball program some in Louisville certainly was turned upside down they lost their coach what about others\nI think overall it has not yet had a big impact on college basketball\nYou know I mentioned that they do well in a fantasy land and part of that just involves putting your head in the sand so the one of the most prominent coaches in college basketball\nThe legendary Mike ... coach K of Duke was quoted as saying this is a blip this is nothing you know this trial is nothing um it's a small sliver of what really goes on well nobody believes that but\nThe fact that coach case set it gives you an indication of the sort of institutional reaction to to what has gone on and a\nDetermination to sort of try to get past this without really changing anything\nYou know you're right that the question in the criminal case is whether this conduct violated federal criminal statutes but what what's really at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of\nThe whole structure of college sports explain what you mean\nOf sports does not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars and it doesn't pay and then there's certain juncture that's just not defensible maybe when the money was a little less you could say okay they're getting their scholarship\nTen and twenty and thirty and forty million dollars for a particular programs and they're not\nReal students their loyalty and their their responsibility is to their teen first\nWhich takes up forty or fifty or sixty hours a week and you're not paying them you know you are you are having their elders just spread the money around and they're not all by the way going into pro basketball or pro football some of them are just moving through and not necessarily getting a degree\nComing out with some injuries and yet the NC double a persists in the myth of the student athlete when everyone knows that if anything it's the athletes student you know the the athlete is what you're there for\nThem to come back to one thing you said earlier um you said a lot of people knew that that shady things were going on and that there was a risk of running afoul of and see a regulations it as a whole new game if you have the FBI asking questions do you think that'll make a difference in the future\nI Do think it will make some difference but I think that difference will be\nJust in the way that people\nConduct possibly criminal activity I think people will be more careful you already heard these people you know on the recordings that the FBI took them\nYou know talking about you know we have to do this and some underhanded ways we have to get it out of certain accounts so they knew they were engaged in criminal activity I think there'll be or possibly criminal activity I think they'll become more careful sunny the Cairo the former Nike\nExecutive the godfather of the grassroots circuit he told me these people forgot where the boundaries where you know they got too greedy you also saddened by the way you never do this kind of stuff on the telephone so there's an element of\nAll of this that makes\nThis look like just common criminal activity it makes the three shoe companies seem like crime families on the on the basketball circuit so to the extent that all of this is true and I think it is whether it's criminal we don't know\nIt will continue to go on because there's too much incentive for it to go on I certainly think with the FBI on the case people would become much more careful\nAnd just so we covered this I mean ... you said that in some respects shooting apparel companies look pretty bad in this what do they say about their role in in college recruitment in these charges\nThe apparel companies have been very quiet they've put out sort of vanilla statements that this is not what we do um but they've been very very quiet\nThere is a ... executive who is one of the three current defendants his name is James ghetto he's being represented by\nA lawyer hired by Adidas and if I like James ghetto who this does executive his father was a high school coach\nHe's an insider he's a basketball insider\nAlmost all of these defendants are well liked well known insiders they're not people who operated you know outside the system I think one of the scariest things for people in the basketball industry to the extent that that they are alarmed is\nThese people were them they were family they were part of the basketball fraternity and Adidas\nAnd Under Armour and Nike are part of the corporate basketball fraternity and I don't think they're planning on much to change either if they can help it\nMichael ...
