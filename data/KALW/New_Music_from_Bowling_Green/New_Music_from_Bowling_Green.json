provoking in that way it's also scored for a pretty interesting instrumentation weird Madeleine ... out the flute\nAnd Paul row bass clarinet alongside Dermot done on the accordion so interesting instrumentation and featuring the accordion I think in a really unusual but great way in a chamber music setting\nWelcome to relevant tones I'm set those dead on today's program we'll be playing a lot

metro you're going to hear accordion players coming through the trains I've heard it in Poland I've heard a lot of countries in Europe but the accordion is actually a popular folk instrument all over

these accordion virtuoso is all over the world who are actively commissioning new pieces\nAnd they're really pushing forward with the accordion both in terms of what's possible physically on the

ancient Japanese court music because his back when their capital was an ego\nAnd there were all of these incredibly complicated rituals and writes surrounding the Japanese court and that apply to the music as well so does this very ceremonial music\nHere is ... is a low key to perform slow motion by ... and one of the things that I Want to mention really quickly is not every accordion is the same you can definitely get different sounds out of different according to one of the most striking aspects of the pieces is that the accordion is asked to\nAnd he's playing with a composer calls the

types of medical situations we presented\nSome of them will be rejected right away some of them will be transformed to be more appropriate as it were to the gate keepers so the musicians here are sort

these gigantic percussion section et cetera here has taken a lot of the metal sounds that you hear and crash and transfer them into a more kind of shit Murray wavy sound that I think ... really really well with the accordion the great work metal work we heard as much as we could get\nOf that piece I was actually a live recording\nFrom the final round of a competition in Baron\nBlessed be someone to play on the program today is by Danish composer parent or a guard and this was kind of a an interesting piece and interesting stories and interesting composer me just tell you that what about him so he's in his eighties now and he's having his amazingly career renaissance all of a sudden his music is getting performed all over the place he had a big\nPremier by the New York philharmonic last summer for example the U.S premier it was a symphony you had a big premier in Helsinki is getting all of these pre mirrors and commissions around the world\nAnd it's very late in his career he's in his eighties\nPrior to that he had really kinda flown under the radar for sixty some odd years if he tried out a lot of different styles and I think a lot of this is just he was sort of born in the wrong time if you will I mean he's not so interested in the cereal techniques a tonal music that really marked the music of the fifties sixties seventies eighties and even into\nThe nineties he was interested in finding a different way of presenting tonality and we're going to hear that in this piece is called recall and it's for concerto in chamber orchestra and it is a total is music gets it's amazing to me that this was composed in Nineteen sixty eight because this was a time when a lot of composers were saying if you weren't writing cereal music\nYou are of no use that you were actually backwards looking in hurting the history of music and so paranoid guard in this context is writing as these knowingly to me it's like an active rebellion in a way casting off the guiding principles of his teachers of his fellow composers especially the composer that are older than him it must have been really hard to do\nA very brave act when you hear the speech you're going to hear that it's inspired by folk music\nWhich of course was appropriate for the accordion and it is very tonal it's also a beautiful piece of music\nIs in three short movements called recall we're going to hear ... on a court in this is the person for him to pieces written and he's performing with the Danish national chamber orchestra led by real scoop to here's music from Nineteen sixty eight for accordion and
