D jays well and he's very entertaining guy\nThree original compositions is performed by the three featured banjo players at this year's California banjo extravaganza November seventh through twelfth in northern California we started out with that ... doing a night driver a performed pretty much with Chris Jones and the night drivers from his\nNew album called take five and then Chris cooled at a song of his called I Know you're wandering heart that's from an album called the tumbling river and other stories and\nThat was a my co host here today bill Evans from his wonderful album in good company a track that ah he calls a big chief sunny and and that the ... he was also pick of the banjo on that one and you wrote that for your guy funny I was\nI did I did it has uh some distinct phrases that are associated with other U.S born compositions like I'm big band ... for those [laughter]\nFor the one or two people who play banjo who my care that some little is too much detail well I you know it's always interesting to me to hear a the players to learn about the players and singers who influence contemporary people I mean Sonny Osborne has actually\nHad some influence on your music oh for sure yeah for for what are the things that you took from Sundays\n[noise] um well\nThere is a certain a fearlessness a to his playing that as evidenced more live than on record and so many people when I have this conversation with other banter pickers they'll say well you know what can I listen to where I can hear you know that and\nAnd my response is often gosh there isn't too much on record because he was producing those sessions and they were oftentimes a whole room of the best a list of countries session players and the Osborne brothers band and you're going to play a more in the pocket in that situation and everything is cut by but if you go on\nGo on YouTube and watch some stuff from the eighties or nineties you'll hear how bold and adventurous he\nWas and uh and the Osborne brothers' courses a band you know I like them to the Beatles or bluegrass music um in terms of pushing things forward and and um you know they were the first bluegrass band to have double banjo switches what a big chief sunny has on display\n'em and they were the country vocal group of the year in Nineteen Seventy two which is kind of a may kind of a grand may have does ice ... and how would they played that game [noise]\nYou know and then they returned to blue grass in the late mid to late Nineteen seventies\nSo everybody wants to do with these California branch extravaganza is will there be double banjo and or triple\n... there always is and I I don't want that to keep people away though [laughter] I don't know that in a jar off most most\nOf the night and and the way that I've been vision is over the years in it to me it's it's one of the\nUh joys and thrills is seeing the backup ban adapt to the headlining player and so we've got John ... Chad manning sharing Gilchrist and it's just fascinating to watch them ah you know a company each of these musicians most of the concert is\nEach individual player backed by the band or a smaller unit and then we come together for ... um\nWould we had Tony ... and Sandy sealer and die and Tony ... unveiled very ambitious far out pieces and then when they were backing at CNBC Miller I never thought those guys could sound like the lunch and rubber band but they did\nAnd and it was great just to see ... you know there's such tremendous resist the rich and they make the tour I couldn't do this without\nThem yeah for sure well since you features the or the individual banjo players in the concerts let's do it here on the show tell me a little bit about Chris yeah\nWell we always have one climber player one bluegrass player and pre school was from Toronto, Canada ah he currently tours with the lump sum a string band and hopefully we'll get them into California before too long a wonderful band that\nDefinitely sounds like a bona fide old time trio but they pushed the boundaries as well and Chris has a background in in bluegrass he played with the ... and he's\nA great song writer as well so you know I covered his son ... old dog or a ... you know several years ago and so his solo records a oftentimes heavy river theme he's an avid fishermen\nAre the ... the profits from the latest record which is called the road to the river go to a conservancy in Canada and done and very evocative a cello pieces and a great singer songwriter as well so to get that rolled into one is a big thrill he's been\nHe's appeared on number two hundred projects and many Canadian recordings and a\nTremendous tremendous singer and great authentic league\nGreat old time player\nAnd we're going to listen to free tracks here right\nYeah yeah a couple of from that that new one called ... do the river and one from the the album that we sampled does\nJust during that first set in our minds you again that you could see Chris along with a\nBill Evans is that the Iraqi and that all start band on November seventh through trout in Chico winters Berkeley so vast pole and Los Gatos go to bill Evans banjo dot com for all the details as we listen to music by ...
