magazine on the right as rich Lowry editor of National Review on what his honorary Cox hosted with friends like these and columnist for ... and our first special guest living in New Jersey the Washington correspondent for New York magazine on friday\nMorning the FBI arrested a man in connection with the attempted male bombings of critics and opponents of President Trump including George Soros the Clintons and the Obamas so far more than a dozen pipe bombs have been intercepted fortunately but none of them exploding\nThe man arrested in connection with the bombings is a fifty six year old resident of South Florida named stays our ...\nPresident Trump said at a White House event the culprit will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law but earlier friday he was complaining on Twitter about how the bomb coverage was affecting the elections he tweeted quote\nRepublicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now this quote bomb unquote stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows news not talking politics very unfortunate what is going off Republicans go out and vote\n... what's the reaction to this day and at the White House 'cause we've seen a lot of comments over the last few days from the right wing fever swamps and I count TV host like Lou Dobbs when I say right wing ... about this maybe being a false flag attempt to make Trump look bad by making it look like somebody's sending bombs\nIs that how people are thinking about inside the White House now that there's an actual suspect in custody\nWell it's difficult to say I mean initially they tried to kind of striking a diplomatic tone I thought after Donald Trump's rally the other night\nPeople were saying they always do that he is somehow pivot that this is a new Donald Trump because he was not outright attacking a members of the price of the normally does that obviously that was short lived I mean you could have predicted that\nAnd now today Donald Trump has uh an event in the eastern it's happening at as as we talk right now\nI'm at say a young black leadership sentiment and he's talking about I can just owing on stage at who just a few days ago called this a false flag attacked basically and so I think that\nAny hope that he would respond to this differently than we would have expected if it's probably faded away by now\nAs for how people in in the White House feel I mean you saw some of some of I think that the true feeling coming through when you when Sarah Huckabee Sanders attacked CNN after they released their initial statement ah from from Jeff Zucker\nA condemning Donald Trump's rhetoric they kind of can't help themselves or even at a moment like this when they should be trying to unify the country or at least a toned down some of the rhetoric that cannot help a fanning the flames and engaging in these fights um and I responded the other day\nWhen Sarah Huckabee Sanders first ...\nFirst responded negatively to CNN just saying like what does this accomplish it's very difficult to see how it helps and uh and it's very difficult to see how it how is that it's going to help the country at all but I don't think that they really care about that I think we've seen that again and again in times of crisis\nIt rich jump shooter from CNN tweeted out a photo of the side of of this guy's van which among other things out of CNN sucks sticker that is a popular chance\nTo get him to just read the report they had tried to include his name and each paragraphs said that he follows me at least follows a through that to the end of the sheet of paper that he's reading looking for his own name were as we sit I think people call that the Washington read\nUh [laughter] but it's also the Donald Trump breeds ... no it doesn't surprise me um but I I think it's it's terribly worrying that you have spies listening in I think one of the most interesting parts of that report by a net Rosenberg and that you have room and\nIs that they're listening not just to get information but to figure out\nTo be most successful who does he really listened to and why did you listen to them I mean that you're\nReading I mean isn't isn't this a scandal I mean parts of it are amusing but even if the president is not reading a classified report the president's own thoughts and feelings and who he listens to his sensitive information\nHillary Clinton got an a lot of trouble for what seems like a you know less significant intelligence breach the Nat how why isn't you know why aren't oversight committees in Congress looking into this isn't this substantively important regardless the politics of it\nIs another one of these stories if there were any other president this would be dominate the next quarter of news and it's just there there's so much in the era of Trump a of a friend who's a national security expert and actually called them before the show so what do you what do you make the story\nWhat's right I I missed this is actually possible the minutes if in today's news environment obviously it's incredibly reckless it's even worse\nBecause it's completely avoidable I mean it's not as though he couldn't call people they would just be logged in John Kelly would know so to\nTake this sort of risk just to avoid your chief of staff knowing is it's it's really hard to get your\nYour um your head around and you know apparently the New York times is right the Chinese are using information from these calls and the friends he was calling to try to influence those friends to influence Trump which is also astonishing and very bad\nFirst of all I continue to argue that the media safest thing for the country would be to turn the White House in ... something like the Truman Show where he can pretend to be president and had like a self contained bubble\nUm and he can watch himself on TV and talk to the people on the TV and they can talk back to him and the other thing is actually if I can quickly ask Olivia based on her reporting do you think there's anything he says on these phone calls that he doesn't say in public\nLike is there anything that he ... himself in public that he would he would just suddenly like reveal in private that doesn't seem possible to me it's just seem impossible\nAnd based on my reporting since he's been in office perhaps the only thing that he would not revealing public our concerns about his family\nConcerns about if the avant garde and Jared Milan yet I'm concerned about the investigation but I think a lot a lot of these phone calls I did a story about his relationship it's a Sean Hannity a few months back\nAnd when I found is that a lot of it it's really just him gossiping him talking about TV ratings and talking about all the things that he cared about during his life in New York um and I I Want us to just add that I think it's ... I keep thinking about the fact that when he first entered office\nOne of the first portraits that they they line the walls of the west wing with\nEverything is terrible and it was Donald Trump on his Android phones to this enormous cell phone to his ear this close up shot at him and I I just think in light of the story that's even funnier than it was at the time\nLiving in New Jersey from New York magazine I Want to thank you for joining us thank you\nI also want to note Olivia on a rich and I will all be together for our show two weeks from now which is going to take before a live audience November seven in New York the day after the election\nWe're doing the show in partnership with my other employer which is New York magazine Olivia and Jonathan Chait will both be there from the magazine so we'll see corn occupy MSNBC understood Herndon from the New York times\nYou're gonna hear that show on the radio you'll hear it as a podcast but if you live in New York or if you feel it coming to New York you get tickets and come see us in person those are available at KCRW dot com slash L R C live\nI've been talking with rich Lowry of National Review and author Marie Cox with friends like these we'll be back with the federal records or five thirty eight to get a sense of what's about to happen in the election they're listening to electric center [noise]\nWhat do you think share your thoughts on today's show on our Facebook page or tweet us at ...

friends like these and columnist for ... girls and since we're less than two weeks away from the election we're joined now by Daniel ... who is elections analyst at five thirty eight hind Daniel hey how's it going\nGoing well thank you uh before we get into the specific forecast themselves I Want to ask you about forecasting a lot of people were really mad at the election forecasters after the twenty sixteen election because they felt they'd been told Hillary Clinton was going to win and then she lost\nAnd I know your boss Nate Silver response was basically we didn't say she was going to win we said she was probably going to win has\nReaders learned that lesson or have people has the conversation Ron odds gotten better in that people have an understanding that if you say something has a twenty percent chance of happening it's going to happen one out of every five times\nYeah a great question and I appreciate that you kind of brought that up by herself because these are that the first thing that I Need to say um\nBut ah yeah I think that it's gotten a little bit better I think when we initially launch our house for cats at five thirty eight are the chances that we gave Democrats to pick up the house for roughly the same as what we gave Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen and a lot of people I think picked up on that ... that oh well five thirty eight was wrong quote unquote last\nTime even though as you point out you are\nWrong exactly we do have a Trump a thirty percent chance I think people\nAre picking up on the fact that isn't that don't go for a Democrat that that in the height of election eight and I think people always you know round up to a hundred percent make assumptions where they shed\nSo what are we talking about where those forecasts stand with that caviar that forecast is not a one hundred percent production what are the odds looking like for Democrats taking back the house and what are the roads in the Senate\nYeah though according to the factory forecast currently Democrats ... ... and ...\nAre picking up the house at the clock smelly eighty five percent um another thing that we've done is we've started to refer to hang them made it kind of stick them seven or ... then why chances which we think empathize with the fact that one time out of seven Republicans do keep the house\nI'm In the Senate fight it almost the exact inverse there's a five and six chance or about eighty two percent that Republicans keep controlled a so basically Democrat or as much of an underdog in the Senate as Republicans are and how\nRich I Wonder do you make of the president's clear choice over the last few weeks to really put himself front and center in the campaign he decided he should be on TV more he's out doing rallies more frequently and we'll be doing them even more frequently in the week and a half before the election his approval numbers have improved somewhat but it doesn't look like that's translating into stronger numbers for Republicans at least in the house races\nI think a little one is just what he wants to do right he wants to be the center of attention no matter what whether it makes sense or not I think this makes more sense than would have six months ago because the approval ratings have picked up the wall Street Journal poll is kind of ...\nPresident was higher than President Obama was at this point in his first term and in Senate races in particular it's that the a lot of these battles earned Trump territory and he can really help you can also helping some some house races but\nThey're just there are many more house races where he he can't help at all and I think part of the calculation is that you know the Democratic base particularly suburban women they they already have them as much as they are going to hate him there already energized so you might as well go all out try to energize your your\nSide as well so what do you make of that I I hear this a lot basically Democrats were already in a tent on enthusiasm and so at the margin more enthusiasm can only be good for Republicans but then I look and you know that there's all these people who don't vote\nIn mid term elections normally who do vote pretty reliably in presidential elections that means that on both sides are have to be a lot of people out there who theoretically could be gotten devote if there was more enthusiasm\nI can just suspect there's not a lot of talk on the table for Trump I mean I I think that you've he's already got the people who are going to be excited by him coming to town you know what I mean like I think\nThe people that aren't going to vote and the people that he lost our you know college educated suburban women and him coming to town doesn't make them any more than likely to vote for Republicans I think it may make them just less likely to vote they may not want to vote for Democrats or they may incoming may may inspire them to vote for Democrats I\nThink it's a weird play 'em knowing the president he'll he'll probably argue is if they do lose the house that he didn't go out enough\nUm [laughter] I I I I think it's sort of the trees a lot about his thinking that he does really think you know I Alone can fix it and and he's really unwilling to let the Republican Party um localized elections which I don't know if that's a great idea and then the term election editor nationalized everything\nWith every every first Nathaniel\nQuickly how competitive is this race really I Know Nate Silver or are you guys on your website did a qualitative quote simulation where Nate pretended to come back from the future and in the in the simulation where things are really good for Democrats involved Beto pulling it out actually winning this race I Know you guys see that as something that is at least within the realm of possibility\nYeah exactly and am frankly Democrats are going to win the Senate um that one of the main way they would do that basically either they win Texas ... the or North Dakota I personally think North Dakota's of likely but Texas is perfectly\nI'm likely it or not likely but impossible as well I'm currently we give it over a one in five chance Ted Cruz a four and five chance but I mean you can pay those numbers closely mirror overall numbers so yeah in a scenario in which Democrat outperform the older the polls are off by\nYou know three or four points which is a fairly normal polling air historically speaking um yeah that's become a nail biter rate\nUm deathbed based on what we know right now Ted Cruz is\nClearly favored a like you said is leading and all that much but you have to go back to the mid September to uphold that even have the two tied um so ... if you I think a lot of liberals are squinting and paying all medical it out and that is truly could but should count\nYour your ... should be that kind of in\nThe ... elections analyst FiveThirtyEight thank you for joining us ... thing\nI've been talking with ... with friends

I think he feel sort of powerless that he's not been able to stop migration efforts\nAt the southern border but as I say it's getting to this has been a complex issue that and it's a policy issue that was that the president inherited from the Obama administration is is a problem that your father was rational to solve the problem\nYou have all these relationships in the region where you need to get the Mexican government to be helpful you would like more stability in the Central American countries so that fewer people would feel the need to try to leave\nAnd so you have a president who who wraps and raves about this and at the same time was threatening to cut off aid to these countries whose revoking temporary protected status for people from Central America in the U.S which is likely to further destabilize those countries including by gang members were in the U.S returning to Central America and causing further unrest in Central America so where's the president's strategy here\nOther than you know yelling and talking about executive orders\nDo one as has been pointed out Mexico does a fair amount and this this area and we need them just as much as as it possibly can which is one reason you shouldn't go out of your way to insult\nMexico or Mexicans to the idea that um ... Honduras than in Guatemala age to be cut off because we're not stopping this migrant flow and they're very few countries in the world that stop people from leaving their country is you know the ...\nAnd states and even if there is that that a will to to do it um there's not the the capacity\nIn in this country so that's entirely miss forgotten I Will say I think this is a legitimate story I think it's a the images are compelling which obviously drives the TV coverage\nAnd it's just not every day you have um a caravan I think maybe as three thousand people at that time basically forcing its way through international border into Mexico so it's right that this does get coverage\nOr I think what tends to get lost the president occasionally hits on this is the problem is we have an enormous loophole and they're all system now ... ah regarding families unions units from Central America and they set foot in in the United states is very likely\nThey're going to stay so it doesn't matter whether they're ... voluntarily surrendering to border agents or if we send an Infantry Division down there they'll just\nThey'll just surrendered soldiers because they'll make an asylum claim a ... almost always the initial credible fear interview is granted and then it takes so long to adjudicate the asylum claim you can't hold them down there there isn't the capacity to do it and they're all sorts of other problems as we learn\nSo then you're you're sent into the United states and they they know that and that's one of the reasons not entirely but as one of the reasons they come in and although all over all the ... down this particular population is growing\nOn what is the liberal position on this caravan and on Central American migration more broadly because David Frum wrote a piece this week basically saying that the Democrats\nNeed to be made to protect themselves from ending up in a de facto pro caravan position this is a this is the policy concern that his inherited from the Obama administration then while the Obama administration loose and some of the rules about who could claim asylum in the U.S they also had this partnership with Mexican Government that was frankly aimed\nAt trying to to to limit the flows of people who would appear at the U.S border and be able to seek these asylum claims I mean of the ... the millions of people in Central America who have legitimate fears about unrest and gang violence and domestic violence in their country I mean do all those people have a valid claim on asylum in the u._s. should all of them be able to come

report regarding a dispute in a bar Kavanaugh was involved in a college student at Yale in Nineteen eighty five [noise]\nCan you make the argument for us why is this important to Brett Kavanaugh through I used to have someone in a bar thirty three years ago\n[noise] [noise] yeah that's a great question I think on Kavanaugh open himself up to this kind of reporting with his dismissal and minimizing of his drinking and conduct in high school and college and what happened after his testimony a lot of people who knew him then at that time of his life\nWhere I'm really shocked at the way he described himself and the degree to which she was on I think really minimizing is the right word um a lot of hard drinking he was doing and this matters of course because he has completely denied allegations of sexual assault and ruled out the idea that he could have\nDone these things when he was blackout drunk so our story was based on a police report and it just for court at this bar fight incident that cabin on and it's friend Chris deadly were involved in 'em and it just sort of painted a picture of some of what he was up to in college I'm don't fight ended when Chris Lee threw up\nThe hospital that Lee was arrested\nRich or the reaction to this\nArticle from from conservatives it's a it's sort of feel like we've gone through three phases of opposition to judge Kavanaugh at first you had some critics have his were basically like already unduly at an eleven over things like you know credit card balances that changed over the years and a lot of speculating about what that meant about ... about his finances\nThen you had this allegation emerged from doctor for that really merited beat the\nOpposition being at eleven and Republicans look a little bit chase in for a while and then you've had\nMore objections to Kavanaugh about either less serious or less reliable claims about his behavior and Democrats remain at eleven and Republicans this has given them in a window to basically dismissed everything as a witch hunt basically saying you know they they just they're out to get Kavanaugh but even if we stipulate that they're out to get capital I\nMean have have conservatives really dealt with the corps for the allegation and then what Emily describes there it's not so much that it matters if Kavanaugh was in a bar fight thirty three years ago but the he's staked his reputation on certain claims about his behavior and personality such that it's implausible that he could have even been involved in these sorts of things when he was younger don't we sort of\nDemeanor and his part is in attacks\nIn his testimony from the point of view of the legal profession\nThere's a stumbling block here and it has to do with judicial temperament and character and veracity these things we are discussing earlier it's not about the useful conduct it's about how he's handling himself now there are lots of other people who disagree folks like rich he you know they are willing to look past these\nDuring but I think for a lot of people within the legal profession\nWho want to think of the court and in some way at least one step removed from politics and that has been its role at some moments in American history um we do of this idea that the Supreme Court has the power of judicial review has the power to say what the constitution means and that it's made up of people who are not elected\nIf you think that matters then that is very much tied to the courts legitimacy and having such a controversial um confirmation process that ends with on\nAnd that's that's the game that I think a lot of people's minds did not resolve these key questions about sexual assault or about ... that's going to be tough on the court and it may slow down John Roberts on and other conservatives who want to make real changes in a conservative direction to the law\nReally bad one I Want to thank for joining us thanks for having me\nI'll be back with rich Lowry of

late Nineteen nineties so I guess maybe this was all ... attacks and I apologize for that Steve ... is a national political correspondent at NBC News and MSNBC and he's written a new book called the red and blue Nineteen nineties and the birth of political tribalism\nHi Steve thanks for joining us Hi Josh thanks for having me\nSo I've watched a Supreme Court nominee discuss under oath what he meant by goofing in his high school yearbook quotes\nWash them sidestep this question about whether he's the board of Kavanaugh and more judges alcohol so memoir watching him contends that ... was not a sexual innuendo about one of his high school college I'm reminded of the debates over what the definition of Israelis\nHow as someone who's just you know spent so much time writing a book about Ninety politics how much of this feels like a Ninety flash back to you\nYes exactly I knew exactly where you're going to I think when you when you started with that because they are one of the defenses of Kavanaugh from these charges that he was being a invasive or untruthful or whatever in his uh\nUh in his appearance last week a you know is that he was making technically true statements that might have left out context or might have been in complete and of course that's what Bill Clinton was famous for doing that would um it it it would it would drive his opponents crazy\nIt really throughout his entire um his entire rise in politics in it and it was something that um you know of course he was in Ninety eight at the beginning of the Lewinsky saga that Hillary Clinton claimed to there was a vast right wing conspiracy that was out to get her husband to get her um one of the things that that that fuel so much of the conservative um\nDistaste for Bill Clinton was you know they call them slick willy his ability to to find some precise lawyer leeway to maneuver his way out of jams with words and then they thought even if he was saying things that were true they thought he was being dishonest well and then the\nThe other thing was that these these lines of questioning that Bill Clinton was invading very often they were about accusations that he had behaved in a way that conservatives considered to be a moral and part of the reason that it was supposedly okay to be invasive or in some cases outright dishonest was that it wasn't anybody's business and you know well he was lying he was lying about sex and it feels like those roles have\nCompletely reverse we're now you have a left that his newly energized around a morality in politics obviously a different set of moral values than the right was focused on Twenty years ago but it's more morality based politics and its conservatives basically saying that a lot of these questions aren't important more often with regard to President Trump\nOn although we've seen some of that with regard to to judge Kavanaugh\nThat's been an interesting transformation to write some literally some of the people who were Bill Clinton's chief critics\nAre from the right on questions of morality and then that is the sort of you know merger of morality in politics you Bill Bennett comes to mind I think notably um had become Trump supporters you know a generation later two decades later a couple of different ways to look at that I guess one of the things that I've I've heard just in having conversations with folks\nWho made that shift you say and you can you can say hey take a look at what you were saying about the importance of\nOf truth in you know in in a in a president the importance of a\nA a moral values and a president take a look what you were saying then versus now what happened one of the things\nYou hear back or at least that I've heard back as the idea that that Bill Clinton um and his defenders you know Bill Clinton his defenders in the media Bill Clinton and his defenders in popular culture they basically succeeded in changing the rules in breaking the system\nAnd and the conclusion that folks on the right some folks on the right\nDrew from that you know a generation later over time is that I'm a hate they don't need a moral exemplar to lead them anymore are they more feel like that the kids on a playground or being bullied and you know when they went out and they found their own bully to fight back and that's how they kind of you Donald Trump by I don't take a position on whether\nThat's the that's the you know it appropriate uh a way to sort of a a process the last Twenty years but it seems like\nSome have rich is that what you've lived through yeah definitely I mean that that's the go to argument and Steve regulations on the book and flood or it's worth I find you one of the most compelling political analysts on television something I'm curious what your take is clearly you know have this enormous divide\nBut George W. Bush after these\nIntense hateful fights Nineteen nineties heap pivoted away from them and said on the lighter not a divider had rocket bomb a famously end of the convention speech that would\nPropel him to fame and eventually the presidency was all about they're not being a red or blue America and he ran on a unifying theme was sort of stands out about Donald Trump because he didn't actually say this word but his his theme was no actually I'm a divider [laughter] you know [laughter] so where where do you think the public is just in terms of\nWanting to get beyond this divide I mean they're obviously everyone's implicated in it or most people are but are are we in a different place because people don't care so much about I'm trying to to get beyond this division or do you think we'll see a Democrat in twenty twenty who who run and that kind of traditional unifying theme these have you Donald Trump\nNo I mean look I I think we have we are conflicted as human beings is one of the things that um that that that sort of occurred to me well well writing this I think on some level we are hardwired going way back for tribalism for tribal thinking for tribal associations and\nIt we we may not like to think it but I I think it's there and I think the way our politics involved in in in not just our politics but the media too and in sort of the way those two things um interact\nThe way it's evolved over the last generation or so just lends itself to tribalism maybe lends itself to you know finding a media source that I'm a ... that you agree with that to shutting out of media source that you don't just surrounding yourself with with voices you find pleasing\nTo identifying herself as part of that group and of course we're not like you know those folks who listen to the other thing or watch the other thing\nUm we we now the media political culture that really caters to that you know we also we we like intuitively and instinctively the the idea of a unifying message we like to believe that we can transcend tribalism that we can transcend partisanship and\nYou know yes Bush in in in two thousand um that was the the promise of his campaign was enough for him to win but you know barely I mean it was it was the closest thing to a\nA perfect time we've ever had a ... in this country when they ever have um you know Obama right there are no red states there are no blue states well I think we found that in the Obama era there are red states blue states\nThere is a red America there is a blue America ah so neither one of them was was able to ah to transcend that either um I I I just think that the bigger problem is you know politics have been a nationalized I'm In a way I don't see how we go back from not just nationalized\nUm they've they've merged with this this this media that just puts those divisions and puts those those tribal distinctions in everybody's face every second of every day and every second of every day you're confronted with a choice of which side of my own and and that's\nI take it as a given the Democratic energy is is is there in November what does that do to this this sudden burst of energy Republican suddenly have they've been they've been trying so hard to create it and they've got it or does it endured as it just does it just stayed out\nYeah in terms of timing the Access Hollywood tape was what October October seven read

I mean last week on this show not not to pick on Evelyn Evelyn Marcus was saying that she expected that these talks would drag out for quite a substantial period that the U.S and Canada we're quite far apart\nIs is this an area you know the president is always going around saying he doesn't get get enough credit has not been given enough credit here where he sort of had this whole new China shop approach and it's not clear that he's gotten huge changes and he definitely\nHasn't gotten the turn away from the global free trading regime that he claims to oppose\nBut he does seem to have gotten incremental changes that are at least from his framework favorable to the United states [noise]\nYeah I mean that's the thing that Trump's effective or in some unusual way is right just because he's willing to to do politics and unusual way I'm it reminds me of the things that are conservative say about Reagan or that sort of Reagan struck the global stage as being unstable enough\nA to a elicit certain changes at a worry of what he would do with others didn't cooperate I think Trump maybe strikes a similar note I'm I I don't know it's his base and it's going to be altogether thrilled\nI'm with you know having a new NAFTA Senate old NAFTA um but you know as as far as they're willing to give them credit for incrementalism I'm sure there please\nIt rich that's the funny thing here that ultimately Trump now sort of owns this global trade regimes he now says NAFTA is good because it's his NAFTA or it's as us MCA the U.S South Korea trade agreement didn't change that much but Trump has gone from railing against us talking about how good it is\nIt looks to me like he is selling those to his base that they weren't really committed anti free traders who wanted NAFTA necessarily ripped up\nAnd are super bothered by this is that sustainable though I mean some of the some of the reasons that he was able to to make hay out of trade agreements was that there have been real disruptions in the U.S labor market associated with certain aspects of foreign trade\nThese changes are not going to materially change those effects right well one key question we had throughout this you know during the campaign especially who always said I Want better deals because everyone negotiated the deal is we're we're idiots\nBut the suspicion was no you didn't win deals at all I just wanted to rip up and tear down the the current trade regime\nAnd this is not that it might be a better deal it might be a worst deal I'm but I'm all things considered as you point out it's just basically\nMarginal and I think in terms of the politics of this is very good for free trade for the reason you outlined here's here's the single most vociferous voice against every single\nTrade agreement the United states has had the less last fifty years\nSigning onto a new version of NAFTA and giving it to his seal of approval I think that will matter for a core of his supporters\nAnd helps the the free trade him\nAny something you said it's something I've been hearing for a lot of people which is that by rationing down these trade tensions within the north American area with South Korea ah with the ... you were the president stepped down from a brink of wanting to impose auto tariffs on that you\nDid that freak people up to work together on our shared grievances with China what does that mean in practice is there something that we're going to do now with Canada\nThat household China accountable in some way what is that gonna look like\n[noise] yes I think that um it's true that now that the president can declare victory on on the negotiating NAFTA even though there are skilled and very problematic provision like thing like their parents' plans on and on them and um um\nIn the office of the U.S trade representative will be able to\nUm work together with European Japanese Canadian counterparts on how to gather we can pressure the Chinese more effectively\nTo move forward on market access liberalization and tear down the barriers that they are standing by in in keeping their market closed and forcing American and Japanese and European companies to transfer technology\nAnd the price of entry to the market alone it's difficult for the United states and moved China on this but together with other like minded countries the China pursuing unfair trade practices\nI think there will be more of a more effective way to pressure the Chinese\nCan we talk about this big Bloomberg story in this context on Wednesday Bloomberg Businessweek published a bombshell article about tiny microchip sort of appeared on Chinese made mother boards which appear to be hacking devices that help the Chinese government compromise foreign government and\nCorporate servers the Bloomberg article allegedly devices were even found on servers an apple and Amazon\nThose companies have issued unusually categorical denial of a new story like this thing they'd never found these devices never talk with the FBI about finding them and they insist they are under no gag order that would prevent them from discussing such facts if they had found such devices\nAny what do you make of this story and if the if the Chinese really are doing this what is the significance both both economically and from a national security perspective I mean we have this super integrated supply chain we rely on enormous numbers of electronic devices to come out of China\nWhile it is um it's very helpful to the Trump Administration that the story broke this week the same week that vice president and and delivered a speech that was highly critical of a widespread array of Chinese practices including cyber espionage\nAnd so this really does lend credence to the Trump administration's viewpoint that global supply chains are a problem for American national security if there are these vulnerabilities and there's a Bloomberg report", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Left, Right, & Center", "city": "San Francisco",

center and business columnist at New York magazine on the right just him Carney commentary editor at the Washington Examiner on the left Elizabeth rooted columnist at the Washington Post and our first special guest today is James Kirchick he's a visiting fellow at the center on the United states and Europe at the Brookings Institution\nAnd a columnist for the Daily Beast\nWell the story they seem to be going with is Rogan killers ... a columnist for the Washington Post and former Saudi insider turned a critic of crown prince Mohammed bin Salman disappeared after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second\nThe Turkish government says it has obtained an audio recording of his interrogation and torture death and just remember Mitt\nGruesome details of which were published in the New York times at first the Saudis in such a good show he was alive but missing but now they've been working on an excuse whoever killed him wasn't authorized to do so by the crown prince and when I say they don't just mean the Saudis the president has been helping along with this line\nLike they should have been known to the bottom of it very flat denial\nLiz I Want to start with you this was your colleague what do you make of this\n[noise] yeah it's really shaken us up I'm at the post you wrote for op eds that to my section on the road for carrying a tia who is my colleague and it's a fantastic writer and editor\nUm I mean a you know it's uh it seems like the story that was published in the times are with regard to what happened to him ... is probably\nClose to the truth right it it doesn't really strain credulity I'm I'm a little bit skeptical of the footage the audio footage of what happened having been transmitted by apple watch to a phone seems more like the Turks probably just have the conflict bugged 'em but\nUh it it's extremely disturbing and uh and it's something that um he has to be kind of a flash point and it's it's it's escalating quickly\nJudy the remarkable thing here for me is obviously\nA lot of terrible things over time and yet they've been a close important ally of ours for a number of decades what is the case for the Saudi alliance what do we get from aligning ourselves with this government that that we acknowledge does a number of things that we think are quite bad\nWell they are one of the world's biggest producers of oil and we will still does matter it's not earning less as the United states is fracking and there are alternative sources of energy but it doesn't matter\nAnd they also are are are Maine's Arab strategic ally in the middle east in terms of containing Iran which is a revision this power it's an anti American government anti Israel\nThere fomenting warns stability across the middle east and the Saudis generally are on our side in pushing back against Iranian influence that's the case for it is that worth it are we getting enough out of this deal that is that it's worth putting up with all this bad behavior by the Saudis I mean this is a very\nDifficult neighborhood and that sounds like a cliche but it's but it's true and you know you're not going to have a bunch of Jeffersonian\nDemocrats with you if you're dealing with Saudi Arabia um I Do think it's an important alliance is worth preserving but this is the sort of behavior that cannot go unpunished and there should be reprimanded for this and look this is the kind of thing that the Russians are the north Koreans do you know killing\nCitizens on foreign soil this is not something that the Saudis have engaged in you know and until now and now they're joining the ranks of you know of countries like Russia and North Korea Tim what feels\nThere are I mean a lot of financial inducement they receive a massive military aid arms deals all of these things to be on the table and they have been in the past when there's when they've been issues with with with Saudi Arabia and I think I'm certainly that should be on the table\nBut this sort of thing can become a precedent where we can just be you know murder by countries and diplomatic postings around the world\nBut hasn't the president made that impossible I mean he's been out there with comments talking about how important do you think's the arms sales relationship between us and Saudi Arabia is would make it hard for him to credibly threaten to cut that off\nIf you recall diplomats for we don't even have an ambassador in Saudi Arabia and if you if you recall other diplomats that's supposed to be basically a symbolic thing saying you know we're very mad at you but when the president does out there sending signals that he doesn't really care about this does that symbolism of moving the diplomats around me\nI think it does have less with this particular president because there's been less of a um of a of an emphasis put on diplomacy and there's sort of this kind of weird um diplomatic style of this particular president but we often see the use of east seems to say things\nThat have been put in his head by the last person I spoke to him I think that's what we saw with the statement that you just played a couple of minutes earlier about the road killers you've probably heard that from someone just repeating it I think if secretary Pompeo and and uh Mr bolt in the national security advisor both of them are serious people and and who understands that American credibility\nIs on the line here this is an American residents not a citizen but a resident who wrote for one of our major newspapers\nAnd try to persuade the president this is not just a slap in the face the United states also an insult to him I mean if this President Trump this is the first country he visited his as president Saudi Arabia is really oriented American foreign policy away from you know cozying up to her on his last president and then moved back to the traditional\nPosition of being closer to our Sunni Arab allies in Israel so\nPrison terms invested a lot in this relationship we just had NBS through this whole tour of the United states so I you know if I were secretary Pompeo and try to make the case personal to him that you know you've invested a lot in this relationship and this is this is an insult to you and you need to exact some sort of tribute ... I'm In in response\nYeah who knows what the president's national interests are and whether that to overriding a chef Jamie Kirchick I Want to thank you for joining us thank you I Will be back with Tim Carney of the Washington Examiner and lose brunette of the Washington Post talk about Congress was full of front and center\nWhat do you think share your thoughts on today's show on our Facebook page or tweet us at LIC KCRW and download the KCRW at to listen to left right and center on demand [noise]\nWhite House correspondent April Ryan clashed with Sarah Sanders and Sean Spicer and was put on a black list for asking President Trump if he's racist\nIn her new book under fire is reporting from the frontlines of the Trump White house she talks about the challenges of covering this administration April Ryan joins us to look ahead to the midterm elections this week on days [noise]\nTomorrow at twelve noon heroin KLW San Francisco\nAnd tomorrow you can join KLW for a signature blend of music in story telling by bay area journalists writers and entertainers\nAs part of San Francisco's lick crawl the closing night event for the ... quake festival here from Liz Mac with snap judgment actor Don Reid\nHospice Maria Jose Monti Hillary another\nFive PM tomorrow at the chapel in San Francisco's Mission District information and KLW dot org\nBack again with left right and center I'm Josh barrel of New York magazine and MSNBC on the right is Tim Carney commentary editor at the Washington Examiner and on the left is Elizabeth Rubik columnist at the Washington Post\nAnd we're now joined by Burgess Everett congressional reporter at Politico Republicans are hoping to retain their majority in next month's elections and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has his pitch about why voters should keep them in power is extraordinarily\nWe wish list for many years of just about than daughter with tax reform to regulatory reform to Supreme Court justices eighty for\nA lifetime appointment to the courts is terrific period of your life America right of center at obviously that's what I prefer\nTim is he right is this the successful Congress for conservatives\nBut I mean the main thing they ran on was repealing Obamacare and Obamacare still fans so in that way it's a failure bought the the tax cut that acts in some ways as a tax reform by reducing corporate rates and increasing the standard deduction for\nIndividuals I think is good for the economy it's one of the things that are Republicans also run on and a succeeded\nAnd confirming the conservative justices to the Supreme Court and judges to the lower court is really the main thing that most conservatives were looking for from Trump and a Republican Congress so it's it's a mixed bag with taxes and judges is worth quite a lot\n... I keep coming back to something that Corey Lewandowski said I think it's the only smart thing Corey Lewandowski or say ... don't turn out to say thank you\nUm I think we're starting to use some signs that liberals remain outraged about the cabinet confirmation about any number of things the president has done but the conservatives who got their way on Kavanaugh are not necessarily clawing up the walls to turn out and say thank you\nYeah I mean it's hard to predict um you know there was some speculation that the Kavanaugh hearings\nA would sort of inflame a conservative participation coming election\nUm and I can test and they see that as possible\nUm and and there were also polls around the time and Kevin confirmation that showed that the enthusiasm gap between Republicans and Democrats actually married pretty substantially um so uh you know whether or not that trend will continue or will will turn out in the in the exit polls I'm\nA certainly hope that uh that Democrats or or or independent to lean left get out and not and vote and are already registered because a lot of those deadlines bypassed\nBurgess I Want to know what you make of this interview in the context of the message that the president has been trying to send in the lead up to this election because the president is clearly wants to talk about a different set of issues he wants to say the Democrats are for crime and weak borders and if you elect them you're going to have chaos and mobs in the U.S\nIt's very different from the economic agenda that Republicans in Congress tend to say they want to run on\nYeah and I I actually think you're probably in more of the Trump rhetoric in an advertising campaigns at least you know like over the phone it in the Senate races and the conservative state where most of the battleground or this cycle it's really sort of culture wars is what you're seeing\nA you're really not seeing people don't run ads on circuit court judges ah you're not seeing much on tax reform\nAh but you are seeing a lot of stuff about just in cinema ... was a liberal activist back in the day or that Bill Braniff in a fantasy of former governor is gonna be a vote for Chuck Schumer I mean I think you're just going to see sort of this base turnout\nUm culture wars style ad dominating these things so [noise]\nYou know senator McConnell's probably not going to be talking about this stuff as much but even if you listen to his rhetoric you know you you've heard about the the liberal mobs that the Republicans talk about um with regard to the Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd I I think that's a larger play that Republicans are saying you know they're not saying shake up Washington are saying keep it out of it and don't let the liberals takeover essentially\nAnother matter that McConnell addressed in this interview that is really caught people's attention were some comments that he made about rising budget deficits he says he is concerned about higher budget deficits but he doesn't blame the big Republican tax cuts\nIt's very disturbing it as it's ruined by the three big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid that Seventy percent of what we spend\nThe you have the president out there saying that Republicans are the ones we're going to protect your Medicare Democrats are going to ruin it by imposing some sort of single payer system if McConnell is out there saying this you know what Republicans seem to be essentially trying to deny that they're going to try to cut these entitlement programs at some point that it was like a negative message for Republicans in this campaign\nI consider myself pretty close McConnell watcher he's been saying for years uh it's the timing of it that matters and so while he's sort of on the victory tour actor confirming cabin uh uh I think you know he did sort of get a bit off message and start talking about entitlement programs and this is where Democrats have\nMade the bread and butter of their campaigns ah ever since I started covering Congress you know twenty fourteen twenty twelve twenty ten ... this is where Democrats feel most comfortable so I think in that sense Democrats feel like McConnell handed them a gift but\nI have not seen paid ads on the yet I'm not sure if there's going to be time to cut them maybe there is but it doesn't feel like\nRight now that the ground has shifted entirely just because of the comments of the Senate majority leader is made Republicans will basically tell you if Trump isn't saying it it doesn't matter nearly as much they're not trying to fame McConnell's words don't matter but they're trying to say how much bigger microphone\nTim going back to the question of whether this was a successful Congress for conservatives in theory conservatives were supposed to want to shrink the government and they cut taxes\nUm but in the long run if the government keep spending money that has to be paid for one way or another ... Republicans are supposed to be in favor of cutting these programs one is it that they actually intend to do that\n[noise] no I think that's a great question um I remember a time when spending was legitimately going down when I first became a a political reporter and it's when we had a Democratic president Bill Clinton\nWhat what do we make of the CNN report about this new department of justice investigation a newly disclosed department of justice investigation into at least seven of the eight dioceses in Pennsylvania plus the diocese of buffalo in New York they they called a source familiar with the subpoena the buffalo diocese saying that it sought quote\nDiet fusion documentation regarding pornography taking victims across state lines and inappropriate use of cell phones and social media so a lot of these allegations have dealt with activity from from decades ago that could not be prosecuted but that makes it sound like they're looking for something that would be a lot more recent involved cell phones and social media and pornography\nWell they do have to look at if it's a federal thing they have to look at a federal crime and a lot of um criminal statute is on the state level so and abuse case I mean being not a federal crime doesn't mean it's not serious right a sexual abuse cases tends to be a state level a crime unless it involves crossing state lines\nAnd a lot of uh you know the cell phone stuff but yes if the the the closest thing to sort of\nUm good news to come out of the Pennsylvania documents was that almost all of this was sort of pre two thousand for ... two thousand two when you have lots of the Boston suffer came out and did seem that met most of the reforms that happened\nI had to do with a you know we're a did have an effect of a curbing this abused and so if we do have things that are more recent than that then that would open the wound even farther than it has been opened in the past couple of months\nThink that's exactly right I also think that another aspect of this scandal that's aggravating it or is that in two thousand two two thousand three people were mainly being exposed allegations of sexual abuse of children by priests which is unspeakable horrible\nI'm now we're dealing with the fact that not all of those priests were adequately handled they were not all punished in many cases or they were protected in on a continuing basis up to the present\nAnd we're dealing with the fact that I'm a the abuses seminarians and adults\nAre in the church is being revealed in this round um that's what make Carrick was accused of\nMainly he does have a couple of allegations of abuse of minors um but primarily what he was known for was it ... it was a abusing sexually abusing seminarians a ads and these are you know adult Catholics who are in training to become priests [noise]\nUm I think that's new that's further aggravated things the churches unwillingness to deal with\nThe abuse or an exploitation of adults and its care or you know being sort of live about that uh is is also extremely disturbing I think that probably the worst possible thing um\nThat could happen and is already happening which is that\nI'm ... and by worst possible thing I mean worse for the prospects of the American Catholic Church\nAnd that is multiple attorneys general in multiple states opening their own investigations one by one\nOvertime or which means that just sort of on a rolling basis every few years every year we'll get another released like the Pennsylvania grand jury report which will just be a discussing a newly detailed extremely disturbing will prompt\nFurther federal probes uh and so stretching over the course of many many years will essentially\nAlways have news about a sexual abuse in the Catholic Church if there's anything that's ever been custom designed to destroy a church establishment that's it\nIt's called confession I Do it all the time uh and they are the church officials need to open their records they need to confess to what they've done a there needs to be ... ah and if that\nMeans the churches under staffed and that's better than the church banned completely and utterly destroyed from the Pew is up to the altar or over the years by subsequent state and federal investigations immense\nWe believe that there I've been talking with Liz ruin of the Washington Post and Tim corny of the Washington Examiner we will be back with Wesley Morris critic at large for New York times to talk about who's getting canceled listening pull up front and center\nJoin the conversation on our Facebook page or tweet us ...

I mean 'cause if you really ever challenged those people who bought the show was good and what you know we're glad it was on TV\nCouldn't really discouraged if we get you\nThe the gratitude for having the show in the first place\nRate these sort of a counterpoint to your critique it can't be\nYou can't say that because\nBeen so hard to get gay people on TV for so long that just took them seriously as normal people [noise]\nI don't think it's a very useful counter pointed maybe thing I Would say Liz\nOne of the things that I that I see flushed out and unless we say is basically how the moral isn't through which popular culture is discussed is now a moral as I'm coming from the young and coming from the left in a way that you know twenty five thirty years ago you would have had Dan Quayle complaining about you know single parent Murphy Brown on television\nSo as you know as a young left person what do you make of this you know this rise of moral isn't from people who share a lot of values with you having a lot of influence over the popular culture", "show_name": "Left, Right, & Center", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "20", "locations": [["New York", 40.71427,

I Can't tell you how how radicalizing it was for that group to watch this happened and it wasn't about the seat and that was something that I think the left mess is that what happened to Brett Kavanaugh that one guy\nAnd they had stopped caring about the seat at some point I Want to point out it's not just about Kavanaugh at the very fact that people got enraged about patriarchy it's about like ... it's about a whole class of people that they feel like shouldn't be attacked\nSo if it was just about Brett Kavanaugh and then I think people would be much more and ambivalent about whether he should be confirmed it was because he stood right this was the ins and I have to say\nI was a a a a SEC football game two weeks ago and my all my friends who aren't in politics it was crazy that the their wives were coming up to be talking about how bad they were among the husbands were whispering in my ear like was this really that big of a deal I I mean and these are not political people so I actually think it got outside of the extremely all yeah bubble can\nSo I mean I I have a different idea of what it looks like when someone's life gets destroyed because of a criminal defense attorney and what I say is that\nTypically people who have never encountered the system before when they encounter it are convinced that they are the victims of a conspiracy because they cannot conceive\nThat a person can be treated this way unless there was some vast conspiracy so I think what you're seeing as you would certainly make the argument he was treated unfairly you could make the argument he was treated badly but he's treated the way people get treated when they get accused of things in America every day all the time all over the\nPlace I Would like to be destroyed so badly that I was a federal judge [laughter] like a great like he had not even started to testify before the press releases started hitting my inbox saying and teach Brett Kavanaugh from his federal ... a ... and a judgeship so that can vary on line I'm Sorry that's\nLike ... like ... it was like nay Raul and progressive groups it wasn't like ran yesterday in the sense that like those people drive actions\nWouldn't narrowly powerful lobby on the left it's not like some random group of three people sitting in their basement sending out ... I Want to ask about one one more topic but I think may be shaping the run up to the November election which is\nMaybe part of why this whole to soften a little bit for Democrats was that they had a very good poll environment before all this happened or the news had been driven by all of these negative development surrounding the Russia investigation the conviction of Paul Manafort\nA Michael Cohen's guilty plea in the news of of Manafort's cooperation I think maybe solidifying a sense that there was criminality around the president can I I\nI Want to ask you it feels like a quiet time in the mail or investigation right now like nobody's nobody's gotten indicted this week and while I felt like I was going to happen every week it's a quiet time what does it tell you that it's been a little bit quieter\nIt doesn't tell us anything this was what normal looks like you might remember from like twenty Fifteen or so [laughter] it normally federal criminal investigations take a long time\nThe hardest thing often it's talk people look you're just gonna sit around and wait for two years to see if you get indicted\nSo low for a month as nothing we're in this environment where I'm Mueller's investigation is very fast three to four times faster than a\nInvestigation this complexity typically would be a but you know among the law and this type of thing when he's doing things behind the scenes with nothing doesn't signify anything\nOther thing about Brett Kavanaugh themselves Trump that's related to this is is less I think about the excitement among the base but more about the fact that we're talking less about Donald Trump and and\nWas in the news for a given week his poll numbers with ... a little bit because you know while we're a polarized country this is a small percentage of people that hate Donald Trump and also hate the Democrats and so when Donald Trump's on the TV all the time that I like I really dislike the sky\nBut when he's not when Brett Kavanaugh as on TV all the time they start to forget like we've all turned into Donald Trump a little bit we all remember even that now in cycles\nAnd so this habit until he's sixteen where the the Access Hollywood tape happened three weeks elves and and it was like Donald Trump's done and then he behaved for two and a half weeks for him right and and didn't make a ton of news and the Kobe thing happened and and that made a ... a real difference in the end of the twenty sixth in campaign and so\nThere there could be a change like that either in his favor or against in the next three weeks\nWell we'll see if he manages to uh to keep quiet for for that kind of period or Ken white I Want to thank you for joining us like you coming up I'll be back with Megan McCarthy honorary Cox Tim Miller inland Lopez to talk about who's in who's out for Donald Trump Kanye West is in Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell is out there listening to what frightened centralized\nWhat do you think share your thoughts on today's show on our Facebook page for tweet us at ...

Lopez who is senior finance correspondent for Business Insider as we tape on Thursday evening the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen Thirteen hundred points in two days and President Trump knows why\nWe have interest rates going up and then flipped that's much faster than certainly a lot of people including myself would have anticipated I think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nWith the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates although not all that quickly and not this week what has happened is [laughter] is long term interest rates have been going up a lot on the open market and that's bad for stocks and it makes it more expensive to get a mortgage but it also might be necessary if the fed is going to have to keep raising rates in order to stop inflation\nMaking is is from right about the fed have they been raising interest rates to much are they screwing up for things for him politically by pushing the stock market out in inflation\nIs not particularly high and you know like the fat likes to to run that anything they want to nip it in the ... I Want to get ahead of it they want to get ahead of of of inflation so like maybe they're a little too tight and it's\nSort of hard to judge trade 'em but\nTo go after them right because then the independence of the Federal Reserve having an independent central bank was a tremendous achievement\nAnd it took decades to build up the credibility that the president does not interfere with interest rates I mean like ... you know Nixon's Federal Reserve was like a little too close with Nixon and that was really bad for the country\nAnd so he should keep his hands off of the bad for the same reason that he shouldn't say many of the things that he says I'm because he is chipping away at really important civic institutions\nThat are important for our economy that are important for a civic society that are important for our democracy um do I expect him to like\nHave a change of heart and realize that challenging that independence was a bad idea no but you know in an ideal world where Donald Trump listen to someone\nI wouldn't do that so that the funny thing here is that the fed at least ... for an institution in Washington seems to basically ignore the president when he runs his mouth like threat so that part or or like arguably one could actually see the fed being like oh yeah you see this proves\nJust to prove that the president is not telling them what I heard that that's like some people's real concern oh well that's this is where this is where the tradition of the president doesn't comment on interest rates comes from it or not it doesn't go back to George Washington we didn't have as you go back back then it's not in the constitution\nIt was the Clinton Administration and the reason they did it was the George H W. Bush spent a lot of Nineteen Ninety two complaining that interest rates were too high\nAnd the fed was too worried about inflation or should be cutting rates\nAnd the perception was that the fed had actually become more reluctant to cut rates because they thought if they did it would look like they had done it because President Bush had told them to so Bill Clinton\nDidn't talk about interest rates not because he was super disciplined and carry out it would actually interfere with the fed doing what he wanted\nGet married [laughter]\nThat same kind of sense of alienation from the black community that sense of I don't want to advocate I don't want to have this responsibility of\nYou know correcting the people that I'm Around because I'm successful this is a burden that every minority who become successful in class and decide whether or not they take on and kind of has decided I'm not going to do it it's too hard I Am a coward\nAnd what do I know right now is called the actress who should be replacing Megan was Conyers for up and we haven't tried though maybe maybe he would agree I don't know he would probably he would probably rap much better than\nMe so used to build some citizen rhyme on us [laughter] okay what am I what am I [laughter]\nI don't know where to go what are we make of Taylor Swift choice to finally talk about ...

organizational changes on it which is Tesla what you've been doing a lot of really great reporting on\nAnd I feel like Tesla sort of embodies at the same time a lot of the best and the worst of

say how do you have time for this how no here say how do you have time to tweet and it calls and they'll wrap now\nThings when you're building cars is that good that does seem like a bad\nA phrase I specifically to cars\nYou\nKnow and the judge and Silicon Valley I think it's starting to try to figure out is this something that should be applied to every single industry is this something that we can use on everything and the answer might be no because you know I must might go bankrupt um but ...\nThe and the other thing I Want to get to is you know um is it okay to do what ever for a good cause is it okay to lie to regulators are lie to your shareholders as long as you're making cars that are supposed to save the world\nThere's they're making what ... what do you make of the the SEC is in this weird position 'cause they're supposed to protect shareholders and the the clear judgment of the market as the shareholders are better off if mom stays a CEO and so the the SEC is sort of

they have still not found that way right I mean the boards in that position as well you know I I think that the thing about manufacturing cars at scale is really hard\nRight it's a really difficult that's why there's not that many auto manufacturers because like there's only a few firms that have ever gotten really good at making huge numbers of cars so far Tesla is not one of those firms but
