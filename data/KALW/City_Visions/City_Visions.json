British Columbia campus this past November\nThe series was presented by the university by the Laurie institution and by the way you want\nHer address was titled youth and reconciliation for\nThe next one hundred years\nI was ... for that I had the pleasure of introducing a real ... from the stage in front of a full house which included indigenous elders students university officials and members of the [noise]\n\nI mean so Joe ... plenty dacey Gabrielle who's shame good evening everyone my name is\nGabrielle screen shot and I'm a proud member of the hatch it like for the nation from treaty tend territory in northern ...\n[noise] I'm very happy to be with you here and that's the name of a territory and it is my honor to be invited here to give a lecture on reconciliation and I'm candidate future\nNow an elder in the community once told me it was a cold winter afternoon in Ottawa\nHe told me that the strength of who we are as indigenous people comes from the fact that we speak from our hearts and that for thousands of years we've passed down our traditional knowledge history and culture through our stories\nSo I Would like to honor that out\nShare a little bit of my personal story with you\nKnow when they asked me\nTo give this talk I was told to give the perspective of what's in the hearts and minds of indigenous use across Canada in terms of reconciliation so I didn't want to just share my perspective on this stage tonight so I reached out to indigenous of friends of mine across Canada\nAnd I asked them about their thoughts on reconciliation on Canada's one fifty on the vision they had for where we were going as a country\nNow their answers were all very different but they were all incredibly aligned and now well my survey wasn't scientific um I Do\nThink that the answers were telling and for the most part they mentioned three themes the first being the relationship between indigenous and non indigenous people the second being a true understanding of our history\nThe past mistakes and recognizing where we've all come from and then the third was reflections on a path forward where we're going from here the role of language in our communities\nSo this evening I Would like to like I said honor The Elders wisdom and share with you just three stories three stories and three reflections on reconciliation from my own life\nBecause I realized that although he did was born on the hours before the because of who he was being a young for me since child that he would have to face some pretty daunting circumstances not unlike the ones that myself and my family in my community it had to face\nGoing up and I just couldn't fathom that that before ... and had the opportunity to make us\nA bunch of his life the statistics would argue was already made up for him as I'm holding even in the hospital I made him a silent promise I was just Seventeen years old and I promised isn't\nThat I Would live each day you each decision as an opportunity to make life better no matter how big or small I didn't know how that will look I didn't know what the work would be but I just knew that even though eastern didn't have a say in the world that he was about to grow up and\nI did have a say and that I owed him at least that much now after eastern was born\nI decided to apply to university I applied to the University of ... when I applied to one university got accepted to one university\nAnd those four years as they are for so many other people were the most transformative years of my life and my dream of traveling started to become a reality\nI was able to do a study abroad in Australia for shaking indigenous ceremonies in Peru um travel all around the world and through that I started to meet with different indigenous groups\nAnd I started to understand a little bit more clearly that there were common denominator is amongst indigenous people around the world\nAnd while I was at university I was able to understand a little bit more deeply the shared challenges that indigenous people had but also see and be inspired by the strength that we had in our communities around the world\nAs I started to expand my world view I also had a sense of wanting to understand who I Am a little bit more clearly not only as a first nations woman but as a Denny woman who grew up in a creek community and just understand that aspect of my identity\nAnd so that's really what I dedicated those four years too but that doesn't mean it was always easy in fact there were many people who made me realize just how much\nWork we had to do in one of the more vivid moments I realize that not everyone in the world view the indigenous community the way I did\nIn the summer between my first and second year of university\nUm I had an internship and I was in a new city and in this city it was um one evening I was that was about ten people and most of them I didn't know some of them I knew a little bit and we were all chatting and there was this young man who was about Twenty years old\nHe was saying how\nHis father was an RC and the officer his brother was an RC empty officer and his uncle was an RC and the officer and wouldn't you know he was in the process of becoming are applying to become an RC and the officer now\nWhat he said next are words that will stay with me for the rest of my life he said I Can't wait to become a police officer\nSo I can shoot some F ing Indians\nAnd in a room of about ten people about half of them knew that I'm first nations and no one said anything perhaps though most unjustly I didn't say anything\nI felt\nBurdened by it I did the mental calculation should I say something I felt a little bit of shame for the conversation involved and people moved on\nThat doesn't mean that the way to this moment left me in fact I reflected on it for days days turned into weeks and about a month later I was telling my oldest sister Jessica\nLike a mother figure and I remember telling her about what had happened and she's the calm cool collected one in my family and she got so angry at me like I had never seen before\nShe's on young Gabrielle like why didn't you say anything and when I couldn't come up with a good enough answer she says she real who cares about how you felt in that moment what\nDoes that guy does go and become an RC and the officer and the native he grows up to shoot is Ethan\nAnd for me I just remember the breast coming out of my lungs out of every way I had gone over that scenario I had never thought about it in that way [noise] [noise] right that's something I could have said and done could have changed in life\nAnd in that moment I realize that not only do the things that we say and do matter but also the things we don't say\nAlso the things we don't do have consequences\nAnd so slowly but surely while I was in university armed with the conviction of a responsibility to eastern armed or the responsibility of knowing that my actions and actions mattered I slowly started to stand a little bit taller I slowly started to speak a little bit louder\nThis wasn't a process that happened overnight it took me years but in the end I ended up finishing up my degree I became a first generation students\nAnd at the end of that journey I decided to take what at the time was the biggest leap of faith in my life and moved to the big city of Toronto that day that I moved to Toronto is a day I'll never forget\nIt was the first time in my life I had ever purchased a one way ticket\nAnd for those of you in the room who've done that you know how daunting that experience can be\n[noise] if I close my eyes I can still remember it was an Air Canada flight lending it Pearson I had a window seat and it was raining it was a September afternoon and I can still remember the plane kind of taxing towards terminal one\nLater on that evening on the day that I moved I remember seeing my reflection and all of the color had been drained from my face I was terrified I just moved to a city where I had no friends no family and no network\nAnd people ask me naturally why did I Do it\nWell\nI think the answer is twofold first I had an amazing professional opportunity to work with the royal bank of Canada\nThey hired me for a position that quite frankly I was unqualified for I Will admit it and I think they would too\nUm I was never rotational program and they were setting me up with some great mentors they were taking a really big risk on me and I wanted to meet them halfway I wanted to take a risk and moved to Toronto to the city I never even visited before\nAnd the other reason why I wanted to move to Toronto was to remember that promise that I had made to eat and all those years earlier\nAnd recognizing that I didn't feel like I was leaving my community so much as I Want it to be an ambassador for it\nThat in the greater Toronto area we had um you know a majority of candidates had offices and yet we're vastly underrepresented in terms of indigenous leadership\nYou know at the upper levels and I wanted to earn a seat at the table to have a say ensure the perspective and part of you know the indigenous communities in Canada\n[noise] I realized though on that journey on that leap to move to Toronto is that a lot of the support that I had along the way in terms of navigating through high school going to university and landing my job after school\nThat a lot of support systems that were there to support indigenous um students kind of dropped off actually once I got a job\nRight I had an education they had a good job in corporate Canada and I'd move to the city and there I was but for me I was in my early twenties I was just starting off\nRight I just finished university I just started my career in banking and I had every aspiration to be the c._e._o. of our BC one day like my potential I felt like my ambition was limitless but I had no idea how to navigate that space you see as much as my family would have loved to have helped me and believe me they tried\nMy father never had a manager you never really had to put together a resume or\nYou know kind of knew what who to cc on an email so there are plenty of things like this that I realized very quickly that I didn't have an understanding of how to navigate that space it at the same time I've been on this amazing cultural learning journey\nUnderstanding more who I Am as a young woman while I was in university and I didn't want to drown in a city of strangers I wanted to continue on that journey of learning about myself as an indigenous woman\nAnd I wanted a place that I could do both\nAnd so that was a light bulb moment of the idea that eventually grew to become the aboriginal professional association of Canada I started to reach out to indigenous professionals across Canada once I had this idea and start to ask them if they'd sell something similar and many had\nAnd so I reached out and\nThrough an organization called civic action and diversity in particular in Toronto I was able to get the support to launch the organization had my first onto your team I'm a man named Richard will shirt went on to become my cofounder and he's still a good mentor and friend of mine to this day\nThe ...\nThe middle as being the theater on the Vancouver ... university campus was vulgar and but it was an opportunity for audience members to ask questions when the presentation was over ... question shortly but first the conclusion of a real scruples [noise]\nSo where do we go from here\nI Want to share with you another quote the indigenous you shared when I asked him about reconciliation they said it's more than a respectful relationship it's an indigenous power shifts towards full self determination\nNo anniversary is like the one candidate just celebrated our moment to celebrate yes where we've come from their moments to reflect on the past that got us to where we are today but I think there are also an opportunity for us to discuss where exactly do we want to go from here\nWe're at a unique point in time we're at a moment in time for us to get it\nRight for me personally\nThat means one of the hardest things that I can think of in my life which is to mend the relationship with my mother on our land speaking our language that's not an overnight thing\nThat's my life\nThe thought of walking down that path scares every ounce of my being I'm scared part of me the shamed I have no idea how it will turn out\nFor Canada\nI think it means understanding that the work of the truth and reconciliation commission\nWas not the end but instead the start of our journey when we think of progress we need to start thinking of lifetimes instead of decades\nWhen we think in decades we think of the short term we aim to get the gold star and we want to rush the work we think in terms of short term gains and short term prosperity\nInstead I think we should focus on the long term and the lifetimes on the shared prosperity and our shared responsibility reconciliation is the longest marathon we've ever entered into as a country\nAnd if we want to do it we need to do it right\nWhen I asked the use through my survey their thoughts on Canada's one fifty and where we're going to go from here and here are some of the thoughts that they shared with me\nThey said strong indigenous self governments with strong positive relationships with federal and provincial government\nEmpowered first nations communities reinforcing cultural pride an identity on their own terms revitalization of indigenous languages and ways of being in mainstream when I asked\nIndigenous use if they thought reconciliation what's possible on a scale of\nOne to five one being impossible five being possible the average was for\nWhich to me and says cautiously optimistic\nWhich I think is where I land reconciliation is more than an apology reconciliation is more than any one policy it's a critical look at the systems of power economic social political and the relationship between indigenous and non indigenous people in this country\nIt means not only\nSupporting indigenous people but also having the courage to make the sacrifices need it\nFor me I'm going to graduate\nFrom school and just six months now and that milestone hits all have an MBA\nNow there has been a lot of people in my life that have supported me to get to this moment and I want to make them proud\nWhen I feel scared when I feel shame I remember that I stand here and then the result of thousands of years of strength and culture\nAnd that I owe it to my ancestors to do the work that they in many ways we're not allowed to do\nI pursued these two degrees because I Want to help support indigenous economic development I have a vision for communities one where we have full economic independence that I Believe will help to lead us on this road to self determination\nAs my next step on looking at a potentially starting an indigenous venture capital fund that will be indigenous zones be funded by indigenous uh money and then support indigenous businesses\nWhich from what I've gathered might be a world's first it's uncertain work it's hard work\nAnd of course I have no idea if it'll work out\nBut that doesn't mean I shouldn't try\nEarlier I mentioned the year two thousand and twenty six to nine years from now that's the year the four hundred thousand indigenous use will enter the workforce in Canada\nNow that here is also important to me for another reason because that's the year that Ethan we'll have his twentieth birthday and will be about to start his adult life\nIn so many ways that promise I made to Easton and the thought of him being an adult I realize that that's just the beginning of the journey but in some ways that for me is also an endgame I never want him to face the same challenges I had to face growing up\nI Want him to feel loved to believes he can be anything he wants to be do anything he wants to do and be proud of who he is as a young to any person my vision for\nReasons lifetime I Believe is well within our reach but it's up to unite to have the tough conversations and the courage to ask questions about why this is the candidate we live\nIn and how can we do better\nTonight I shared with you three stories\nA story of truth seeking a story of action and a story of lifelong reconciliation I did this and parts that you can see that reconciliation is not linear\nReconciliation is not a destination we reach nor does it come neatly wrapped in a bow reconciliation is hard work\nWe need to press on\nWe need to resist the assumptions that got us far that led us to this moment and move forward in the face of all this uncertainty where to special moment in time where the convergence of many important things from political the social economic to legal and we have to turn around to see\nOur past for what it is to decide on what our shared future will look\nLike with indigenous people on equal footing and we have the opportunity I Believe to get it right now\nAll storytelling I think that there's a bias towards the happy ending\nI was tempted and preparing these remarks to tied up in a way that would make everyone feel good like we had closed the chapter and we had a clear path forward but that's not the way this works [noise]\nMore you realize you have to learn I Want us to be a little bit uncomfortable I Want us to be a little bit uncertain of where we go from here\nWell I Do recommend that everyone read the truth and reconciliation commissions final report unfortunately there is no checklist I can give you of three things to do to be reconciled\nBut if my story is any indication I think reconciliation as a lifelong process and like most things worth while it will take time for us on this journey to get it right I started with an elder story and I want to end with an older story\nAn elder I worked with a lot in Toronto who worked with us at the professional association\nYou once told me a story of how on a sunny winter afternoon he was walking with his little son who was four years old and he was teaching him about traditional medicine and I was ever walking it's very cold and snowy outside as it were trudging through that deep snow\nHis little sun slowly started to fall behind him and as they were walking his son said dad it's a lot easier for me to step where you've stepped see each day every one of us has carving a path and an elder also told\nMe he said Gabrielle make sure when you walk that you walk in a good way for me that means keeping a sense of justice at the core of all the work that I Do it means choosing action over inertia\nAnd having courage in the face of discomfort to keep on walking\nI don't know where we go from here I Know we're at a special moment in time and I know that reconciliation will only work in Canada if every Canadian can turn our hearts in our minds toward this work\nAnd so I review tonight with just two questions and two questions only as you reflect on your journey and Kansas journey of reconciliation which are what are the footprints", "show_name": "City Visions", "year":

we'll talk about who votes who doesn't and why\nAcross the country they're increasing reports a systematic attempt to restrict who votes to purchase a voter rolls stricter id requirements and cutbacks in early voting which the\nDepression is not typically considered a concern our guest tonight point out to other barriers to voting that will be discussing for those whose languages first language is not English or for example those who are disabled or among younger voters a general sense of disenfranchisement\nSo how can voters' rights advocates reverse these trends that we're seeing across the country well we have three guests tonight to discuss these questions are here in the studio I'd like to welcome Lisa Garcia but do ya she's director of the Institute of governmental studies and chancellor is professor in the graduate school of education at UC Berkeley\nWritten numerous articles and several books on the topic of voter engagement including Latino politics mobilizing inclusion transforming the electorate through get out the vote campaigns and fluid borders Latino power identity and politics in Los Angeles well can we say thank you for having me\nAnd are joining us from the studios of Capital Public radio in Sacramento we have to guess first is Mindy Romero founder and director of the California civic engagement project which is now part of the University of Southern California so price school of public policy in Sacramento welcome Andy good evening\nAnd finally we're joined by ... the voting rights project manager and attorney at the ACLU of northern California roll was appointed by California secretary of state Alex ... to the states language accessibility advisory committee and the state's voters Choice Act\nTaskforce welcome rose\nHi good evening and of course we invite you our listeners to join our conversation about twenty minutes I'll give you that phone number now you can do to free at eight six six seven nine eight talk that's eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five\nWhere you can email us at city vision that KLW to work or tweet us at ... a city visions K. A. L. W.\n[noise] so I wanted to ask this question to each of you in turn a I'll start with you here Lisa him in the studio um how would you rate\nUh the the state of um ability to vote in our country at this at the state or of time and and politics and what we're going to unravel tonight in terms of factors that seem to be getting in the way of people voting how would you\nDescribe how easy it is for people to vote how does it vary\nBy person by part of the country just each of you in turn just to get a sense of where you're we're starting from\nWell just because they I think it's important to know that the United states is among the lowest in advance industrialized countries in terms of voting rights and I think there are many reasons for that but we have to put\nThe current situation within that broader context we have always made it very difficult to vote comparatively speaking other countries had election day as a holiday they have elections like over multiple days\nThey have other ways to facilitate the process we've always had a very high bar we require registration pretty far ahead of the election we here in California because of the initiative process had ballots that are books I'm filled with language that most humans don't normally understand\nAnd we don't provide a tremendous amount of assistance or an integrative work to help people who might you know maybe have lower levels of education or who aren't necessarily paying attention to politics\nThe facility to to enter the system so it's not by accident that are voting rights are so low and they're especially low for people of color and people who are low income people who move off and people who had multiple jobs you know the people who are really in precarious economic situations and so\nI I Would say we're um and scale of one to ten probably for in terms of access and are the the work that we do where the facility with which we help people and to the political system\nAnd what what score would you give California specifically\nI think California is doing a little better than we are nationally um we've had a lot of it\nThe talent and California is just that we are so big the scale is so big and we have so many um ... immigrant origin voters naturalized voters people whose first language is not English we have\nMany low propensity voters and so California has an extra need to make an effort to ensure that in fact the voice of the entire electorate and not just certain sectors the electorate actually gets heard at the ballot box every election day\n[noise] All right I'm Indian ... a year go next what's your sense of the the uh the state of of voting in our country and I have a California compare\n[noise] well I Would absolutely agree with um the summary that Lisa just gave 'em we're not doing very well and when you compare us against others hapless democracies um [noise]\nWe are are certainly not the the beacon a of a democracy that many people think that we are at least in terms of voting um\nYou know what what mostly what Lisa described as a are what we call the institutional barriers around voting we don't make it very easy for people to vote and what California's been trying to do over the last number of years\nIs making voting and ... men and registration more accessible I tried to break down those barriers um the thing that I'll add to that is\nThere's this other component so I I think of voting as a kind of two main buckets of parts to this or we think about the problem we're trying to explain and address the low turnout one is we need to make it easier for people to vote that's the institutional side of things and we also need to make people want to vote\nAnd those are both related very much so but the one to vote and\nWill fall then there is people feeling like their vote matters are people feeling motivated to participate that if they take their time and the energy to actually physically going voter fill out that ballot mail it in to do the research to be deterred responsibly right to be informed\nUm that they think it actually makes a difference and makes a difference not just in terms of the election the outcome like who wins that makes a difference for themselves and their families are communities and\nA lot of Americans and a lot of Californians have a a really difficult time seeing how voting is connected really matters is connected to what they care about and to their life and to their life chances and um we don't do a very good job to health reasons for that and how we talk more about that over the next hour\nBut we don't do a very good job of encouraging people to vote aside from the institutional barriers so we have a\nWell we don't have an expectation of voting is completely socially acceptable to not vote 'em in our society particularly for young people [noise]\nUm and and then you have this other component is huge component people again not feeling themselves right motivated and why it matters in a lot of that gets labeled as apathy and I think comedy when we think of apathy we think people just don't care they don't give a darn what's wrong with those young people today why aren't they participating [noise]\nYou know why is there the sleeping giant why aren't Latino voting more all that kind of all those labels that we put to people\nAnd really sure there's always apathy in in that sense of not caring but uh I I Would argue that almost everything we see is what might be labeled is apathy is you know this real reasons five people are not participating why they think their vote doesn't matter and their family disconnected and that's an area that we need to do more to address\nGraham definitely want to talk about the intersection between obvious you know barriers and the and the um the sense of lack of engagement I'm a a lack of a sense of um\n[noise] uh ability to to have a an act changed through the vote so a room with the U.S with the ACLU or I Want to go to institutional barriers a little bit more in your comments around how we're doing um as a ...\nTo help with the issues of of a concern of uh on equal access to voting um uh for some of our population here in the state uh tell us your take about um the institutional barriers to voting\nWell\nI'm In terms of thinking about how the country rates right now I think we're out of\nIt seems that we keep reaching new um new low points we've had in twelve years ago the country or our Congress renewed the federal voting rights act nearly unanimously um but since that time there have been said he attacks around the country on voting rights\nI'm I think we're seeing\nA well we're reading about it more and more in states all around the country in particular since um since two thousand Thirteen when the\nWhen the Supreme Court struck down I'm searching for the of the voting rights act that's allowed states that used to be under um it's called what's known as pre clearance so when they made changes they there was a a a burden on states to to show that their changes wouldn't um\nWouldn't uh will were not discriminatory against racial minorities um since um since Trump or restrict down we've seen an increase in states that previously would covered by pre clearance and in passing\nBarriers here institutional a in a barrier a sense of lack of a engagement or a sense of lack\nOf ability to influence politics if you kinda have to give us a abroad overview um obviously the Latino population is quite diverse in of itself\nI mean I think it's important to to know that there are multiple Latino electorate depending upon what state and and and what area you're talking about but I think\nNever last week essentially saying that if there is not as big of a blue wave is people want to because the Latino voters are still asleep I'm I an image that I personally I agree with Monday's offensive [noise]\nAnd so I think we really have to remember this was a structural problems so not only do you have a low voting rights overall in the United states you have\nSystematic large disparities in boating across different communities and we generally put the onus of that difference on that can be themselves and say they're pathological they're apathetic they they they just don't care rather than thinking well what are the structural so it is these institutional barriers but it's also the fact\nThat we simply don't talk to them so if you add together so most campaigns use these up ... scores in order to decide who to talk to during an election because they they have limited money they can't speak to every voter and they usually only talked to people who score above Seventy essentially if you're above Seventy it means you're likely to turn out I'm not going to waste my time\nIf I talk to you and if they get a bunch of extra money maybe we'll go under but usually those are the folks\nIf you add together those folks\nPlus the people for the midterm election at least plus the people who are unregistered among Latinos is basically eighty percent of the citizen voting age population among Latinos so exactly the point that then\nThey're not getting campaign information they're not having an even knock on their door\nThey're not having to anybody call on the phone and so if they are interested in the election they have to go out on their own and find their own information and do the the legwork themselves and so it's not only that you're making it hard so that's a barrier you you're sort of creating a higher bar to actually engage so that you can gather the information\nTo do exactly on the menu was talking about in my work with Latino voters because they care so much of a voting they don't want to make a mistake and so they need to get good information and that's really difficult and the current information environment\nBut secondarily it also means that they're getting the message that they don't matter right so that means candidates aren't talking about policies that they care about so there's a whole ecosystem which makes it very clear that this is not a space where I should spend my time and we're actually going to take care of the things that I care about and so we have to appreciate that\nYou know even in this current mid term Jim kind of party has not spent the money that it should spend towards ... so if I didn't let the numbers don't turn out it's actually because\nThe investments were not made it's not because they are somehow pathological detached disengaged in fact if you talk to them is what I found in my work if you knock on their doors if you have a conversation with them about the things they care about they will turn out to vote the problem is no one's knocking\nAnd why is that right I mean if you're if Democrats are looking for a strategy to to turn things around a next week or two and twenty twenty of this keeps coming up and yet if not changing\nBlame when I called the political industrial complex which is basically a consultancy class so that people who run campaigns are generally speaking folks who are\nIf I can be Frank there are sort of their their privilege white men by and large\nAnd they have a strategy that they've been using for the last Thirty years which is essentially to reach out to white likely voters and they try to flip the three percent of swing voters that they can flip to persuade to vote for their candidate and that's what they say is a winning strategy and if you think about all the post mornings I came out after twenty sixteen and all the discussion of white working class voters\nUm ... among the Democrats there were three post modems of about thirty five that were done that actually talked about voters of color and what happened was that it was a color so you have this whole ecosystem of how we run campaigns that just doesn't see\nReaching out to voters of color is a winning strategy and those are the people who decide how many spent and those are the people who decide and the other not to sound conspiratorial issue is that if they buy ads they get a percentage back and so\nYou know focusing on television focusing on advertising actually makes them a whole heck of a lot of money putting canvassers into the field and having them talk to voters face to face doesn't and so there are a lot of incentives to keep campaigns running the way they\nIn case you're just joining us this is city visions our local public radio Ninety One point seven KLW San Francisco\nAnd on the Web and KLW dot org I'm just a ... inch night we're talking about barriers to voting a amongst of voters in general but especially a communities of color or here in California and across our country or just one week\nOn a day away from the maternal election\nUh we have three guests Mindy Romero founder and director of the California a civic engagement project and ... voting rights project manager attorney the ACLU northern California joining us by phone and here in the studio Lisa Garcia ... director of the Institute of governmental studies and chancellor is professor in the graduate school education at UC Berkeley\nOf open our foremost you our listeners now to join our conversation\nUh eight six six seven eight talk that's eight six six seven eight eight to five five you can email us at city vision that KLW toward\nPost a comment to kill the website or tweet us at city visions K. A. L. W. Mindy did you want to say something there\n[noise] oh I I was just going to add something I absolutely agree with everything that Lisa laid out there [noise] um they're very related component to this is so you've got you do have this industrial complex you have campaigns and candidates and their consultants using the likely voter model and Latino and and by the way young people to type back into our conversation about young people\nAh don't aren't procedures letters and numbers right I'm historically don't match that and that's a big reason why young people are participating in a lot because they're also not getting that outreach and mobilization when I wanted to add\nThat beyond does that strategy around campaigns you know when we're often when we're seeing news stories were looking at the overall aggregate numbers your turnout numbers right at the state level and we're comparing it over time and were saying you know these are not you know these are not good numbers or their disappointing numbers are there okay numbers um\nAnd when we do see mobilization outreach that is targeted which doesn't happen very often but when it is targeted\nWe have to remember that it is about what's best for the candidate or the campaign and so even in this election right now where there is some aggressive mobilization of people of color and young people it's only where we typically at least\nWhere those candidates have deemed those groups could possibly strategically right be worthy of their investment and be a good return on their investment\nAnd suicide from the political right the strategic campaigns kind of almost everywhere else\nWe're not seeing 'em a whole lot of engagement of young people or people of color and often and in the community at large right if it's a safe district and we have to just remember that those that are primarily responsible for that at ... campaigns and candidates those are the ones that have the you know do the bulk of the outrage and ...\nAre are just being very very strategic in in\nWho their average into and often very safe seats are doing very little mobilization\nAnd how could we then expect right realistically when we talk about those news stories that say you know will the Latino vote or will use though to ... you know whatever group we're talking about will it be higher this year\nYou have to realize in a vast number of races were not even seeing necessarily any additional outreach or any additional funding that's coming in to do\nThat to mobilize those groups ... really unfair and unrealistic expectation and it does set up for the day after election day those narratives around failure\nRight ... thanks I'm quoting something that ah that you said earlier roe [laughter] you know like be so you can't be everywhere a Kennedy can't be everywhere but but but it seems at the same time perhaps short sighted to only go where you where you\nThink you're going to be able to to benefit from is that is that what you're saying like\nWell I'm not necessarily even blaming the candidate says the campaigns themselves because they they have a ... or obviously strategic purpose\n'em but it's just a recognition if we're talking about expectations and we're talking about that narrative of failure and we have to understand kind of their realistically how you know what that landscape looks like and understand that and many of these districts or is there is really very little outreach mobilization period going on\nWhere it is happening it's happening very strategically um it is based on often old models or misunderstandings right misperceptions or even by us\nUm and it just has these very real consequences and we may on the surface right or talk about or in our in the media to talk about well you know all these factors should mean that we'd see you know all this turn out right for Latinos for instance right\nBut it comes down to you know local districts and local contacts often and the set of or ... of ... and that is happening or is it happening um and we have to understand that\nYou can be very motivated to they could be a lot of factors that logically would see would should get out of you hope would get out of a group or an individual to vote but everybody needs mobilization everybody needs that outreach so you you have the factors that are in play but then they have to in a sense be activated right you have to be grabbing pulled into the electorate right now we leave\nWe lead groups particularly circling underrepresented groups um on their own to if they get if they see factors that matter for them we essentially from in many many instances are leaving them on their own to then say\nOkay I'm going to vote and act on it and they're not getting the outreach and mobilization that's so critical in our system to turn them into voters and again thinking about expectations and then we wonder\nWhy we don't see that the turnout and we blame we bring groups themselves for why they're not turning out when they didn't get that activation but other you know those that do fit the likely voter model did get that touching that outrage so Lisa and that makes sense\nAh people who ... who languages first language not English or who are uh who are voting perhaps is the first time when they turn Eighteen how much of a big size not getting it right meaning worried that they're not going to\nVote correctly in a sense it's a mess up the ballot or that they somehow think like wow this is just way too complicated\nTire out I I think that's the reality it's a very intimidating process many people don't know that they can vote for the top of the ticket or not and not vote at the bottom of the ticket or they or if he can I skip the judges right the judges are always the ones you can never get information on\nI actually had a voter provisional ballot because my point pace changed because I wasn't paying attention this last election and as someone that works in this area it's still felt very kind of dicey like is is actually going to count\nAnd so appreciating the lack of basic information was a machine look like how do I fill out the form can I take my sample ballot in to remind myself what I've decided I'm going to vote on can I bring my child with me because actually you can in the state of California many people don't know that\nSo I think just appreciating it feels very official is feels very important it feels like you could very easily make a mistake and that that is really intimidating for many people and that if we got rid of that sense of intimidation we actually would probably have many more people participate in the\nProcess Mindy [noise] I agree um we probably should say that uh you're a provisional ballot will in all likelihood get counted [laughter] and so people can trust in the system um [noise]\nBut that intimidation factor doesn't really matter and I think it will add to that as you know often when when\nWe're on we're we're Research Center but we do a lot of outrage and the sense that we we talk about um our research in the research in the field and his route and about doing that\nWe do get a lot of questions from people that just don't that say I I don't get it I don't understand why voter turnout is low I don't understand why I'm young people\nOr other groups right are participating in lower rates why it's so hard it's really you know if if it taking\nAlong the lines of blaming the victim but but a little bit more to that right saying it\nWe don't really need to do anything else because it's already pretty simple what's so hard\nUm and it is if you're unfamiliar with the process so most of the people that are saying it doesn't seem so hard what's the big deal or people that are probably die hard voters vote every time and even then at least they just said you can still have those moments where you are uncertain\nBut if you've not voted very regularly or you've never voted before she very first time it can be incredibly intimidating and it can be a barrier for why people don't participate um it why they if they don't feel they have enough information that they don't know about the judges is always the judges\nThat didn't maybe then they don't sell out that built by mail ballot because they literally think they have to submit everything and they're trying to actually be responsible and that process so I think remembering that and remembering when we hear that criticism sometimes that's why people aren't voting it's very easy if you're very comfortable with it to not get why it's not so\nRight not such a no brainer for many many other people and and we don't we do we make it harder right for people also to get that information if they're unfamiliar with it at the last few years have been a number of\nAvenues now that you can you you can go to voters actually went voters have lots of different places you can get information on candidates judges are still hard um you can go to secretary states off as a what the website and identify whether your vote by mail ballot with actually counted um yes you do have to sign your ballot on below\nSignature doesn't need to match um the signature that's on file um so but there is information available to again many voters don't know where to go and that that information is is available so that's also very\n... thanks for answering the questions of the of the listener there yes go ahead rule\nWill just um\nIt's always call at eight six six hour boat in election protection hotline that can answer some of these questions I think some of these they can also district to their county elections official I'm somebody some specific to their to their situation\nI'm an eight six six hour vote as a election protection hotline that I'm a ... you can call okay and what languages on if they have ...\nYou know I think they have what they have a number of language a bill introduced staff but I Believe there's also they use 'em\nUp you know a translation hotline if people are calling and language that they don't have um someone who's accent language\nOne ensuring that yeah one group we we haven't talked about that if we think about this issue of of trying to engage and remove institutional barriers among communities of color is\nA communities of color are are convicted felons or you know we've we've been talking a and you know at various points are about the representation and and the prison population of people are who are convicted of felonies is there any work\nBeing done in organizations that you represent or\nOr that you know of that really is looking at that issue because that\nCould be definitely seen as a a pretty large institutional barrier\nAnyone can speak a little too there's a show you here in California we ever done this for decades um there's\nWe have a website that people can go do for information um is it an area that there's a lot of confusion about who's eligible to vote I think people hear news from other states and they get confused about who is actually eligible to vote [noise]\nUm but in general unless you're serving as a federal or state prison sentence or unless you're on parole for the conviction but ... you're eligible to vote in California we have a Web site let me vote C. A. dot org that people can visit for more information where\nThey can also call there do they election protection hotline or the ... elections official I'm here in California we've we've passed a law um a couple of years ago to make it even more clear that it's only people who are on serving serving Pearl for much of a felony or in state or federal prison\nWho can't pump to if you're in county jail in general you can vote if you're on probation you can vote if you can conduct of a misdemeanor or you can vote\nIf you're awaiting trial you can vote 'em and unfortunately I'm\nWell there are a lot of people who are still aren't ineligible because of um either because they're on parole are in are in prison but what what happens you know too frequently I think is that people um\nUnfortunately um believe that there are ... about 'em because they had a conviction at some time in in their life and um I think that they\nThey can never registered to vote again and um that's not right and I appreciate you asking that question\nAnd just any work and trying to reverse of the restrictions on those serving time or whether in their shoes me in custody or on parole or is that just kind of like a nonstarter\nWell\nYes there during stations were working on this isn't I'm a great organization called initiate justice that tried to qualify a ballot measure um for for November they they came up short but I Know they're going to continue to work on this we in California to go any further we would need at a constitute a constitutional amendment I'm unless\nOur governor took some action sort of you know laterally is what they did in New York where I'm Governor Cuomo issued essentially what er I'm partial pardons to people on parole to restore their voting rights and so that's another avenue that we could take in California at least that you wanted to say something there\nJust wanted to lift that unless you're only mentioned in terms of the misinformation and we did a study and back and Twain Fifteen looking at the reasons people give for not registering to vote and and uh\nEighteen citizens and so I think it's not only people who who have a conviction but I think sometimes people who've had any interaction with the criminal justice system believe that that has made them ineligible and so that misinformation disenfranchise as many people beyond just the actual uh incarcerated or or formerly incarcerated population\nSo lots lots there to to turn around a in terms of people's perceptions of their of their right to vote 'em [noise]\nSo um India there was something of that Lisa said earlier about the um would call them ... ballots is that right or is that is that a strategy or being thought about a in schools or to try to get even maybe kids who can't vote or\nA art of voting age and maybe a couple of years beforehand to kind of just getting the practice of the habit of doing it\nYou know when it's too early to start on voter education\nOh it's never too early to start [noise] ah actually I I Am looted to really briefly that there have been some changes in California recently there's momentum um happening around civics education\nUh through a group called the power of democracy which was a started earned supported by the chief justice of the California Supreme Court and I believe with support from the state superintendent\nOf schools and they are actually uh through a task force that they created um produced a report called K. through twelve set of learning really encouraging trying to make the case for\nStarting in kindergarten or in some form a talking about and integrating the importance of civics um through through lesson plans of the curriculum\nUm it shouldn't be certainly but it is right now which is your you know one semester and your senior year your government class in California and it shouldn't just be um high school so one big tool which we mentioned earlier\nThat schools now having those that work with young people have it's the pre registration so as folks come into schools right organizations they give them a boat or other great groups\nAnd I want to talk to kids about voting on a register kids are talking about the importance of registering they can actually pre register sixteen and Seventeen year old so that's pretty exciting but it shouldn't be just then when the ... part of the establishing that norm around

I O W San Francisco\nMm\nGood evening and welcome to city officials on your host grace one tonight is the first of our election coverage theories we explore the opposite pros and cons of San Francisco's proposition C\nA measure that would raise taxes on large businesses in order to find housing and mental health services for the city's most vulnerable residents San Franciscans are no strangers to the debate on the city's housing and homelessness crisis with rising rents and at least Seventy five hundred people on the streets\nYeah on San Francisco's mind proponents of proposition C argue the biggest big business has added to San Francisco's housing shortage and rising inequality\nTherefore it should contribute to the solution [noise] opponents of the measure worry that companies already paid the lion's share of city taxes and may leave San Francisco in response to an additional tax therefore taking jobs in revenue with them [noise]\nSo tonight we ask is proposition see the answer to San Francisco's housing in homelessness problem or will this measure Dr companies and jobs out of San Francisco as opponents fear fear\nJoining me in the studio to discuss these issues are Jennifer freedom Bach executive director of the ... coalition on homelessness an organization helping to develop the leadership skills of homeless San Franciscans so they may fight for permanent solutions and human rights\nThe coalition on homeless homelessness is a sponsor proposition C welcome Jennifer for having me on the phone we have ... the former senior advisor and communications director for recent San Francisco Mirren supervisor mark feral he served of the ... campaign spokesperson\nJustice delete all homeless policy and initiatives for supervisor feral and is currently vice president arrest city strategies will just\nJust are you there\nSort of you know and no problem also joining us by phone from the beginning of this hour is Heather night of San Francisco chronicle columnist who covers homelessness and the politics of the city welcome Heather\nHi thanks for having me great and we invite you our listeners to join our conversation by dialing one eight six six seven nine eight talk that's eight six six seven eight eight to five five [noise]\nUm I started out talking to talking about this issue with you Heather keep set the stage for us about um homelessness in the city in particularly what currently is the city of San Francisco doing to attack the homeless problem and how much is the city spending\nSo as you said there's about seven thousand five hundred homeless people on any given night that's an estimate from the um the last one night\nHomeless count which was then a over a year and a half ago about half of them are on the streets and about half of them are in shelters hospitals and other facilities that number hasn't changed that much over the past several years that it's become much more visible as development has driven homeless people out of their former\nHideaway like the old chance they terminal and other places where they weren't so in your face and now I think residents are seeing this\nUm issue much more than they used to and so they feel like it's gotten\nA lot worse the city spends about three hundred million dollars a year on this problem and it um created at thrift department of homelessness and supportive housing about a year and a half ago to really focus on this issue\nUm we have navigation centers which are um homeless shelters that provide more case management and more relaxed rules and try to help people find a solution beyond homelessness\nUm there's the ... team which is an outreach team that goes out on the sidewalks every day trying to help homeless people um there are other um programs that the city has that people feel like it's just not getting any better and so they wonder where their money is going but um people say that we just aren't spending enough money and that's why the problems seem so bad\nWeather you did a recent column about how what it really costs to help the homeless um that came out in the chronicle on August twenty fourth break down for us how that three hundred million dollars is being spent\nYeah so there's a perception that if you just divide three hundred million by the number of homeless people like we said it's about Seventy five hundred that the city must be spending more than forty thousand or a homeless person per year\nWhich is is not true because a lot of that three hundred million is not spent on people who live on the streets it spent um [noise] a major chunk of it that is a two thirds of spent on supportive housing so that's formerly homeless people keeping them\nNow at another chunk is spent on ethics in prevention trying to keep people from becoming homeless\nSome of that is spent on administration capital funding so when you look at the amount that goes to people living on the streets currently it's about uh sixty million a year\nI'm which I'm it's just not a whole lot plus when you look at the fact that the Seventy five hundred number comes from that one night count and the director of the department of homelessness says his um staff actually serves\nTwentieth are Fifteen to twenty thousand homeless people every year so it's a lot more people in a lot less money than people think\nAnd the kind of services that we're providing now as a city you mentioned navigation centers and supportive housing what about um the mental health issues that homelessness um homeless people often face\nYeah I think that is really where the city of falling down on the job I'm anybody who walks around downtown seeds people in huge mental distress who clearly are not um in their right mind and who are not getting help and the city pretty much so that the pen sometimes they're taken as a general but under state law they're almost always released within Seventy two hours\nOff and back to the street because we don't have enough treatment beds for them to get real helped and there's an effort in Sacramento the governor just signed legislation that will make it um it easier to consider people but San Francisco still has to um opt into that and figure out how it would do that so that's a ways off\nAnd this that perhaps the with the about Seventy five million a year or two more mental health care\nAnd do you live in is proxy something that all the supervisors are supporting right now\nI Know that\nProgressive ones are there some moderate supervisors who are opposed and they are Lyndon breed um last I checked pet not weighed in on at one way or the other\nAnd what do you think London Breed hasn't made a statement about prop see she she campaigned heavily on homelessness\nYeah she was waiting for the ... report from the city's economist which just came out a couple of days ago so I imagine we'll hear from her and I'm I suspect she's analyzing the results of that report which essentially said it would cost the city\nSomewhere in the area of seven to eight hundred jobs per year a lot of those with the retail jobs so that is something to be concerned about but it also said that it would um help the homeless and the situation on the streets and we would see a difference in terms of mental health and homeless\n[noise] well this is a proposition that your own paper does not support um what do you think about that\nThe newsroom and the editorial board have a wall between them I don't have anything to do with their decision\nRight um well let's get into the proposition itself we have one of its proponents here with us Jennifer ... Jennifer can you tell us what proposition C actually does\nYeah happy to um just to\n[noise] I'm\nOne thing about what how they were saying I'm which I'm sure we have seven of the board of supervisors members who are supporting it one who's opposing it and then the remaining have not taken a stand\nUm but uh so yeah so proposition see it's really\nReally really exciting I'm I'm really thrilled to be here to talk about it um basically how it works is that it you know it's just very common sense approach because it's funded by a very tiny tax on the city's largest corporations um it's an average of a half a percent\nUm and it's only on receipts over fifty million so if I'm a company has fifty four million coming in only the four million um would would be applied [noise]\nAnd um you know this the way we profited really carefully over the past year I'm In this inclusive process that included people with lived experience business owners um elected people on the front lines you know the folks who see what works and doesn't work I'm On a daily bases\nSize where all the dollars have to go half of the funding has to go to housing and we think it's going to um find based on that um homeless departments um strategic framework about four thousand units of housing housing about six thousand folks\nUm including families with kids I'm twenty five percent and mental health and substance abuse treatment um we can do a lot with that and a lot of amazing stuff that's not is hampered with Medicare funding in all these different regulations around\nUm around the funding streams and bought a thousand shelter beds would be able to get rid of our\nUm for the most part are weightless for shelter in San Francisco I'm and provide a bathrooms and hygiene centers and you know our vision is to have a system where\nWe and a big piece of it is prevention I'm keeping people in their homes because of course the majority over Seventy percent of our homeless population became homeless his house San Franciscans and there's all these different situations that had they had people had the resources they never would have become homeless oh an elder who's\nOn income is fixed in Iran slowly signing up above their fixed income or a catastrophic health issue or\nUm you know folks who need long term help her short term help 'em so we would be able to really um barricade that pathway into homelessness with this measure as well\nAnd how much do you predict how are you hoping that it will raise so according\nSo we're we're talking about is taking a little tiny fraction of that tax give away\nAnd then capturing it and then re allocating it to turn around of crises that was caused by that very same federal government that very same federal government that is not going to save us in his crises they're not going to pull this out of this there that cause of this\nCorporations and you know and that's another piece that came out of the you know the econ report is that you know these companies are they're they're no companies are saying that they're going to be paying more than they did a few months ago they are going to be paying for far less [noise] um before we\nGo on with that that's a city visions on local public radio Ninety One point seven KLW San Francisco and on the Web that KLW dot org\nTonight we are discussing San Francisco's proposition see with our guests Jennifer freedom buck executive director of the coalition not homelessness and sponsor of proposition seat and ... former senior adviser and communications director for recent San Francisco mayor and supervisor mark feral and now on the campaign spokesperson\nWe invite you to call in with your questions or your comments is a business tax the right solution to our housing shortage how else should San Francisco addresses homelessness crisis or you likely to vote yes on prop see why or why not\nThe number to call to join our conversation is eight six six seven eight talk\nThat's eight six six seven eight eight to five five you can email or text us now at ... at Yale W. dot org or tweet us or post a comment on our Facebook page I'm Jess Jennifer was saying that this is the right time and um what do you think about the city economists report\nYeah I think the city's economic impact report showed massive insurgency jeeze oh guaranteed outcome whatsoever in terms of what the proponents say we'll do\nUm you know again if you look at the ... page report 'em if businesses move out of San Francisco which is very likely here give it a high talked with that exist in San Francisco and I'm very much lower originally in the East Bay on this topic\nUm the the uncertainty here in the impact of middle class in Franciscans and the potential to rich transportation golfing housing costs are very severe you know obviously we go through the report I'm In a different you know I just wanted to look at the big on the street look at what we've seen over the past decade\nA decade ago if you if you ...\nWe were spending nearly three times was on a home with his budget ... where we are today nearly three times more at the same amount of homeless people again there's a lot of issues that contribute to that but what that tells us and its supporters are opponents of this measure I should say is that more money alone is not the sole answer to that\nYeah but it's much deeper than that there's not a one size fits all solution were arbitrary number was awarded factory increasing says history is going to solve homelessness wants him for all its performance pointless just simply not true to\nLook for what he said that there is three hundred million dollars in the budget for the city to addressing homeless issues and has had her pointed out a majority of that goes to supportive housing this proposition is talking about permanent supportive housing as well as one of the solutions to the problem is more money um the right answer to resolving the problem\nDon't think anyone thinks she can solve homelessness without spending some money I mean it's so bizarre statement to say that\nUm we're spending the same amount of money and we have an old people\nBecause we have a house thousands and thousands of people in the meantime and we've we've had thousands more homeless people more people become homeless in our impoverished population in San Francisco we have a massive housing crises I mean get real all up and down the west coast massive housing crises\nAnd so you know as as ranch keep going up and up as people lose their housing as all the speculative real estate happened so I mean all these ... everybody's familiar with what's going on here\nUm and so it's you know if it was the same seven thousand people who were on the streets um and we had an housed anyone in the meantime but were housing\nYou know I mean we've got Ninety five hundred formerly homeless people that are in housing 'em your former boss push for more money for bus tickets out of town we've lost six thousand people out of town we've I mean I could go on and on but the reality is that what our approaches ban has been a piecemeal approach and that his ...\nA little bit there and it's not enough and we have this opportunity to get serious about it and to really turn it around and so you know this this is really our chance and I think you know [noise]\nReally the vision is about values and about the values of justice and equity about a vision for San Francisco where we go upstream half of our homeless population became homeless before the age of twenty five\nIt's astonishing we're not serving families with kids this initiative is going to make sure that we're addressing family homelessness so thousand of our um four thousand housing units are going to come out of this are going to go towards families with kids were going to make sure we address youth needs\nUm we're gonna go upstream we're going to make sure that San Franciscans don't become homeless and so it's really a thoughtful approach about how we address this crises in the long term because let's face it\nWe've been in this for three decades we cannot keep going that the unintended consequences of homelessness are overwhelming our city we have thousands of police calls responses were spending forty Cape per person\nPer year on emergency room cause\nWe had you know just another death that happened were confiscating people's property constantly taking away their medications we just took you know we just had an overdose because people didn't have the nor can that just got confiscated by the police of fatal overdoses someone died\nYou know this is the stuff that we're facing and we we've got to turn around this crises and this is our opportunity to do it [noise] I'm Jennifer what do you say to\nUm people who are thinking about voting to about this proposition and maybe the concern that they have about how money has maybe ... has probably or could not have been used efficiently um and the oversight that's going to be provided by this proposition to how the money is going to be spent\nYeah I mean you know you look around and you're like what\nYou know and what's happening is is that everyone who's going is getting turned away we're spending in San Francisco we got twenty five hundred shelter beds were spending twenty four dollars per person per night were underpaying the staff\nWere over extending our contracts are dropping centers let me just take cap street for example there contracted with the city to serve a hundred people a day you've got three hundred and fifty people a day going through there and they're more working hard jobs that really low wages and they're well they're saying look we need to turn this around were willing to take on more work to turn this around\nAnd so you know it is we you know we're the failure is is that we ... we don't have the capacity were getting everyone is getting turned away\nYou you're you know we've got a thousand people on our weightless for shelter we have seven thousand homeless households trying to get housing 'em you can knock yet I'm supportive housing San Francisco right now unless you've been homeless for Twenty one years in San Francisco\nThat's how we have to prioritize are supportive housing right now because of people who've been there the longest are get the top priority and and so that's not okay we need to dial that back\nAnd really you know get people into shelter right away um move 'em into housing as quickly as possible or else we're spending much more money keeping them homeless than we are housing them [noise]\nAnd and who's going to oversee the use of the funds yeah so I mean the ... the the it's pretty pretty you know the the initiative says exactly where all the money has to be spent\nUm which I went through that already um it there is an oversight committee that I'm a that will basically be looking at doing and need there'll be doing it needs assessment and looking at accountability so there'll be tracking those dollars and looking at whether or not the city spending them effectively\nUm there's going to be at ... you know and of course we're this is we're so interested in this because we want to make sure that you know this is done right and so we'll be bird dog in this very aggressively to make sure that um that money goes where it needs to go um and then every dime spent effectively it\nStuff ends up happening through nonprofits um\nAnd ah we know where to housing can go already um there is going to be a lot of work to be done absolutely um but we were really careful about constructing us initiative in a way that it was\nFully accountable um that it utilizes best practices and that it builds on a plan that's already in place well it seems from the looking at the proposition\nThat the um members of the committee will be appointed by the board of supervisors and the mayor is and the controller is\nNot really a tough it's half bored half mayor and then the swing see by the controller\nUm but I just want to know one of the things is each of the seats on is you know we're trying not to have it be a body where they just stick people who may be worked on somebody's campaign um we see that a lot on our commissions and so this is supposed to be a working body\nSo each of the seats has you know they have to have experience in an area and bring some expertise to the table um because we really expect us to be a working body that's really laying out okay\nUm you know how how do we do this right and looking at best practices and data and where the gaps and and those kinds of things right I think we have a caller on the line a\nLine one star child from San Francisco\nAre you there can your yes go ahead with your question\n[noise] yeah so um\nSo they knew they were mentioning the opponents organizations opposing prop see earlier um they didn't mention the Libertarian Party which is a ... on the local out with stricter we definitely has a\nAnd a ... I mean it it is\nA huge amount of money and the fact is already spending like three hundred and eighty million dollars a year\nOn homeless programs and services and yet you know for most of the past decade the number of homeless people on the street ... official count has been about the same of the current approach is working and and I don't think that they're proposing to do\nTo the fact that San Francisco can't shoulder this crisis alone this is a regional issue that deserves a regional response\nUm again you know ... with folks moving their jobs to the areas that\nHave lower cost in terms of transportation and housing to think that you know Francisco is going to continue this you know strong economic growth a forever simply misguided you know we're at the longest period of economic growth cities history or you know everything happens in cycles here especially in business you know especially in politics\nUm the downturn is right around the corner\nOf the recession you can come in any minute here and if we were wind back to you know I'm I'm fortunate days of two thousand two thousand eight when\nPeople are losing jobs unemployment was you know into double digits but that's the scenario we don't ever want to be again I'm In a city and\nI think you know with prop seeing the lack of flexibility it really provide 'em you know city leaders here to to take a holistic approach at the city as a whole instead of just focusing on one thing to grow a you know issue here is unfortunate and you know one of the the fatal flaw\nMentioned regional it's a regional issue and can you expand on that ... yeah of course you know ... San Francisco you know ... is not an island off it's\nNowhere peninsula you know we have a a an economy that's highly based on tourism business you know there's a common missed\nConception that these big businesses aren't paying their fair share the top one percent of businesses in San Francisco contribute forty percent of the tax base for business tax revenue in uh in San Francisco\nYou know we've had many examples of the business community\nAnd wealthy individuals that are leaders within that company stepping up in terms of philanthropic after I mean our first navigation center was privately funded by a wealthy tech um individual wander ... remain anonymous you know we're lucky to have leaders like Mark Benny off and others who are committed to use in private capital\nAs well to help address this issue and in terms of\nYou know everything being regional here um you know the the the lack of building housing in San Francisco affect housing prices and open and the same for the south than the East Bay and so again to think that just you know the largest tax increase in San Francisco history and double in our budget is going to cure almost as for all of San Francisco\nIs really um you know an empty promise unfortunately\nAt the end of the day well we'd like you our listeners to join in our in our conversation about this this is ... is on local public radio Ninety One point seven KLW San Francisco and I'm Glad that kale W. dot org tonight we're discussing San Francisco's prop see with our gas Jennifer freedom Bach executive director of the coalition on homelessness\nAnd a sponsor proficiency as well as just my ... former senior adviser and communications director for San Francisco mayor and supervisor mark feral and\nNow on the campaign spokesperson we'd love you to join our conversation is that this is a solution to our housing shortage are you likely to vote no or yes on proposition\nAnd number to call to join our discussion is eight six six seven eight talk that's eight six six seven eight eight to five five you can email or text us now it's ... KLW dot org between us or post a comment on our Facebook page\nI think we have somebody on line one I'm Tim from Berkeley\nYeah Hi there I'd like Cassie former risk to San Francisco as a result of the tech industry\nComing in in two thousand and one I'm I'm ... primary talking point which is a big tax which I'm not sure if the accurate\nBut there is something to be said for the fact that a lot of homelessness in San Francisco have created by increasing property values and ran as a direct result of the tech industry coming\nThe or actually kicking the poor people out suing the president would seem to be with the tech industry created a problem and I would see it's not as if you get from the tech industry left her system as a result of this time I don't see\nAny other way to deal with this problem could you please address phone\nYeah and Tim can you turn your radio down and maybe we'll take your pick your hands are out there ON Technology it's tricky just what do you say about that\nYeah I mean I think the reason why the housing costs are simply so insane that was going to obey areas\nYou know we have the most byzantine process for proving ... out of bed you know city or state in the country\nUm you know it's a supply and demand issue you know fundamental yeah but you know our cities in a building in the region inability to sufficiently build enough housing or reading for the higher housing cause you know potential that ship you know that happened a year out you know every single day\nUm but unfortunately I think the caller's misguided so you know think that if the technology we were to banish\nUm north unfortunately these or San Franciscans many of them are here you know in our community many of these tech companies you know homegrown businesses um I think it's unfortunate uh one bay area residents\nA scapegoat one community against the other to try to benefit\nOf one and I think you know the day um if the technology community were not to be president or Cisco are calling me would suffer as a result in the first people that would suffer from that are low income and middle class Franciscan\nYou know the first jobs to go from ... or not the wealthy executive orders to sweep the executive it's the ministry of stuff the middle class folks that are working in ... every day to try to um survive and thrive on one of the most expensive cities in a region of the other\nQuick question for you that came from a listener so the companies that are covered by the proposition do they include something like a chain chi which is headquartered in another state but has an office here in San Francisco would that be a company that would be covered by this proposition\nYeah ... the company's figure out what their grocery seats are based on their uh production in in San Francisco and so they they already do that I'm In there on business very very small business tax that they pay 'em already in San Francisco and this would be a very tiny one on top of that\nSo it's only it covers only companies that make fifty million dollars in San Francisco as a result of San Francisco\nBased business yeah yeah and so and it's and it's just above fifty million of its fifty formula is just the form in I I just want to mention really quickly died you know this is kind of of you know when we are value is our vision is not about vengeance it's about values but we we really [noise]\nWe've heard the scare tactic before that companies are going to move out of town are going to lose jobs we heard that when we did health care in San Francisco um and the business community sued the city of San Francisco by requiring\nOn the prevention of healthcare that didn't turn out to be the case um we ended up leaving the country and and doing this um they said that with minimum wage um they've set it over and over again every time one of these things comes forward and it doesn't pan out\nUm you know but what does pan out is that San Francisco leads the way and we make change and when we talk about this being a regional problem it is and we have other cities that are already leading the way as well Santa Clara did a massive initiative themselves um where they did a big um [noise]\nA a big bond issue Los Angeles to H and double age where they did a a combination of a revenue measure and a bond measure um we have cities all over the country that are doing this um that are leading the way because we know we can't wait for the federal government anymore I'm so and we have this\nBig tax break that we can then recapture some of that money and use that to transform an issue that has been vaccine I said it it really homelessness hurts all of us and it just seems\nKnow approach what is your thought about the propositions and east Palau town Mountain View that our business taxes are real and trying to raise funds to address the homeless problem\nYou know I'm not as well versed on those initiatives unfortunately um I Do now and chose cumulus south are much much less um you know the void of San Francisco the proponents are proposing here\nUm and again when I talk about a regional issue and no opportunities here you know many in the business community for example or support are supporting the state's two billion dollar how can I mean there are ways to go about things um in terms of solving the issues\nYou know I really you know I've started calling President Obama um you know in terms of\nA lot of outcomes here you know when when when two sides of any issue you know really view it as a zero sum\nAnd are going to move forward and left a hundred percent of their needs and demands are met unfortunately there's no progress you know that it would be able to be made or you know no more progress um you know for folks to to really care about it and I think again it's an unfortunate outcomes near um you know we we could have had an opportunity for a consensus\nCity wide approach we could have had an opportunity you know for a new mayor in for elected leaders to come together\nOr like they've done in the past to\nPresent options for more revenue for the city's most pressing crisis\nBut instead you know we have community leaders you know when I was thankful for you know the folks at work a nonprofit community and provide services on a day to day basis you know there's something to be said about elected leaders you know voters go to the polls you know every June or November\nTo elect individuals that have run on issues that have run out an idea that we had a mayor that just did that you know she hasn't taken a position yet on this measure\nUm but again you know we we really hope that you know there's an opportunity and we're hopeful about the new mayor you know will come forward with a consensus approach here that involves you know all stakeholders to find a solution that's workable for everyone but yet we'll have you know a major impact which um I Know it's possible\nI guess what you mentioned that Maryland and breed has any town taken a position on this have you as your collection had conversations with her about you were on grievances with the proposition\n... the business community in general sure has you know definitely express their opinions and the parents you know I think again you know a base that are left to turn San Francisco you know definitely opposed you know to this measure um you know I think um unfortunately you know it's", "show_name": "City Visions", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "02", "locations": [["San Francisco", 37.77493,

send us your questions and comments at any time by emailing us at ... at K. A. L. W. dot org [noise]\nWell I thought to start the conversation we really need to understand the underlying law which is called Senate bill number one I'm Martin can you explain how that law came about and what it does\nYes the gasoline tax is an excise tax which is ... cents per gallon not as a percentage of the sale price\nSo the legislature has to raise the tax every now and then in order for it to keep up with inflation\nAnd then on top of that I'm with vehicle fuel efficiency increasing in order to raise enough money or the facts has to get higher in order to produce the same amount of revenue that it did when when vehicles got ten or twelve or Fifteen miles per gallon and now they get forty miles per gallon\nSo the tax has to be higher to to view as much as it used to per mile of driving so periodically the legislature has raised attack but recently it hadn't been for many years\nAnd so the buying power of the revenue had declined and there was a backlog of um mostly maintenance projects would also new capital investment so in the spring of twenty Seventeen the legislature exit is raised\nA in sb won it raised the base\nOf gasoline excise tax raised the diesel fuel tax it added to our\nVehicle registration fees of of between twenty five and a hundred and Seventy five dollars\nA per vehicle depending on the value of the vehicle and for the very first time it added a fee on electric vehicles which of course pay no gas ... packs\nAt all and so it added a modest fee of a hundred dollars a year on electric vehicles as a first step I think toward trying to be fair in charging electric vehicles as long a alongside a gasoline powered vehicles\nAnd Carl this um says Senate bill one has been around for a year what has it funded so far\nThank you again for having me on the show You're welcome so for the Senate bill one has moved forward with six\nYeah eight of California's county's four hundred and eighty one of four hundred and eighty two cities and there's a price for anyone who can save the city that has not yet drawn on that\nNow I'm curious for\nJones says ... county Caucasian eight hundred and thirty nine and they will they just have not yet applied for their funds with eight hundred and thirty nine residents\nCould hide from his if you're listening and ... it used to call in [laughter]\nIf you're if you're single goes to ... more power to you so where did the funds go it's as Dr rocks said it generates about five point two billion dollars a year at one point nine billion of that grace we'll go for\nA hour highway system fifty one thousand nine hundred\nState highway lane miles Thirteen thousand state bridges sixteen hundred of our bridges are an unsafe in deficient conditions one point eight billion will go for our local streets in roads we have three hundred and five thousand\nLocal street and rode ... miles in another twelve thousand bridges in over crossing so seven out of every ten dollars will make sure that our roads are safer\nAnd in better condition for our motorists\nThe remaining three out of ten seven hundred and fifty million goes for transit improvements especially in urban areas like ours that depend on it\nI think the bart extension into San jose in downtown Santa Clara electrifying and modernize in modernizing Cal trained commuter rail service the smart train for those of us who enjoy going up to the wind a country and snow member in Area Rapid transit\nA hundred miles for those a hundred million a year for those of us who prefer to wheels to four wheels\nMost of my commute by bicycle Seventeen miles each way each day and so we want to get more people out of their cars and burning burning a a burning cards rather than carbon so a hundred million a year of that five point two billion his first\nIs for bike safety pedestrian safety safe routes to school for my little girl's et cetera uh and that\nCovers almost all of it for for a a vehicles in our parks and rec system there is a modest amount there for agriculture vehicles there is a modest amount there for those tow trucks you see on bay area freeways and tried to move traffic jams by pulling people off of our freeways and local streets in roads\nThere is a modest amount of about twenty five million a year there a doctor walks in his expertise or I Believe at UCLA will know there's about five million or seven million a year or two words I think four or five universities two words are indeed in transportation improvements\nIn together as a package\nThat is what SP one provided again through the California transportation commission and Caltrans sixty five hundred\nProjects have already been approved in are moving forward in those categories\nI felt a lot of that's a lot of projects I mean why that particular proposition should be passed and why and it sounds like a lot of infrastructure needs that are being attacked the south and what what are the objections to have you on that and working\n... jumping off of what some of the point to colleges made a lot of the things that you described are desirable projects for our infrastructure our infrastructure in California is woefully inadequate in many ways the problem is\nThat first of all only a third of the funds that have been raised so far being budgeted and allocated towards Cal transfer the core purpose for which this tax\nWas advertised SBY namely our highways are bridges are crumbling infrastructure a lot of that money is instead being used for social engineering projects like bike lanes and made it very nice to hear Carl talk about riding to work on a bicycle\nLuxurious for wealthy people and a lot of people who work here in the bay area actually have to commute two hours from their homes and more affordable areas to get to work and for them there is no bicycle riding to get to work there is no weekend\nTime to go on the line train they actually have a huge impact to their economic situation from the approximately Seventeen Eighteen hundred\nDollars that is imposed on a two car household to pay for this gas tax increase and so when you add up the amount of money out of pocket it's about Fifteen hundred dollars gross set up with the taxes at a lower income tax rate of two thousand dollars that's two years' worth of\nA Christmas presents for a family of four that looks that's a lot of other necessities of life and so this tax is the most popular aggressive possible attacks and that's the objection to it so\nUh it's an unfair tax it imposes a huge burden on the people who couldn't put a cooking afforded beliefs secondly the problem in California is that all of these types of well intentioned taxes that raise money for a specific purpose\nThey get raided by the legislature for other purposes and we've seen that happen with prior gas taxes and prior taxes in bonds that are allocated for improvement of our infrastructure so\nCarl is the president and CEO of the Silicon Valley leadership group a public policy trade association and a member of the California transportation commission we all have harm me Dylan a trial lawyer and former candidate for assembly and a Republican National committee member and\nOn the phone have Dr Martin lax Martin is a former director of the UC transportation center and the department chair of the department of planning at UCLA\nWe invite you to call in with your questions and your comments what do you think the states\nPlease call in at eight six six seven eight talk again that's eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five or you can email us now is the vision that KLW dot org or post a comment on ... KLW dot org or a Facebook page you can also find us on Twitter at sea visions KLW\nI mean I wanted to turn to you when it comes to the editorial boards of the state wide newspapers\nVery few I think the only the Orange County registrars in favor of proposition sex and the overwhelming um the sentiment of the editorial board to vote no on prop sex and largely that's because it seems like the Senate bill one that has been effective in um funding in important unnecessary transportation needs what do you say about that\nWell I'm sure we would have very efficient funding if we tax people at a hundred percent too but that's not really how it works out of the problem is that a lot of the voices in California who are most impacted by these massive tax increases at every level and they include\nFrom I'm from nimby attitudes to housing that really complicates is transportation issue in California to these transportation\nUh taxes to employment taxes to sales taxes and income taxes\nThose people have left California and fewer and fewer people are reading those newspapers that are saying yes please continue to raise the taxes because because that's how they vote on just about everything they want more money for the government to spend on various things but\nI don't know how you can have an intelligent conversation about this tax in any tax involving transportation without looking at the gross and efficiency of ...\nI'm a reason magazine and other studies have shown that\nThe the cost of doing a mile of road here in California and maintaining and improving it\nIs four point seven times what it is and other states it's a four hundred and Seventy percent inefficiency how can you not talk about that we have tons of people uh Caltrans who don't have enough work to do every day a lot of the money that we raise for these types of projects and why so many lobbyists and so much money are behind this\nOr for a union you know unions need workers to work on these projects and a filled our coffers and again\nThe you know I have you want to get emotional anecdotes I can give you the names of dozens of people who've left California because this was one too many taxes and on top of that this tax if it was so great\nWhy did a democratic leaders have to wanna one by one bribe various Democrats and vulnerable districts and mix districts to vote for it with\nA half a million dollars here and a hundred million dollars there so uh this kind of dirty way that this thing was passed in the first places of the reason why so many taxpayers are so angry about and why it needs to be repealed\nWell let's talk about is it more expensive to repair roads in California than elsewhere Karl\nRove you ask a different question about editorial boards and I'm not sure that was answered so let me start there and then I'll go to your second question grace because both are fair\nThe truth of the matter is that every bay area newspaper every single one that has taken a position on proposition six has been\nAdamant in its opposition to proposition six months for so for reasons but let me just mention a handful of those papers the room independent journalist Santa Rosa press Democrat to San Francisco chronicle the Petaluma argues courier the East Bay times from San jose Mercury News the San Francisco business times from Santa Cruz sentinel\nEvery single bay area paper it's opined ... an opposition and why is that it's how dangerous in cynical this measure is and the impact\nThat it will have in destroying our transportation system and when we dive into\nThat the LA Times calls this the ...\nWorse or the cynical motives behind proposition six\nCalled political ploy the only reason this is on the ballot is to give anti tax Republicans a reason to go to the polls\nParty bosses are hoping that while we're there there they'll vote for conservative candidate Santa Rosa press Democrat ... say cynical approach the chronicle a cynical political ploy that would destroy California's roads grace let me remind your listeners how this got on the ballot\nThe signatures were collected because the national Republican Party in GOP leaders including the speaker of the house GOP leader of Paul Ryan of Wisconsin\nHis superPAC helped funded Steves the least the majority whip from Louisiana and his superPAC funded it Kevin McCarthy majority leader three hundred thousand for this six\nRepublican congressional candidates at risk funded it because they see this as a way to keep the house of representatives why are papers so against it and the dish and not the politics which are not appropriate\nBut the policy it's the cost of bad roads in traffic to San Luis Obispo Tribune bad roads cost the average San Luis Obispo resident almost twice of what it costs the average California resident of one thousand four hundred and Nineteen year in maintenance and repair and lost fuel efficiency\nSan Francisco chronicle similar California's roads are ranked as some of the worst in the country I thought are dangerous thing to harm me said that she she was concerned at first it only a third of these funds go to Caltrans that as Dr ... confirmed two thirds go to\nOur localities they go to the cities and counties for those street maintenance and pothole repair fountains so after lamenting that only a third goes to Caltrans she'd done at tax Caltrans is grossly in the\nFall I don't want I don't want that hell at all I don't want the bill at all I I don't think that another tiny should go to Caltrans until the discipline that fact that if we actually spent the money that's already ... for these purposes on these laudable goal as having passable roads in California\nWe didn't need this tax so that's the problem well I'm just curious ... original question is that mark spent ... I'm\nSo hard and he does is quoting an organization called the reason foundation who's still hasn't said where they got the funds for their study where they said that it was more expensive to repair roads in California so let's look at that closely for a moment\nThey didn't say lane miles they said lanes\nSo in California we have highways that are three four five lanes in each direction pick Arkansas one or two lanes in each direction and they counted miles not lane miles seconds we are blessed to axe to be the import hub for twenty percent\nOf all the imports coming into the United states those going trucks mainly but also in rail cars\nAnd they beat up our roads a lot more that they do in states like Arkansas\nAnd as I'm sure ... confirmed or tell me if I'm wrong on this but those are the reasons we're data matters over dogma\nYou have to count all the lane miles not just the lanes and you have to remember what's going on on those roads so that's why three hundred and Seventy five million a year of this five point two billion are for those freight court orders think eight eighty five eighty six eighty and others where\nPeople may say it's dramatic but when people are almost losing their lives or losing their lives on our roads in part because of the conditions ... the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration twenty sixteen day that we lost thirty six hundred and twenty seven\nAccording to mix the based on the conditions of our roads those aren't sob stories those are human lives\nBut we have a full phone line so let's go to one of our listeners I'm Lisa end salon a county\nHi my name is Lisa I'm a nurse and I'm I'm less you know that represents the Latino community and I'm very disappointed I feel that his top is on the ballot because we should've been given a choice\nAs hot fairs and everybody that voted to vote and we didn't we didn't have the\nAh we couldn't because it was put through through legislation and I have to tell you that they're going to affect everybody it doesn't matter if you're Democrats independence or Republican every one of us can be as most of us too because we can't live in the bay area so we live outside\nThe bay area my husband and I we both can use every single day at least Ninety miles each\nBack and forth so it's going to cost way more than the eight hundred that you said it's going to be more like the two thousand which we calculated with everything else not only that it is that the farmers we have a lot of farmers up in northern California and in order for them to get their produce out\nIt's going to cost them more that means is going to cost more I guess what that means they're going to be taught and I feel if we don't vote yes five six till we feel the gas tax what's going to happen as a legislator things\nThey'll just say to think that they're going to be able to have our phone our water and they're going to go off the top Thirteen which protects our homes and um\nThis is on the ballot because it should be on the ballot it shouldn't be on the ballot but it is because you didn't give us the choice you didn't give us a choice to make a decision and vote\nHockey economy in or help the economy in terms of imports from around the world that is why we need to use phones\nWell thank you for that this is the city of our local public radio Ninety One point seven KLW San Francisco on the Web that KLW dot org tonight we're debating the pros and cons of a proposition six with our guests Karl card you know the president and CEO of the Silicon Valley leadership group harm me Dylan trial lawyer and former candidate for the assembly\nAnd Martin lacks a former director of the UC transportation center at the department chair of the UCLA department of planning\nWe invite you to call in with your questions or comments what do you think of ... sex and and feel free to give us a call at eight six six seven eight talk Martin would you like to comment on Carl's last I'm no comment\nI I wanted to add one point or more to what a cold\nWar you know that he he said I can correct him if he was wrong and I do\nNot correct them because he was not wrong in fact I did the calculations myself as to what the gas tax from Nineteen twenty three would be and it came up with exactly the same results so um he would not run but there's one more point I Would make this rainy day fund would\nCover about two years of revenue the card balance would cover about two years of revenue that would be produced by sb one\nUm and the problem is that that's general revenue so it\nIs available to be spent on for example a firefighting as we've had some very serious fire a forest fires in California and\nBrush fires and it's also available for use for education and health care and those are important programs and transportation would have to compete to get a share of that so that the\nTotal balances only two years of the proceeds of revenue but we would get from the gas tax of program and um the the the gas tax is guaranteed by\nState law and by article Nineteen of the constitution of California to be spent on transportation so again if you're if you're planning projects that have\nA better in the pipeline but for seven and eight and ten years before they're open to traffic\nRelent as being purchased and construction is under way it's important to know that there that the gas tax stable source of revenue and the rainy day fund is one for which there would have to be competition each year and the portion that would go to transportation cannot be specified in it that\nWe have an email for thank you for that Martin and we have an email from Ian in San Francisco please have your gas clarified ms Dylan statement in which he represented the actual costs to families as attacks\nAs opposed to the fact that it is the cost and excessive wear and tear if the tax does not pass currently California drivers spend up to seven hundred and thirty nine dollars per year on front end alignment shocks entire repairs\nBecause of driving on bad roads facts matter um [noise]\nWhat do you do what I Would say is nobody here in this conversation is saying that we shouldn't fix the roads and we shouldn't have good roads the problem is that we already have taxes in California to address these issues and if we impose discipline around them\nWe wouldn't be talking about raiding the rainy day fund or any of that nobody is suggesting that here I don't think that's just the responsible\nBut I think that what's fiscally irresponsible is to\nAllow this bait and switch and raise money repeatedly for different purposes\nWhen you add up all the different taxes and fees in our gas costs it's actually Ninety five point five cents a gallon there all kinds of fees that relate to environmental issues and other issues like that Californians already paid the second highest gas taxes in the country after Hawaii Hawaii is number one and after that it's California\nDo we add the second best roads in the country\nResponsible way of handling our problems and I I personally as a taxpayer I don't see a problem and using general revenue funds for general obligations in our state because when we do that and we have to weigh competing interest against each other as opposed to thinking this is some kind of bottomless pit they can keep taxing people more and more and more\n[noise] we have a caller Tony from San Francisco\nHi um I it's so funny I was in his show and I was actually commuting home from work from rockstar I live in a fight forest hills in San Francisco and I have to drive by ... ... over the Golden Gate bridge\nEt cetera et cetera and nineteenth avenue and it is unbelievable how bad the roadside\nAnd what I see it you know the answers and both of those I get the email said that what I Know this is the his management of fire\nAnd outsourcing the contracts that they didn't like taking the lowest I contract at least in San Francisco you will see I thought that if they got this one road it shaped though three times\nAnd like for my and it's just you know I Know the money's going away because I really think that that needs to be done is\nLike an overhaul of how the Pfizer being fat because\nEspecially if the money's there I mean I'm In favor of increasing the cat that found but then to cut out people with electric cars they already get the you know the ... and that's your guest said that you have to make the most money to buy an electric car I Can't eat or glass\nThanks for your call Tony appreciate that ... what do you say that that that the way the funds are being is it's not efficient and how can we make sure that any money that's raised for transportation gets used wisely and that I rented do get to be in better shape yeah\nIn Tony thank you for calling safe travels home from San Francisco to to lurk spur\nA in remembered let's talk about your prep six passes what would that mean to your commute I already mentioned the traffic this taken off the road it's not a wind train it as a commuter train called smart ... Area Rapid transit and it takes commuter\nCars off of highway one on one this would also take away the money to fix the murder in Sonoma narrows and you probably know that road very well Tony it's where\nHighway one ... one goes from three lanes to two lanes and then mysteriously back to three again well that's one of the sixty five hundred projects that\nSenate bill one is funding the propositions six wants to take away and if we take it away we're not going to be able to build that lane because dollars are finite it's math and we need to recognize that and I'm Glad you brought up electric cars and you're right that is why in in their wisdom\nAs grace mentioned earlier and as Dr Iraq's mentioned earlier the electric cars are now paying it's it's a hundred dollars a year starting in twenty twenty plus they paid the transportation improvements the and as you noted you and I can't afford an electric car\nMy car again nine years old previous with Ninety eight thousand miles on it\nBlue Book value of six thousand I'll pay fifty dollars a year Ninety percent of the cars would either pay the twenty five dollars a year or the fifty dollars a year based on our uh depreciated value of our car so a brand new electric car of sixty thousand than up\nThey pay not only the hundred for the electric vehicle but another hundred and Seventy five for the transportation improvements the they're actually paying more than\n... would be paying through this and again as you mentioned on the phone Tony or they was the previous caller before you seven hundred and thirty nine dollars is what we pay is an average motorists\nIn fuel inefficiency because the beat up roads shocks alignment entire damage and Marty Dr ... again we'd never met your the expert if I got a new that wrong call me on a\nCell that can I add a point about this uh you know Tony mentioned the inefficiency at the spending of our resources let's just talk about to bay area projects I mean we have the\nUh the trans bay terminal which is a shut down because the boats are cracking because somebody didn't do a good job of designing that particular transportation hub which is one of these projects that this money gets spent on\nAnother example here in the bay area is our\nUh I think twice over budget Willie Brown a span of the bay bridge which again made a defective foreign boats and not money well spent for the taxpayer\nBecause this money as a bottomless pit that legislators in Sacramento or out of touch with are people who actually have to commute and work for a living um have to suffer through\nThey think it's a bottomless pit they can keep coming back to the well attacks us more and more they don't realize that the killing that goes that lays the golden egg workers like those who have called in today are leading our state for places where the taxes are lower the roads are better the legislators are more sensitive to the needs of the working\nPerson and when and again remember the tax today after this increase the first tax in nearly a ... that the first gas tax increase in California nearly a quarter of a century\nSince a Republican governor George Duke mange you lead the effort for our last increase in the early Nineteen nineties but didn't adjusted for inflation is the same amount as it was when the gas tax started in January leaving\nOut all the ... of Carly ... Ninety five point five percent ... percent Ninety five point five cents out of every gallon and you're not even talking about one in ... and he talks about getting my ... so there's also an increase

different positions on this November ballot propositions one into our bond measures to make affordable housing more available\nProposition ten our focus tonight would repeal a state law that limits cities abilities to impose rent control that law in Nineteen Ninety five Costa Hawkins rental Housing Act\nStrictly limited local rent control laws under the ... the legislation local laws that cannot apply to housing built after Nineteen Ninety five single family homes condos\n'em and therefore this is what we're talking about tonight should do hum visa restrictions be repealed prop ten would repeal Costa Hawkins and\nWould remove these legal requirements therefore allowing cities to decide whether they want to adopt but a rent control or decide to make changes to existing rent control laws\nAdvocates a prop ten are rallying around the slogan that the rent is too damn high and argue that something needs to be done to make housing more affordable in the short term\nThose who oppose prop ten point out that economists on the left and right all agree that rent control is a policy that limits and not increases affordable housing as of early October over sixty two million dollars has been poured into the prop ... campaign for both sides\nAdvocates are passionate about the cause on both sides and so we asked tonight what's the right solution for the problem of affordable housing and the ever rising cost of living in California is it the passage of proposition were not\nJoining us in Studio tonight to discuss these issues and more are deep up ... the executive director of the San Francisco tendency union and part of the yes on prop ten coalition welcome ...\nWelcome and thank you so much for having me on the show\n[noise] also joining us here in the studio is Matt regained the senior vice president of bay area council\nHe's up in charge of their housing policy efforts in the bay area council is part of the no on ten campaign welcome Matt thank you great to be here and joining us by phone is Conor Dougherty he's a reporter with the New York times who covers the west coast economics and real estate wealth encounter\nA thank you for having me if I recall into a ... and I had to put my kids\nAnd no problem thanks for joining us and of course we'll invite you our listeners in about twenty minutes to join our conversation I'll give you that phone number now it's eight six six seven eight talk that's eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five you could send your questions and comments at any time by emailing us at ... at K. L. W. dot org\nSo Conor Dougherty I wanted to start with you to understand prop ten we need to understand a little bit more about the bill is trying to repeal I mentioned it earlier Costa Hawkins a say a little bit more about how Costa Hawkins came to be a and what is it do and how what's been it's impacting on California\n[noise] so um if I start by saying if the view of the bill is repealed nothing will happen on the first day it gives a option to do\nBasically broader and\nMore restrictive forms of rent control so ... is though that prevents cities from applying rent control to older units which are different in every place in San Francisco at Seventy nine but generally it when I did five [noise]\nAnd ah it also ... um [noise]\nIt created something called vacancy control\nWhich is very confusing but basically I mean if you move out the rent and go up as much as possible or as much to the market rate uh when uh the person was up so that's why people um you know hold on very tightly controlled apartment because uh\nUh probably rent controlled anymore it just goes up to whatever the regular rate is\nBut then just rent controlled kickback in ones that the yeah okay I didn't\nLike that I don't want 'em as you know there are apartments where one person's paying you know whatever twelve hundred dollars and their neighbor might pay\nTwenty four hundred dollars or whatever else and that's because of um\nEven though they're both technically under rent control so [noise]\nUh this can get very confusing very quickly but I think the important thing to remember is that it would allow cities to apply rent control to more units and there were units and it would ah allows cities more flexibility in how restrictive they would be put the rats\n[laughter] so um when you see more units you mean those built after Nineteen Ninety five or potentially in San Francisco those built after Seventy nine ah and then single family homes and condos would be fair game so to speak\nYes there are no current so there you go right and then you mentioned that\nUm it it would be up for negotiation when or how landlords could or could not raise the rent a one someone moved out\nUm but your point or is that nothing changes of the day after the election uh should prop ten pass it then just leaves a municipalities are the option to be able to do things without the same uh with no longer having the same constraints that they've had to\nUh work under a sense of ... this past\nYes a that is what I'm saying [laughter] and um\nAnyway you know so it would give you a lot more flexibility now of course you might see I'm not gonna you know Richard spent all night talking about different dominoes it's possible people if it past people would do things in anticipation of a lobbying change and stuff like that but legally speaking nothing would change the first day\nRight so it's a it's not it's hard to predict or you can you predict what could happen if prop ten past ah if we don't quite if there's many steps that have to fall after that\nI don't um I don't think that's a predicting other than there would be a very lively conversation at the San Francisco board of supervisors and a couple of other cities um\nI don't think I Want to predict what would happen right away\nI'm not just because I'm being a cop out but you know a lot of investors and other people will kill on both sides will posture about what they say they're going to do if something happens and it's\nNot entirely clear if they were really do that things so um I don't think it's a good idea to get too deep into that because sometimes you're playing into people's you know\nPlaying to people who are trying to get you to vote one way or the other\nGot it okay this just a a chance for you to give our um our audience a a a an understanding of what this is about what happens if it passes I'm In immediately and and what could happen down the road um so and\nAt this point and one of the things we're going to talk about a lot over this hour is is whether um\nCosta Hawkins a has a impacted the ability for a more affordable housing\nTo be built uh in California um do you have any research you can point to that might point to that question or what might happen or if a rent control were to become um\nSomething that's become more widespread or less restricted\nSo there's going to be a lot of discussion hair and a lot of parsing of studies and when you go to a human read about this on line or wherever you will always be a lot of dueling studies\nUm\nPolitics is about a choice people have their choice now an economics is about cough and people can tally cough in perfectly but they do probably the best job or you know in perfectly\nI think that um when we're talking about this issue it might well be that some people hear what people have to say about um you know print control and I would very much does help tenants today a and they'll say you know what that's a\nThat's a that's a choice I Want to make\n'em but I think people should also be wary that there are cough and it might well be that those costs are totally acceptable to them as a voter\n'em and um it might be that they're not but the costs aren't free and so I think that you know and and you probably you're you can make a very strong argument that people need rent control now that we're in a crisis that needs to be expanded and that the costs are worth a\nFair point that some people will probably make some people would say the costs aren't worth it but I don't think you should listen to anyone who says there's no cos I'm the cops generally are that you're more or less\nUm so we have to bury accounts of where we pride ourselves on being data driven not dogma driven and the data is clear liquid fickle on unpaid shovel um rent control stops\nNew housing construction and actually goes a dozen more\nConnor correctly pointed out it creates winners and losers um the winters are existing tenants who who hit the jackpot and got the rent controlled apartment in the in the lottery\nBut but it also does is it discourages landlords for maintaining their their their properties so the overall quality of the housing stock goes dog um\nAnd then you get a lot of landlords particularly the smaller family mom and pop landlords who may have a few units I'm as their retirement income\nThey're much more likely and the and the data is as clear again on this to take those units off the market and sell them I'm a small mom and pop landlord does not want the rent board or you know coming visiting um uh they'd they'd they'd much rather not deal with that level of government\nUm when they're when they're with their talents so that you get last a rental stock overall the beneficiaries of that\nAre the people who can afford to buy\nSo it's ... it's the people at the bottom of the income ladder who suffer most when a particularly strict controls her past\nAnd that's I think not what we're trying to achieve here I think deeper and I are United on our our our intentions on our goals to help us solve this housing crisis in this affordability crisis I think we're just disagree that the ... the the solution to the problem I think it's a it's a medicine that could kill the patient\nSo uh first of all we don't really know what would happen after after day once it's interesting to if proposition ten pass it it it's interesting to hear how people might in this anecdote you shared a might already be responding to it as if I had already passed\nUm but um tell us more about how landlords look at a ... or developers look at\nUm a project or does or does rent control or is it just a no go as as you describe it or does it give people a chance to kind of know what they can expect since rent control tells them kind of what\nWhat they can and cannot do when they sat and and rent and how they can raise rents wouldn't that give 'em win that game developers some sense of what what could they could reap from their investment\nAt developing a properties and and housing is an incredibly risky undertaking and venture I'm On the front end a developer has to negotiate with a with a property owner for the value of the land purchased the land\nThen they have to run the gauntlet of getting the the project approved through multiple local a\nFlaming hoops um they have to negotiate with Labor Day after negotiate with suppliers they have to pay all of their contractors and as the project moves through the process quite often get sued 'em they have to negotiate with community groups for community benefits agreements impact fees\nAt ... at each step in the process value is taken out of the project and what's left at the end of the day at the ... is what the developer takes their um their the last person to eat at the table if you will and if they end the ... the government says we're going to impose on the front and\nAll of these incredibly high risky costs and on the back and we're going to cap any potential profits you can make\nOn the D investors are going to go elsewhere with their money investors always look for the highest return on their dollar and and this is this is just high wall street works they look for the highest return on the dollar and if you say you ... this we're capping potential profits on on rental housing they will build condos\nOr they will buy bitcoin or they will invest in Tesla they will do something other than than build rental housing and I think again that's not what we need at this at this time in our history\nQuestion before I let deep uh respond [noise] um what about deep was a proposal that\nAll new construction as soon as it's constructed it could be phased in over a number of years say Twenty years away Berkeley is proposing a wouldn't that be a way to kind of mitigate some of this chilling effect on development\nWell that's making the assumption that cities won't use rent control is just another tool to stop housing construction\nIf you look at our regional housing needs allocation numbers in the bay area for the past several cycles\nAre the vast majority of our cities have failed to meet those numbers um I spend way too many late evenings planning commission meetings and have done for over a decade I ... I go to city halls across the region and fight for more housing and I see a local elected as\nSome of them trying to do the right thing many of them trying to do the right thing but they are faced with incredible pressures by nimby groups to stop construction of new housing um they have zoning controls at their disposal to to stop new housing um\nIf you give them pricing controls and ... on top of zoning controls that that's that's a huge multiplier you can stop a project by saying no you're not allowed to build that type of project here or you can stop a project by saying you can only be charged X number of dollars knowing that the project will never pencil\nSo saying that we can you know cities are free to impose a ruling rent control that will be good for the developers that's assuming that cities actually want the housing and I I think that's a big assumption to make particularly when you look at the track record of a lot of our cities in terms of housing production\nIn case you're just joining us this is city visions on local public radio Ninety One point seven KLW San Francisco and on the Web KLW dot org I'm just a ... and tonight we're diving into the pros and cons of the uh arguments are for and against the proposition attended that would be\nThe a repeal of the Costa Hawkins a um act\nThat was passed in Nineteen Ninety five that put some restrictions on on rent control in the state of California we heard at the beginning of our program for Conor Dougherty with the New York times are just now Matt Reagan the senior vice president of the bay area council who uh opposes prop ten and\nA ... a is also joining us the executive director of SF tendency and part of the yes on ten coalition we invite you to call in with your questions and comments should the ability to regulate rents be returned back to the local government and his rent control the ... right way to tackle the Affordable housing crisis\nThat we're currently in it seems like both sides agree on how will you be voting on prop ten we invite you to join our conversation by dialing eight six six seven nine eight talk that's eight six six seven nine eight eight to five five you can email us at city visions KLW done work post a comment on the ... website\nOr tweet us ... visions KLW also\nA department back to you hear ah when I'm Matt was just talking he says that the real problem is there's not enough housing and that uh lifting restrictions on rent control will only exacerbate the problem um how do you respond to that\nThink that's absolutely not true for several reasons first of all it's never happens that any rent controlled city in the nation has\nPlaced limits on buildings that are that have brand new um they've all had some sort of protections in ... when I got called protections they've all allowed landlords to set and developers to set rand's when they first constructive building and to be on and wreckage will say is that all have built more\nHousing and have built faster than non right controlled cities in California I'm In LA and San Francisco and Berkeley for example they all felt ... and and now it was a hundred and thirty six percent\nThey built more housing than neighboring areas that were not controlled in San Francisco it was over thirty percent\nThese housing is scare tactics in order to preserve profits and nothing more\n[noise] um\nSo this this conversation about um developers currently stopping projects not not not but building right now has to do with the fact that we're talking about potential instability in terms of what might happen and they're waiting to see how things fall out but\nWhen we talk about winners and losers we should think about the people who are really being harmed right now where the people who aren't sure if they're going to have a roof over their head next month this was a reality for Californians right now more and more\nHomeless families more and more people working more and more jobs deciding between food and rent deciding between medications and rent moving farther and farther away from their jobs driving to in three hours to get two jobs in places in the bay area for example I'm\nThe losers in than the current state of affairs are low income and middle income people and the winters are um of an unregulated market or the businesses that benefit from having no regulations on them and of course they are fighting regulations that always happens\nUm [noise] in terms of the\nConversation around mom and pop landlords\nSelling right now um there's a huge speculative market to buy up property from mom and pop landlords and more and more of those units are going into the hands of a large scale\nCorporate owners for example and those same companies are the biggest donors have been no one ten campaign companies like Blackstone um ethics properties um equity residential these are the companies that there's there's some of the biggest landlords and the entire country and I'm\nMuch of their portfolio of single family homes that they bought after the foreclosure crisis [noise] um and they are spending millions and millions of dollars to make sure that they're um portfolios won't be regulated\nComplex it is or sorry very old gross apartment complex that isn't particularly nice\nAnd then they clear everyone out and then they raised around a thousand bucks and maybe if you're lucky they painted em and a lot of people don't like that activity um in fact even economists don't like that activity they say they're the only uh [noise]\nThat the only use of that activity is quote price discovery um [laughter] which is a which is quite a way of putting it so there's a lot of ideas\nFor wanting to help renters now and ... ten is one of those ideas it's not a complete there are fairly conservative people who when they're feeling about you know\nA societal fabric and whatever else I'm ...\nYou want to impose some kind of price cap temporarily or whatever uh who who who don't think uh what I'm saying if you don't think the idea of capping rights as a horrible idea um but they don't think ... a good way of doing it so I guess I just try to keep in perspective\nWhat without like going back and forth about like this study this this study that um\nI think that it's important to keep in perspective that we do have two problems and California one is a long term problem that we don't want to make any worse\nBut the other is a short term problem that we seem to want to do something about and um you know anytime you have a mix of problems like that um you end up doing you know picking kind of\nOptions um you know meaning sometimes you pick a some degree of [noise]\nLike a price like I said it's like a price cap of ten percent or something like that so I just I just kind of want to try to say that there are even people who are you know economists or or who would be against prop tend who would be for some kind of price\nA cap of some kind and you know anyway I just think it's important to kind of keep in perspective that we do have a a reality on the ground that is a little bit more complicated than studies make it out to be um so\nShould so I Want to make sure to get our guests back in the studio back into the conversation but thanks for that Connor and one to make sure to put the phone number out again if you want to join our conversation tonight about prop ten which is ah about um\nRepealing a Costa Hawkins which uh would liberalize rent control uh or in cities across a California should it passed potentially regret raised the the ... I'm Sorry I Would\nUh a decrease restrictions on rent control a cross a California what actually happens remains to be seen a number down to join our conversation is eight six six seven eight talk again that's eight six six seven and eight eight to five five\nYou can email us at city visions and KLW dot org and post a comment on our Facebook page or let's actually go to a caller and I'm from San Francisco welcome to the program\nI I'm I'm calling because I was looking at information regarding prop pan and I didn't find an answer for it and that is\nRecording owner move in because I'm a public school teacher and my husband was a public school teacher and he worked three part time jobs so we could be bought some houses that he and my sons and I worked\nFor families we put out and we had we have teachers living\nAnd somehow this but we also have grandchildren now and as our children get owner older you know they may want to move and so I'd want from what I understand it would be almost prohibitively expensive if not impossible to do an owner moving down the line but I may be wrong\nSo that's my concern and aren't we deliberately went out and we didn't buy foreclosures we just worked hard you know weekends for years fixing up houses [noise]\nAnd ah we have all we have to in San Francisco and one in Oakland and um we rent to teachers and families specifically without gouging but\nIf it were true that we you know we've never been able to passes on to our children our grandchildren we might sell early so I just wanted to hear\nSomeone off thanks so much call yeah go ahead\nI I can answer that question um prop ten has nothing to do with the owner move in laws in San Francisco or anywhere in the state it simply has to do with rent controlled it would have no impact on your decision or your choice to um move it yourself or a family member into a unit that you own\nAll right so ah let's ah this issue of what happens when um [noise]\nA renter leaves I'm so vacancy control which is kind of a hard concept to get your head around but my understanding if I get it right is with Costa Hawkins in place now I'm a\nVacancy control is prohibited which means that a landlord can raise the rent to the market rate once a a tenant moved out or if a prompt and passes and cost Hawkins is repealed that restriction would be removed and theoretically it would take cities\nUm some doing to actually allow um I'm a two to prohibit rent or uh landlords to a raise runs to the market rate it wouldn't just happen on the day after the election um why a ... is this such an important piece of uh of this a proposition\nIt's so important because um we talked about\nHow\nExpensive it is to move into a new unit today and how every unit as it goes back to market rate um [noise] I talked to a tenant today I'm In my office who moved into his unit he's a trans man in San Francisco moved into his unit Twenty years ago\nWith his partner his partner passed away a few months ago and his partner was a tenant the original ten in the middle east and he moved in with the permission of the landlord but he was not the original occupant [noise]\nUm at that point the landlord raise the rent seven times what he's originally been um and he came to the tendency union on the same day that he wants to ...\nUm for um his partner and we had to give them the bad news that we don't have the ability to\nThat that that run to increase is legal and there's nothing we can do because he's not on beliefs um because he's not the original occupy the language is in costs talking about the original occupants okay I'm In New York a tennis have that kind of protection family members\nHousehold members who um have that kind of protection if they've been in a unit for more than two years\nUm and if they've lived with that family member for some time and we see this kind of heartbreaking story every week that's the most extreme example but of course\nThere's also the examples of any situation in which attendance is in their place for a long time I'm as their rent is less at lower and lower the market there's more and more pressure to push that tenants out and that is\nHe's a prisoner perverse scenario in which um landlords take worse and worse care of 'em they they treat\nLonger term tenants worse and worse longer term tenants are more and more afraid to speak up about their rights and um\nLandlords target them for harassment we've seen that in particular with one of the big corporate owners I'm ... I'm In San Francisco that's now the biggest um owner of the biggest lower in San Francisco with over ten thousand units in their portfolio which is there a test they um will buy a building\nThey will pass through a number of pass which pass throughs of course are fine if a landlord has cost that exceed what their um\nIf they make a bunch of her parents and and on alterations to a building the improvements they should be able to pass those costs through\n'em but they do that and then they they pass it costs only onto the longest term tenants with the hope that some of those tenants leave I Will not be able to afford those costs and then they can flip a certain number of units in their loan documents they actually demonstrate um that they're\nThat they and they expect a certain amount of turnover\nI'm ... I'm going to market rate and then they borrow money to fight the finance the purchase of these buildings with the intent of flipping a certain number of units which means in real um and we'll terms it means people losing their homes people losing that's that's the ability of their lives people living in in this economy people being pushed out of the city\nSo Matt wanting to have you you're not here necessarily representing landlords are but uh but this idea of a Costa Hawkins creating these perverse incentives uh that then lead to situations where rent skit or jacked up on long term tenants who\nBy technicality that could still happen um or with a as a um as properties change hands are new people come in with the intent to really move some long term tenants out of so that they can raise the rent because vacancy controls are prohibited um what do you well how do you respond to that\nI I Do agree with you one hundred percent the ... of market controls price controls um any kind of distortions do create perverse incentives I'm On the analogy I like to use is you know we a generation ago we pass prop Thirteen in California and", "show_name": "City Visions", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "23", "locations": [["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["Costa Hawkins", -43.76667, 169.7], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["Costa Hawkins", -43.76667, 169.7], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["Berkeley", 37.87159, -122.27275], ["San Francisco California", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["SF", -32.94682, -60.63932], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467], ["LA", 34.052235, -118.243683], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["Berkeley", 37.87159, -122.27275], ["San Francisco California California California", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["Oakland", 37.80437, -122.2708], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["New York", 40.71427, -74.00597], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["Costa Hawkins", -43.76667, 169.7], ["California", 34.68743, -116.78467]], "not_found": ["bitcoin"], "ep_coords": ["San Francisco, CA", 37.77493, -122.41942], "in_country": ["California", "San Francisco", "New York", "California", "San Francisco", "San Francisco", "San Francisco", "California", "Berkeley", "San Francisco California", "New York", "California", "LA", "San Francisco", "Berkeley", "San Francisco California California California", "San Francisco", "San Francisco", "Oakland", "San Francisco", "San Francisco", "New York", "San Francisco", "San Francisco", "California"], "out_country": ["Costa Hawkins", "Costa Hawkins", "SF", "Costa Hawkins"], "in_state": ["California", "San Francisco", "California", "San Francisco", "San Francisco", "San Francisco", "California", "Berkeley", "San Francisco California", "California", "LA", "San Francisco", "Berkeley", "San Francisco California California California", "San Francisco", "San Francisco", "Oakland", "San Francisco", "San Francisco", "San Francisco", "San Francisco", "California"], "out_state": ["New York", "Costa Hawkins", "Costa Hawkins", "New York", "SF", "New York", "Costa Hawkins"]}]
