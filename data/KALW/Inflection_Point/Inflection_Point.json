World Service news\n\nWhen you think about diversity you think about how benefit people of color or marginalized people but you don't always think about how it will also benefit the majority organizational psychologist Dr Barbara Adams as there is transformational power for\nEveryone and diversity and increased if any [noise]\nWell in business we're all in competitive environments and the business case um gosh McKinsey and company has produced a few of them Credit Suisse has produced one catalyst\nHas produced them there's a number of them they're growing and they are without question strong and powerful than when you look at the numbers\nDiverse groups diversity seems different companies don't perform they out innovate day or more productive um many are more profitable than homogeneous ones\nAnd she would know Dr Adams has been helping companies\nI'm Lawrence Taylor and this is inflection point [noise]\nSpent a lot of my career and advertising and occupation let's just be honest that is dominated by white people when I hear ... talked about these workplaces who have shifted their culture or filter to be diverse in the beginning [noise] I have to wonder how\nMany untold perspective I've missed out on and when I was hiring how many people that I leave out of the considerations that because they just simply weren't on my immediate radar or in my social or career circle\nFor the recruiter I worked with told me that non white people just weren't raising their hands for a job in advertising [noise] it was the system we worked in [noise]\nAnd all of us are just trying to work the system to get ahead and bring our people along with\nWe're simply\nBiologically hard wired to prefer the company of people who are like us\nOr you know goes back to evolution evolutionary times were very tribal people\nSo white people do tend to congregate with white people and black people do tend to congregate with black people and so on and so forth um and women's groups or sometimes you know more fun when the guys aren't there [noise] I don't think there's anything bad about that we just need to recognize that that's how we're wired\nBecause once we realize this then we can begin to do the work to say OK so knowing the power of diversity and inclusion and knowing frankly how limited as to not have that\nHow can I developed curiosity about people who aren't like me\n[noise] so now that we know better\nAnd there is an entire field dedicated to increasing diversity and inclusion\nAnd we'll start to see change rate\nThe challenge and we're companies have gotten stuck and why people talk sometimes we'll diversity fatigue even heard this week gender fatigue oh we just talk about it so much and we're tired of this and just hire them because they haven't made that shift between here's the business case but would it take to actually achieve that\nGoes so far beyond these initiatives that sometimes in death by initiative because it's really about [noise] knowledge that nothing changes until beliefs in mind that change that's a really hard work\nAnd who wants to die by initiative [noise]\nThat brings me back to the theme of this season what is the point of all this empowerment if it doesn't truly lead to power\nWhy talk about diversity when reality just comes back and slapped him in the face [noise]\nAll of that is based on this Mitt the meritocracy that you know it it's going to go to the hardest worker and they're the people who are going to the to the smartest people blah blah blah but\nSince then there's a guy named Tom was headed crew at um one of the UCs um who studied it much more recently I'm up to the year two thousand\nAnd um he found that even if those conditions aren't met just by virtue of spending time with someone who's different from me give me a greater appreciation helps me to grow my curiosity about others so\nMuch just intuitively makes sense does it just it is it is somehow like\nAll the forces of our society\nSeems to be working against that [laughter] that like neighborhoods shift in color you know when one direction or the other so so you might might move into a diverse neighborhood but\nTen years later the whole the\nWhole thing has changed right that suddenly you're with people who ... you looked just like yeah\nYeah and what they found is that your ah the stereotypes you hold about different groups might not shift but the likeability factor still increases\nSay that one more time that the stereotypes you hold the boats certain groups may not shift but the likeability of them still improve\nSo you made a list in your book of people who are never questioned and those who are questioned regularly\nSo issues affecting diversity and equity and inclusion so racism accepted without question white people question with regularity non whites and people of color\nAnother issue sexism except it without question men question with regularity women and people who are gender neutral as well or gender fluid\nHomophobia except without question heterosexual people question with regularity lesbian gay bisexual transgender intersect\nOr religious oppression are accepted without question Protestants\nWhich with regularity Muslim Sikhs Jewish Catholic\nClasses um except it without question upper and middle class question with regularity lower and poor working class people\nElitist them a except without question college educated people question with regularity non college educated ah militarism are accepted without question will be called the good wars World War one world war two the Korean War question with regularity Vietnam the Gulf wars [noise]\nUm linguistic oppression ...\nSpeaker's question with regularity there really one of us\nThink you're going through that less because I I just feel like it highlights all the opportunities that we have to learn more about people that are not like us so\nThere's something interesting but I came across also in your book which is you said that being equal isn't the goal to strive for that valuing difference is mikel mhm and I\nThat kind of made me raise my eyebrows because I in my mind being equal is totally the goal so please explain what you mean an end in women for example are different we're never going to be equal\nExactly the same rate ... men are never going to be able to a birth children and breast feed and do all these great things that women can do so you know women are unlikely to be able to do develop the same level of physical strength on the whole as men have\nSo we are different and women are fuels more by estrogen men more by testosterone that's okay\nIt's really we get into trouble when we act like well you know we have to defer to the guys because they're the ones who run the organizations longest they know the most\nI don't know I don't know if we could say yeah but you know what he was a lot of things that don't work well in organizations and maybe if we had the female point of view more often\nMaybe if we maybe we could say you know we need to shift our mindset we're seeing this too much the same way you know we're the Fort white guys from Twitter or whatever then you know that's where it's the appreciation of difference and I think that that's where the value really lies and we can get past this\nYou know we're all trying to be same because we want to be the same it's those differences that really um make us also dynamic and so interesting\nAnd give us the opportunity to learn from one another and the challenge to within business environment I think we learned a few decades ago that you don't want to be surrounded by the yes men I think that doesn't really get you anywhere you really want people who are going to challenge\nAnd so people were different from you the once more likely to challenge you because they have different experiences and they've grown up in different environments and they've experienced life differently so it's those differences that really really matter I don't want to try to make them\nLike me I Want to figure out what else can I learn from them\n[noise] so like language it's so a more fast but this idea of being equal to you is the equivalent of being the same but\nWhere does this notion of the quality that we are striving for ... where does that fit into this came out I mean would you consider being equal a different thing from equality\nI think of it more in terms of achieving parity\n[noise] so you know if if a woman and a man do the same work then yes they should have equal pay so it's cheating parity I think that um we tend to give opportunities to certain people because we have gender bias sees about it so\nThey're still former women who become nurses and become teachers because we think of them that way you know they're soft skills and they are nice and that kind of stuff\nBut it really kind of who's us to think about it differently because that's where the opportunities come in\nAnd I've known many male nurses and they do a great job as well so parity should they be compensated equally absolutely the benefits equal absolutely you know are they exactly the same in their approach probably not\nBut that's okay [noise] so it's going back to what you're ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n... excuses excuses excuses if you look at the data they are everywhere but again it's the shift from well\nWhat do you mean they're not there so this comes up in healthcare comes up in um academia as well\nAnd it helps companies to to look at where we hiring from oh so that's why we're so limited because we just want the cheer one schools you know we want the people who want we want the five black candidates who went to Harvard\nWell you know there are a phenomenal candidates who went to Morehouse and he'd look there and there are lots of an ... in the book I said a couple of examples I mean I don't think a lot of people do that you know a Tim Cook was a graduate of Auburn University\nLaw school but no it's not a phenomenal school um he seems to have succeeded pretty darn well there are many examples like that so it's a mindset shift\nWhere we have to say you know great talent exist in lots of places we aren't yet trained in school for how to look for it there but we could do that we could try different things\nYeah this pipeline theory is very ... [laughter] they're just not there there are a lot I guess my point being there's there are a lot of organizations I'm working to fill the pipeline so the\nUnbelievable rise in girls only stem camps engineering training and ... and\nYou know science exploration of just like so much focus and and you know there's girls who code there's and there's cutting for a you know people have color there's like there's all these focuses on on different groups of people who would typically be marginalized especially in technology um\nAre you and it's been going on for years now so are you aware of any impact that that has had in making a difference\nSadly know why because the mindset is in there and because the hidden bias he still exist at when folks come in\nYou know we say we're fair we're open and all that but if I have a hidden biases that associates\nMen with technology and I really got some work to do to get past that and you know if I Want to go with the guy who makes me more comfortable and you know I can shoot the breeze with and have a beer and all that\nThen no one's telling me not to think companies need to make them more intentional focus\nBut you can't just mandate numbers that doesn't work it still comes back to\nDo I have an environment in the workforce that really helps people to feel like they belong like ... you know I Would say you need to let people know we want you here what's it going to take to get you hear\nNo you are really valuable to us and we want to help you succeed and here are the things we can do to to help new folks coming in to to really succeed here\nYou know here's a person you can go to if they're issues you know those kinds of things it's really um it's a multi faceted challenge but it can be done but I was thrilled to a year or so ago I went to um but ... twenty twenty conference\nAnd um the c._e._o. of Intel's stood up on the stage in front of hundreds of people and said I'm here to say there is no pipeline problem\nI have learned that I understand that and I don't want to hear it from any of you [noise]\nAnd it was like wow so I thought great you know we're starting to have an impact\nBut not everyone thinks this way yet and as a result it's going to be a really slow slog\nSo that when you at this ... yes but they're not going to be OK already more women than men who are going to medical school there are more women than men who are attending law school\nUm and competitions going to try this because these diverse firms are going to perform the others I mean I Know a lot of people think oh you know Google my God you know who they are just so successful to sue amazing they do this they do that well the truth is\nThey make Ninety five percent of their revenue by ads generating ad so as ad blockers become better as there are ... there was a growing number of search engines that protect your privacy people are migrating to those more often\nAnd you know quantum computing is coming up you know Google could be irrelevant tomorrow\nYou know we if we look back and we say oh we used to have standard oil right we used to have these big behemoth companies well how many of them still here but the truth is that it's less than four percent of organizations who lived to be a hundred I says calling people write most companies don't make it that long it's very rare\nSo that you know disruptions will come from places where we can't even imagine it right now but we know that diverse teams out perform others they know that too that's why they worry about it because they you know right now they don't have a culture that's welcoming enough to really shift that\nSo you know I I'm I'm reticent to to um to say just because you make a lot of money you\nKnow that's one measure of success there are many others\nBut when one of the other objections that I have heard\nAround hiring women is that they need to go and you know perpetuate the human race though they're more likely to take time off and we're going to have your family leave and there\nYou know there's more biological issues associated with you know being a woman ... so um what are what are some of the solved to get past that because that I mean I obviously that's ridiculous [laughter] um and it's not just women raising children it's just that we happen to be the ones that have to bear them so last night at the heritage\nRight um main could also have parental leave just a women take maternity leave but I also then comes back to that whole mindset shift where we say we need you we want you what can we do to support you [noise]\nSo a lot of companies say ... especially a lot of the tech firms in Francisco ... you know free food right you know ... free dry cleaning onsite medical care you know it's like we never want you to leave\nBut is that healthy work environment no study upon study upon studies as it is not it's an American cultural no false belief but it's really not accurate\nSo if instead of um you know all the free food and the cafeterias we said we're going to allocate you know whatever some percentage of that too on site childcare\nBecause we think that will really be helpful oh and then whether it's mom or dad they can go visit their kid was right there and we can afford to find these kinds of services so there are\nNo small incremental things that can have a huge affect positively for people's lives but there needs to be the political will to do it\nOn and what about within Oregon organizations there are women's leadership groups and groups that are specifically for women I Would assume to the exclusion of men ...\nDo you encourage those I mean what about like all these lean in circles and things of that nature I\nGo I used to belong to one of those groups um when I worked at Kaiser Permanente um they didn't intentionally exclude men the guys could come they generally didn't and it was really about helping 'em folks who or at the you know mid to lower", "year": "2018",

yourself\nTo be able to to provide your child child care um it's not until you tell that story that someone might see themselves in it and then they connect with you on a on a much deeper level um and

right it's my job as a researcher to make sure that that any story that we're telling is actually accurate because we have to if we're asking our voters are supporters to invest in us we have to trust

democratic women get elected for office\nWell this is I mean this is really I feel like the crux of the issue for women and politics and and\nPretty much every other industry that we participate in and and and relationships and so on is that we are assigned a certain set of characteristics that we need to\nBrain we get ... for it\nAnd yet when not every not every woman is is the same as the next to him and just like not every man is the same as the next man\nI mean you're you're in the field of promoting women candidates specifically pro choice democratic women candidates but\nHow do you feel about defining women as having certain characteristics like you know we've been touted as being more collaborative and that's better for a working across the aisle or being better listeners you know same result in politics yeah men like what are your thoughts on great point\nAnd it's a great question I think one that that you know\nI'm as we're seeing I think more and more women come together um in twenty Seventeen you know millions of women both Democrats and Republicans I think marched on January twenty first\nI think we're seeing Republican and women um members of Congress come together over um you know saving healthcare reform\nYou know we saw Senator Susan Collins Republican from Maine and Senator Lisa Murkowski and independent from Alaska um vote with the Democrats and all the Democratic women senators to save health care reform so I think we are seeing these moments of um\nGreat unity at the same time I think your point about some of these qualities are characteristics that that people talk about with women especially women leaders um I think there's a fine there's a slippery slope between being a central is\nAnd equating that all women are collaborative or is that all women are better listeners or um that all women\nUm want to work across the aisle I I\nI think we can find ourselves\nIn a space where we forget that all women are not the same or to your point and I think I'm reminded of that whenever someone asked me why does emily's list only support democratic women are we support democratic women because we know that those are the women who are going to stand up for women and families time and time again\nThose democratic women who are more likely\nTo um whether it's on abortion rights or on health care or it's on the environment or criminal justice reform\nUm it is democratic women who are going to be the the champions for women and families I'm In support women and families that have returned um I think\nAn essential his argument negates women's ability to be individuals and to have specificity\nUm and I think when we do that we fall into some some dangerous trap\nYeah and I actually just even\nThe most recent election there\nWas concern I was concerned actually that one of the\nCollateral implications if you will if Hillary Clinton had been elected president was that there would actually be a backlash\nAgainst women and\nAll the games that we have made to date [laughter] and it turns out they were having like this other weird reverse pendulum effect where Trump was elected\nAnd now\nAll these women are coming out seemingly of the woodwork to stand up for\nWomen's rights and\nWould positively affect women and get the people who are\nMost in leadership right now are not necessarily on that side says this is interesting\nI don't know equilibrium ... equilibrium as a result of of the election to something that was completely unexpected I think\nYou're exactly right that we are seeing a feeling like a pendulum shift back the other direction\nBut I think a lotta millennial women are in the same boat as me and it wasn't until you know frankly Hillary\nAs a candidate started talking about it is\nIt's not like those feelings you know between\nOf Donald Trump or or men or women for example I hadn't been out there for a long time but I feel like through the election and through his inauguration and into this year of his first year in the White House I think\nRight we are seeing and a a real nice to\nBoth the Republican Party's longstanding\nRecord of policies that hurt women and undermine our value um but you're also seeing a man in the White House who I don't think respects women are and who is I think actively even from his first week I'm surrounded himself with with men as the undead\nPolicy after policy that um\nWas put in place to help women\nSo you were born in the eighties I've got two daughters who are born in the two thousands their experience there they're [laughter] they're being ... if you will is I'm like I feel like\nThat's all we talk about in my house is what's going on in the political environment because we have the radio on all the time and they're you know they're seeing the headlines in the newspaper which we still getting print at home and it's kind of unavoidable to\nTalk about what's going on in the world so I feel like they're they're probably like there are so well now they're probably gonna want to like go to sleep when they become your [laughter] your tires [laughter]\nUm but but for you you were talking about growing up in the eighties and feeling sort of like it wasn't really something that was top of mind for you until you had this you know sort of awakening and I was wondering if you could just\nHow that came to be for you\nSure [noise] um so politics is not a\nTopic of discussion in my my household voting was a very personal decision in my household I mean I I think I asked my parents went to they voted for and they didn't tell me which I was like\nI didn't quite understand but I knew that meant that it was private\nUm and so then the conversation about politics was private [noise] it wasn't actually until college\nUm when I was home from school\nAnd um\nI was riding in a car with my dad in Columbus ohio and there was a car in front of us have had a bumper sticker for um George Bush\nAnd I remember remarking to my father oh George Bush who would vote for him and my dad kind of just quietly turned to me and said maybe I Would and it wasn't until that moment you know in my twenty first year probably that\nThat I knew my dad might be a Republican\nAnd you know the interesting thing about I think my kind of evolution into a very political life on a very feminist life and I'm very active it's life has been also seeing the evolution of our political dialogue within our family um you know learning that my\nMy dad um uh has supported Republicans in the past and my mom has voted independent has been an interesting\nShe's a conversation you know it comes up with Thanksgiving sometimes when it comes up in other ways to\nFeels when he tried on for the first time\nHe's eventually what you're going to want to do is address starting to tell more and more people\nThinking about running or you want to get their input or advice I'm\nAlso you want to start building out a list of those people keeping a goal of of um supporters and allies um so the eventually when you do run you have a place to start you have names and emails and phone numbers of people that you can call to for support for money for you know just\nHaving a a team at your disposal and ultimately voters that you're back which is really really important and the last thing I Will say is you know if you're thinking about running for office\nJust run [laughter] just run you know we talk a lot about training and there are some really great training programs out there including the one like emily's list like I described but if you're ready to go we never want to make training\nA barrier there are too many barriers and in the face of women who want to run\nAnd so by no means do you have to go out and do every single training um that's out there for women candidates because of the men are not waiting the men are not asking to get trained and so if you're ready to go run and run often\nUm seventies your act the president of emily's list has a fantastic quotes that that accent exactly that that that you will run and you could lose but that last could lead to another opportunity and another campaign so the more that we get women out there running in places where they could be successful or at least get their name out there and a way that matters\nTo people um I think it is a good step towards our goals\n[noise] this is infection points I'm Lauren Schiller my guest is Kate black the chief of staff and emily's list will be back right after a break\nOn again and Eugene Jones and\nYoung this ... this is Michael mush joined me for a fascinating rhythm and blues gospel\nAnd um [noise] um and um and and\n[laughter] [noise]\nHours of French cultural metal more fix beyond category music radio on tangents didn't ask me is that it's a classic progressive reform radio embracing creative jazz hybrid rich Americana and music from all over the world\nThat tension so Ninety One point seven your local public radio Saturdays due to midnight [noise]\nI'm Lawrence Taylor and this is inflection point I'm Talking with Kate black the chiefs of staff at emily's list an organization that helps pro choice democratic women get elected for office\nTo catch this as a podcast and catch up on all the other fascinating women I stick with an inflection point just search for inflection point and I tunes radio public or wherever you get your podcasts\nIt's so interesting it sounds like these could be the same steps anyone would take if they were\nWanting to start their own business or be an entrepreneur of some kind\nOf [laughter] I'm I'm thinking about running for office\nOr building a campaign so to speak is a campaign is a is a small business that you're building\nIt has an end date on election day um but you will raise millions of dollars you will hire staff you will um advocate for a product being you um you know in some ways it does mirror\nA a lot of pieces of a building a small business\nDo you think that the personality type that is suited to doing that\nIs different from the personality type that is suited to now you've been elected and now welcome to the bureaucracy which is a totally different mindset and there's all these other you know a constraints in places that aren't there when you're doing your own thing\nYou know I've seen I've seen women run for office who would\nCall themselves in the river and\nThey are tremendously successful\nUm both on the campaign trail and when they're leading and writing policy I've seen women run who\nAre I have never been afraid to speak in public\nAnd and then once it gets office there they're\nUm I don't think there's a ... a personality for a candidate that works one way or the other to be Frank I think\nI think I've seen women bring their own brand of leadership to a variety of different campaigns and and I've seen them be successful and I think that's a good thing especially for you know a former shy girl like me\nUh it's comforting to know that I can I can watch other women who say that they're introvert and instill you know kick a lot of but up and down the ballot\n[laughter] I mean I realize there are a multitude of positions a person can run for but does does one typically have to leave their day jobs in order to do it\nYou know that's one of the questions we get a lot um and it kind of goes into the barriers which I'm happy to kind of touch on a little bit younger than I Am so\nWe knew we get that question I think that question comes from a couple of different things one is the financial security\nThat often women are responsible for for their family right now women are the solar co breadwinners in over two thirds of American households\nWe're also the majority of minimum wage earners in this country so I say both of those two facts because they think it paints a pretty stark picture\nWhenever you're asking than a woman to run for office with a real understanding that or they just described that's like starting a small business um so do they have to quit their day jobs in order to do that\nYou know the reality is every job every position that you might want to run for might require you to take different amounts of time off right a city council\nMay not require you to take a you know quit your job or go on leave in fact you might be able to negotiate working part time or having flex ours um but running for office let's say for the United States Senate\nWill require a large amount of your time\nI mean that's just you know I don't want to hide the ball there but it's important to understand the time needs of different types of campaigns there are over five hundred thousand officers that you can run for in this country a lot of those people most people don't know right you can run for\nAnd some counties they have something like a special district or the fire\nMarshal is an elected position um you can run for sheriff you could run for um controller you could run for city clerk you could run for I mean I could go on and on the point that I'm making here is that it once you understand the position you want to run for\nThen it's time to have a conversation with your employer I'm with the support of your family and you're probably you know political advisors or team don't understand a little bit about the time that's going to take you know one of the things the other barriers that we've seen that I'm certainly can hold women back\nFrom running is the financial barrier\nBoth in terms of you know not being able to possibly leave a job because they need to run for office or frankly because women get paid less for doing the same work so we have less money um and we also have less access to the financial networks that men have typically had easy access\nTo 'em and so you can undermine the financial\nBarrier that is in front of women and frankly is one of the key reasons at emily's list was was created in the first place was to\nBuild that that early money that initial angel investment that Kickstarter campaign that women candidates need 'em to help them really start to build out a solid political um campaign ... and this will be a great time for me to ask you to explain the name\n... happy to do it [laughter]\nI said I Love it [laughter] emily's list is an acronym it stands for early money is like east\nThat is the the the foundation of emily's list we started in Nineteen eighty five when no\nWoman had ever been elected to the Senate in her own right\nSo in your history of of\nOn behalf of women has there\nBeen a moment where something that you've turned up or understood or been able to get together a narrative that has created a turning point\nFor that person that might not otherwise have happened\nYou know so much of my job is\nPrivate and personal\nI think what I what I Will tell you is\nHave had women candidates\nWho I sat down with and coached and talk to about about their personal stories and one of the questions I always ask is um you know what keeps you up at night\nIs a piece of information that that you are worried about or um uneasy about and once I Know that we can help solve it and\nYou'd be surprised and also not surprised by what comes out in the conversation you know it is sometimes\nSomething small like I've gotten a lot of traffic ticket [laughter] um and and can someone find those answers yes those are probably public [laughter] um\nBut sometimes it's um you know I had a really messy divorce and I'm I'm worried about those records being public or I was late paying my um

twenty minutes south of both Minneapolis and St Paul\nI'm Lawrence Taylor and this is inflection point stories of how women rise up the first thing you need to know about Aaron is that she's the only person to flip the Republicans\nNeed new in the ... election [noise]\nI I have always been a person you a question not\nJust the way things are about why things are the way that they are a lot of times when you ask someone why do we do this this way the answer is often a we'll always done it this way and I'm a person who likes to question why do they do it this way and politics is a great place to get back to the root\nOf why we do things the way that we do [noise]\nI should mention that this is uh\nBecause I've done for this show not a single one has been with a politician as one woman on Twitter set upon hearing about this interview that's so nice I don't remember what it's like to have respect\nFor a politician [noise] well there are a few out there who are doing the job we sent them to do and I'm hoping this conversation will help us all remember what it's like to have respect for a politician\nAs more women run for office than ever before I thought it was time to give credit to women who are already in office and to hear what they're really up again\nHow empowering it is to run for office and what kind of how are you really have when you win\nHand what stands on the way of votes\nWhich brings us back to Aaron may quit specifically and her first run for office\nTruthfully most people were like well she's not going to win and because I was running against an eight year Tea Party conservative she had taken the seat from a Democrat and had won by wide margins for the previous for cycles and so I think people just thought art crazy go ahead and have fun and let's see what you can do [laughter]\nSo right away when I started to run you know people have a lot of advice for you when you start running so I'm biracial my dad as black my mom was white [noise] um I'm gay and clear and I'm young millennial I'm thirty two and to be quite Frank with you I'm\nVery short I'm five two and I tend to have more of a baby face so I don't look thirty two I probably look more like twenty five\nI'm and I'm progressive I've never had not I've always been progressive and so when I started to run people gave me advice like on don't talk about being gay had a professional relationship with your wife in public which I really don't know what that means\nIt's clear the air and had to tear down some expectations about what it would take to win this written\nAnd along the way another thing creep day and I use the word greed deliberately\nWhile she was running for office and after she was elected\nAaron had her own need to moment but we'll get to that later [noise]\nWhen I was I was Fifteen when nine eleven happened and I remember shortly after we're going to war in Iraq I had so many questions for adults because I didn't understand why we're we're going to war with the country over the actions of a group that may or may not be in this country\nAnd I would ask really basic questions and they would always say like you'll understand when you're older or don't ask questions like that instead of answering my question\nAnd it was at that time and I realized asking basic questions shouldn't throw people off they should have a very quick and basic answer for that and so at that time I realized that maybe they're not asking those kinds of questions and someone should be asking those questions and so that's when I started thinking\nUm you know don't be progressive you should moderate yourself and you know I never did any of those things that that was the overwhelming advice of most people\nAnd the difference for me and so this was probably the good part is that this is a community I was born and raised and my parents moved\nTo the community I represent in Nineteen eighty two they had their wedding reception at the local community center they have lived their their whole lives we were raised there so these are people that I Know these are my teacher is these are my pastor is these are my fellow churchgoers these are my friends are my friends' parents\nAnd so when I Would get this bad advice from people who didn't live in my community and be like oh okay sure\nAnd then I Would know in my heart and my gut that that's not what the people of my community once I never wanted to run a race where I was trying to run towards some missile logical middle I'm In order to be elected I wanted to tell the truth about what I believed in and what I think that we should do\nAs a state legislature in terms of policy and where I thought we were at as a community and if people were on board than they would vote for me and if they weren't than they wouldn't but I never wanted to win by pretending to be someone that I'm not to be so\nI really enjoy talking to my community and learning kind of some of the more interesting issues that I hadn't been aware of beforehand\nThat's so interesting so I mean can you tell me more about who they you know there's been handed to somebody they are I mean is it the sort of I don't know for lack of better the establishment you know other people who are already in politics or who who is giving you this advice to kind of cover up who your authentic self really is you know it could\nSo like you know I've worked in politics for very long time so my friends tend to run in political circles so it could be offhand\nRemarks and advice from a friend or from a Senate district chair\nOr from an organization that was thinking of endorsing me or going to endorse me and it was never said as um we don't believe in you know maybe if you do this we will it was we really believe in you and think you will be a great voice of legislature we want you to win\nAnd we just don't know if if those folks in your community will vote for you if you tell the truth about how you feel about X Y and Z\nAnd I proved the opposite I told the truth about every single thing I believed in and I think more than anything what I have found is that people respect the fact that even if they don't agree with me on the issue they know exactly where I stand\nWhich means every time an issue comes up that maybe we didn't get the chance to talk about during the election they trust my judgment and they trust I'm where I'm at on the issue because they know where I Am at that issue and that's um something I always tell folks is that people very rarely vote for you\nBecause of the policy positions\nWhy we kinda see some of these swing districts here in Minnesota\nIt's so interesting and I mean in many ways and and and particularly I'm thinking of ... in this way of\nThis old I'm going to call it old school because I'd like to be old school thinking of how to work within the current system when we know that the current system is broken [laughter] you know sadly against women generally and people of color and\nUm and your bravery really of just saying like this is I'm not working for me and I'm not going to discover of the things that I that I Am and and believe and I'm going to\nTry and change things by being who I Am even if that's not what the system typically elevates\nAnd I think it's it's not working for other people either you know up until being elected I was kind of adjust citizen right and I knew that it wasn't working for me either and so I have this deep\nLove and reverence for our democracy and for our constitution and the way that our government is set up\nBut it is set up based on truth telling and it's based on us really being in\nCommunity with an in conversation with the people that we seek to represent and I think we moved away from that\nTowards you know can talking points and pulled tested language\nAnd uh trying to find again that mythological middle on to appeal to the widest number of folks and I always say that if you if you try to run to the middle and everything you lose everyone on both sides ... and so people actually want to know where their elected representatives stand even if they don't agree with them\nThey want to have access to those representatives to share thoughts concerns ... names\nUm even if it's hard right we have folks here in Minnesota and across the nation that won't hold town halls or they'll have selective town halls where there's tickets and you got to show your ID I have coffee and conversations during session every weekend and out of session every month and then I have town halls quarterly\nAnd they're open to everybody because it's really really important that we do not stop listening to the people that we seek to represent because it's hard like people might yell at you oh well they're yelling at you about something that's a tough in their life or that they need you to hear because\nWe're doing the work for the people and if we don't talk to the people don't we're not doing the work\nWell what in what was your experience and what has your experience been in this age of social media with people who are yelling at you on the Internet trolling really\nYeah I'm so I thought well there's a few things so I'm science has shown that trolls um tend to get discouraged when you respond to everyone else except them and so I use a tried and true method of positive reinforcement there are\nPeople who started on my Facebook page or on Twitter as people who are there to ...\nBut when they would say like oh I'm interested in that I Would respond and be like that's great tell me more and so through positive reinforcement um they're not trolls they're just people who are constituents that comment on things now do I love every comment now\nBut it's gotten to a respectful place where I don't have to hide it and I don't have to ban people from the page and said on Twitter and I do like to interact with people and have thoughtful and intentional dialogue I think that social media is a place where we can have tough conversations about some things not all things and not super nuanced conversations\nBut so you know the trolling\nIt's not particularly bad once you learn how to use the meat function and meet some words and then actually engage with folks that disagree with you in a respectful manner\n[noise] did did you experience any trolling that would be essentially considered hate speech yes I did I mean\nMy opponent and twenty sixteen I'm was endorsed immediately after giving a speech are saying you know just starting my marriage and my ethnicity um and you know I was called a dyke um I was you know I've had some racist terms lobbed at me\nFor being biracial and not particularly dark but yeah that does happen and I think more than anything I feel pity for those folks to carry that amount of rage and anger and that very limited worldview around more than anything else and so I Try to approach it from aspect of\nCompassion more so than being angry or like taking it very personally as if it's some sort of relevant attack on my character did did you have to work to get to that place you know honestly working for um President Obama and then working for Congressman Keith Ellison yeah you see the worst things\nUm and so you you get to that place when you see enough\nTimes really terrible things you know I I'm colleagues Ilhan Omar or we were elected in the same term and so seeing that the type of abuse and hate lobbed at her um is ... like what is a lot and he is nothing compared to that and so getting to that place I think a little bit of is it just being thirty two years old and being like that's not going to be a thing that shake my whole day\nUm but yeah it took a little bit of time to not be super\nOr hurts and offended or scared honestly 'cause again being a anti gun violence a person you know you\nKind of get some of them are scary dangerous um folks and the other side of that that issue is also scared I think is probably the biggest one that had to work to get in a good place for me\nThat's ... that's exactly what I was thinking about is and yeah I had a had a temper that fear with you know being safe on at the same time yeah\nIt's ... I Try I trust people I have a\nDeep and anti biting belief in humanity that's where that theology comes in\nAnd [noise]\nUm\n\nI'm Lauren Shiller indices inflection point my guest in Minnesota state representative Erin make weight [noise]\nAnd even if you haven't been following Minnesota politics the name\nIlhan Omar bring about she rose from living in a refugee camp for four years after fleeing Somalia to becoming the first Somali American to win a seat in the Minnesota house [noise] for those of us playing along on the ... there's a lot of rising up happening is fly overseas and and we should be paying attention [noise] unfortunately\nRising up stories universally involves someone to rise up again\nEnded Erin's case that someone came in the form and the fellow elected official [noise]\nMake that to someone in\nThere and once you got to office\nWasn't anything like you expected it would be\nNo not at all I don't think anyone can prepare you for elected office um a lot of it is like college a particularly at the first few weeks you know you have committee Monday Wednesday friday from eight Fifteen to ten Fifteen you know you have your office here you have meetings you have to write\nUm brief or read brief or write emails back and take meetings I you're learning a lot in a short amount of time you're switching topics really fast um I think when I started to run\nOne thing I didn't fully grasp was that people\nCome to me or look to social media or look to what I'm doing in the lens of you are a state representative or you're going to be a state representative\nText messages to which was helpful in kind of quote unquote proving that this was going on\n[noise] so in the end Cornish and shown both resigned right I mean is that is that the only I forgive forgive my everyday on how this works but can they be fired or do they have to resign so\nA numbers can be expelled by the legislature but it takes an insanely high threshold and that's certainly wouldn't happen I don't I mean it might have in the Senate to be perfectly honest with you but it certainly wasn't going to happen in the house the reason representative Cornish resigned as it was part of his settlement\nWith the um assaults lawsuit with the lobby is that he assaulted\nGot it and then showing resigned and what what gotten him to resign\nUm I Want to give credit to both the chair of our party and the majority and minority leader in the Senate for both calling for him to resign I was very nervous that when I spoke out\nUm they would not say anything or you know maybe defend him and they were very quick with saying this is not OK and he should resign even though we you know we had a\nA one state minority in the state Senate and so that opened up a special election which could have put us further into the minority and um they were very quick and saying this is not OK and he should resign which I appreciate so I think that had a big and he's also a police officer and so I think\nNot dragging it out um and being able to keep the job he had outside of the legislature was important to him as well\n... what was the seat eventually filled by another Democrat yes a woman oh right she's great yeah senator big I'm OK welcome senator big um so as a result of your um coming forward about the harassment with these two guys what else changed\nFor better or worse as as a result of coming forward for you\nI was blacklisted by the speaker gave instructions to his caucus to not talk to me don't laugh with me don't go to her office she's not your friend [noise] um and so it was\nI mean next to impossible to get 'em Republicans to co signed on to bills with me um I had a lot of especially female colleagues that were Republicans that will come to me um to be their number two on bills that they knew I was interested in not stopped um\nKnow settled digs are like little comments here or there uh we had to go through a mandatory sexual harassment training on our second day back the following session after um I have come forward\nAnd that training itself was pretty awful it kind of blame to those who didn't say stop and stopped doing that as the ones who are perpetuating sexual harassment it's really on the\nThe victims to to say stop and if they don't kind of their fault 'em and so it was really hard to sit in a room with and it was mandatory that we were there so sitting with all one hundred and thirty four of your colleagues and they know why they're there are and to have that be the training was was pretty hard\nUm but on the flip side of that you know there were women who felt more comfortable sharing their stories about what happened at the legislature um we started looking at a process for reporting for sexual harassment so for independent contractors the media\nLobbyists because they don't have an avenue to report sexual harassment and looking at what consequences actually look like that started so you know it was a little bit of plus minus they're more minus and plus but it was worth coming forward\n[noise] yeah I I I read something about that training and there was another representative who I'm going to read what she said about it um it was that there was a slide in their presentation that said the most horrifying thing would be to be accused of being a harasser\nMhm and then her response it was\nActually the most horrifying thing is to be assaulted\nAt the site of ... actually said like luck careers ruined lives destroyed and families in tatters or something like that [laughter] as overly not them as a result of arresting people exactly yeah\nUh it was a is and it was given by someone who is actually I'm a defense attorney for people who have been accused of sexual harassment in the workplace so maybe that's where that came\nOut I was your perspective right there that's [laughter]\nThat's yeah different lens to put on things [laughter] yeah um it seems like the training thing is something that is just\nNot really considered all that effective and you get these these [laughter] like screwed up perspectives around who's to blame for the behavior of the harasser what'd you what do you think are the things that are the most effective in terms of putting an end\nTo sexual harassment in the workplace\nSo my one line of advice for every one is do not approach non sexual relationships and a sexual manner it's a very easy thing to do most of us do it every single day [noise]\nUm but I think you know real consequences for sexual harassment and um that kind of behavior in the workplace that is probably one of the best deterrence of it because so often when that happens it's just a joke and you take it too seriously and lighten up than there is no consequences for that behavior so setting cultures and tones where\nThat behavior is not accepted that is the um outlier and that person who was behaving that way is the one who is\nNot sitting in and set of the other way around\nThose are the types of things and I think more than anything um you know every industry has different every workplaces different but if someone who runs a workplace where manages the workplace is really keen on getting to the root cause like take the temperature of the folks that work for you\nBecause they were probably the best equipped to tell you what are the problems and how can we best address them and it goes back to this\nUm idea that if you talk to the people who are most impacted and then listen\nOr you're more likely to have effective results that is true for policy and it's certainly true for a sexual harassment\n[noise] okay so you think things did change again for you though you you were asked to run for lieutenant governor mhm in in the towards the end of your\nTerm right so Aaron Murphy and you\nTo women [laughter] women to Aaron Aaron's to women I mean\nOh wow okay so what I mean I'm I'm curious about a couple of things um ... when I Am curious what role did the\nThe coming forward about the sexual harassment play in her decision to choose you\nYou know I think more than that um I did a sit in on the house floor for twenty four hours um because we have not moved gun violence prevention measures to our house\nUm or through the legislature at all despite you know students rallying and walking out of their classrooms and the number of organized events that had happened certainly before Parkland but absolutely after Parkland\nAnd I was frustrated and I know that everyone who was outside of the capital was frustrated as well and so I did that sit in and\nUm it was it was hard on you know physically as to sit down and be awake for twenty four hours hard but certainly it was in our caucus that wasn't widely loved and celebrated not everyone was very excited that I was doing it\nAnd I think that was a saying that she looked at to say you know you did the right thing even though it was hard even though you've got pushback from your colleagues even though I'm\nYou know it was the right thing to do even though it wasn't the easy thing to do um the sexual harassment peace I think\nWas more that I was willing to do the right thing even want it dealt with people in our own party and even at when that dealt with people who had more power in our own party and so when you're looking at governing state um and lieutenant governor his state or having someone who stepped in for you she wanted someone who could\nContinue the agenda that we had laid for us for Minnesotans if something had happened to her she didn't want someone to balance her out she wanted someone that would continue are very ambitious agenda and she saw me as that person so that was part of the the calculus or with someone who is bold brave and unapologetic about what we believe in and why we believe it\nAnd was it unusual to have a two women ticket for a governor and lieutenant governor have you seen this before we were\nYou were the first all female ticket um endorsed by a major party in the state of Minnesota in a in history\nMhm I'm not common not common how did that play out in terms of your campaign to do you did you play that up did you play that down where where what what was it function\nIf any its function well I mean we didn't\nNot played chew it it was important it was a historic ticket for a number of reasons um it works against us in number of ways because in the same way you know we've seen with female politicians\nYou know for time an eternity the question of quote unquote electability always comes in and it was only brought in in terms of us um you know we are both from what we call the metro so in Minnesota we have eighty seven counties we have seven counties that are\nUm that hold about fifty five sixty percent of the population and then the other eighty have the rest and so they call that the metro and so it was a metro centric ticket it wasn't balanced geographically um and so it was about are they elected will will voters vote for two women or two women from the metro\nUm and it was kind of used as this whole can people really get over this thing [noise] um and so we on our campaign talked about the politics of joy right 'cause there's fear built into that narrative of can't a woman when we've never had a female governor in Minnesota our constitution still says\nHe shall he will he appoints when it talks about the governor of Minnesota um and so I think that that fear can play a huge role um when it comes to female politicians and can they really and will people really\nAnd when we talk about electability right the thing that makes him unelectable is that people elect them that's at our president proves that\nUm but it did play a role in both\nWhy we were excited to run and then also why
