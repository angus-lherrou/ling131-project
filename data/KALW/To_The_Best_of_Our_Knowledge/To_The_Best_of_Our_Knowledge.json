group of people who think just the opposite that one of the biggest problems in America is it that are under attack literally Alexandra hall has our story which begins with a Wisconsin police report\nOh [noise]\nThis is protective Homer tells cucumbers two thousand seven came [noise] [noise] ah interview with various\nDiseases may two dozen Seventeen Thaddeus food is meeting up with a

has become not routine but not unexpected either ... Alexander Hall is an investigative reporter and she first heard the story when she was working on a pro public art project called documenting hate\n[laughter] we're looking for hate groups in Wisconsin my boss told me about the story the headline was Madison\nPolice investigating possible ambush of proud boy by anti fascist and I thought were the Proud Boys\nSo she investigated and has up to parents the story is not appropriate for children oh\n\nThe Proud Boys are a fraternal organization that's how they described themselves they're a men's drinking club\n[noise]\nWe politically if you've had to nail is on the spectrum I Would say Ninety five percent of his land on the new right they're socially liberal\nFiscally conservative they don't really care if you're gay or anything like that but they think the tradition has some value in this been you know we've thrown off the baby with the bathwater quite literally and uh you know even when they're letting their ovaries dry up for some stupid career and blogging [noise] how old are you\nTwenty nine\nOh so you you're right there you're going to stop dating comedians and musicians and start thinking seriously about your mate\n[noise] it seems like he makes a giant right turn right there he's talking about libertarian politics and suddenly he's asking you whether you're planning on having babies I think that's kind of his and now\nLike feminism is obsolete\nIt definitely had a place women needed to vote somebody needed to drive but the pendulum has swung way past that so I Would say feminism was done and maybe Nineteen Seventy nine and since then it's just been woman inventing problems in lying\nLike saying one in four women will be sexually assaulted or raped in college are saying that women earn less than men\nDo you think that those statistics about sexual assault and the wage gap is just that it's not true\nWell I don't think you've looked it up if you think they are\nAnd that makes me think why do you care which makes me think you don't care which makes me think you need to find a man you need to focus on creating an shaping lives because you don't sound like that tiny percentage that we'd better off in the workforce I think you'd make a great mom you're clearly curious\nI don't even know what to say about that [laughter] what did you think\nI thought it was a distraction I thought it was strange that he was making it personal want to be curious about the quality of the schools your kids are right\nIf you look on line I feel like a lot of the Proud Boys blog posts that they write are pretty as fences scene borderline angry\nAt women yeah don't you think about feminine and\nI just think it's [noise]\nIt's taken so much away from the traditional family\nThat is kind of contributed to the degradation of\nThe American family as a whole in\nSeeming to be anti [noise]\nKnow they always had these mean\nWent in on the right women on the left and the women on the writer like platinum blonde mad guy hat super sexy look in twenty something year old girl\nAnd then on the last this overweight woman with green hair all had it up with like AT T shirt and it says which would you prefer basically it's kind of like you are you would\n[noise] men and women are Cynthia logically created different\nBecause of their physiological bio chemical makeup\nMen and women are predisposed to gravitate towards different fields\nYou think that's I think I Do think that's the case absolutely to the field or health\nCare for one I think nursing for one that that's one teachers early childhood education and\nEngineering fields math fields\nAre you saying that like men are better than no no\nMy little sisters of biomedical engineer she's great\nI have a lot of ideas about where women would be happy as\nAt home versus in the workplace\nHow's lies are looked down upon\nLike they're not doing enough when\nReally they are shaping live\nAnd what do you think about women [noise]\nThey were very cautious about hey if you don't want to be a housewife cool with us for the housewives you want to be housewives don't look down on it personally\nLove the idea of my wife's the reason why I Love that\nIf I have to be at work in the late at work or somebody there that he can little Timmy to baseball practice or picking Sarah from soccer practice in certain people have\nAttempted to make them feel bad for them and we're doing we're entering the house like not is on a pedestal now that is the scene there is being a doctor my wife was a doctor my wife is a house with\nThe they're to me\nAs far as stature is concerned they have the same way\nToo much of this conversation seems curiously nostalgic you know like ... for the day is when mom stayed home with kids and dad's had\nJobs that they could count on\nYeah it is interesting um you know I don't know how many of the Proud Boys actually believe all of that\n... is a whole nother thing he's sane I Believe Ninety five percent of women would be happier at home you need to go home\nWe want women to be happier we weren't guys just stopped ignoring them in masturbating to porn we want guys to stop treating them like a colossal me back for someone else's you Jackie late you know the feminist mentality bodes very well for guys who just want to screw women and then dumped them when they become thirty five\nI think if women have their head screwed on properly they realize that it's these so called sexist who have their best interest in mind we don't want them dumped we don't want them given the milk away for free because we want them to sell the cow\nAnd no for the record [noise]\nWomen earn more than men when they're your age before they make babies they end up earning less over time because they choose to\nWomen tend to choose jobs that are less strenuous less risky they tend to want to go home for their daughter's piano recital rather stay at the office all night and that costs them promotions down the line\nSo the wage gap isn't easy method he bought it takes you honestly sixty seconds\nAnd when feminist harp on it I go yeah you're pretending to carry your virtue signaling and it's a waste of everyone's time it's a pain in my ass\nYou kept your cool remarkably\nMean probably if you had a video camera and the studios during the interview my eyes got wide a few times did you find a source that the ban Batman [noise]\n[laughter]\nStill news do you do you know that Santa's not real\n\nShe's with the Wisconsin Center for investigative journalism and Wisconsin Public radio and a couple of things\nFirst if you're curious about the wage gap or does campus rape statistics we posted some links on our website at ... dot org but we just heard the founder of a popular right wing men's group talk about generating women while simultaneously referring to them as cost me bags and cows [noise]\nWe'll talk more about that after this\nI'm answering champs and this is to the best of our knowledge from Wisconsin Public radio [noise] NPR acts\n[noise]\nThe November midterms will be here before you know and no matter where you live you'll be voting on a bunch of ballot measure KLW wants to help you make the most informed choice tell action date will be airing election treats short summary of state and local ballot measures to get digestible detailed\nAnd learn who funds support and opposes that listens Monday through Thursday just after eight am three PM and just before six and nine PM or browser election breeze at KLW dot org\nChris Hedges and the\nWith a warning Sherman who was suffering so blind\nSpiritual crisis signed a political\nIt's the best of our knowledge I'm an strength champs\nWe're talking about men's issues this hour and reporter Alexandra hall has been telling us about the Proud Boys\nAre right wing men's club with chapters across the U.S the group's founder Gavin McGahn us\nBelieves feminism went too far and that most women would be happier as housewives we're talking about why does views are appealing to large numbers of young white men and to remind you again parents next part of the story includes references to adult sexuality probably not appropriate for kids [noise]\n\nSo what I hear is a couple of things there's there are a lot of phrases like\nYou don't want your ovaries to dry up or you want guys to buy the cow\nMhm you know these references that are I find very demeaning to women but in the next breath he'll tell you that he really generates women and this whole line about generating housewife\n... ... ...\nWhen we come back we're going to put this story and some historical context Warren Ferrell the father of the men's rights movement ... [noise] I'm an strength champs it's to the best of our knowledge from Wisconsin Public radio [noise]\nAnd the arm [noise]\nWait a day on this American Life or producers always chase was following Senator Jeff flake during the days before the recent Kevin occupying the day of the hearing and after she has stuff that you have not heard elsewhere at one point she was backstage with the center to remember there was straight out of good\nFellows but what are the actual cast members bum Goodfellas strongly encourage gender deflect vote a certain way on the nomination anyway and later today [noise]\nToday at one PM here on Ninety One point seven F. M. K. A. L. W.\nFor walking across campus to the newspaper on the campus newspaper office and I said\nI'm ready for it and they were like untruth a movie review guy [noise] but I was like I'm trying to\nDoors and indignation and like and crossed wires that next time on them off radio hour from\nThat's tonight it's sixty I'm right here on K. A. L. W.\n[noise]\nThe Nineteen seventies was the era of second wave feminists ms magazine Gloria Steinem Betty for them\nBut what a lot of people don't remember is that it also sparked the men's liberation [noise] one of its early leaders was Warren feral author of the midst\nOf male power that look was cortex the men's rights movement but ... says he never considered demands movement a backlash to feminism more like a continuation\nThe blessing that the women's movement gave two girls and women was basically said two girls about let's say there's a ... you're married and you're both men and women have a a a job and relatively decent job and the woman because pregnant the woman's has basically to herself I have three options here\nOption one has to be full time involved with my children option choose to be full time involved with my workplace options for you to do some combination of both the men just sort of sits back and he says oh you know I have three options to option on his work fulltime auction choose worked fulltime actually three has worked fulltime\nAnd then if you are is a great deal of money he calls it power but power if you feel obligated to earn money that often somebody else spins while you die sooner I think that's a very deficient definition of power\nThat paradigm so what I Want to bring in the men's rights movement here and and sort of what this is a response to it because you are commonly called the father of the men's rights movement what do you see as the goal here as the value of this movement [noise]\nThe men's rights movement and it's sort of current form is like someone who is shouting to be heard for Thirty years and has not been heard\nAnd when people shouting be heard they get hurt they get mean they distort they do anything to get attention and so many people in the men's rights movement are highly intelligent and thoughtful other people in the men's rights movement feel that that women have\nGotten a lot of opportunities that men don't have and nobody sees the opportunities that men don't have\nAnd we should point out I mean there is a nasty side to all of this or I mean as as as one reporter is called it you know it's an army of massage innocent trolls on the Internet\nYes well first of all it is an an army of but many of the people in the men's movement are so hurt and such pain\nThat they're shouting out and when people don't get heard as in any relationship they start getting meaner and meaner and angrier and angrier and so if we want to do the best we can is instead of saying trolls or army of let's say what are they trying to say that we are hearing\nWhen the women's movement first surfaced I remember and I was on the board of now in New York City as you know\nI remember being on the Barbara Walters showing the today show\nAnd Barbara Walters had well how can you be part of a movement is where you have people like Cape mallette who was bisexual this was a number of years ago when this was considered that okay and I said Barbara first of all people who are bisexual may see the heterosexual world more clearly than we do\nWhat do we open our ears to what the women's movement as saying instead of calling them dikes and bra burners why don't we hear their best intent\nAnd that led me to spending a good part of my life I'm supporting the women's movement and trying to articulate two men who were feeling threatened by it what the woman's move its best intent was\nWe should just reiterate this point because I mean this is kind of fascinating when you who are so identified with the men's rights movement back in the seventies you worked for the national organization for women you are called to Gloria Steinem of men's liberation I think that's going to surprise a lot of people\nAnd really the the myth of male power was really inspired in many respects um by better for dance second book the second major book called the second stage with what she said\nThat we've we've done a great job with women and now we have to focus on men and if we don't focus on men the second stage of the women's movement we will be in trouble but there's an underlying reason that we don't listen to to men\nAnd that is because part of what toxic masculinity is about is men in order to become successful\nHave to learn to repress their feelings not express their feelings\nSo when a man is feeling down and depressed we don't hear about it but he he may act out instead like drinking driving are getting DUIs and so the parents focus on the DUIs and we don't focus on the hurt and the pain that is leading to the to the DUI the questions that are being asked\nAnd we have things for example like you know we have I think it's six officers federal offices of women's health we have no offices of men's health even even though men die sooner\nIf we consider ourselves progressive and liberal we need to see the pain of men as well as women and boys as well as girls and that's our that's our next evolutionary\nAmended [noise] more and Sarah [noise] he's often called the father of the members will run around the classic mail power [noise]\n[noise]\nYou know boys started getting messages about what it means to be a mom [noise]\nYoung [noise]\nSometimes really young\nUncle told me when I was seven years old you're the man of the house\nYou got to take care of your mother and your sister and your baby brother like at seven\nOh I don't want to go play and he told me that I was like\nWhat does that mean this is a shanty branch he's a high school teacher and mentor in Oakland, California and when he first started teaching he noticed that a lot of supplies at his school we're kinda checked out they weren't going to class they weren't doing their work\nAnd the majority of them weren't graduating so shocked he did something that seemed at first pretty simple he started an after school club for ... and in that club he pushed them to take off what he calls the male mask\nYou know the mask is it's a thing that we show the world like when we walk out of our homes to work to school to played most people they're clear that they have a massive they show the world as I think that with a lot of our young men um does idea like let me just so everybody that I'm happy funny cool athletic\nIntelligent smart hard you know whatever their characters that they show and then there's that stuff's sometimes there's like people couldn't handle this stuff people couldn't handle knowing that I'm dealing with sadness or fewer depression and also in our society is that a lot of respect for a man Who's Afraid\nWho sad\n[noise] some of our work is helping our young men have a safe place so that they can talk about this stuff is really happening all of it so when they go back to the world they're not like built up all this pressure that's waiting to explode and that's what I think sometime happens we'll let 'em urging men\nSo for you personally I mean what what's the mask you grow up for wearing and how to kill adopted at what point did you realize that lets getting your way oh man\nI was a middle schools where there's like a lot of transformation was happening you know I knew that in my head I thought it was kind of smart\nBut in middle school is not cool to be smart and so am I ... I was like getting sliding by whatever I don't care about this in order to do the homework because I didn't want to\nIt wasn't until there's one teacher pulled me aside and really adjusted my thinking you know 'cause I was really I was dealing with a lot of sadness you know my father died before I was born\nWho you cry at too about the fact that you're sad every time you see a father like picking up his son some school ... where you know when you see your father come to back to school night when you talk to about that like that with my friends couldn't you couldn't talk to them about it\nSo I just had to hold it and I had to pretend like I didn't really exist\nWhat did this teacher city and that changed\nShe had a speech rights she was talking for a long time I don't remember much of it I Do remember one sentence so uh I was like staring at the corner I'm not going to look at it right 'cause if she's lectured me I'm just not ignore her but she said I Know you're sad and that's one reason that are listening because she was like\nWhat you can call me sad I'm a I'm a black board from Oakland I like the one thing I cannot be seen as sad so I looked 'cause I'm about to ... or her statement\nFollowed at eleven by philosophy talk on today's program white privilege it's become a buzzword and discussions about racial inequality and racial justice the called the check your privilege appeals to those privilege to acknowledge the various ways they receive special treatment that others don't\nBut when white people explicitly acknowledge their privileged as this actually do anything to further racial equality find out later today\nIt's to the best of our knowledge from P. R. acts\nEvery now and then life forces you to reinvent yourself [noise]\nSometimes it's [noise]\nI woke up one morning and I was flying in my left eye so of course this was a nightmare for anyone virtually for you regard historian soldier for you guys\nSometimes life throws you a curve sometimes you go on a trip and you discover not who you thought you were\nI didn't get to ... bad for them so I was Nineteen years old\nAnd so what was that like I was African\nWays that are going to say Africa [noise] ...

sitting in the test up listening to public radio putting on Shea butters and they said oh that sounds like a really interesting work\nOkay that wouldn't be my reaction\nBut we're talking about how artists work\nThey kind of let me thinking about how complicated material was its relationship to Africa and an African from West Africa ... shape better it is it's a West African material that\nComes from an officer put in a lot of different products that we use today even dragons indifference lotions pretty much everybody has put shape better on their skin and they just may not realize that

standing in front of one of Rashid John for his newest works in a one man show at the Milwaukee art museum it's a long heavy wooden table piled with big sculptural blocks of shape butter\nAnd when you get close you can see that the table itself has been burned and places looks almost like a rich or\nIt is kind of a ritual experience I built the large forge and then I have the steel brands some of them are kind of like on sites others are just circles triangles\nBut the steel brands gone to the end to the fore and are heated almost like a cattle brand and then it burns as to the table so this was during the scarf vacation of the material and by placing the shape butter on top of it and you kind of imagine beginning the healing process for their staff and\nSo what began as a private moment

S. I got some scholarships I got some loans\nAnd then I had to start learning what it meant to be here as an American was Nigerian it was almost as if for the first time I was also learning that I was black did not need to be stated in Nigeria because everybody else around me was black\nAnd in the U.S now I had to learn the racial politics of the U.S\nToo when you first came here it sounds like you did not have the experience of most African Americans I did not and so but then over time ... ...\nI I've been in the U.S for a twenty five years I'm a black guy in America of course [laughter] you know it's never do but you know within those first couple of years\nThere are many things I did not have a narrative for what does it mean if I'm strolling around in a small town in Michigan and a car slows down the window is one down and someone shouts the N. word at me\nI had to figure out what to think about that but\nAlso what does it mean even in a social space in a university setting and somebody says to me oh you're not like those other blacks what does that mean you know and all of this stuff has to be understood and you know it took time but my experience of life is as\nIn Brooklyn I live in the u._s. yeah so and you do consider Brooklyn home I consider Brooklyn home or because that's where my wife is my brother lives there um my friends of air\nMy books there so that's how I consider leaders home\nMy parents live there is where I grew up if I go to Niger my room is there it's a place where the two most spoken languages in Lagos you buy an English on languages I'm fluent in so there's an at home this\nBut home is also wherever there's Good Wife by\n[laughter] that sounds [laughter] that connects me to the world in a way that is it reduced civil and as essential to my experience of the world do you consider yourself more Nigerian or more America\nNeither split right down the middle or rather a hundred percent of both\nI feel very invested in Niger is feature is a book I've been working on for a long time about Lagos so I think about Niger allowed I'm American and um America is in crisis at the moment\nI feel invested in being an American who with other Americans thinks about what this country ought to be I'm a citizen who is not a patriot but I'm a citizen in the sense of being invested in what do we owe each other\nWhat do we do to protect each other's writes\nThose philosophical questions are very interesting to me if my money is being used to kill foreigners in the theater of war that's my business so I'm very American in that way and I'm also very nature and in that way\nSo you said the two cities that you spent the most time and are like us and New York city yeah are they just two totally different experiences for you or or ... or did they have certain similarities I mean obviously two huge cities well the commonalities are very\nSimilar uh it is the experience of ... which is maybe the fourth definition of home for me [laughter] you're you're you're comfortable in cities I'm comfortable among cosmopolitan people who share some of my assumption is about\nThis conversations have been talking about mhm if somebody says you know gays should be and or Muslim should be shot I say well no that's not the conversation the conversation is how does somebody who's sexual these different somebody who's religion is different\nHow is that person\nAble to inhabit the same space and have the same rights and respect as anybody else that sort of the core value of cosmopolitan at some right absolutely so what would you say some of the biggest differences between like us and New York New York is much richer\n... might have twenty five buildings of monumental scale and New York has three hundred never ceases to surprise me the the sheer physical scale of New York\nAnd then there's that thing in New York of being a will capital Lagos is the capital of Africa don't lead people in Cairo Johannesburg tell you different\n[laughter] you know it's all live in the name of God this is this is a very strong guy talk yeah later as the place\nWhere the pop culture of Africa is being made and sold Lagos is the capital of Africa but New York is the capital of the world so that New York is almost not an American city it's a city that's a vision of what is it will look like if these borders are not as they are right now\nI've loved and actually with with a passage from from your book open city which is set in New York kind of a novel of New York and where where you are wandering\nCould you read that yes thank you a bunch of it is a book of wondering what I really wanted to evoke over the course of this book was psychological intensity but also those kinds of plenty [noise]\nAt first I encountered the streets of incessant loud [noise]\nShock after that the focus on the relative tranquility as though someone had shutters calm all of sudden private chapel was a blur the TV set [noise]\nI Love my waist crowds of shoppers and workers too little construction on the horn of Africa [noise]\nWalking through busy parts of comment I laid eyes on more people\nWhen I was with customs are seen in the course of the day [noise]\nBeach neighborhood city appear to be made all the different substance\nEach seem to have a difference to pressure\nThe difference psychic weight [noise]\nBright light

the photographs in it on our website AT T T E book dot org where you'll also find a link to a much longer interview Steve did with him in the middle east [noise]\nSo we're talking this hour about reinventing yourself getting outside boxes or writers have a word for those\nBoxes genres [noise] here's Lauren mucus with a dangerous idea [noise]\nAnd learned here because the author of broken monsters\nAnd my dangerous idea is that we should get rid of genre altogether I Am so tired of the very artificial arguments that their literature and there at science fiction and that there is westerns and crime novels and they that these are all somehow different and have different values system\nAs far as I'm concerned we should be permitted to it you know reading habits we should take any Dan buck we liked to bed as long as that book is good in bed\nOr in the boss or on the sofa wherever you like to read you probably shouldn't read with your reader and the boss but you know\nSo the idea that we have stories and we have good stories and bad stories and we have stories that use different elements\nBut to reduce them into these kind of\nLittle boring pigeonholed where they have to fit sending criteria it's so frustrating and tedious\nI think we miss out on a lot of really good books and of course the bad side fire but it also depends on what your idea of science fiction is it's a very broad stretch at the same with crime you might have already tedious it'll murder mystery which breaks out all the cliches about pretty dead girls and\nThe serial killer creeping up on people and we've seen it before and then you might read a crime novel like Congo which just blows you out of the water\nThese distinctions they're fake they don't exist we need more hybrid novels we need novels which can take their inspiration from the world read what you want to read\nCross different genres surprised yourself\n\nLauren ... is author of broken monsters\nNext Charles Monroe can make a former pop singer turned jazz crew in her and she's the light I'm inspired I'm ready to go change the world now and go do it I'll go do it on my soul now has already [laughter]\n...\nAnd it was

I was thinking about your biography and you're talking about people you're around people that I figure special is delayed print so who I Know you were ... and and he was your mentor told me about about your relationship with him and the music but you were able to do with him\nYeah well that was just an awesome surprises life [laughter] um I you know growing up a huge huge prints fan and he reached out to me on line like Nico will you come to the park\nAnd play with us but you got to say yes to that one [laughter] it's pretty much\nYou know so we went to Paisley you know that's where the big was [noise] and um yeah I didn't know if I meet him I didn't know if he'd be like the wizard of Oz like behind the curtain you know whatever we were sound checking and you know we're in the Paley Park and all of his outfits that you ever remember from ever video where we're we're hanging there and I I\nBut anyhow that's obviously really hard for me so [laughter] I I looked up and I'm like oh\nYou know and I and I my eyes go down from looking at ceiling and don't bury it I'm like oh God I just sat in front of friends with I wasn't but so I just kept sanctions and it was so bad um and then he was like have you ever been to Paisley before and I said no no he's like you want to come check it out oh yeah [laughter]\nSo um I was asking him all kinds of questions and he and he is a super cool and very generous\nAnd then over the years you know we just became friends and he would bring me out on the road and um we wrote together and jammed together and watch movies and he was just very a generous with advice and support and\nYeah can you please for me I just I'm sure the song is going to become a hit I I Would assume it will I ever want to play the for love or were you do

said Michael Smith from the monkey are you kidding\nAbout you know we have to actually image of ease [noise] get\nFor those of you not old enough to remember the monkeys with is smart funny adorable pop group in the early sixties they had the zany TV show\nI was a six year old super fan I watch that show every week and I still remember all their names their was Davey they're really cute one with a British accent the when everybody had a crush on Mickey the second cutest Peter the client one with the blonde page boy\nAnd Michael Michael ... the one in the green stocking cap okay so the monkeys faded out sometime when I was in third grade but Michael Smith\nTurns out to have had a really interesting second and third and a mouse fourth career\nYou sort of invented country rock and the music video he wrote two novels he worked in film TV and virtual reality and after all that have come out with a memoir called infinite Tuesday\nAn autobiographical rats and lucky for you and me that garden sat down to talk with him\nSo Michael one of several things that I think you invented or at least help to invent is country rock and and one of the great examples of the pioneering country rocket you created as a song called listen to the bat can you tell me about the song [noise]\nWell I can try I mean listen to the ban came out of a studio I wanted to go into the studio before the monkeys was over right at the end of it\nI call built in Jarvis who was a producer he was always his producer book called him up I've known him I said I'd like to bring a band into the studio\nCan you put something together what he put together was the Muscle Shoals base\nThat had just started to play and was completely rearranging the way people thought about our and be in the deep south gospel driven\nMusic did a researcher saying and on and so forth so that was late one day going into the studio and when I walked in the door these guys have been just jamming and roofing and doing stuff on their own [noise]\nThey said okay well here you are you're late were really good but I just heard them play these recession cats are playing at the top of the form\nSo a plate I'm listening to the band and they started playing to it in a way that was very far outside country music it was very far inside rock and roll mhm have you had opened up some of the same windows and doors that the big power players were opening up\nThe drummers and and the bass player Briggs on the piano when everything locked down\nInto this this orange ... march of the sport from Japan\n[noise]\nIt's leading to a bruise\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nOne of the things you invented quote unquote invented in I think it's fair to say well I'll let you respond was MTV music television you tell me how you did that [noise]\nWell no I don't because I I really didn't invented I what I was there I was there at the birth of it and it and it started with the music video I'd been asked by Chris Black well it was\nThe owner and I think he may still be of island records when I delivered Rio to them to distribute if I if I Would be willing to make a clip\nFor real that he could use to promote the record around the European cocked and it would get played on television that way well I didn't know what he was talking about so I had to go and do some research will there weren't hardly any out there but the ones

to have someone throw cold water on these crazy turn almost stories\nThe strange thing is he has his own story\nWell some of my wife's from a clone Germany she was raised by a single mom and her grandfather and her grandfather had this radio this little Philips transistor radio from Nineteen Seventy seven or so [noise] [noise]\n\nThey used to listen to music you meet her and when he died she\nKept it and it stopped working you know long ago [noise]\n\nAnyway when she we met and bill of love and so on she moved to Los Angeles to be with me she shipped her belongings out ahead of time including this radio\nAnd I try to get a working for her because I knew was meaningful to her and I couldn't put new batteries in and checked the wires and slapped on the table firmly and all the things you're supposed to do to get electronic equipment to work and uh you know I couldn't and and so we gave up and I just tossed in the back of a drawer in the bedroom and it\nDidn't think about it for months and then you know the day of our wedding\nJust particular moment when she was feeling rather sad that there was nobody there from her family and\nFriends a long way from home and we heard music playing in the back of the house [noise] it's like what was that you know and I thought well I'm a slip my iPhone honor my laptop with high dunes or maybe the next door neighbors playing music and it was none of that and then we [noise]\nIt was open the door beneath the fax machine and then there's the rate that plane plane is love song perfectly you know perfectly tune with station [noise] for us particularly for my wife this was a very deeply emotional experience I mean meant something\nTo her ... her symbolically anyway like the grandfather was there with us and the day of our wedding and make her feel good and it did [noise]\nIt played the rest of the day and night we fell asleep listening to music on the radio and they went there the next morning and the debt ever sense even though I get it to work and and still won't work it's still there [noise]\nShare my I think that was anything more than just a bizarre coincidence not really but it kind of shook him [laughter]\nIt was like whoa man ... column down [laughter] call it's okay [laughter]\nUh yeah a little bit but but that also is insightful to me when I talked to other people that have had these experiences and makes me more open to what they're talking about are more sympathetic like yeah I get it I totally understand the yeah I had something similar\nHe didn't have to write about this than I mean that's actually one of the things that I think is is great about what he did as this goes against his sort of idi allergy of skepticism\nWhat does it mean I don't know you know I wrote about this in Scientific American just to say you know weird things happen\nYou know my friend is not really religious friends with people like deep October that think that there's a you know it's sort of a quantum field that inner connect all of this in a quantum consciousness way he thinks that it's a sign you know okay maybe but you know again why are the effects so weak my wife said numerous experiences and last year and a half where she felt sad or\nWas missing home and the radio didn't come on ... but this was this was your wedding day well it was\nOther I mean what some people who study mystical experiences say is that the most profound experiences are often once in a lifetime I mean they're not replicable there there there's heightened emotion for whatever reason there's something extraordinary happens and will never happen again\nThat possible end and it could be you know that science is limited in the sense that we really really need replicable\nLab tested or some kind of way of getting that the experience again and those kind of went off events don't fit that and it could be they are real and we just are limited and how we can study them\n[noise] [noise]\nWell I don't think that science can ask the question of what ultimately true about the supernatural the nature of the supernatural is is that it is\nBeyond the natural I think science studies for natural okay so this is the Stanford anthropologists Tanya Letterman [noise] son to kind of person that people come up to at cocktail parties\nAnd you know I haven't told anybody that's but my goodness I was in the hospital I find myself up in the corner of the room looking down at my body [noise]\nPeople see things that other people don't see or couldn't see the here things that other people couldn't tear they sometimes feel their mind leaving their body and was around me these experience happened to people and in fact I think they are pretty common\nSo she has spent her career studying religion sort of trying to understand religious belief why do people have these beliefs and\nWhen she was a grad student in England she was really interested in the pagan community practitioners of magic and she joined in\nSo as an apologist you do what the field that you've come to study does no I meant I cast spells I was part of groups of people who were conjuring up power I was I learned to read tarot cards I learned to a little bit about astrology a lot of that type of law\nAnd participated in these different groups as they met to carry out their ritual metric\nDid it become real for you or at least at times\nOne of the things I could see was that people experienced the magic Israel and so I I put to the side\nThe question of whether magical force really existed what I could see and what I came to experience is that if you spent time in this world and you did the kinds of things that people did to raise and manipulate natural power you would feel this this forced moving through you\nAnd that happened to you and it did it did [noise]\nA psychic ability I have this odd ability to step in to other people um the living and begin to resemble them become them without having met them or seen them ended so I'm kind of like a human radio think that's the way to look at me and who are you channeling I have these guys that work with me they say that their teachers\nThey say that they're operating in a different level of consciousness than we are at a higher level of consciousness uh higher octave\nThere is a name that they use occasionally which I'm always a little uncomfortable with names because that seems to bring in ideas of lineage in history that I mean so is that in other words you can distinguish between different gods they have different personalities elective I work with a collective but yeah there's personality that comes through certainly when I work but I don't really see them\nI mean for me the experiences very physical and very auditory I've seen a couple of them and meditation what are they look like the one that I've seen that I Am I'm able to to distinguish clearly and I only saw him because I was hypnotized and somebody said we like to bring your guides through and\nI was quite surprised when somebody showed up and sat down he was\nYou know quite lovely to look that he was older he were a large hats and it's sort of went up up up and up and there was some sort of flat out the topic was sort of a little bit like you would imagine I suppose\nA Greek Orthodox priest would wear and he held to a sector which was very odd it was boss the the weathering was raised and it was higher clinics and I didn't know what any of it meant the time and um he had blue eyes very blue eyes and a long beard\nAnd he had a purple robust summertime still when you when you have that image I mean you you take that literally do you think this is what this guide really I'd say that's how he presented himself for me\nSo this all sounds kinda crazy yeah hang in Akron imagine maybe when you first started having these experiences that might have felt like too much but I mean did you ever feel like you were going crazy\nNo not really I didn't start off believing in any of this stuff I was raised an atheist you know and I wasn't I didn't have a great interest in the paranormal certainly see we're not you did not come out of a religious you know and not at all I grew up in the Upper West side of Manhattan and we sort of snicker to people who believed in things that was a convenient\nAgnostic ... I suppose when I was twenty five I was a year at a graduate school at Yale I'd had a list of things that I had achieved in the world but I thought would make me okay and I got the whole list and I wasn't okay that's really what happened and I began\nTo pray or to embark on what I now know was the beginning of a spiritual path\nAnd things begin to happen as a result of that too I what started happening well the first thing was I heard a voice telling me to get my act together and I was so surprised that I heard that voice\nThat all of your other thoughts and it's not your fault it's the only way that I can explain it and I had a bit of an experience and the experience may well had been hyperventilating I really I may never know what it was but it was an experience of energy moving through my body and out through the top of my head\nAnd then as a result of that I sort of seeing lights around people or maybe not as a result of that but shortly thereafter I sort of seeing this things these flashes started you know going off\nSo when you say see lights around people without was whether they look like\nWells fireflies sparks little blue lights over the top of the head so I\nEnded up studying a form of energy healing as a way to get a context for this\nI'm sure a lot of people who are listening to us right now are are deeply skeptical she or he might be thinking you know you're making it all up or even if you're not you're delusional you care about that kind of skepticism\nNot in the way that I used to I Can't you know I had a life as an academic for very long time I was at NYU for twenty five year teaching creative writing my writing yeah I talked play running for very long time and you know initially I was very concerned about what people thought and I kept a very low profile with this\nBut once the first book came out I had to begin to own it a bit more and that was a challenge so you're not you're not teaching creative writing and he no I'm not ...\nI'm traveling around the world sitting in a chair closing my eyes and waiting for this transmission to come through in speaking what I'm hearing them in all of this energy comes in and fills the room and people who come are having an experience with it\nYou know I'm not a spiritual teacher I'm not a good ... I'm not a psychic who's gonna connect you with your dead relatives and I don't like doing productive work\nBut if you're actually having problems in your relationship and you give me your spouse his name I can step into your spouse begin to look like her and possibly hear what's going on in the dynamic then that's been proven out in the film when I'm channeling I'm really just operating as a radio\nSo I'm just sitting in the chair and letting the dial turn to the station that wants to come through and then being receptive to take the dictation\nSo play that out for America explain that for me if you can when you say you're like a radio and you know you got to sort of tune into the writing channel and then the guides we'll we'll speak through you ... how does that work I mean ... where are you in that where where is Paul ... heated\nI'm president but I'm receded I sort of in an altered state of conscious I think I'm going to like trance it's light enough that I can interrupt pertinent and and and say hey wait a minute this doesn't make any sense which I've been known to do and the rule with all of the books is that they could they can't be edited so all of the books or the on edited transcripts of the sessions\nSway they really are you are and you're not going out and you know sort of cleaning up the ... year thing these books you know they're not written by you if you're like red lawyer automatic writing and no no\nNo they're spoken these are oral teachings that are transcribed do you think about\nThe metaphysics of all of this okay what's the architecture of this universe that you are describing here\nDo and I don't I think I only do when I'm sitting with somebody who asks those questions decay while you're sitting with one right now if you say I'm not going to access it myself because I actually don't know\nAnd I would have to recede and begin channeling on your show and I think it was already the way we started off this conversation has so far out to begin with everybody is the lesson that I Am absolutely thrilled [laughter]\nYou know honestly when I first started doing this stuff I didn't want to record it I wasn't looking to be known for it that's for sure I was really hiding out I did a group at my apartment had met for Eighteen years with\nAbout ten people who would show but the most every week and we would sit in a circle and the guys were talking and they would bring\nThey say well you know you've written you know multiple bucks an hour they have through new mayor or is there sort of a\nCommon message [noise] yeah I think\nThat who we truly are is not what we think we are in Middle East and and I really talk about humanity being at a at a transitional points that's evolution right now and the the opportunity really is here for us to reclaim what would they would say is I think are true identity\nAnd how you identify yourself and your life\nIs primarily based on a lot of collective agreements what it means to be a man whatsoever culture you were brought up in what it means to be a success what beauty is all of the things that we collectively ascribed\nGreat value to is really an inherited information and it's actually in most cases operating at a cost\nThis is what they've said they've said that humanity is a time of reckoning in a reckoning is facing of oneself and all of the ones creations and what's been created in fear and needs to be recreated in the higher way\nHas anything changed in your own life as a result of all this I mean obviously you what you're doing day to day you know the workshops that you give the toxic effects different you're not the university teacher anymore but in terms of I don't know how you think what your values are I think\nIt's all different it's all different I'm a lot less afraid when I was and I have to say that I was very frightening person ... much of my life\nAfraid of what things life yeah life you know I was a sensitive kid you know and I grew up wary consequently and I suppose in some ways maybe I still am you know there's a quote from\nHelen shook man the woman who was the channel for course miracles [noise]\nShe said I don't believe it but I Know it's true and I can get behind but I understand that I don't believe it either but I Know it's true what you mean you don't believe that you must believe it I don't I don't I Know that it's happening I don't know how it's happening I don't know how I Do what I Do\nI'm I'm very happy to be able to be part of this but I'm Still challenged by the whole experience\nThat's Paul Salopek he's published five channel tax Steve\nWe started earlier talking about your family and all the stories of family goes to the paranormal has doing all these interviews changed how you feel about your family's experiences and stories\nYeah it has it has um [noise] yeah I take them more seriously\nWe have really good conversation [laughter] when the family gets together because you know we have these mutual interest and we come at it very differently\nAnd uh I'm a speaker and you know I had my own way of doing it and they are secrets to\nBe there's something in common there and it's it's the

were expecting to tend to do what soldiers expect to do which is get into combat situations and potentially engage with and and kill bad guys and that's why a lot of these guys joins to begin with sure a lot of these guys were hooked up during nine eleven right\nExactly that a lot of them joined us out of a sense of patriotism and\nAnd yeah so I think when they got this assignment they had a mixed response on the one hand um you know I think they were intrigued by the idea that they would be with Saddam Hussein but I think some of them were kinda bummed out that they weren't going to be outside the wire sort of mixing it up with the insurgents and that they'd be kind of stuck in in one place\nThat was a little surprised that these guys didn't have special training that I for some bunch of high level CIA guy should be guarding Saddam Hussein but some kids their kids from like you know higher seems strange to me\nYeah no I mean they were in some cases not far removed from basic training Eighteen\nYeah I mean it was it was remarkable they weren't special operators they weren't you know CIA clandestine service personnel I mean they were just a basic young soldiers um and then that combined with kind of the intimacy of their\nInteractions I think was what really struck me about how unusual this was they were not allowed to tell anyone right\nCorrect um I mean that's one of the things I think that made this mission particularly challenging was that\nYou know here they were sitting in a few feet away from the most wanted\nYeah I mean there's a an account from one of the guards that he was on the same day he was in court wave in about how he had been mistreated by the Americans he got into the elevator to bring him back down into the subterranean cell where they were

[noise]\nSo I stood there and watch them get ready and [noise]\nFix his hair put his suit on his watch um [noise] he got dress to the nines as best as he could [noise] once that was done I left him and then we all had the mentally prepare for what was about to go down [noise]\nThat was that was pretty intense because you figure\nIf someone is going to come get him or he's planning to escape he's going to do it now\nJust cleaning your weapons and making sure everything was a point with her so [noise] yeah once we got there [noise]\nHe said goodbye to us so [noise] I mean\nNobody when when ... I'm Sorry what ... what did he say to you you personally how did you say goodbye to you\nIt was very it was very sad once the commotion was over and we knew we were in somewhat of a safe zone no one was going to come and get him [noise]\nHe sort of need to before he walked into the [noise] the deaths house and the [noise] he turned around and say goodbye [noise] and it said that we were all his

really didn't know what to feel I I've never seen anything like that my wife\nYou know it's just like wow that [noise]\nI mean it was a wild wild west to me like [noise]\nLike I've only seen the

just had more respect and the presence of death I guess [noise]\n\nAnother one of the soldiers would speak very candidly about any number of insurgents that he had killed and he didn't have any real regret remarks about that [noise]\nThey put this experience I had a profound impact on him and so you have to step back and say okay well why was it that he was able to kill from a distance and almost joke about it off handedly but here we are with essentially the worst of our enemies\nAnd playing a role in that particular death really hurt him in trouble and have [noise]\nI feel like I have to

the Nazi on the barber guy named after ...\n\nAnd that some books that was banned in Germany I think the book came out in the early seventies and it was banned for like Twenty years because it looks at the Holocaust from the point of view of a a guy who was a prison guard at a a concentration camp\nOh\nI didn't even know if I like the book but I kept thinking about the book because of the crazy questions that it's a way that it treats the illness that people bring the Baron all kinds of ways in the way we forgive them and don't forget them it's just it's a book that really just sits on your show just won't get off my church\n\nSo I mean it's an easy book to read and to say oh you know there's no culpability for a crime like that I think it's easy to read them you know I could see being German and reading that book and go out to be ... we're not responsible and that the books not saying that at all\nOh ooh\nThe victims are responsible but it's asking that question about culpability responsibility to both about forgiveness and want to talk about the book you know give it away but look where identities useful words not useful how it measures how we see people you know it's just

[noise]\nI said ... was the youngest son as Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson he\nCame to Madison well it would have been right after the passing and the fugitive slave act so we should go back a little bit in time after Thomas Jefferson died he granted all of his children their freedom\nAs was Sally Hemings freedom\nThey grow up slaves\nOn on Mount a cello on Jefferson's plantation and then once they're fried some of them identified as African American authors passed\nBecause they have like no skill\nThey were all fairly fair skinned and they could pass even Julia ... wife was also multiracial and so she could also pass as white they were in the sense is an Eighteen fifty in Ohio identified as mulatto but then after the fugitive slave act passed in Eighteen fifty\nAshton and Julie I decided to take their three kids and moved further north away from the border and they moved to Madison, Wisconsin and here they pass as white and they identified as white they lived among whites and ... and nobody ever questioned that and that is how they continued their life [noise]\nJohn and that really who were essence two sons both served in the civil war they served in Wisconsin regiments at the time of the civil war if you were African American and identify that way you had to be in a colored regiment both of them served in white regiment so clearly there is no question\nThat they were white and that they identified that way\nJohn the older when he moved to Memphis and became a cotton shepherd was very successful at it but never married there's some theories that he chose not to because if he had a child who was dark skin\nThat would sort of blow his cover I guess in a manner of speaking and then he could lose everything that really did marry he had sons of his own he said in Madison he ran a very successful large carriage company here and purchase diverse I'm the best and Madison actually\nSo these children up a former slave became these prosperous\nYeah why they chose Madison one would assume maybe had something to do with the name [laughter] you know it was also obviously further north certainly safer from the fugitive slave act\nWhen I first heard that one of the children of Thomas Jefferson\nAnd Sally Hemings was buried half a mile from where I live\nI was done I mean this is a long way from ...

[laughter]\nThey're all over the mid west they're still family members and Michigan still some in Ohio now this kind of progressive we moved to the middle and north of the United states\nJust thinking about the history of this I mean if you have the son\nOf Jefferson the guy who wrote the declaration of independence and then you have a child who grew up in slavery it's like these trends of American history come together right here in the cemetery\nRight it's interesting how little he sort of know about your local history and how it all kind of intersect in various ways and it still affects us today Thomas Jefferson is so famous right and he stands for so many things and I think you can avoid feeling the weight of that here\nMm\n\nAaron Hogan is an education specialist with the Wisconsin veterans museum here in Madison\nOoh\nSo by now pretty much everyone knows that Thomas Jefferson had a sexual relationship with his life Sally Hemings and that they had children are Twenty years ago the Jefferson Hemings relationship was mostly a rumor that his white descendants denied\n[noise] and then a brilliant legal scholar Annette Gordon Reed proved it with historical records stories passed down by Sally Hemings children even DNA evidence she became the first African American to win the Pulitzer Prize for history followed by a MacArthur genius award and she tells the policy\nOf this story is a perfect example of the way many Americans have tried to bury and deny the real history of slavery\nI think most people in the black community did not doubt it because we understand that this kind of thing happened quite a bit\nAnd so it didn't seem like it was wild and crazy\nI Would say that most historians did not believe it was true and there were a variety of reasons there was sort of an old view well Jeffrey symbols of southern gentleman and this sort of he ... he wouldn't do this there was this sort of\nThat important to them once you put things down and writing you can at least begin to locate where people are and then research and find out about them\nSo the big question that people have been asking for decades is\nThe revered founding father who wrote the major part of the declaration of independence thing that all men are created equal you know the great document of freedom and equality who's not just a slave owner but ... have this intimate relationship with the slave woman for years and had children together I mean what\nWhat do we do well that kind of thing was a part of being a slave owner I mean the the real problem\nThe connection to slavery and we've always known that but I think what is happening now is people are understanding that slavery was not just about\nOr whipping people or whatever it was an institution that ended up with mixed bloodlines and a lot of different ways to rape through\nConnections that we don't understand and that make us uncomfortable\nI think the thing to make of it is a Jefferson was a person\nWe should take him down from the mountain as this revered icon no\nThere are things to admire about Jefferson\nAnd we're just going to have to grapple with the fact that a person who wrote the declaration of independence and helped create the country not just Jefferson bowed Washington at all of them\nThe number of them were slave holders they help people in bondage and profited from that I think you'd have to take the bitter with the sweet\nAnd I don't know\nThat it's ever been good to revere people\nAs God in a way because they're always going to disappoint you I think a better way to look at it is to\nSay this is what these human beings did on their time on earth and some of it was good and some of them was bad and what can we live with and what things do we reject how do we move on from that Jefferson didn't think that\nWe were going to stay in one place\nBut he had already without a mystic view of race relations didn't eat\nHe was phrases yeah he he thought black people were inferior we're not as smart as when you\nFound that most people at that time thought and that's a lot of people think today there's no question about that even though he says I ventured as a suspicion only but not a suspicion he believed that whites were better than blacks that was the currency of the time\nI Do think he thought slavery was wrong but it's like many other things that we believe that we don't live by\nThis was not what really\nAnimated Jefferson I mean we're interested in slavery and race and we should be but that's not the main thing he was interested in he was interested in the United states of America he'd been part of a revolution that overthrew king and created a new society\nThat's what he was fixated on that slavery\nJust fix this that little thing over there\nBut it's that little thing over there\nThat destroys the thing that you love\nAnd slavery was he came to see the walk upon which the union will be split\nThat was true\nThank you very much is is

could trace somebody's ancestry based on their\nDNA and I thought boy I bet that there are a lot of people walking around thinking their backgrounds are one thing and there are different and how would that change the conversation that we had about race\nPicture of this you have a class full of undergraduate kids and they all spit in a test tube and send it away and is there a big unveiling day where they get their results [laughter]\nAnd almost invariably there's something there\nThat is unexpected and people are funny it really runs the gamut somebody will say the test is not right you know tested over but\nAlso start to see that they're connected to people that they did not think they were connected to ... and it's it's really neat\nIn one setting there was a young white guy who

stunning experience that I had was that I went to gone out\nBefore I took the test and as part of that trip we went to a place called the door of no return which is where the slaves went out on the

and I was surprised at my own reaction\nI've heard other people say that they have been surprised at their own reaction\nSurprised how just how emotional that was for me and I think that that is something that a lot of African Americans\nIt's hard to articulated it sort of a low level anxiety\nJust this tremendous feeling of sadness\nAs a person who has a background in slavery where you were

great thank you thank you come from a long line of him [laughter] and it's working for you [laughter]\nIn the opening statement of the novel the archivist talks about the difference between mystery and secrets and it seems to me that mystery and secrets or two of the major themes in both the twin peaks TV series and and your novel what do you think\nIf I Would agree with that I Would say that the idea of mystery is something that is\nProfoundly inherent in all of reality it's a Joseph cambell mystery as opposed to a murder mystery I it's it's a sense\nThat there's something going on just beneath the surface of what we can perceive it it's really what people talk about I guess when they're talking about a a spiritual sense of reality that there is something of an accent and hard to grasp and very often seems just beyond our reach\nBut there are times that our lives when we catch glimpses of it\nNow and UFOs then identified flying objects also come up on more than one occasion and\nWhy did you want you to launch includes so much us though content\nNumber one we had dealt with it in a in a very particular and specific way and the second season of the shows right or was that was ground for it number two it it becomes a kind of a stand in for this idea of the mysterious experience\nAnd as I delved pretty deep into UFO history\nYou quickly realize this is a phenomena that goes back not just hundreds but literally thousands of years\nThere's this very strange tradition and inhuman storytelling of people being confronted or or abducted or meeting beings but they have no explanation for understanding I cited\nAn example from the Bible and ... and the the Old Testament sees this flaming cherry at in the sky\nAnd talks that meeting these giants the yellow team it's a whole book of the Bible well that's pretty weird that very well yeah and then I'd I uncovered in in the nineteenth century there were these\nHuge string of accounts of people all over the west in the mid west\nSeeing what they describe this giant airships floating across the sky and says well before the the Wright brothers had ever been up there but these these stories are legion and not all of them have been debunked it it's a mysterious and persistent\nPart of human existence and it's not just in our culture it it appears to be fairly universal\nYou mentioned that what we call the UFO experience it raises the question in my mind should we have a different name for it like what would you call this if you know going further back in pre the Wright brothers and things they should we come up with some sort of name to describe this kind of experiment\nI mean in the in the nineteenth century and in England they called it the spirit world they called it encounters with that ferries are elves are in Germany they were ... or ...\nWe're up in a Washington filming we were out in some native people land and Michael Horse who's a member of the cast and a Native American himself took me aside and said that the native people had told him one of the forest where we were shooting\nWas where the little people showed up so this ideas persistent we Americans have a tendency to think we know everything because we have a lot of knowledge yeah but there's different kinds of knowledge\nYou also leave conspiracy theories in into the secret history of Twin Peaks very artfully and these conspiracy theories really add to the narrative drive of your story why do you think we're so drawn to conspiracy theories\nWhile I've thought about this a lot because you know I was a\nI was ten years old when JFK was shot he was buried on my tenth birthday and for four years I was obsessed\nWith getting to the bottom of this and there's a whole worldwide industry on who kill JFK that became a kind of alternate way of looking at the world and that was the first time when I was ever really particularly aware\nThat we didn't just have to depend on\nConventional or authoritative voices that were perhaps other ways of of viewing it\nI think a lot of conspiracy theories arise out of the the notion that something as momentous as say the murder of a young and vigorous and shining example of American political history could be taken out\nBy somebody is small and as insignificant and as stupid as a as Lee Harvey Oswald so that gave rise to this idea but it it can't have been him yeah had to have been something more momentous it had to have been something that that ran much deeper\nThan it can't be random there's got to be some underlying meaning it's a it's kind of a just a sort of the way our minds are wired right to detect these patterns in and make sense of the world\nExactly once that gets started once the ball gets rolling it's pretty hard to stop\nYeah definitely final question what do you think is the legacy of Twin Peaks the television series\nBoy it's a hard one for me to answer because other than that it touched\nIn some way on some kind of truth that spoke to a a lot of people\nIf you if you work creatively for a living sure you want to entertain people and you want to you want to make them laugh you want to pick him cry and you want to you want to tell them a story that keeps them in the edge of their seat but to go back to the Joseph cambell idea of the function\nOf a storyteller and the culture is that it's our job\nTo keep mythology alive for people that it's akin to what ... did and and first world cultures they kept alive the mysteries of the past and that somehow in live in the president and I I like to think that at its best\nThat's what storytellers do for our culture now\n[noise] and ... with [noise]\n... is the author of the secret history of Twin Peaks he's the co creator along with David Lynch the true these series the third season of Twin Peaks debuted on may\nOne [noise]\nThis year's Booker Prize went to George Saunders for Lincoln in the bar down his complex and multi character novel set during the civil war President Abraham Lincoln's they love it sounded really dies probably of typhoid fever you only eleven years old Lincoln is overcome with grief\nAnd visits the cemetery cramps many times to hold his boy's body\nSteve ... when the book first came out and I began with their reading can you explain\nGoing on in this scene yeah there was a convention in the book that when a ghost sort of Cohen habits the same\n... the person's thought string becomes fully available to the ghost so they're linking has entered the tune and Willie is kind of watching him watching Lincoln fuss over the physical body and spirit willy who's separate is kind of feeling a little jealous and so he kind of just\nPlunges into Lincoln and thereby gets access to Lincoln's thoughts and feelings in that moment\nGo onto the next step so the danger of the ... you can get stuck there\nOr you can sort of be trapped there for eternity\nYeah and then that's probably true of my ... than the actual Tibetan borrow but at some point that kind of had to break from it and and make a\nYou know a whole new concept of what might happen when we die mainly because my guess is not to have you done it but my guess is that whatever happens it's going to be a real shocker and ah [laughter] and it it is not going to be like oh this isn't just what we were told\nSo so that was part of the the writing challenge was to make a bottle that had some resemblance to what we think the afterlife might be but be different enough that we shared and some of that this orientation that a natural that person would feel\nJust this resonate for you personally I mean that's more than just illiterate device ... the Buddhist concept of ...\nYeah my wife and I haven't students of of Buddhism for a while I'm just you know a total beginner but it back and flex this life in the sense that if the ideas that when you when you die your mind is basically like a wild horse that gets let off to tether because now it's not dampen by it\nThey can do anything it can travel it can be a mission that can experience horrible visions are beautiful visions much like our idea of having\nWell if that's the case the way we cultivate and train our minds right now is is really key\nSo you know you could see it as a literal afterlife or if that doesn't sushi you could see it as a metaphor for the fact that we're making heaven and hell this instant by our habits of mind and then the kind of hopeful thing which is that you theoretically could cultivate a state of mind\nThat was more patient and more loving and more sane than the one you happen to be in at the moment for me that's kind of the big takeaway is that had been how\nOur right now and they're not beyond our ability to influence\nIt seems like there's also a connection to be made between literature and religion at ... they're both exercises and world building and even if you see religion as representing an underlying reality they're both ultimately imaginative exercises yes they are you\nKnow I think in world building especially in a book like this which is ... ... you get to decide what the rules of ghosts are you get to build them and what was interesting to me was I didn't start off with a bunch of rules I just started out with trying to make\nInteresting lines in the book basically in ton dialogue or vivid images and what's interesting is as you do this kind of intuitive approach with the thousands of the draft the world starts first of all it starts being very consistent you can see which rules have to apply\nAnd in a really magical thing was it you know a ... year three\nWith the rules in place the rules started\nKind of producing weird fruit you know there would be [laughter] turns in the plot that I hadn't anticipated that were really meaningful and and I found really moving that weren't really me doing it it was the rules of the world saying well if a therefore be it's a kind of a cliche but I for writer so you know you're like a midwife to book is there\nA perfect being or you know very good being it as a strong sense of what it is in your job is to kind of manage your daily activities so as not to work the thing's individuality and I had that feeling really strongly in the last third of the book and it was just I'm deeply enjoyable I really kind of miss it I have to now\nGet out of Eighteen sixty two and come back to now\nGeorge ...

sick but\nAlso get into their milk and people would drink the milk and get sick and die and that was called milk sickness and it was a real problem\nThroughout the Eighteen hundreds in fact\nThe mystery part of it is interesting it took us a long time to really understand how plant poisons work in part because\nHow do you even do those experiments the KGB starts assassinating people\nWith rights and which is an extract of the castor bean seed and\nWe did not in medical science even know how much rice and it took to kill a person so as late as the Nineteen seventies were doing experiments where we're figuring out what would be a lethal dose for a pig that weighs roughly the equivalent of a human it's amazing how much we still don't know\nA poisonous plant garden and that it's been listed as one of them\nI think Eighteen most unusual gardens in the world [laughter] well I thought that I wanted to grow these plants it's weird to write a book about plants that you've never grown and maybe never even seen in some of them are pretty hard to get\nYou can't just walk into a garden center and say I would like twelve manned drinks [laughter] they're just not for sale but as I'm doing these interviews and reaching out to people in the horticulture community\nPlant start getting offered to me\nKind of secretly like you actually yes I I really did go visit a farm that grew a lot of very poisonous and strange plants including some illegal plants there was up in the hills and before I went up there where I knew there was going to be no cell phone coverage I remember calling my husband and going if I don't call you back in an hour or something has happened [laughter]\nWhat plants so like I watched maybe you've heard of\nA hallucinogenic plant from South America\nThings that may be or not quite illegal but that the DEA is very aware of and that are losing a Jenike plants but they were going straight up you know it was a pop farm and it was a I mean they were going other illegal\nStraight up illegal plants as well so you're you started collecting collecting so I started collecting them but they need to go somewhere so I planted a poison garden\nAnd I really made it a I had fun making a creepy so like rather than plant markers I had the cement tombstones that identified what the plant does to you\nBlindness I found a company that makes resident skeletons for medical schools and they sell their factory seconds on line [laughter]\nSo I had all these lightly divide the skulls and hands and and so I had those are like a skeleton buried those creepy and wonderful but not terribly practical was it beautiful I mean opium poppies are beautiful right yeah I mean a lot of these are very pretty plants\nSo I was crying Fox glove did to tell us which is a heart medication\nIt's a great example if a plant that both medicine and poisoned depending on the dos and who's taking it and tobacco's beautiful at flowers and its spending on the which one you grow can be quite large and\nImpressive looking plan you know yeah a lot of them are very pretty\nI've heard that some people think plants have a consciousness\nI was reading something about\nMaybe the night shades have\nInability to hate you think that's true well I'm fascinated by this and that is something that we're finding out more about so one way that plants communicate is through route exited so they exude chemicals out of the roots into the soil and those route exits can attract\nCertain microbes are other living creatures that might help the plant do better or ward off\nAnd they're also plans to do the same thing above ground that if they're under attack they can release a pheromone that would attract the predator of the bug that's attacking them so in other words they can signal for help mhm so this certainly suggest that they're able to react to\nStimuli around them in a way that we didn't know was possible and we're sort of just starting to figure out\nDo you think that there's a reason that we have these toxic plants in our world oh sure they're just defending themselves and this is something I Try to remind people of is that\nYou don't have to be terrified of poisonous plants\nThey're just trying to make a living you know they're they're trying to protect themselves against predators\nIt's a mistake to think that because some things green and comes out of the ground that it's all natural and it's therefore good for us you know we tend to think that anything that's plant based is more healthy and superior\nSo as cyanide so as rice and\nThey're just trying to keep from getting eat\nPlants are rooted in the ground they don't have opposable thumbs they can't run and hide they can't fight back but you know that's why plants have\nForeign or spines are stinging metals I mean they're all just trying to keep predators away\nSo they inflict pain and suffering on anyone who tries to\nThat was Amy Stewart she writes mystery

the\nTitle of your book present shock is a reference to advertisers Nineteen Seventy book future shock what's the difference between future shock and present shock\nWell I guess in some sense or maybe the the sensation might be similar to the real difference is that the future that out and talk to her was describing that we were moving towards is here with us now so well Tom Sawyer was really warning us\nReally to learn how to orient to a world that was changing ever more rapidly to basically be able to adjust to change itself\nI'm arguing that that changes happen that if anything you know as we pass from the nineties into the twenty first century we became less of a society that was just obsessed with the future and what's next and what's happening what's the next big thing where is it all going\nAnd we became a society that was very much\nIn the moment in a kind of a a an always on real time hyper connected\nAbout how do we adjust to change to something much more like how do we adjust to living in a world where everything is happening seemingly at the same time\n... where you break this idea of present to them down into five big areas and little let's talk about that was one you call ... ... what does this\nWhich is interesting and it kinda comes out of that video game sensibility I mean the beauty of video games is that instead of watching some other character go through a story\nYou are the one going through the store you know you're the one making the choices in real time and you move from choice to choice to choice to choice rather than watching these canned choices in the sense of agency\nBut you know the digital environment\nVery often makes it seem like you don't even have to choose you don't have to choose between this and that you can choose both and we're doing so many things on line what we're choosing both that we've ended up with really multiple instances multiple incarnations of ourself\nKind of running simultaneously and all these different platforms and it's very hard to live with more than one you know digital technology is great for copying things but\nHuman beings don't copy so well so there's you on Twitter that maybe somebody's commenting on something that you did there's you and your inbox it's filling up with messages that are waiting for respond to\nTheir view on Facebook who might be being used to advertise a product you never even heard of while you were asleep you know and you'll wake up that you've been in these sponsored stories\nAnd they're so how do you deal with all of these different use running simultaneously that's\nSort of the essence of the digital ... are just kind of digital confusion\nSo you're basically you're saying that it's enough to make you a little crazy there's almost like a split personality here 'cause we're tending to so many different digital persona\nRight and even if your personality is not split your digital personalities are split and you're a single person now going to have to deal with all of them I got the idea for the digital any a chapter when I was\nIn the lobby of a hotel in Berlin and I kept trying to log into my Google Calendar to see if I can do one talk at the same time as another talk with her I'd be able to get from one to the other in time\nAnd each place I went I couldn't log until I finally got why fight on in this lobby\nAnd I get this message back from Google that they locked me out of my calendar because they said I was trying to log in from too many places at once [laughter] right so Google Calendar didn't believe I was a human being\nThey didn't believe one human could be an all those places at once and that to me seemed to be the essence of you know the problem we have a digital culture it's not this idea of information overload and all these people have all these problems with digital technology and this I promise you present shock is not one of these books is just\nWhining and handwringing about the problems of ... but what I Do get concerned about\nIs our readiness to really to put our human lives into digital time frames and digital technologies really don't understand time\nThey live outside time they're just sequences you know your Twitter feed is not in real time it's just trying to catch up with you just because people are sending emails out to you it doesn't mean that now you have to respond in real time to them\nRight the beauty of digital technology was that it waited you know the early conversations we used to have on the bulletin boards we were also smart because we had all the time in the world to respond to these things we founded smarter online than we did in real life\nRight well in the the irony of course is that this was supposed to make our life better it was supposed to make it easier and it seems like it's just makes us feel crazier\nI really do believe it's because instead of using digital technology for slack which is what we saw it as right we're all going to be able to work from home in our underwear anytime we want\nYou know 'cause we'll just get our work done and and turn it in as it as it's ready rather than\nGoing to work for this eight hours a day and being always on while you're there what we ended up doing instead was kind of taking that time is money a fish and sea values of the industrial age and translating them onto the digital age where digital technology really if we're going to embrace it the way I think we can\nIt's about really liberating ourselves from these obsolete industrial age priorities and embracing a totally different really way
