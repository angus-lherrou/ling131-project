[{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "On Ninety One point seven KLW San Francisco your local public radio station\nThen that was one o'clock [noise]\nFrom is the creation of a failed system and you can remove from but if you don't address\nThe system itself [noise] then especially I fear as we barreled towards both an ecological\nAnd an economic crisis out\nSchwab will rise figures as frightening or more frightening\nThan Trump demagogues who actually have an ideology touching the American flag in one hand I'm a Christian crossing yeah we have to address the root cause\nThat's Chris Hedges and this is the alternative radio I'm David ... on this edition of a A R features Chris Hedges on root causes of a failed system\nWe live in an era where the one percent is raking it and we have a dog whistle politics bullying and disdain for science and facts\nSome saw this coming for example Neil Postman in his classic work amusing ourselves to death nailed it when he wrote\nWith a population becomes distracted by trivia when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainment's\nWin serious public conversation becomes a form of baby talk when in short people become an audience and their public business of vaudeville act\nThen a nation finds itself at risk\nCulture death is it clear possibility postman wrote that in Nineteen eighty five or political life today is like a reality show there is a fascination with celebrities from Kenya west to the conditions to the former host of the practice\nAnd the soundtrack in the background is permanent war\nTo talk about these issues is Chris Hedges you shouldn't award winning journalist who's reported from the Balkans in the middle east and Central America\nHe writes a weekly column for a truce the dot com he's the author of many books including the world as it is wages of rebellion and America the farewell tour he spoke in Eugene Oregon and now Chris Hedges\nWell this is where our hope is right here in this room are with us and we have a difficult task before us oh one that won't be easy or that will require communal solidarity\nAnd self sacrifice\nBecause these corporate elites won't go without a fight\nAnd they will play dirty and they will be vicious and I'm sure I'm not the only one in this room who wasn't Standing Rock a great heroic effort led by indigenous communities [noise]\n\nWater protectors who understood that there are certain elements around us which are sacred which have an intrinsic value beyond a monetary value and which are worth fighting\nThe last few years\nI have written several books that have attempted to diagnose the deep malaise within American society the failure of our democratic\nInstitutions the bankruptcy of our political elites including the Democratic party the collapse of our press in debris or less\nThe shift away from a print based culture one rooted in truth and verifiable fact into a culture where fact is inner changed with opinion\nWhere\nWe are skillfully manipulated\nCorporate forces to elicit emotional responses to everything around us including manufactured political personalities and we confuse how we are made to feel\nWith knowledge\nThe problem in American society has been orchestrated by corporate forces by of corporate\nCoup d'etat in slow motion as John Ralston Saul points out\nWhich has transformed American society into\nA version of the late Roman Republic\nThe facade of democratic\nProcess electoral politics civil liberties a court system that defends the rights of citizens remains\nBut internally corporations have seized all of the levers of power\nAnd there's a great probably our greatest political philosopher Sheldon woolen taught at Berkeley later at Princeton\nWho writes in his classic work democracy incorporated\nBut there are no\nInstitutions left with in American\nSociety that can authentic we be called democratic\nThat we live in what he describes as a system of inverted\nTotalitarianism and by that\nHe means it's not classical totalitarianism we still have the iconography and language of the republic of a democratic system but the primacy of economics the ...\nOf neo liberalism which calls on us too Neal before the dictates of the marketplace\nJust structure our society\nAround the primacy of profit\nHas a centrally turn those institutions and the Democratic system\nInto a facade anytime a cabal seizes power\nWhether it's an article communist fascist or corporate\n\nAnd it read directs the institutions\nMade incremental and piecemeal reform possible\nLater concentration of wealth among the elite and amassing ever greater systems of power it fosters in essence political paralysis\n\nThe system works only for a tiny segment of the ruling oligarchy class and becomes increasingly oppressive\nSo the majority of citizens\nI wrote a book called death of the liberal class which is a study of liberal institutions and what has happened to them within American society and in the corruption and destruction of the liberal class\nWhich in a capitalist democracy should function as a kind of safety valve\nTo ameliorate the stresses and suffering within the society\nWe saw an example of this with the breakdown of capitalism in the Nineteen thirties\nAnd the response by the ruling oligarchy class under Roosevelt\nAnd Roosevelt in his private correspondence and the letter is published after his death writes that if we in the oligarchy elite do not respond we will get revolution those are Roosevelt words\nSo we must if\nIf the if the private sector cannot create jobs then we as government must create jobs and Roosevelt creates twelve million jobs Social Security\nMany of the union is who rose up in the Nineteen thirties had not been members of the union previously especially after the sole against unions following World War one that's how a functioning liberal class works\nThey put on the white shirt it would stop the white man's bullets that if they fell into this sue fee like hypnotic dance the buffalo herds would return the warriors would rise up from the earth\nAnd the white euro Americans and Americans would disappear\nAnd that is essentially what the Christian right is it is a crisis ... the only way to break the back of this movement is too we integrate these people back into the economy and of course the opposite has happened\nTrump has no ... it's an idiot logical void but\nThat vacuum is being filled rapidly by the Christian right the Christian fascists and as Noam Chomsky points out we may get rid of Trump\nBut Michael Pence will be worse\nNothing will protect us until we address the root cause which is the rupture of the social bonds the seizure of power by corporate forces\nAnd the deep lays an alienation that that is rippling across the United states we personalize our dilemma in a figure like from but this is a grave mistake\nAnd one of the saddest moments in contemporary American history\nHas been the Democratic party's refusal to address the social inequality that is driving us over a cliff [noise]\n\nBecause I figure like from did not a rise\nOut of this morass because of James Comey or the ... emails or Russian box\nBut the Democratic party is a creation of the corporate state there's one party it's the corporate party on one hand you have the\nFrog with diets and the race is the ... and the Sheldon Adelson Z\nAnd the trumps and the Bannon's in the middle or ... and the Kavanaugh's and on the other you have the segment\nOf the ruling corporate oligarchy embodied in the polish Princeton graduate work at Goldman Sachs I've taught at Princeton I see how they recruit who don't want to be identified as racist or homophobic or ...\nBut never addressed the structures of power the seizure of power\nBy these corporate forces\n\nTen years ago\nWe suffered\n\nAnd what was the response of the corporate elite\n\nThey created out of electronic ether according to researchers at the University of Missouri twin the six trillion dollars in fabricated money\nThink of what twin the six trillion dollars could have done in terms of putting people back to work making sure that the eight million families that were a victim from their homes had a place to live\nForgiving student debt creating a rational health system\n\nWhere parents were not forced by corporations to go bankrupt\nTrying to save their six children\n\nAnd the speculators these global speculators they took this money they never created jobs they never buttress manufacturing\nThey bought back their own stock which is what they did with the money they got from the virtual tax boycott never forget that under Eisenhower the highest\nTax brackets for the wealthiest individuals and corporations was Ninety One percent Ninety One percent [noise]\n\nAnd we now live in a system whereby next year we'll be pain\nOver three hundred and fifty billion dollars on interest and within ten years nine hundred billion dollars on interest\nAnd the gamble\nFracking industry aside from destroying the water\nOn which we depend for life\nDoes money losing operation\nTwo hundred and eighty billion dollars because the fracking industry like the dot com industry has value not on the profit it produces but I'm projected profit\nAnd this money this twenty six trillion dollars of money marks calls it fictitious capital because it will evaporate is borrowed that virtually zero percent interest from the fed\nIn Europe there were central banks that negative interest rates meaning they would pay to borrow\nMoney but it has to be paid back and since they're not producing anything of substance\nThey are imposing\nHarsher and harsher forms of austerity and debt peonage on a beleaguered population that no longer has a voice within the society\nWhat we have done to our students\n\nCrippled by monthly payments in the hundreds if not in the thousands of dollars\nOn able to find meaningful work\n\nProductivity since Nineteen Seventy three has increased by Seventy seven percent and if wages kept pace with productivity the minimum wage would be\nOver forty one million workers in this country earn less than twelve dollars an hour that's a third of the workforce and almost none of them have employee offered health insurance\nThat's by design\nThey are extracting it from us even if you have health insurance in this disastrous for profit system\n\nYour co pays what's not covered astronomical pharmaceutical costs are draining you\nA million bankruptcies a year\nAre caused by\nPeople who can't pay medical bills and they had insurance\n\nI'm not the only person in this room to read the climate change studies\nEach one more terrifying than the next and each one with the same thing which is it is happening far faster than we predicted\nWhy our climate scientist so terrified of raising global temperatures beyond two degrees Celsius because the feedback loops and they know what feedback loops do they studied it on Venus which used to have water and is now eight hundred degrees\nAnd these corporate forces Neal\nBefore the primacy of profit or not only willing to enslave us\nBut ultimately to push the human species to extinction\nAnd there are no internal or external mechanisms within the systems of power that will protect us\nYou're listening to Chris Hedges on root causes of the cells system\nThis is independent alternative radio you can order copies of this program and the Hedges book America the farewell tour\nBy calling one eight hundred triple for one nine seven seven that's one eight hundred for for for one nine seven seven\nWhere you can order online on our website alternative radio dot org that's alternative radio dot O. R. G.\nAll resistance now must be grounded in the spiritual\nNot in an orthodox religious belief system necessarily I come out of that system but I certainly saw that spiritual dimension at Standing Rock\nI'm not gonna play no stir dominance with dates but that it's coming is is a fact and the military machine has to contract and empires are always fragile entities because they depend for their wealth on the exploitation of foreign labor and the ... of foreign natural resources\nAnd you you saw you saw it in the feeding empire as the city's writes the tyranny that Atkins imposed on others that finally imposed on itself\nAnd that's precisely what's happening and you use the harsher forms of control and the outer reaches of empire a wholesale surveillance suspension of a basic civil liberties including due process militarized police militarized drones it all comes back into the heart of empire\nAnd and my fear and Cornel West and Rick Wilson I've been going around doing these series of talks based on great revolutionary thinkers rows of luck some bird Antonio ... Carl Marx WB to boys we did Thomas Paine for our first one because\nWe cannot separate ourselves from the wisdom of the past that is our patrimony that's our\nUm you know you can go back to Aristotle and Aristotle understood that you can't have a democracy in an Olive Garden system as Aristotle said once the oligarchy seizes power then you only have two options revolution or tyranny that's it\nAnd what I worry about this land of the eternal present and the land of images is that we're cutting ourselves off from our intellectual heritage at a moment that we desperately need it [noise]\n\nYou spoken up the need for spiritual awakening since humankind can't agree on who are father that's not politically correct God is or even whether we have a father do you think it might be time to remember\nOur well that's good our mother surely we all can agree that were children mothers well this is the guy or this is really the guy a theory by Lovelock\nUm that the earth is is a living being\nEvery society has a concept of God\nBut that concept is a human creation and they in doubt the eternal with particular attribute ... depending on whatever religious system you come out\nBut they all know that there is something beyond ... there is the internal there is the sacred there are these forces that give life and on which we depend for life\nAnd that our time on earth is very brief\nFor ten thousand years since the end of the last ice age and the very peculiar elements of the biosphere that have made this possible polluting the Gulf Stream for most of the four point five billion years the earth has been have not been exist\nIt's called the house thing this moment bean now supplanted by the anthropology so it's about being in touch with the sacred it's about\nHonoring protecting the sources of life and understanding that our life with a life around us is intricately linked\nWhat do you see is the role of third parties can we afford to risk wasting our vote in twenty twenty [noise]\nTo quote the great Emma Goldman if voting was that effective it would be illegal [noise]\n\nIf we don't rebuild our movements it doesn't matter who we vote for\nPower is the problem I agree I'm In that sense an anarchist\nPower is always the problem we are a terminal heretic a power we must remain organized hold power accountable as Ralph Nader has pointed out the last liberal president in America was Richard Nixon not because he was a liberal or out of conscience but because he was frightened the movements\nAnd there's that's how we got oh show the mining safety act the clean water most of it written by NATO\nAnd there was a scene in Kissinger is memoirs do not buy the book\nWhere it's Nineteen Seventy one there are tens of thousands of anti war demonstrators Nixon has put empty city buses all around the White House and he's standing at the window sane Henry they're going to break through the barricades and got us and that's precisely where we want people in power to\nBe [noise]\nSo I vote\nBut without movements real movements and my problem with Bernie is that and I ... I saw one and I were whiz Bernie before he announced\nAnd trauma was pushing him that he had to run as an independent not only are we not going to gain power through the Democratic party which doesn't function as a real political party and which stole the election from burning\nWe're not going to build an effective opposition within an election cycle it's going to take a long time\nIt's going to begin in places like Eugene that's going to begin from the ground up\nSo race or ten years ago now the ruling party breeze was pulling in four percent\nSo you know there\nDoes come a moment and we just have to stand up on principle because if we don't begin to stand up nobody else will [noise]\n\nWell that's a good question real solutions to homelessness but it raises the cruelty of what we have\nDone to people with mental disabilities um we have thrown them out on the street or you can see them twenty five percent of the prison population severely mentally ill and as soon as they get in prison they drug them up\nSo they sleep Eighteen hours a day because it's the only way the prison can cope is by applying them was psychotropic drugs but it's just\nExample of the cruelty of unfettered capitalism the way\nStill on the planet will discard people and treat them as if they're human refuse including of course children how many high school students are homeless how many college students I mean children living in shelters\nAnd that's why this system has to be\nOverthrown and let me spell it out for the homeland security that's O. V. E. R. [noise]\n\nWe have to restructure our relationship to the planet in our relationship to ourselves you know how many more decades can we go in without paying reparations to African Americans [noise]\n\nI've been in Germany and you know it's not a perfect society but they confronted the evil of the Holocaust and it made them a better society for it we've never confronted what we've done and let's be clear black people built this country [noise]\n\nNo everything has to go I mean education at all levels must be free there should be a guaranteed minimum wage there should be universal free health care for all [noise]\n\nThe fossil fuel industry and the banking industry must be nationalized [noise]\n\nAnd the military machine must be radically diminished\n[noise]\nYou know Eric Foner when he writes about the abolitionist\nSays\nThe abolitionist ... who had called for the emancipation of African Americans with no restitution\nTo their slave holders were dismissed as utopian us and Lincoln initially had all sorts of bizarre schemes of\nNot only compensating but sending blacks to Madagascar or I Can't remember where but\nWhat happened at the end of the civil wars that everything the abolition is called for came to\nPass we have to begin to stand up in a real way and not be cheering eyes by the practical\nBecause we don't have any time left to re create and we can figure our own society\nAnd that really means holding fast then of course they will attempt to frighten you but Trump is the creation of a failed system and you can remove Trump\nBut if you don't address\nThe system itself\nThe deformities within the system then especially I fear as we barrel towards both an ecological and an economic crisis out of that swamp will rise figures as frightening or more frightening", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Alternative Radio", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "29", "locations": [["San Francisco", 37.77493, -122.41942], ["Kenya", 1.0, 38.0], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Eugene Oregon", 44.05207, -123.08675], ["Standing Rock", 38.17499, -109.95902], ["Berkeley", 37.87159, -122.27275], ["Princeton", 40.34872, -74.65905], ["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Bannon", -7.55, 146.6], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Germany", 51.5, 10.5], ["Madagascar", -20.0, 47.0]], "not_found": [], "ep_coords": ["San Francisco, CA", 37.77493, -122.41942], "in_country": ["San Francisco", "America", "Eugene Oregon", "Standing Rock", "Berkeley", "Princeton", "the United states", "America", "America"], "out_country": ["Kenya", "Bannon", "Germany", "Madagascar"], "in_state": ["San Francisco", "Berkeley"], "out_state": ["Kenya", "America", "Eugene Oregon", "Standing Rock", "Princeton", "the United states", "Bannon", "America", "America", "Germany", "Madagascar"]}, {"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "Yeah but right here for alternative radio this is not a one point seven K. A. L. W. San Francisco [noise]\n\nSo what it costs you get these co ops by fairly privileged people who decide to reject this corporate food regime [noise] they want to live differently they want healthy food they went for it which is recognized [noise] and they weren't enough snippets battle [noise]\nAll of these instances of people pushing back in ... called the counter movements [noise] the counter movement is a social movement of people who do not accept what capitalism is doing to them and they push them\nIf you want to change the streets [noise] we're gonna have to understand on capitalism [noise] it's not just about surviving within\nCapitalism which I think costs are very\nHelpful for as we've seen this storm\nBut can actually change [noise]\nThat Eric Holder the menace and this is the alternative radio I'm David ... army on this edition of a A R features Eric whole team manners on pushing back the corporate food regime\nFood is the basis of life we needed to live it's as simple as that the un declares the right to an adequate food is a long standing international human rights\nBut the aim of twenty first century capitalism is not primarily to promote our wellbeing and health it is to control markets and maximize profits\nThe production of food is a gigantic global enterprise dominated by a handful of mega corporations General Mills Pepsi nationally Unilever and Coca Cola\nWhile they do well hunger and food insecurity affects billions of people around the world including tens of millions in the United states\nCommunities are pushing back the corporate food regime ... co ops environmental and food activists London I should of India says\nFood has been transformed into a commodity destroying farmers livelihoods destroying the health of the planet and the health of people she calls on us to become the change we want to see in the food system so no Russia's the earth and all beings\nOur guest today is Eric Holder the menace he's the executive director of food first the institutional food and development policy\nIs the author of calm Pacino outcome Pacino voices from Latin America is former to farmers movement and foodies guy to capitalism\nHe was the keynote speaker at a meeting of the consumer cooperative management association in Portland, Oregon\nAnd now Eric Holder the madness\n... she moved on boom boom boom like in my ... my ... my ...\nMy grandfather is turning over in his basket grave were butchered that sentence but I just think that it's an honor to\nBe here with you\nOn indigenous lands and I thought I should honor indigenous people with my own indigenous language\nThank you um\nTalk start talking about or capitalism by talking about the colonial food regime and I think good place to start talking about the colonial food regime is with the Irish family\nAnd really encapsulates or what the food system has\nBeen about ever since the dawn of capitalism let me just read from here from my book\nIt doesn't matter if the food is fresh organic uh rubella or a Big Mac\nTest from highland from Ethiopia or cheese whiz from Walmart doesn't matter whether you need it or not whether it's good or bad for your where it's locally produced or travels from afar whether it was corral cage free range or let a happy life\nIf enough people wanted and have the money to buy it someone will turn it into a commodity\nAnd sell it so that is the basis of our food system as a commodity system\nWhen the commodity system was introduced to the world during the and that's just a revolution\nAnd not only changed the forces of production it changed the relations of production and millions and millions of people were uprooted from their lives from their villages 'em and driven\nA out of their social relations and out of their productive relations into a capitalist\nRelations into the factories the satanic meals um and many starved or even though there was plenty of food the Irish potato famine it's really a misnomer there was plenty of food in Ireland or during the famine people were just too poor to buy it\nIn fact it was one of the golden age of a\nEnglish or agriculture high farming and\nUm but people had been separated from their means of production and we're no longer able to feed themselves and were flocking into this attack meals or to look for work where they were literally worked to death that is the introduction of capitalism\nThat's introduction of what we called the colonial food regime [noise]\nNow this was a great concern to great thinkers at the time and I'll just mention to have something to do with co ops in John Stuart mill who is a very important reformer and who believed in a co-op cooperative there's some um as a way of helping people to respond\nTo what capitalism was doing to their society\nUm and of course Robert on\nA who was a utopian thinker also very much in favor of co ops end of a a planned communities um but\nAnd he was also trying to uh not just sort of reform\nThe cap can the capitalist system that was being imposed on Western Europe at the time particularly British Isles\nBut he wanted something different he really wanted something radical he wanted to pull out of the capital system and you also want to collapse to help do this so we begin to see the cooperatives or tools and different responses to capitalism\nVery few people today actually know what John Stuart mill or Robert own said we don't really studied much\nOh and and crew the philosopher is and and the sort of the wealthy people who were pushing back against capitalism at the time\nBelong to a very elite level of society and they sort of launched these ideas and what we called the public sphere where there was all this debate in the coffee houses in London about oh\nBut in fact there was another public sphere where people were discussing what the hell to do about capitalism how the hell to stay alive working Eighteen hours a day and not getting enough and literally being worked to death\nAnd of course those were the partisans who had been de skilled and displaced by the industrial revolution\nAnd whose work had been devalued because of this enormous what they call reserve ... an army of labor starving people willing to work for nothing in order to survive and so you see this response\nFrom the co opt for survival resistance survival but more than that because when people get together and once they can eat\nThey begin to talk\nAnd they've got to talk about a lot of things they began to talk about suffrage they begin to talk about evolution of slavery they began to talk about changing governments they begin to talk about democracy they get to talk about how to change the world so they can see cops being a as a place of\nThe public sphere where a different vision of society is cultivated I shouldn't happen just in the British Isles of course it happened to all around the world there are many histories of co ops engaging in social change\nAnd the ... you know everyone knows if I'm On that are going I should be proud of them on that are going to given my heritage back ones are gone and has a food co-op which absolutely for reasons\nThe farmers and I'm so I'm not too happy about that but when they were going I think was his trotted out a time and time again because it's one of the most successful capitalist collapse\nUm it really is a big corporate capitalism co-op and it's been surprisingly successful so they begin to see a range of responses to capitalism which is one accommodation reform progressive change and isn't very radical change\nA lot of my example is coming from Liberia and peninsula the uh anarchists\nSo the world bank steps in and said you got to keep up your payments [noise] um well alone you the money shaking up your payment is just public money this is our money by the way the world bank is a public institution that's our money\nSo public money was used to learn to farm to governments in the global south to keep up their payments private banks in the north but you've got to sign\nOn the dotted line with this guy over here it was always a guy\nAnd he was from the IMF the IMF said there was a little thing would cost structural adjustment we'll give you the money but you have to promise to remove all your tariff barriers dismantled all your marketing boards\nUm get rid of of all your or um food crops don't worry about food will grow it in the north dismantle although if you're a grain reserves\nAnd um started growing things more coffee and flowers these things were to get your dollars so you can pay back the banks\nIs this called Neal liberalism you have to privatize all of your state services privatize all of your state run industries put them up on the market will come down will buy them thank you very much so what's happening to us today in the United states happened first\nIn the third world the privatization of Arctic of education already happened in the third world privatization upcoming privatization of uh the post office already happened for a third world I'm so privatization\nIs basically this new wave of capitalism I'm which we now call Neal liberalism\nAnd a complete deregulation from Minneapolis environmental deregulation um labor deregulation trade deregulation that's what the world Trade Organization about and we have this this rush of free trade ... the\nFree trade mania World Trade organization and the free trade agreements of the north American free trade alliance and Central American free trade\nAgreements and you get tremendous over production in the north they dumping in this in the south or putting farmers out of business within the year the signing of NAFTA over a million Mexican farmers went bankrupt and why do you think we have so many immigrants here today\nIs because these arrangements these agreements these capitalist\nAgreements destroyed their livelihoods that's why you're here and you look at who's who's uh in the back of the house with the fancy restaurants former farmers whose cutting the launch those are farmers\nWho is doing all the farm work\nAll the stupid labor those were farmers so when farmers in this country say oh gee is who's going to you know all the farmers are disappearing\nNo there's no no one wants to farm anymore and they're surrounded by farmers just happen to be brown so what it costs doing well in the postwar period cops kind of you know languished\nBut then they begin to get what I learned was another um\nSecond when called the second wave of cause and you get these co ops by fairly privileged people\nThey want to live differently they want healthy food they want food which is recognizable and they organize and they push back\nAll of these instances of people pushing back is with carpal on your call the counter movement\nThe counter movement is a social movement of people who do not accept what capitalism is doing to them and they push back out of necessity out of belief\nFor out of survival ... anyway we get the second wave and I like to think that the second wave was really part of the beginning of what we today we call the food movement\nMhm but the woman has many roots\nAnd one of the roots as the food justice movements in the food justice movement comes out of the tradition as African Americans goes out of the needs of Mexican Americans\nComes out of the desires of Asian Americans people with a very different position and the food system but who find different ways\nOf ensuring their own food security out of necessity and so today we have a really a thriving food movement we talk about all the time Michael Pollan Alice Waters all these people talk about the food movement Raj Patel I'll pay me um and\nI think we have to sort of cop to the fact that\nThe food and one of the reasons the food movement is here not just because we're rejecting\nA processed food which we should just pretty bad for us as everybody knows where we're also trying to deal with the contradiction that the richest country in the world produces more food than any other country except maybe China\nI'm In this country when people winter seven people are going hungry\nWe don't call it hunger because food insecurity\nThere's a special way of measuring it might not um if you call it hunger you won't get a USDA grounds I sure do you have to call it food insecurity\n\nBut one in seven people in this country so that tells you right away that hunger is not the result of scarcity\nWhy are people going hungry and the richest country in the world with more food than anybody else because they can't afford it and so hungry maps very closely with poverty\nHunger also maps and very closely in this country with rich so the highest levels of food insecurity in this country are among people of color we have a racialized food system\nAnd this is one reason we have a strong food justice movement to deal precisely what kinds of inequity\nNow it turns out that the figure\nI just gave you one in seven hungry people in the United states\nReflects perfectly\nHow many hungry people that are in the world about one in seven people are going hungry in the world in fact depending how you measure it it might be much greater but by the standard um a means of measurements from the uh United Nations uh one is having people are going hungry now you're a lot about from bill\nGates and others that we have to go to Africa and we'd have to save Africa from Hungary we need to take the new green revolution to Africa and Africa Africa Africa where are you guys so interested in Africa\nAll of a sudden oh well African never got a chance for the green revolution it's not true actually agreements wishing failed in Africa but in fact that if you really want to end hunger that's not where most of the hungry people are most of the hungry people are in Asia and Pacific why aren't we talking about that\nAnd the Pacific that's why so they bring the pollution isn't just about expensive inputs\nAbout fertilizers and hybrid seeds and pesticides and all that the green revolution is about\nExchanging one food system for another exchanging president food systems for capitalist food systems and so logically and historically as it always has it displaces and dispossessed says millions of people and drives them into the ranks of the hungry his wife producing more food the way we produce food\nIn the industrial food system is never going to solve hunger back in two thousand uh\nH. and again in two thousand eleven we've had record harvest record profits and we also had record hunger around the world\nUm we'd never produced so much food as we did during those food crises and there were food riots around the world during this time you might remember there are food rice in this country\nIt was put right in Milwaukee when they were still writes in places where you would expect them like in sub Saharan Africa or I'm In Haiti where people were eating mud biscuits to survive\nBetter in Milwaukee\nWasn't 'cause there wasn't enough food is because people couldn't afford it but meanwhile ATM Monsanto Cargill general foods Safeway or Walmart or making\nRecord profits at the height of the food crisis\nAnd again this is science because of a lack of food we've been over producing food for half a century we produce ... percent more food every year for everybody per capita I mean every one of us should get ... percent more food every year\nOf course not everybody does so what that tells you is you can produce more and more food it doesn't matter if people are poor and they can't buy it and we will have hunger the price of food it's been going down\nIn going down ever since Nineteen hundred until two thousand and eight and we got this tremendous bike and the price of food and then a billion people start going hungry in the world how do you explain this\nYou're listening to Eric whole team a niche on pushing back the corporate food regime\nThis is an independent alternative radio you can order copies of this program and his book a food ... guide to capitalism\nBy calling one eight hundred triple for one nine seven seven again that number is one eight hundred\n... percent is all the globe the in 'em all the corporate food regime controls\nGlobally they controlled ... percent of the food and with that they control the world's food systems\n\nNow co ops don't control much of the food in this country I Know and farmers are too weak to demand anything\nBut people who work in retail grocery that's the biggest employer in this country Walmart biggest employer in this country\nWhat if we were to converge in all of our diversity how powerful might we'd be and then by saying that the counter movement as far as we're concerned is the food movement it has a progressive\nWing and it has a very radical wing and the corporate food regime has two wings one neo liberal and one reformist\n... and if the counter movement expects to introduce any reforms much less transformative reforms it'll have to converge the progressive than the radicals are going to have to converge\nThink about the different types of co ops that I described\nThere are all represented here but which ones should come together my position is that the progressives in the radicals need to come together because if the reformist in the progressive to come together than the Contra movement is split down its back and becomes a week thing and it will never be able to introduce changes\nThe reformers weren't being assigned to change the two week why because the new liberals or hedge I'm On it this is the age of neo liberalism what's keeping us from coming together I Would say there are some historical obstacles we need to deal with\nOne would be sexism and now there would be racism and another would be classes and\nWe have to deal with these things brothers and sisters we have to take them head on we have to be fearless we have to call it out I have to call out my privilege as a white male and I have to allow people to call it up right here right now\nEverywhere\nWe've got to dismantle patriarchy we've got to dismantle racism this is an extra work this is the work because it [noise]\n\nBecause if we don't dismantle what is keeping us apart we will never come together\nThank you very much [noise] [noise]\nOh it's just a curious you said there are three million grocery workers do you know uh this this statistic of service and restaurant workers that we could add in that as part of the food oh\nYes I Do but I Can't remember it [laughter]\nYes and there are some excellent organizations like the restaurant opportunities center that organized restaurant workers\nUm by the by restaurant workers have some of the highest levels of food insecurity in the nation and the highest of within that sector or in the fancy restaurants\nI have a question of all the inconsistency that me and my friends discuss brought many systems but what people in this room all respect what I'm saying about this one so we had eleven thousand members are small co-op and upstate New York\nIt occurs to me that those eleven thousand members although they raised their hand to say they want to be part of this shift in food systems\nTherefore one case their retirement plans their stocks and their bank investments are at the same time more than likely supporting the structures that you discuss\nRight we realize is in our school board work in my community that's what people were coming to us demanding security in the front of the school buildings\nHad not checked her all the ... to see whether or not they were supporting Remington\nRight so how do we begin to expand this conversation so we just stop eating the tale of our own snake\nWell thank you that's not a simple question is it [noise] I think I I really do believe that that\nReflection of action\nNeeds to take place within the public sphere is which we consciously create I think that we need a radical public spheres I Need we need public sphere is deeply rooted in community um and these\nIssues have to be put on the table and you know people are going to get defensive\nUm but we can't not address those inconsistencies a and I think that the only\nThere's no easy way but I think that as we understand the structures which is driven is to this dead end\nEnd to the contradictions in our society into the violence that we experience in our society is understand the structures behind that and called him out I think it deep personalize things enough so then we can begin to address the very personal issues\nAs well and I think that you know there's a lot of trauma trauma um built into all of this\nSo we can't just in addressed that intellectually we can't just addressed that organization like every one of us has to do some work whether it's about internalized oppression or whether it's about the guilt of privilege\nWe can't get anywhere if we're if we have these hangers on us which means we do have to do the internal work the good news is you don't have to do it alone in fact you can't do it alone and the good news is that there are tools for this\nIf you look at ... Native American communities today they have developed all kinds of ways of dealing with the trauma of genocide and constant constant work on genocide\nThere are excellent forums and workshops and um for dealing with racism and how to dismantle racism from both sides of the ...\nSexism and patriarchy so I think that to the extent that we can begin to bring these into our practice or social practice whether that's cooperatives or whether it's research like I Do\nThere's no guarantees on this you know we don't know what's going to happen\nWe don't know if we can avoid planetary collapse civilization will collapse the planet will go on\nWe won't we don't know but what if we didn't even try what else are you going to do is trying to change everything were you busy sounds intimidating but what else I've been\nDoing this stuff for a long time and very much for a position of privilege to meant Trent tremendous mobility got educator I never thought I Would I mean I grew up as a farm worker but I'm the only one in my family because of the way I look I'm that got a PHD I get depressed\nI get really depressed looking at these numbers and the only way I've been able to keep my spirits up is to align myself\nWith those who don't have that luxury those people for whom getting a pope is not an option we need to build these alliances and commit to them in fact they will save us all\nWhat do you think the potential power as of your story or some version of it for opening a constructive dialogue with a working class faction of the Trump coalition and um\n[noise] do you think that it's worth energy or to invest in that direction and do you have any specific suggestions about that\nYeah I think we need to remember is that there's a big faction of people who voted for Trump that voted for Obama\nI Would reach out their first established established dialogue and it really doesn't have to be a dialogue Nancy Frazier has a term called progressive Neal liberalism to describe a nearby ministry\nThat the administration was very progressive on identity politics for example but essentially new liberal as far as the economy was concerns\nAnd that would I think very accurately described the Democratic party right now and that's why they couldn't let Bernie Sanders in [laughter] because he was a progressive but he wasn't neo liberal ... so\nWe share the same um damage social and economic damage as men of all the Trump supporters right you can't just blame things on Trump Trump is not an ... an anomaly in my mind Trump is like the logging logical conclusion where we've been heading for a long time\nUm and unfortunately you know is is the er the rise or is that a a precursor hopefully not the end of of ah", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Alternative Radio", "city":

"Nineteenth century the word Holocaust appeared in the New York times headline above a story describing the slaughter of more than five thousand Armenians in eastern turkey\nPart of an ongoing mass killing campaign they're\nHolocaust again appeared repeatedly during World War two as historian Peter Norfolk has observed in reference and I'm quoting of it to the totality of destruction wrought by the access not to the special faith of the Jews\nIn fact another points out only in the Nineteen sixties in the aftermath of the trial in Israel of the Nazi criminals out of like when did English language publications began referring to the Holocaust loosely translated reference to the Hebrew word Shaw like most people\nI commonly refer and speaking and writing to the Holocaust with exclusive reference to the slaughter of six million Jews and the Nazis massive extermination campaign but I don't believe it makes sense to expect word Holocaust suddenly to disappear from the English language following\nWorld War two except with reference to the Nazi today aside by the same logic we should be prohibited from using the word calamity except with reference to the Armenian Genocide where the nineteenth century Irish famine\nEach of which killed at least a million people any each of which has been designated in capital letters and in quotes the great calamity by their victims\nThe same logic would suggest that we strike the word devouring from everyday speech since that as the English translation of prime is to capitalize rama word for the genocide perpetrated against gypsies by the Nazis\nOther examples of genocide victims using a particular word to memorialize they're suffering of course abound\nIt just doesn't make sense to banish or word from everyday usage because one group or another has adopted in reference to their victimization\nAnd no doubt that's why my use of the word Holocaust not the Holocaust and referring to the destruction of indigenous peoples in the Americas actually was a very little remarked upon much more controversial as my use of another word\nThat word was genocide\nOne of the reasons that became controversial is that by employing it I was joining an ongoing debate about the uniqueness of the Holocaust\nNot talking about that debate the uniqueness debate shortly but first it's important to have some sense of why many people who knew nothing about that debate we're still instantly resistant to my use of the word the word genocide\nAmerican Holocaust was published on Columbus Day Nineteen Ninety two earlier that same year Oxford University press also published a book by the prominent literary scholar and cultural critic Jane Tompkins than of Duke University\nHer book was titled west of everything with the west referring to the American west\nIt was a sweeping in a wide ranging book that included discussions of women in the west white women at least popular western fiction buffalo bill and much else even had a separate chapter on horses another separate chapter on cattle\nOnly one thing was missing\nIndians the native people of the west\nHow could that happen\nTompkins address the question in her practice\nI forgot what she wrote us what she said I forgot\nTo be fair she did express regret for forgetting as she put it in a quota\nRemoval and conquest and now I had ignored them\nSo she wrote I cried and then she returned\nTo putting the final touches on her manuscript\nBut don't recount the story to be critical of Jane Tompkins but rather to suggest that her self confessed memory loss was representative and in some ways perhaps symbolic of the attitudes of most Americans and understandably so that's the way it's supposed to be\nConsidered this in the late Nineteen forties following almost three centuries of colonial and then federal assaults and Indians\nFrom mass murder land confiscation ethnic cleansing by way of forced removal and then confinement of the small remnant of survivors to what we're often Baron enclaves known as reservations\nThe American government decided to establish an Indian policy it officially called\nLiquidation\nWhen some people pointed out that in the middle of media aftermath of the world war two that term might suggest unsavory connotations\nThe government changed it to termination\nThe allegedly fine distinction between those two words the specific words themselves don't matter either one was fully appropriate to what was planned\nThe idea behind the new policy was to extinguish once and for all everything was Indian about Indians by abolishing their tribes in their treaty relationships well seizing what was left of their land\nIt was to be an extermination campaign not one aimed at individual lives but at the entirety of these indigenous peoples greatly varied and distinctive ethnicities nationalities cultures and religions all of which are tied to tribal identities and ... says\nThe Indians of course resisted this extermination campaigns just as they had resisted invasion of conquest and annihilation for centuries but in just a dozen years\nBetween Nineteen fifty four in Nineteen sixty six when the policy itself finally was terminated more than a hundred tribes and bands had been dissolved and more than one point three million acres of Indian land had been taken\nThat is the spirit of never forget\nThere was a wall in the United states Holocaust Memorial Museum inscribed warning something that'll Hitler reportedly said one day in Nineteen thirty nine on the eve of the Nazi invasion of Poland it's a famous phrase who after all speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians\nMore ... than on this day I Believe nearly Seventy years later is another question\nWho after the crushing of Nazi Germany in Nineteen forty five could have imagined that the United states and Israel of all countries would help to perpetuate that convenient forgetful this about the annihilation of the Armenians and with it\nHitler's murderous cynicism on them to the twenty first century\nIndeed it was only a half dozen years ago that the current president of Israel Shimon Peres declared the Armenian Genocide Armenian Genocide to be historically meaningless\nThis prompted a particular the anger reply from within Israel by a man named Israel Charney the executive director of the Institute on the Holocaust and genocide in Jerusalem\nIn a letter to Paris Charney wrote the parents said quote gone beyond a moral boundaries that no juice should ever allowed himself to trust is adding that specific remarks on the Armenian Genocide being meaningless were comparable to denials of the Holocaust\nThis sort of statement is not unusual for Israel Charney for many years he has ferociously fought back against the evil of Holocaust denial\nWhile at the same time resisting efforts to set the Holocaust apart as in his words I'm quoting him the ultimate an event against which all other tragedies of genocide a genocidal mass death or to be tested and invariably found wanting\nFor me he writes the passion to exclude this or that mass killing from the University of genocide as well as the intense competition\nTo establish the exclusive superiority or unique form of any one genocide ends up creating a fetish stick atmosphere in which the masses of bodies that are not to be qualified for the definition of genocide or dumped into a conceptual black hole where they are forgotten unquote\nWhich finally brings me back to the genocidal destruction of north and south America's native people\nAnd the strong resistance by some commentators to my use of the word genocide in describing the destruction\nCommentators like the recently convicted felon Senator Ted Stevens who threatened to use his considerable power to cut off funding of the Smithsonian Institution if used the word genocide as a plan to do in a documentary film on the destruction of the Americas native people\nCommentators in short who would prefer that those millions of bodies remain buried and forgotten in Chinese conceptual black hole\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the story of what happened to the indigenous peoples of the Americas during the course of four long centuries from Columbus is first landing at his bunny hill and fourteen Ninety two to the massacre at wounded knee in December of Eighteen Ninety or\nThe U.S supported genocide in Guatemala during the Nineteen eighties and beyond I must confess that it is impossible for me here tonight to describes specific events in any detail\nThat's what I did over the course of several hundred pages in American Holocaust and even then I barely scratched the surface of what in North America Alone began with a deliberate calculated extermination of the Indians or Virginia in the seventeenth century\nWhat yell genocide scholar been turned in recently described as a genocide on the court the Geneva and model so total destruction\nLet me just say for the moment however that the claim of euro American genocide is one of the primary agents responsible for the deaths of millions of indigenous people throughout the western hemisphere was hardly original with me\nIn fact the first person to make that case was the very man who coined the word genocide and who relentlessly and heroically press the United nations to declare it an international crime a law professor of polish Jew who would last forty nine members of his family in the Holocaust roughly ... ...\nIt's commonly thought that in his efforts to name a defined genocide as a crime Lincoln was posted focused exclusively on the den ongoing extermination of Jews in Nazi Germany and this is incorrect\nRecent research in the Lincoln are types of New York's American Jewish Historical Society the New York public library and the mark the center of the American Jewish archives in Cincinnati has revealed the existence of detailed manuscript ratings from the Nineteen forties\nAnd which Lincoln obviously preparing at least one book on John genocide probably more\nLess numerous folders filed under what he regarded as a variety of genocidal events in history including the titles are his quote Spanish treatment of South American Indians North American Indians colon extermination\nHistory of genocide projected book on North American Indian research and much more\nIn the Nineteen forty eight report to a foundation that with supporting his work Lincoln listed what he called ten specific genocide cases justice phrase he used a which was compiling information and I quote to be made available to the United nations drafting committee on genocide\nOne of those ten cases is labeled the Indians in Latin America another is the Indians in North America\nAnd then finally in the Nineteen fifties Lincoln's archives reveal still more folders bulging with information on these subjects including the draft of a one hundred page essay on genocide against Indians one that includes sections on their incarceration in what he calls concentration camps\nHe was of course referring to reservations\nBy the late Nineteen fifties Lincoln had almost completed a massive book on genocide world history\nThe entire third section of which was to be given over to genocides and colonial settings with separate chapter titles listed on genocide against the American Indians Latin America\nGenocide against the as tax the Yucatan genocide against the Incas and then on to European genocides against the natives of New Zealand Australia south West Africa and more\nBut in Nineteen fifty nine Lincoln died of a heart attack in a hotel room in New York City he was not yet sixty years old the book was unfinished\nBut even if it had been completed it probably never would have been published because by then a new orthodoxy was beginning to take hold in the United states and elsewhere when that view the Holocaust as a singular unique genocidal events in world history to some proponents of the sites\nIt was the only genocide whereas Lincoln apparently felt that acknowledging the suffering of others had no bearing on the recognition of one's own painful experience\nSome among this new generation regarded the Holocaust as moral capital to psych one representative writer moral capital that risk to being plundered by others who sought acknowledgement of their own horrific experiences\nAnd this emerging climate of opinion authors who chose to honor even mildly critical comments about aspects of the new orthodoxy including ... distinguished Jewish political theorist and historians is Han aren't in the ... he'll bird\nFound themselves being abused in print and black balled for expressing their points of view\nFor the better part of three decades this sort of exclusive is thinking dominated scholarly discussion about the Holocaust\nSo much so in fact than in the early Nineteen nineties the distinguished Princeton historian or know Jane Mayer himself a Jew found his classes being boycotted by Jewish students and his name placed in a robes gallery of so called ... Hitler apologist published by the Anti Defamation league\nHitler apologist why\nBecause in the book is titled why did the heavens not dark and mayor had dared to criticize what he saw as two camps of historical extremists\nIn his words and I'm quoting him those two camps were revisionists who categorically denied the Judeo side and dogma tests who seek to ... and ... the Holocaust\nIn his letter camper numerous prominence scholars who vigorously condemned anyone who dared to engage in comparative genocide research\nResearch for one such author that might tape the Holocaust bite including it as a merely and I'm quoting one among the ... an array of other conflict rations in which innocence were massacred unquote\nHolocaust is unique it stands alone nothing can be compared with it\nSo said those scholars professor ... criticized as whole the cause of it is indeed according to historian Stephen Katz reading in the Nineteen nineties the Holocaust not only is unique is the only true genocide that has ever occurred\nDust when asked in Nineteen Ninety four what he thought of the recent an ongoing mass killings in Bosnia and Wanda\nCats replied that the Bosnia situation was merely and I quote a population transfer supported by violence unquote while the slaughter of eight hundred thousand people over the course of three months in Rwanda was he said not genocidal but simply a struggle for tribal domination\nSo you said at one point that the American Holocaust is as advantage to pass the wreckage from it as something that we're still dealing with today and this is maybe I can\nI'm like push you on our little back 'cause I'm Wondering if maybe it is the case that it actually is something that ... I'm In the sense that not you know we don't see government forces going out and flattering in a typical fence and indigenous communities but\nIn a way we've seen colonialism work so well that now that have anything to enforce it playing out and doing it actually made it so that communities are very very good at kind of exterminating sell 'em\nBecause I'm thinking in terms of North American reserved communities that have the highest rates of violence and all the other side alcoholism and drug dependency I'm incredibly low literacy rates and also kind of just they widespread ability as like mainstream society to make all of those things and there's an old ... certainly don't come out\nUm said we don't actually talk about them so that we can talk about\nRace and racism without actually talking about indigenous people at all and so I'm Wondering if maybe you'd be willing to say that it's still going on or if there's a particular reason why okay\nAnd you know I Would take issue just one thing that you said and it may have just been a a term that you would not maybe perhaps I wanted to use or maybe you do\nYou suggested that somehow or other the system has become so efficient I think that's not your word or phrase but the the people were doing it to themselves are destroying themselves and to me\nThe ... very close to blaming the victims of ultimately they're not doing it to themselves even those who are committing suicide I think are not doing it to themselves again that's a fine point I think but in saying that what I'm really saying is that I agree with you\nOn that yes this has become a kind of machine the goals of itself in the same way that we can have deeply racist society without any overt\nEvidence of hate speech um and and racial hatred apparent\nOn the surface of the society because we've created institutions that the ... or institutionally racist and simply take care of business on their own with or without all the rhetoric that was associated with racism in the past so I agree with that\nI guess the the distinction that I Would make 'em because I did conclude American Holocaust at the end of the nineteenth century although I did make references to um the killing in Latin America in the Nineteen horrible horrible genocidal killing Latin American living eighties comes back to the costs\nYears of trying to figure out some historians just tomato definitions of genocide and the reason they made up Jeff ... is because the genocide convention the United nations was cobbled together by a group of nations\nTo somehow make sense of and to to institutionalize a law that would say this we cannot have this anymore this is illegal and nations must act against it so in order to do that they had to define it\nThe problem is who is sitting around defining this\nPeople who represent countries that in the past and at that time were committing genocide and when it was like having the thieves sit around the table right the writing the law\nSo for example a Lincoln had always had in his definition of genocide whole groups of of political of people who would who were being exterminated because of their politics the Soviet Union had would have nothing to do with that because they had how many people\nIn the gulag at the moment that they're sitting down reading this this this genocide convention they simply could not have that as a result technically\nThe genocide in Cambodia was not genocide and they're very very few genocide scholars who will say that it was genocide\nBut most of the genocide scholars in the world today would say if it was horrible but the victims were political victims and that's why it's not a genocide same thing with the killing of Indians and part of why\nThe the killers weren't able to extricate themselves by saying yes we kill all of those people almost exterminated on tire people\nBut it wasn't because of the fact that they were Indians which would have made them a protected group but because their political activities were such that we they deserved being exterminated and therefore yes maybe that was not very humanitarian and maybe it was a crime against humanity and so and so forth but it's not genocide\nAnyway that's one of the reasons why historians have tried many historians\nAnd sociologist right above just I have tried to create their own definitions of genocide the problem with that is\nYour definition includes this group my definition includes that group such as um taking children as the United nations convention those taking children away from families and putting them among others as as happened in Australia most famously a and so on and others don't so therefore then you've lost everything\nSo I think that really what we need to do and I hate that I don't like this because I think the genocide convention as real problems\nIf it would just simply have to hold to the un genocide convention it's the only one the only thing that the definition that exist that most people have bought into\nI guess what I'm saying to come back to your point which I think is a very good one is that I think we should stay within the un definition and fight about issues within that\nAnd in that case then we have to accept the word intent however we define it as part of the justification for our use of the term genocide\nEffects are like I think that I'm thinking of the things that happened I I find as I say\nHis sermon he hadn't seen her face and I've really large wave I didn't ... when I I'm not sure it's all die\nLike if you look at the ... the uncanny and so I Know they're in a folder full of cat and a lot better but you know getting ready to read it as a slum policy I'm not sure that you can fall apart they intend to exterminate methane\nA case can be made that the genocide convention does cover them and uh uh uh people have written about that will do that and again in Australia particularly\nAs as somebody who is Native American\nChurch in Muskogee basically my family all ran off during the movie\nAnd hit out I've lived on three different reservations and\nMy kids are all members of federally recognized tribe [noise] when you're looking at genocide as as a native person\nThere was a physical genocide [noise] there is the fact of genocide\nI grew up right here in Nashville and I grew up around mainstream society being a person from a completely separate culture\nAnd having to deal with\nWhy can't you just be an American why are you still speaking that language\nAnd the school still do this my kids have had to fight the very same fights in school that I had to fight that my mother had to fight and so forth and so on where\nYou get one little chapter of maybe four pages and a few paragraphs and it's so gentle it's useless it talks about the aesthetics it talks about the southeastern people and my aunt may mentions the Cherokees and the creeks it talks about the northeastern people and it usually mentioned some all hawks\nAnd it mentioned Lakota and um\nIt's just useless it's not taught people don't understand that three fifths of all the rules food crops were developed right here in the western hemisphere\nMost of the medicines that most people use came from here we were not only the greatest agricultural is on the face of the earth we're also the greatest pharmaceutical button\nNow some of it the the alcoholism the drug abuse of a dysfunction that ah it's just within families a lot of people wouldn't know it and I hate to admit it but sexual abuse among Native Americans is astronomically higher than it is for the rest of the population\nIt started with the boarding schools are residential schools because you had kids that were taken at the age of five they didn't see their families for seven or eight years how can you be normal when you're not raised in a family when you were put into boarding school\nAnd you are beating for speaking your native language\nYou're mistreated you're sexually abused Everytime they ... they go to an old old boarding school site and they start excavating because somebody's going to build something else they start finding skeletons probably twenty five percent of Native American children who went into the boarding school disappeared [noise]\nAnd they were never found those are people who never got to grow up and never got to contribute and we weren't putting those boarding schools to make us doctors or lawyers or leaders we're put in there so that the girls could become domestic servants and the boys could become manual

R. G.\nIt's one o'clock good afternoon [noise]\n\nThe seizure of our political system white global corporations just depressing\nAnd I think that we have to confront once before us including our ... democracy\nAnd yet rise up and resist anyway that's a kind of moral imperative because we are responsible for the world than comes afterwards and even if we fail and we made for him\nBut even if we found a at least a lead those will come after us and they try and if we are passing in front of the system we are complicit in what Emanuel con when called radical even [noise]\nThat's Chris Hedges and this is the alternative radio I'm David by Sunday on this edition of a A R features Chris Hedges on rise up and resist\nWomen's enough enough in the face of evil what does it take for people to move and passivity to active resistance\nThroughout history there have been instances of people they find tyranny fighting back no matter what the odds an example comes from Nazi Germany often considered the benchmark of evil opposition to the regime was highly dangerous\nSeventy five years ago hands and so the shore brother and sister and others at the University of Munich said good new enough\nThey formed the white rose movement and cold on Germans to recognize their moral duty and overthrow the government they disseminated critical information through flyers and graffiti one such graffiti said whatever comes out of Hitler's mouth is ally\nIn Nineteen forty three hundred and so the show were arrested and beheaded their resistance and courage on there today they took risks can we\nOur guest today is Chris Hedges he's an award winning journalist who's reported from the Balkans the middle east and Central America\nHe writes a weekly column for truth the dot com he's the author of many books including America the farewell tour I talked with him in the studios of KGAN you in Boulder, Colorado\nWelcome to the program Chris Hedges thank you David well why a farewell tour because this is the end of American empire a and\nAll of the warning signs that exist when empires disintegrate are flashing red\nUh the expansion of a military machine a that is Halloween the country out from the inside\nThe erosion of civil liberties the D. industrialization of our cities the capture of our political process by a tiny cabal in this case corporate that re directs all of the institutions\nThat once made reform possible towards the further consolidation of power a and amassing of obscene amounts of wealth\nThe political system no longer functions is at least in terms of\nPropel in a society forwarded its its role in that society backwards as we enrich this tiny global financial elite and a which is largely orchestrated attacks boycott they pay little to no taxes ... Eisenhower or the wealthy\nNow they have to extract that money from a beleaguered population\nThat's why you get programs not only of austerity but debt peonage a student at one point five trillion dollars\nHousehold debts over Thirteen trillion you're late on your credit card that's twenty eight percent interest or you're going to poor communities and they're just fine to death for the most ridiculous offenses\nIncluding obstruction on pedestrian walkway is what you mean standing on a sidewalk not mowing your lawn which is actually a fine in Ferguson, Missouri because with the loss of tax revenue these counties and states\nCan't fill their budgets and because that\nOligarchy elite has rendered themselves untouchable a and we can watch massive acts of fraud by Goldman Sachs or banks and nobody's held accountable than the uh the system for its pound of flesh takes it out of the most vulnerable\nIt's from the symptom of something much deeper\nYeah Trump is a symptom of a political system that has seized up and doesn't work\nUh and that's why we're seeing Trump light figures appear\nThroughout the industrialized world Viktor Orban in Hungary or ... or ... or Boris Johnson in Britain you know the polish government just destroy their legal system the sweetest elections just brought to power these are the right wing nationalist\nBecause in essence this global financial elite have seized control of national economy as we see it in Greece and it it the citizens have a lost the ability to determine both economic and political policy\nUh and so the debate has shifted in and Thatcher and Reagan were largely responsible for this it shifted\nA towards an assault on national identity um you know they're the idea that uh uh eleven million undocumented workers are somehow responsible for the economic decline of the United states is patently absurd um but it works when you have\nCorporations controlling your media platforms and there was no rational discussion of corporate capitalism or how it works a and as we move closer towards the financial crisis and one is coming another one\nUh you will see that kind of language and incitement to violence which Trump has already done be ratcheted up\nWhat are the signs of coming economic crash you mentioned that well\nSo what happened after two thousand and eight is that the banks and the global speculators received at virtually zero percent interest twenty six trillion dollars according to the University of Missouri of fabricated money out of electronic\nEther what they did with this money was not invest it in the society\nThey didn't build new factories create new jobs the way of traditional capitals structure with\nWhat they did was hoard it by back their own stock\nThat's what they did with most of the money from the tax cuts because their compensation packages are tied that's why the overheated stock market the idea that that is somehow symbol of a healthy economy is absurd\nUh\nThey invested it and very risky ventures like fracking so fracking the the the value of the fracking industry is determined not by their profits in fact it's a money losing operation almost all places\nAnd they've had to borrow a tremendous amounts of money over two hundred and eighty billion to ...\nOn projected profits but at a certain moment that bubble burst a estimates are that within a couple of decades forty percent of the the people who have student loans will have defaulted um the system's not sustainable now what happens\nThis time around is that the elites don't have a plan B they can't lower interest rates anymore they've already lowered them which is virtually zero I'm In fact central bank some central banks in Europe were lending money at negative interest rates they would pay you to borrow money\nAnd\nFlirt with what will be the death blow of the American empire and that is the\nDay the dollar is no longer the world's reserve currency and why is that significant well because then the dollars value collapses completely I mean it's a fictitious value as it is a but it's it's held up because it is the world's reserve currency it's remains the world's reserve currency we saw\nA ... an example of that when in the Nineteen fifties the pound sterling was dropped as the world's reserve\nOne of the characteristics of late empire is that it makes disastrous military\nDecisions military fiasco so ... in the the the Indian Empire the in in ancient Greece they attempted to invade Sicily their entire fleet was sunk\nAnd uh most of their soldiers were killed ... centigrade it in fifty six Great Britain attempted to invade Egypt after Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal\nAnd had to retreat and humiliation and that led to the pound sterling being dropped as the world's reserve and that they were finished\nAnd our greatest strategic blunder\nIn American history has been the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan Seventeen years of warfare\nOr they're not winnable conflicts in fact the Taliban control is more territory in Afghanistan then when we went in there is no way to extract we've just created one failed state after another whether that's Libya Syria Iraq as a unified country doesn't exist anymore\nJournalism I mean what our politicians are you know like Bill Clinton or ... they're manufactured personalities there's no substance it's a remember the old\nClash or\nCampaign between a Al Gore and Bush who do you want to have a beer with I mean this is insane [noise] but ... they're very skillful the public relations industry which was arguably one of the most evil industries in America and making us confuse how we are made to feel with knowledge\nAnd that manipulation now courtesy of handheld devices just goes on twenty four hours a day\nOr and we are uh I think is a\nForce to and wrote that probably the most illusions society in human history meanwhile we are being impoverished stripped of our civil liberties or have amassed\nAn oligarchy ... elite that you know rivals that that existed dumb and I think is great into in terms of income inequality is worse than what took place under the gilded age and you can't maintain a democracy in an oligarchy that isn't a particularly sophisticated\nPolitical thought Aristotle a\nElaborated on that or some three thousand years ago\nWho didn't Louis Brandeis the Supreme Court justice and you can have a you can have two things you can have a democracy where you can have great concentrations of wealth that you can't have both\nRight and it Aristotle said that you know when you have that income inequality then you're only two choices are chairing a revolution\nLet's go back to ground see again because you write in your book that he would have been spared of the divide in the United states between our and you make a left and the working class\nWell\nSo I mean we had radical union movements and the ... the old CIO the old United mine workers\nAnd that\nIn the name of anti communism or the red scare they were if this rated especially in the Nineteen fifties after World War two and Alan ... written some good books on this\nWhich worse there was something she roaches a historian on that period that I didn't know I mean that that it didn't it wasn't just the Hollywood writers and Pete Seeger and dome trombone\nUh but the FBI was going into high schools with lists of quote unquote reds with no evidence\nUh and then these teachers were fired and blacklisted they couldn't work again it really is at the all through the layers of society they were purging people with a social conscience critics of capitalism\nThe effects of that were quite devastating\nUm we saw a a rise of movements in the Nineteen sixties and then this contemporary ferocious assault\nOr which began in the early seventies and Louis towels memo uh attack on the free enterprise system is kind of the blueprint for that Nineteen Seventy one Nineteen Seventy one and so from that point on word labor\nSo called right to work laws a further attack on unions only six percent now of the American workforce in the private sector is unionized at all\nBut with a right to work law employers can't even make contracts with unions are it it really expands the ability of employers to hire exclusively non union labor and so this re configuration of American society a is one\nWhere we have been left virtually defenseless as these forces role forward and and you know it was Carl ... rights and the great transformation\nA unfettered unregulated capitalism is ultimately a destructive and a self destructive force because commodity size everything we haven't even spoken about climate change it it can modifies human beings than it modifies the natural world in the name of short term profit\nOr until exhaustion or collapse and and there's no constraints anymore uh and part of the ...\nI think what all of us who read climate change report sphere\nOr is that these elites are are utterly and capable of responding rationally to the greatest existential threat to face the human species or it isn't just Trump I mean you know Trump's of climate deniers but the whole month for that we can somehow adapt\nOr the Paris climate accord which are nonbinding ah you know limits on carbon emissions I mean all of this fails to confront the gravity of of what's before us\nThe question always comes up you know these corporate managers they know the signs me getting reports you know accurate information and they have children and grandchildren so how can they be acting in ways that are endangering on their own families well\nBecause in order to become the CEO of BP um you probably have to have a psychopathic personality um these are not I I went to school with him unfortunately I was shipped off to exclusive boarding school\nAt the age of ten where is that New England evil broken and women's\nUh on scholarship so I grew up with these people uh you know I went to school with Louis Scooter Libby I Know who they are I ... I went to I Know them all and they are a incredibly entitled incredibly narcissistic\nUm they believe that their wealth will protect them\nAnd they are in gay gene in behavior that\nIn the short term makes them wealthier and more powerful and I don't think they see beyond it you know by the time you reached that level you are so winnow doubt I mean you don't you don't get I mean I worked at the New York times for Fifteen Years and\nThere's a kind of vetting process where those who rise within the New York times or any corporation do so because they exhibit a loyalty to the institution knocked to the individuals who work for it or the individuals that are exploited by it\nAnd that is a very distorted personality but institutions\nAre quite good at selecting those who who will Neal before its alter\n... and you know and I come out a seminary I mean that it is a form of id ... tree and we were taught in seminary that the danger of idols is not just that it demands human sacrifice but in the end it ... it demands self sacrifice that your finally\nSlaughtered on the altar and that's precisely what's happening they they think they're going to a skate but I mean you've got these silicon\nAnd the missile silos and the mid west where they think they're gonna ... I can tell them from from covering the former Yugoslavia that the people who rule when society breaks down or those who have the guns are and their body guards are not going to sit around and take orders from them once society disintegrates\nYou're listening to Chris Hedges on rise up and resist this is independent alternative radio you can order copies of this program and the Hedges book America the farewell tour\nBy calling one eight hundred triple for one nine seven seven that's one eight hundred for for for one nine seven seven or you can order online on our website alternative radio dot org\nThat's alternative radio dot O. R. G.\nI Want to draw a little bit on your studies of the Christian evangelical right in the United states you you wrote a book called American fascism the Christian right in the war\nOn America large numbers of evangelical Christians in in this country are on national and servants believers in capitalism eighty one percent of them voted in the two thousand sixteen presidential election\nUh for Donald Trump thrice married casino mogul who has a pension for ... and ... with porn stars and playboy bunnies how can they do that\nBecause they're cut from the same cloth live maybe this distinction of the white men who run most of these mega churches have sexual proclivities that are probably can't care than Trump um I find this whole question of\nHow can the Christian right support Trump to be an utter misreading of the Christian right I spent two years without\nA this is a movement that and I speak as a seminary graduate is heretical ... their Christian heritage six they have the culture rated the worst aspects of American imperialism and capitalism\nInto the Christian religion they sack realized it and uh you don't have to spend three years at Harvard divinity school as I did to figure out that Jesus didn't come to make us rich\nBut that\nA marriage of the iconography and language of religion of the Christian religion all you see it with Modi in India of any religion with the state or is a recipe for fascism\nAnd when I was at Harvard divinity school my great mentor James Luther Adams or had been at the University of Heidelberg in Nineteen thirty six I'm thirty seven\nPeculiar world views may be different and even repugnant to ours um but no I spent a lot of time with these people and ... you're just not going to our I mean the the whole I took a creation a seminar and so this was a class for\nA teachers and Christian schools how to teach creationism\nAnd they ... the instructor had to confront the fact that uh\nYou know the world is created in the first day but lights not created till the fourth day so what do you tell the students while you tell the students that God created a temporary like I mean it's all in the details it's ridiculous it's not in the Bible it's completely fabricated\nBut it shows you how just connected there ... is from reality and that's just you know on every single level\nOn a whole range of a public issues from a protecting environment to universal healthcare to having tuition free colleges and universities\nThese are all according to polls including one commissioned by the Koch brothers majority ... heroes yet the political class does not move forward on them why not\nBecause we don't count because we've all people know legislation we know statistically I mean legislation and laws are written by corporate lobbyists and we've been utterly different power we've we live and what Sheldon willing called a system of inverted totalitarianism and by that he means it's not\nClassical not yet not classical totalitarianism or it's not gonna stop all in death camps\nWell and it's not a a Hitler Mussolini I mean I don't think Trump has reached that point\nSo you have the facades like the late Roman Republic you have the facade of the republic but internally corporations have seized all of the levers of power to render the citizen input at a really it doesn't matter I mean it doesn't matter cabin uh commits\nPerjury I mean there's not no question he goes right on to the Supreme Court I mean it's remarkable uh the laws don't matter or at least for the rich uh and then you have a criminalization of poverty\nUh so you know mowing their lawn\nOr not mowing your lawn or standing on a sidewalk which means obstructing pedestrian traffic or or having an open container your find and jailed why because these county and state governments\nBecause nobody pays taxes and under eyes and how the wealthiest corporations and and uh individuals paid Ninety One percent\nTax or they don't have any revenue so they're they can't get it from corporations\nThe vulnerable so the pressure on the poor and the working poor is just getting worse and worse and worse and worse and there were powerless to do anything about it because the system whether it's the Democrats are the Republican the established elites are beholden to corporate money\nGrump she used to say and it's often quoted by Edward ... and ... and others saying that he had pessimism about the intellect and optimism of will or is this something that appeals to\nYes because I mean people say well you know it's so bleak it's so depressing well it's bleak and depressing um and I think the greatest existential crisis of our time is to grasp what's before us from climate change alone\nWhen if we would stop all Carmen missions today which were not doing we would still suffer catastrophic climate change\nAnd one of the reasons that climate scientists are so terrified of going beyond two degrees Celsius in terms of global warming is that they know from studying other planets like Venus which once had water and now is eight hundred degrees that triggers feedback loops which you can't control there's nothing you can do that\nAnd they've run mathematical scenarios on those loops that range from Seventy percent die off of the human species to complete extinction\nLots bleak and it's depressing um the seizure of our political system by corporate power global corporations are is depressing\nAh you know the fact that sixteen million hungry children go to bed and America every night is depressing as if the fact that we have to point three million prisoners twenty five percent of the world's prison population over half of whom were never charged with physically harming anyone is depressing\nAnd I think that we have to confront what's before us including our failed democracy\nAnd yet rise up and resist any way that it's a kind of moral imperative because we are responsible for the world that comes after us and even if we fail and we may fail but even if we fail at least let those will come after us say they tried a and if we are passive\nIn front of the system we are complicit in what Emanuel conned would call radical evil\nIn Nineteen eighty eight the NASA scientists James Hansen I went to Capitol Hill and for the first time\nI talked about a ... what was happening with the climate see sowing increasing warming of the earth's temperature and the potential dangers that that may pose a down the line well here we are Thirty years later\nWith the U.S pulling out of the Paris climate agreement accord with even with all its problems\nAnd we are rapidly hurdling toward the abyss\nWell climate change was first identified as a problem in Nineteen oh five\nNineteen sixty five right\nNo Nineteen over ... over yes it was a scientist in Europe I forget from Sweden or somewhere down a fight it\nUh but then you had acts on their scientist in the seventies understood the nature of global warming edits danger so it's we've known for a long time the elites have certainly no uh but unfortunately they chose their own\nPersonal profit and the prophet of their corporations over human life uh and\nThat's why I don't hold out any hope for the elites I mean we have to remove the system from power\nA we have to overthrow the corporate state and that comes through mass acts of sustained nonviolent civil disobedience such as we saw an Standing Rock such as I saw in East Germany chuckle so hockey in Romania or we're finished and we don't have much time left\nAre you familiar with the recent example of arming yeah\nCorrect yeah oligarchy ... in ... gene or that was literally a overthrown by hundreds of thousands of people in the streets shutting\nDown because what happened in East Germany I mean I was in Alexander plots was half a million East Germans and the ... state was the most efficient security and surveillance state in human history into our own\nThis is the twenty fifth anniversary of the Oslo Accords which which side denounces Palestinian versus ...\nAh since then the possibilities of an independent viable Palestinian state has receded under both Republican and democratic administrations what'd you see in terms of the future for the Palestinians and for the region as a whole\nWell I mean that's why I support the boycott divest sanction movement because it's the only weapon we have left Israel's worried about it um that movement has gained a fair bit of traction in Europe um they are seeking the Israeli lobby decriminalize it here in the United states\nOr I mean we talk about Russian interference in the elections how about Israeli interference in the elections I mean they literally a pack gives money to candidates and\nUh obviously the assault is worse and worse especially cutting off funding us funding to unravel the un relief agency\nRyan refugees provides food I mean most people in Gaza depend at this point they live in the largest open air prison in the world\nUm don't have access I mean Israel has bombed the sewage treatment plants so the whole coast of Gaza is filled with raw sewage they bombed the power plants a of Ninety eight percent of the water is you can drink\nA no it's just a horror show and\nAh the extremism of the Netanyahu government which has openly racist\nA is a few steps away from calling for the extinction if not the force to deportation of the Palestinians I mean they already living ring ghettos even in the west bank if you look at the military roads and the settlements and everything else so [noise]\nYeah the failure on the part of the international community to respond to this horrific a violation of international law and humanitarian crisis is really a terrible terrible stain um but of course the Palestinians are are poor and powerless some um our yeah everyone's quite willing to sell them out\nBut Washington is is the great enabler not just of course financial or satellite a BBS movement so important in the United states\nTalk about um again a\nAttitudes as superior attitude that I see on the left let's say or in liberal circles oh I Can't I Can't support Chris Hedges you know he voted for Nader ah I Can't support this person because she can eat\nI Can't you know support this I Can't get involved with this person because uh they drive an SUV pretty soon there's nobody

it like that you realize that really never had democracy in the west ever the many of the poor never controlled government\nHe'd be the whole point of the American constitution the very point of the German constitution of the French 'cause you're in the Greek um sufficient the whole point of our so called liberal democratic constitutions\nWas how to keep the the most out of the markets how to ensure that the people would never be in power\nThat they would be consult that's that that would be made to feel that they somehow controlled government without control\nIf you read the newspapers it's especially it it's all about checks and balances where checks and balances are not meant\nYou know to keep you know the executive from Tom pulling a rights or the rights of the ... to being defined no\nIt was all about how to make sure that the property that lights up at one percent of maintain that gave him all that might get the crazy idea and he's had a about the distribution of property by their lives over ... wealth and assets\nAnd indeed\nWhen people talk to me about China these days it's always slanted demographic yeah well\nWhat was the west they remember capitalism grew up in the nineteenth century in this country but also in Europe with the exception of England and parts of Scotland would have had to read the stuff that's\nEmerging at the end of the ... century\nLet me remind you that in the nineteenth century libertarianism\nWas defined as the ideology that would be bottom forty competing against the idea of democracy even somebody I Believe that a ... and a wonderful person ... you know sort of a\nVery good writer um defender of women's rights jumps to your meal the al ... was announced the Democrats\nHe believes that democracy was an all from the system of government and she did not encourage 'em one person one vote ever he was actually fighting against it so liberalism was juxtaposed against the markers\nAnd it was only the great financial crisis of the gun\nThe Eighteen forties and then we're ... we're charged in the Eighteen eighties and then immediately after about ten of the century the next financial can access which in the first decade of the twentieth century gave you the Federal Reserve\nAnd then also the Nineteen twenty nine he was only these processes I think they did buy financial collapses that\nCreate it's effectively\nPrice for the word democracy suddenly we started having these this this what used to be a contradiction in terms we talk about liberal democracy liberalism was against democracy the to wear like saying you know social acceptance\nLiberal democracy to some of the plant intellectuals the nineteenth century would have found that it's like you the the um ...\nHave the full about affect me what I'm saying that democracy has many enemies if we ever get the chance or democratic decision making process\nI either at the level of the town hall or the level of our states the liberal and federal governments we must count themselves lucky because that is so very few points\nIn the history now collected you see when we actually had something that his emulate democracy and you can see the incredible war against any vestiges of democracy anywhere where they are\nWhen I was in government in two thousand Fifteen I was struck by two things that are being sent by other powerful men and of course they were men and women are not that they said something that\nI didn't know which is one thing you know for us we'll see what our eyes and think big thoughts on auto he's quiet and one thing to imagine that this is what the\nMen said to one another whether or not it's actually hit with your own is like the kitchen and the two men that I'm defending the one who was about a ... bomber and the other was both from started with the German finance means I remember when I met Barack Obama in the white\nHouse is actually extremely nuts and very encouraging on a personal basis first thing he said and took me aback without he said look you arrive in your analysis we have never discussed before I was writing my knowledge about the ... how it had to be cops\nAnd this ... and the steady thing my company had gone farther pot and head when you look so completely right but you've got to compromise because you know\nThat are very few degrees of freedom in this world and before I said well I can say if the president\nI wake up in the morning and go to bed at night dreaming of compromise but I'm not going to be compromised is fundamental difference between the two and she's smiling you know you know he's and he said look when I was like I said I I'm I'm semi immigration\nAnd I go back to my hotel downtown Seattle\nAnd I I as a prank I tweets that tomorrow not stuck or the will stay stuck or change is going to collapse everyone's going to happen\nWhen crimes because people would be yeah\nEven if I did as a joke it will happen I can give you examples where you're gonna have a fantastic theory which does not so much for the diction does not materialize only because it became known so that's the opposite a good theory which is violated by the facts because it was good\nAnd it brought cod Duncan theory which was confined him just because it was made public see you see the difference nature doesn't give a damn about\nPredictions but so site the ease our predictions because society is what you and I do and what you and I do depends on what you and I believe\nSo if we be something and something will change with our belief that believe the change in really feeds into a different social and economic outcome so the phenomenon that we're spending as economists\nIntertwined in the city can be linked to our own feelings about it say comics his bottom of the phenomenon it tries to explain so we like you know attach chasing and sometimes that's what I can ever be science ever anybody who doesn't go\nTo the science is either the fool or just trying to fool you there's no federal ... and ... that is of course\nThe economists have never predicted any significant economic event in the history of captains\nAnd never will therefore\nIf there are no experts and the comics is not the signs what we do\nWe what we need to do we ... we need each one of us to become able to tackle economic questions with a degree of what\nThat means we have a ... a political and moral duty to become acquainted with the ways of capitalism is the system they cannot mix them we live in\nSo as to prevent the economists from holding us about how capitalism works for some people that that was fooling us on purpose or they need to fool themselves you know do what they're doing because you know it's a very boring life and the only way of\nMaintaining this um process of pseudo science is by convincing yourself of what you're doing science so but he's been with\nHumility with empathy who sympathy you know like lost children that they need your support\nWhat would you don't need is them to convince you that they know what is the answer to the headsets to Donald Trump's back Scott's corporate tax cuts\nTo the questions about the prime of change you as much of an expert as anyone else and this is the beauty of democracy\nBecause democracies Oscar Wilde\nIt's too long to many long evenings the same likes to democracy it's it's a pain clinic or you know I got involved in political processes back into thousands of feet and I can tell you that the find them extremely boring the whole the whole democratic process ease the pain sitting in parliament I suppose the same thing happen cnncom Chris\n... is ... ... ... ... not to do with politics by the way it's all the bureaucratic process buff as Winston Churchill said he'd be the best of all of its ... and here's how long have you what am I from the Sam\nIs the evolution the history of that has led to the society in which we find is\nThat once upon a time power\nWas one\nFear one rattling the lord of the land\nThe bottom the king ... in medieval Europe in the city had over power\nWas military ...\nAnd because he would consider to meet the power to get political power and the ends up men's he was rich which means he always had to make them\n\nHappy ... rapture of these units under your animal power split into two different realms the political and economic before that the weather you cannot didn't mean anything it's no\nHarvard University when he was set up Cambridge invested in Britain yeah all the great universities in the world didn't even consider having an economics reporter and by the way the comics not exactly what they called him he didn't mean anything\nWhen the engine which talks about the economic ... equals means home home economics means how to manage your house was then I can do with what we refer to them\nBut what happened was the victim of the bedrooms in England and Scotland\nWhich was necessary to replace them with cheap because there will be the sheets rule was valuable in the new international trade routes that had been established you'd do advances in Beijing and shipping\nSuddenly those Seventy percent of the president's where the victim witness for the isn't Britain you mentioned that they had nowhere to know\nSeventy oldest\nLabel is extracted from the land and they have to knock on doors from nearby villages and say I will do anything for the loaf of bread that's the first legal to my first time in human history when people actually selling\nThe labor selling it becomes ... and\nImmediately land became a commodity because suddenly we knew how much it was worth every acre because we knew how much will grow and think the last one was the price of who was the time and in fact nationally\n\nIf you throw into this mix Charles wants from Boston convention the steam engine yeah have you ever ... first factory but suddenly you have a new social class which is neither ... nor London loads\nThat have something called financial power or economic power so for the first time in human history the world of political power that animal political power and the ... is a split the merchants and the factory owners suddenly had begin to have\nPower money that they didn't have any more more recently\nHad another splits the economic sphere was dissected divided and multiply the game between industrial power and financial power so the ... ...\nSo this is what this has been happening and to us we are now eating in a world where the financial without going through all our lives in that field power\n... seconds and\nThe political sphere has lost all of our democracy is confined to the least bothersome sphere the political sphere and this is why\nThis ... flowers being crushed if you start thinking in those thumbs\nAnd then stop applying very basic ideas about you know how that few in profits\nSo that is to got to listen to that which had at least was founded on presence but absolutely essential for captains\nAnd how the control of financial power by the bankers makes them\nEffectively masters of the universe because if their bets ... succeeds they become thinking rich if they said you bail them out\nYeah saves them thinking in those times it's not difficult very quickly to acquire and economic expertise which if you look at it than democracy has a chance to give it a much [noise]\nYou're listening to young a slow to focus on how capitalism works this is an independent alternative radio you can order copies of this program and the book\nTalking to my daughter about the economy by calling one eight hundred triple for one nine seven seven to one eight hundred for a for for\nNineteen Seventy seven\nOr you can order online on our website alternative radio dot org that's alternative radio dot O. R. G.\nAh my question is in evaluating how to use our resources effectively and how to empower people economically\nWhat is the use of economic analysis so using the head tax example\nMaybe they had to act with a bad idea that there may be taxing incomes as a better idea are trying to tax revenue in some way or the better idea so using economic to evaluate alternative auctions and decide on the best one\n[noise] but I think that's you know why don't we just try something that is not often be dried common sense\nBeginning most vague goals beget today and then probably Europe as well\nHad ruining the finance ministers of Germany did exactly want the Hoover many station did here they went to steady the minds\nOf Saturday and that is I was displaced price the gun to fall and on the climate of course balloons if you look at the\nElectoral results and I've done bumped a for instance you know local government elections as well as president elections environment and public silently you see as prices that eight different vision goes below zero in other words you're ever the ducks and in fact this suddenly the Nazi school from two percent\nTo eight percent Seventeen percent since the three percent in the space of Eighteen months that's what I'm saying that the nation breeds months that's in Greece\nMike I'm liberal country huh we\nHave a very proud that I could of having full ... to ... navy against not just in this country as we speak ladies and gentlemen the third largest spot in parliament they were sitting opposite me where am I mean it's the biggest said was out of Nazis beneath nuts\nAnd they\nSprung up in two thousand and two well just those prices were falling\nThere's there's no magic formula here I'm not looking for some kind of very sophisticated what I'm saying is very simple\nCapitalism to reach a stage where prices actually phoney and falling and I have to go see something it must have\nLost its within completely you know the the working class um he's facing unemployment and the same time you have small businesses who lose all gossiping because one passes for you know what happens\nIf ... let's say you wanted to buy a fridge refrigerator and then you can see the sky is falling why by today why not wait a few months and by more cheaply but he's everybody does with the democracy refrigerators dies huh so in Germany today\nGermany has benefited significantly from the European crisis in from a big crisis on paper\nIn the sense off a massive flight the money from the rest of Europe to the banks in Germany because people fear in Italy and Greece and Spain that our country's would get out of the European Union a lot of the you know a lot of the you know the common currency is that we would go back to\nAnd ... and inflates has gotten him see the news is value so they take their savings in the system to science you have a German Government has is that since ... and so on a cell phone at the same time\nOf Slate's I below zero\nSo what that does is that the bushes that eight different times of pension funds private pension France and Germany the negative rates so the average middle class person in Germany even if they have jobs mhm see their nest egg come down because interstate's a negative and\nThat has led to the rise of the will to not be for them it's a racist very right wing xenophobic policy that has gone from zero to ... percent in one year and now if it were elections today that we get ... percent so that's what I mean by ... breeding political moms\nSo I'm a little skeptical that just trying to make common citizen into a economic expert is\nGoing to end up in good results basically democracy is sort of an accumulation of everybody's self interest and in the accumulation of that hopefully you end up with a good policy but\nOn an economic standpoint it's I mean wouldn't you always be voting for a low interest rates and access to the cash register\nWhy would we get to the point where we would show um\nYou know and and ... understanding of the interplay of economics that would end up with the fact of posts say\nLook you have every reason to be skeptical a ... there's no way I can prove that you're you're wrong but that is also a reason to be skeptical about democracy\nBecause let's face it it's so easy to have people that are divided\nAnd each one of us looking after that own basically it'll into this or something that is as you put him and failing to get together in order to create collectively the concept of the common good and the common will it's so easy to face about it so easy\nTo become susceptible and victims of sensitive to the forces that plus the bug\nAnd allows to go what Margaret touches vision of society was that there is no such thing as society member when she said that in the Nineteen eighties and she mentioned philosophically in the same way she actually to your thinking or skepticism and turn it into philosophy\nShe lives about age and stuff from the fear of all how can the fear of the the agony of how can we pull together and create the common will by saying we towns and we shouldn't there's no such thing as a society we're just individuals and families that which is that\nIn that interview she gave the woman's own magazine that members I used to live in Britain\nUnforgettable it was a very courageous thing to say is completely ... percent profit\nBut at the same time extremely courageous I liked people speak their minds and it has an interesting philosophical really negative and logically pessimistic but nevertheless it's really interesting philosophical base\nAnd I I miss market factor you know why because she was appointed vision blacks who said what she believes in\nCase somebody may say that Donald Trump does to you from a review right you know it's called Mexicans rapists and he gets away with and she believes it to maybe go back to it whether we think\nThe reason why we don't agree with you frankly because if I Do then I Would not have the energy to wake up in the morning\nBecause you may be what you just said and its victims to basically there is a good chance you're right that I personally speaking this is my own personal statement I Will lose lose the will to live\nOK I'm I I don't know what I'm going to do I want to write another book was it\nTo be a mess but he has the silver lining or if you wanted a smidgen of hope that I went to ... says something about says things that\nDo you know why I'm optimistic about democracy is not the thing is to take them into finding what you make of each one of our imaginations there's no such thing as a self independence of one another\nYou see the leap into the buying the valley but I'm Single so the beginning wave someone's holds going to take you to join look speaking for the software for them is that you know these are some societies that individuals they are\nSome of the time and they are autonomous they know what they like and what they like what they do and they do what they like and all that yeah I Would like to do other things but they have constrains so the matter is an ex con springs to mind but if you in the ... I'm going to kill the philosophy\nSay guilty because the Scottish in there yeah um\nAnd then ... democracy is all about as you pointed synthesizing mind watching mines that itself into this with lets him in your ... doesn't find some kind\nOf a couple of days so that was an old be reasonably unhappy\nBut in a way that we're not best friends yeah yeah that's that's the that's the Anglo Celtic liberal position\nBut I think\nAnd the where politics comes from the west politics and the ancient Greek Democrats believe that democracy can only go in the corners\nBecause we have communities and self\nMakes no sense outside the policies if you grow up in the jungle on your own by some machine that looks after you know the Japanese have created these him as my ... my reasons and I can look up the children the elderly you know you could see that it could grow up in the John ... without any human\nBeing next to you you're not going to be human being you're going to be sent much you're going to be a very sad non human\nSo the only reason why you and I humans and we have a self interest is because we do it that ... that's another good work\nIn other words I could not know who I Am on the left side of the flex myself in your eyes and you buy some of us so myself into this cannot be defined as the primary if you're surfing through from where I come from from my last you know so in other words\nIt's all politics you know what the Illinois mosque understands as he said that it did not come from the ... eleven months it came from within in a mosque as well because it is out of socialization of functioning in the context of the foreigners\nBut he says the self interest each one of our self interest is to be fine collectively why can't we defined collectively what these in the public interest as well so", "show_name": "Alternative Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "01", "locations": [["the United states", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Seattle", 47.60621, -122.33207], ["Osaka", 34.69374, 135.50218], ["China", 35.0, 105.0], ["England", 44.0, -71.0], ["Scotland", 56.0, -4.0], ["Seattle", 47.60621, -122.33207], ["Britain", 41.66121, -72.77954], ["England", 44.0, -71.0], ["Scotland", 56.0, -4.0], ["Beijing", 39.9075, 116.39723], ["Britain", 41.66121, -72.77954], ["Boston", 42.35843, -71.05977], ["London", 51.50853, -0.12574], ["Germany", 51.5, 10.5], ["Hoover", 33.40539, -86.81138], ["Greece", 39.0, 22.0], ["Germany", 51.5, 10.5], ["Germany", 51.5, 10.5], ["Germany", 51.5, 10.5], ["Italy", 42.83333, 12.83333], ["Greece", 39.0, 22.0], ["Spain", 40.0, -4.0], ["France", 46.0, 2.0], ["Germany", 51.5, 10.5], ["Germany", 51.5, 10.5], ["Britain", 41.66121, -72.77954], ["Illinois", 41.85003, -87.65005]], "not_found": [], "ep_coords": ["San Francisco, CA", 37.77493, -122.41942], "in_country": ["the United states", "Seattle", "England", "Seattle", "Britain", "England", "Britain", "Boston", "Hoover", "Britain", "Illinois"], "out_country": ["Osaka", "China", "Scotland", "Scotland", "Beijing", "London", "Germany", "Greece", "Germany", "Germany", "Germany", "Italy", "Greece", "Spain", "France", "Germany", "Germany"], "in_state": [], "out_state": ["the United states", "Seattle", "Osaka", "China", "England", "Scotland", "Seattle", "Britain", "England", "Scotland", "Beijing", "Britain", "Boston", "London", "Germany", "Hoover", "Greece", "Germany", "Germany", "Germany", "Italy", "Greece", "Spain", "France", "Germany", "Germany", "Britain", "Illinois"]}]
