Greek tragedy um\nWas when we presenting the community and the commanding the action\nOf course in the ... no Greek chorus\nUh bought 'em there will be ugly chorus on stage or they will not singing bad they will react to the action as the community and it was important for me also to\nUm differing shaped the the action someone takes as an individual and when he's in the community and the group and how the group is powerful and um when [laughter] and I think I'm\nAssigned the case it's also the community wants to war and the community wants to sacrifice\nAnd the community will will drive that um because they want to then be able to win the war in ...\nSo I'm I'm military glory is very important to a very important theme in in ...

quartet\nOut on the ... label and um this was accorded at St Stevens church in your right yes graduating high place ah\nYeah so you're in residence at the San Francisco's conservatory and I think that's where you met\nUp to this yeah where most of us in it are the only when you find that affirmative action in the beginning was Jeremiah and we we met him outside of school but I'm Eric failing lander of your list and I we all kind of worked chamber majors\nAt ... pm and wear honored and delighted to now be content residents they're working with all the wonderful faculty and students\nSo what does being and residents in town in this case\nWell wait where are we joined a gym music faculty so we we and we coached the college chamber groups\nAnd we're also part of the pre college faculty division on that's on Saturdays and we also coached chamber music in private lessons there as well\nAnd we're involved in a lot of the um uh you know performance is going to retrain redo collaborations with many of the faculty and the students so are we actually we have one coming up we're we're going to do on the ... cat\nOh how nice part of our a faculty concert that on um Ninety nine months worth of Jamie for the chamber majors well when when is that a chamber allow him having ...\nAnd and then Maria van der ... a\nA sand lives are and are currently center so they're all involved in the the major program that Eric failing and I came out\nAnd you have some countries coming out that we should let people know about and they're all on your website yes uh but I think you're playing at the crowd in schools that yeah that that's right upcoming as a force mhm and then also San Francisco performance is kind of yeah\nThat's a that's kind of an um Eastern European concept for during um or when she'll have a five pieces for sugar tank check composer then divorced shocks love on a court at and then um\nAnother composer who is not often I'm Kurt or not not in the past but more recently now a mixed lab Lindberg ... is I think it's it's hundreds when in twenty Nineteen will be his hundredth birthday year\nOr so have six courts had wonderful kind of ... a very um well you dish a theater kind of peace\nI'm In much in the vein of shots the coverage\nAnd how did you decide to haul yourselves to telegraph quartet where did not come\nThat may have been one of the hardest obstacles to overcome as a string quartet [laughter] I don't think we could have done it if we didn't have a deadline [laughter] coming out saying that we had to figure out a name well we had an area that we had a name before telegraph\nYeah aren't out there was another group that more than another like couple of thousand years or so\nThrough a whole list and and um but but basically the idea is that it's regional so you know you have to like grass ill and depending on whether you're from San Francisco it's named after telegraph element of if you're you know from Berkeley thought about that [laughter]\nIn a way like it's an old type of technology that communicate\nUm we kind of feel that we're kind of one foot in one Aaron one in the other week play you know lovingly the music of the usual standard the Eighteen hundreds I'm Seventy engineered you noted but then we want to kind of show that connection\nBetween that music the emotional connection in particular between that and the worker twentieth century you know that it's not the kind of like for gated thing\nJust to reinforce the idea of the the geographical location I think that's something important to us to to kind of show where we come from because that's a the community is a big part of who we are there support and so\nYeah that's great all all very good reasons for the navy Benjamin Britten is a composer we're going to listen to next he wrote three string quartets I think and then these three different and then the so how did the three diverting anti fit in and just sort of string quartet um\n... uh\nOr whatever it was a a a failed struggles [laughter] pretty good job of it is for\nA string quartet when he was about what I I guess twenty or um\nUh and he uh he wrote the first we move he started on another one and it was ... ... it wasn't very good [laughter] and he put it away and then three years later I Believe he went back and revise them and it was just kind of sweet um and then of course later you wrote the first quarter\nWhich uh I think was commissioned by Elizabeth spread Coolidge but yeah\nOkay well let's listen to it again it's just a telegraph quartet and their new recording called into the light\nBenjamin Britten three to ... from Nineteen thirty six\n[noise]\n[noise]\nSort of switching off\nOn first and second violins\nAnd not having a sort of dedicated first filing a second violinist\nI think the advantages just keeps things spicy moving around and everybody on their toes of course of this advantage as as you know if you're sitting in the same spot\nAll the time you can kind of learn a particular sound a type of a role if you will and that is um of course an important thing but right now we're uh we we enjoy moving around\nAnd I'm just exploring the different aspects of the the different parts of the they're quite different uh uh we we kind of choose\nHow do we choose we just pick and never seems to be a problem which is great um knock on wood [noise]\nUh and\nI think both of us have probably played parts of both of the court has to know if I've played a piece before then maybe I tried the other part and it's interesting it's a completely different experience ... second it's like a different piece of a different perspective different world\nTrade Center perspective or you're talking to a lot of it allows us\nI mean you know you'd have to play another instrument in order to uh try with a view of lower the cello um and it wouldn't necessarily be professionally viable but for us it gives us the ability to kind of empathize I think with one another and then you know it's kind of in a way it gives us insight into\nHow we can help the other person up so interesting and it's also it does change is I Would agree with that again it can be a challenge and it can be a plus in some ways because it creates a slightly different\nUm found an interpretation for the group so just naturally\nAnd what is your rehearsals schedule like you mean do you need it the conservatory for reversals you meet sort of you had your own practice time and then you get together\nIt's a mix of course um we ... a judgment failings apartment and Oakland and as well as the conservatory we have a studio there we share with Bonnie Hampton and other chamber coaches but we we have a student that we can use most most days um but there is limited space in the conservatory what\nKind of communal yang and we're all kind of in it together all sharing more musical ideas and and um locations and so we kind of rebalance that and and um we're we're in about five six days a week and ah yeah we tried to keep it\nPretty intense as far as there are so casual concern\nYeah it's very interesting about the San Francisco's conservatory and contemporary music because on the one hand there are some\nThat have come out at the conservatory onto those specializing in contemporary music and\nIt's you know it's it's a it's great\nAnd composers who live taught there over the years and um it's great that way and on the other hand\nYou know I so the reason I play\nThe piano is that when I was seven years old I met Sharon men and started studying with her and I she was my mentor through my whole life and we're very close and um\n[noise] but she\nYou know her students pretty much feel that um nobody in the twentieth century is going to be equivalent or sort of on the same level as the great\nYou know the great canon of Beethoven military and so on and so I teach a class on twentieth century keyboard literature\nAnd the first day I asked the students what twenty century music at the plate and they say well I played some did you see ... not a I played for coffee and this concerto and it's like what what what is going on you know where is the twentieth century it it just um\nYeah well I mean it's ... all I'm saying is that conservatories are very interesting because I encountered that at other schools also on the east coast I mean all over the country all over the world they're a conservatory they're they're very\nIn some ways they're incredibly conservative and sort of the night the existence of anything after Nineteen ten and on the other hand there are as I say there are some great composers and students and ensemble specializing in contemporary music that have come out of the conservative yeah\nAnd there are number like the friction court I've just recently yeah they they they were kind of born there um and you know like non symbol sex I mean it it it's interesting I mean I think you get this this mix you have a on one side of real a\nDedication to the the cannon and then on the other a very kind of open um experimentation I mean in the chamber class we have a a composer on the panel now who are also speaks to this is David Gardner oh yeah we've worked on us on the fence as we played as a\nAs a second course had the conservatory in the recent past and um\nI wouldn't say that we're trying to change anything but we're we're also dedicated you know in our time there to exploring\nWorks for the twentieth century that again might not be I'm running to very often will be doing the vine grove and that just love Feinberg on or a spring concert and alongside of Beethoven up is one thirty ... and um you know in the past week the Germans first court that now I Know that's not quite getting [laughter]\nForeign twenty century but we hope to kind of continue with his his work and into the more dangerous areas of Paul Sherman burger familiar and thirties yeah yeah more exotic like\nA I think pianist are probably more conservative maybe [laughter] but\nWas an incredible experience though to work with living composers I mean it's the experience that back and forth that I think so\nYeah it makes me think completely differently if other composers um if you had a chance to talk to them and talk to them about some some things are I think a lot of them would be more flexible than the way we translate their markings ... or maybe some of them not I think some of them would be just as a precise about\nUh what they wrote\nUm but that that's an experience that you just can't get with those you know can't do that with Beethoven he's well he's gone yeah and there are people now that are writing wonderful great pieces and we can talk to them about it if we can get inside their head and then understand that kind of\nUm that that perspective how the how pieces born that is one side of the way they\nMore I didn't score study as much as I probably should have and now the up and doing more works are doing with composers I look at it because I you know that's the whole picture right it's but it's just kind of silly to look at a part though\nYeah absolutely let's listen to a Leon parishioner from your CD this was a piece he wrote in Nineteen forty nine or anything you want to say about it before you listen\nIt's a I think I'm not sure if I mentioned before but it's like kind of heavily influenced by our talk you know you've been studying mushroom Bergen\nUm I just kind of a wild ride um I think if he had been fired by the kind of music and attempts kind of folk quality of our talk but at the same time it's his own language it is um maybe in some ways\nMore tumultuous way kind of um pulls the listener around by their ears very quickly from one thing to another highly traumatic but very lyrical and time\nLet's listen to it again from the telegraph quartet new see called into the light just out on the Central Asia\n[noise]\n\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Revolutions Per Minute", "city":

Elizabeth Baker but we're going to uh have her on the phone in about\nTen minutes she has this very intriguing album called called ... that has just come out electronics piano toy piano lots of uh\nLots of instrumentation and it's on band camp and various platforms so let's begin before we talk with her\nBefore I talk with her let's begin with his head space and I don't know if we'll have time to listen to the whole thing I'll be speaking with her and about eight minutes or so had space by Elizabeth speak\n[noise]\n\n\n\nYou've taught in schools you mentioned your classical guitar background you're visual artists published author you published ... books and had a guard dog and you're still relatively young are you in your twenties\n[noise] I just turned thirty in August\nOh congratulations that's great congratulations\nSo you prefer to be called a new renaissance artist can you explain what that means\n[noise] so I look at it as rented the renaissance\nIs a state of constantly learning and re creation and re bird\nAnd knew because I didn't want people to think of the renaissance fair and turkey leg mhm um and then of course artists because ultimately everything is art and everything I Do is art and\nThat kind of made sense to me and so that was the term that made more than than like multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary artists\nRight right and it all goes together as it doesn't this on this album\nAnd when you create your own label then you don't have to deal with the expectations\nThat everyone else has so you can define you can define how you want\nBut isn't this on another label dishes and this was on but no I mean the label of\nOh yes yes yes exactly yes um\nWe spent time together last December at your home it was really wonderful and you your hospitality we talked a lot about music your mother is British she's a black woman your father's black men from Florida you have both conservatives and liberals and your family and I'm interested in this complex background with\nUh all these elements work and the fact that there are relatively few black women in experimental music and I noticed affects your experience out in the world but I Wonder if it affects your music\nI Know you work a lot with text and some of this is sort of don't within\nIn text but ah\nYeah does does it have an effect on your music\nOr I think every experience today has has an effect on my music uh particularly a lot of my electronic stuff because I work on my electronic music at night if\nI work on my piano music by day and my electronic music finite so uh I'm In my studio and it's like for blackout curtains\nAnd it really is like the time for me to sit with my little at is involved in my family and rocks and and just sort of met its heat on\nThe things that have happened during the day things that I'm I'm thinking about from like a scientific point of view or personal point of view and so for me a lot of my electronic stuff is like a phonics meditation ... ritual and\nFrom there specifically 'cause you just played heads the heads we started off as a sonic ritual for me to sort of process all of these emotions that we are going on that I didn't quite know how to speak about with other people\n[laughter] not I mean I don't know learning stuff about\nIt [laughter] you know I look at pieces and I think I Know what it's about but then it it's sort of flipped on me and I think about it in different ways and there's always something new that I'm worried about myself in my music\nSo even what I thought about at seven months ago is on the thing I think about it a now so it's\nIt's really interesting and and not plays into you know the piano he is um which is the only piece that uh I did not write the one that was written by Nathan quarter oh so he wrote that for me a few years ago and um\nI we now call it and we now see that it's in it's toddler stage\n... because when I first started performing it it requires a like a very like sure performers to command the amount of space the various Feldman lot like be Thirteen minutes pi I'm\nSo at first I was very afraid and I was counting for my life and now it's just it's actually really meditative and um I've been working on traffic memories so I'm\nActually seen 'em sock shave right next to try out memories and then I leave my practice space and and just this wonderful chills oh\nYeah yeah and Nathan quarters a composer here and we're working with and are collaborating with and you'll be here in January um talk in the studio and you use your mother's voice in lateral seizes beat frequency such such\nGreat to be able to use her voice it's yes yeah\nI'm really excited because I'm I'm working on my third book right now um which is called the resident white\nAnd it's um it's all like a motivational book with some places for people to do personal reflection and I talk about what I've learned from the craziness that is my life um [noise] and all of the wonderful for stories I have and all these different things\nUm and my mom will actually be doing the e book or the audio book rather so everyone gets to listen to my mother's pleasant British voice\nAnd the great oh my story\nIs wonderful and your own voices is on some of these um tracks also on the quad with him so where did the title come from quad with him\nSo ... is the last book in the medieval\n... wage curriculum so to speak or there's the trivia and and then the ... which covers number theory geometry um\nMusic and I'm losing some things\nRight now [laughter] it's thirty at night they're so yeah\nYou know but it's a ... and if the book that lives in my studio ... it's a book that I turn to quite often when I'm looking for inspiration um I really enjoy it because\nThere are incredible visuals about music so lateral fees isn't the frequency is actually has visual component to it that we don't normally think of like when we're looking at music I mean now we\nDo because we have specter grams and stuff but you know to think of back then were\nAppreciating scientist thing but\nYeah it's interesting to look at tuning series from that time and that sort of um\nMusic of the fears philosophy and so on will do yeah that's wonderful so your album available now it's on the air okayed label and people can also find lots of information on your website which is I think the
