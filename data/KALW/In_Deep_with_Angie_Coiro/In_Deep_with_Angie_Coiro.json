[{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "For more election coverage gotta K. L. W. dot org\nAnd visiting with with them in ... San Francisco the time has nine o'clock up next in deep within ... stay tuned\nI'm Angie ... and this is indeed one full hour on one intriguing topic so Mali brought us her book rage becomes or the power of women's anger right after the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings\nThe research in her book indicates that just by virtue of their gender the women in our audience already carried issues with internalized anger and how to express it\nNow we'd be discussing it well women's fury was one of the number one topics in the country ... is a lifelong students of gender inequality issues she made activism her career director of the women's media center speech project she works for women's freedom of expression and against online harassment and abuse\nShe's written for time the birds guardians of the nation huff post and the Atlantic language alert there are two instances of what the FCC considers obscene speech we have bleep those out\nWe started of course with what everyone had been glued to the testimony of the steady\nPolite professor Christine Blasey Ford and the indignities furious red cat how\nWhat were some of your thoughts as you watched the cabinet hearing and as you watched him express all of his anger\n[noise] so I was sad\nAnd angry and depressed I also last because I had never ever thought I'd see a day when a man would use calendar ring\nTo signal Philly all legacy yeah\nSo as he's crying very feminine thing he's saying but I'm the son of a father and I admire my father and human need to tow the patriarchal line even though I'm Crying and I might be a little boy who needs the care of the white women around me\nAnd what were you thinking in terms of how and I do not want to comment on Dr for his presentation herself and I don't want to make any assumptions about what was going on in her head yeah but watching her\nAnd watching how nice she was and how she was smiling through some of her testimony put me in mind when we yeah your woman recounting a trauma and they're so damn nice\nGoing down the rental yes yeah I mean I think that most women would recognize the tight rope she was walking on right be assertive but not too assertive be kind\nBut definitely not angry even though you need to act in self defense what struck me about what she was doing throughout was she kept adjusting right she kept she kept fixing her Mike and she kept saying well does it work for you\nAnd that actually maybe made me fatter than almost anything else because she was actually the only person in the room that should have been able to express indignation and anger at her humiliation\nAnd at the trauma that she was being put through again and yet she was the personal least able to do that\nShe pretty much performed and I think that's the right word in a way that many women are socialized to perform in those situations not because we irrationally think we're going to be punished but because we will be punished right and so she happens to be a white woman which brings us at all kinds of privileges\nA black woman in that situation Anita Hill Thirty years ago is it an even more difficult situation just by being alive and speaking right\nEverything from her posture too the cadence of her voice really address the double standard in their behavior there was that it was quite shocking actually see it play out the way it did\nThe pugnacious hyper masculine sort of I'm angry and I get to be angry and I think it just showed how anger is a social entitlement right he gets to be angry and he gets to exercise that emotion without it degrading anybody sense of his rationality or logic\nWhereas for women were taught to\nBe emotional in terms of regulating our emotions and other people's emotions and are linked with emotion analogy but then the emotion analogy is weaponized against us because there's the assumption that we are not rational and we're not logical and that we're not thinking clearly\nWay back in the classic scenario if she had in front of the public in front of the cameras in front of so many men if she had come out into frankly ... what was she risking\nHer well first of all she was definitely risking her credibility right we we know that there is a credibility gap that exists from many studies that shows that men are assumed to be more authoritative\nMore knowledgeable people have more confidence in them when they give expert testimony uncomplicated issues so that already exist as a gap in our lives and so we often have to bend over backwards to prove ourselves right I mean I have Seventy pages of citations in the book and that's basically because I don't want to argue with awful people all day\nOr they can go argue with the CDC or the United nations or they'll argue way with me anyway right but but in fact we have to go out of our way to proven proven proven prove what we say and at no point in life\nDo we actually\nHave the luxury or privilege of just saying what we know ... and having what we know be taken seriously and so all of her composure\nWas really calibrated to trying to buttress her credibility\nWhereas he could lose his composure and still maintain in some circles credibility mhm I'm so and and we know from many other studies that indeed when men display anger maybe in a courtroom for example there was a recent study done about\nProsecutors in courtrooms that ... they they accrue power so an angry man will convince people to change their minds\nWhere as a woman who displays anger the opposite happened she actually becomes less powerful and people's things she's less credible less trustworthy and um it's not because anything about what she knew changed its because we have these stereotypes about gender and ethnicity\nWhen a woman does get angry with her face and say she's angry when a woman is not angry when her face is in a neutral facial set you have science about how that he's interested in how man faces interpreted differently we don't read men and women is expressions the same way\nNo we don't mean women's faces are expected to be pleasing unpleasant so we're supposed to smile and actually like black people were supposed to smile in order to signal that we're not ... we're not unhappy with the circumstances we find ourselves and mhm right and I I don't know I don't know I I've been told to smile\nProbably at least once a week my entire life\nBy an ad almost always very often by a man I don't know and so it's really irritating to me when someone tells me to smile so we we sort of call a woman's neutral face a resting bitch face and\nI even found surgery that was being advertised as a way to fix resting which face\nA permanently installed permanently I don't\nFault you know but actually it's really kind of an irony because in fact\nMen's faces at rest are bitchy\nAnd we know that because of [noise]\nTo gender neutral faces if a if a face is a gender neutral face but has an expression that we tend to associate with anger most people will say it's a man's face and demands faces at rest it is demonstrably more negative looking than a woman's face at rest\nMhm you also I'm really pleased to see that this is not just about white women that you did incorporate women from all walks of life in here and some of the most interesting points to me came across as to how different those two experiences argue about\nThe difference that you know young black girls have and whether their mothers had been modeling the appropriateness of anger for them as opposed to what a white woman has raised with so can you go into that a bit\nYeah I mean I think that a lot of our standards of behavior are\nPegged to the experiences of I'm white men as our new neutral objective state of humanity and there are lots of examples of that that range from the way we design cities to the way we designed bathrooms to the way we think of the idea of knowledge\nAnd the same things sort of happens in terms of how we think about anger so a lot of this that comment assumptions about girls and women and anger are about upper middle class white girls who were studied\nIn studies for a long time\nBut in fact the experiences of girls of different classes and races and ethnicities and ethnicities are very different\nAnd the point of a lot of the book is about how the emotion is socially constructed so we think of the ... of emotions in general as internal and private particularly if we associate them with women they aren't public and political right but in fact\nOur emotions are socially constructed as anything else we may have them internally but they make demands on the world and then the world response and the way the world responds depends on all of these ideas about our identities and so a young black girl in kindergarten\nAnd on is five times more likely to be suspended or expelled than her peers and she's five times more likely to be expended a suspended or expelled for behaving in ways that don't conform to our ideals of white middle class femininity\nKnow\n\nThis is in deep I'm Angie ... my guest is Russia Molly with her book rage becomes her\nSteve from with the whole idea of the necessity of being sexually desirable and how how ingrained that is a very young age I Wonder what you think about the campaigns that we see with your sexy at any age you're seeing any weight and nobody seems to get around to saying maybe six he shouldn't be the point\nYeah I mean I think that's just sort of\nRight like you don't have to be sexy all the time there are times when maybe it's nice to be sexy but being a sexy dentist really doesn't help you [laughter] so\nSo I think that that kind of framing is just more of the same sort of ridiculous sex segregation that is despite people's protests hierarchical you know I mean men rule that's really not in question I don't really see how anybody can question that\nNot politically and not in the financial world not in the tech world not in academia I mean maybe they don't rule as mothers\n'cause they're not mother's so I think that this idea that we always have to be sexy though is important because in fact\nThe shortest path to a woman's glory or security is vicariously by being attracted to a powerful man ... and that still true we can dress up anyway we want but it's really not denial I think that it's just emblematic of the bigger problems\nAnd I don't know if you saw on the news that it was necessary for and embarrassed costume company to pull yeah they're sick The Handmaid's tale\nNo irony at all irony is dead it's law [laughter]\nGoing into some of the questions here what about man they're not allowed to express emotions how does that affect them\nUm if not and it's a book about women and anger but it's very\nClear that man's performance of masculinity of kissing women off all the time [laughter]\nThat's also not in question right so it would be really healthy if we could on gender the world but specifically an gender emotions in the way we teach children to grow into to people adult people and\nWhat I hear when I hear the question what about men is awfully close to not all men and why are you focusing on women\n... demand and the conversation\nRight and in fact the problem we have is that men are always centered and they may not feel like they're always centered which is part of being always center\nRight so there's a lot to be said about men and their emotions but not here\nCan you can examples of how women can or have made themselves both likeable and aggressive and this goes to how you talk about how important we find like ability to be\nI think that women do understand that there are real price has to be paid if say trans grass in terms of gender roles or the way they act right so a woman who\nLooks pretty typically feminine is more likeable automatically because what she signal\nThe people around her for example there was this great study about\nWomen who wear makeup in the office and it's not that they are necessarily more attractive\nIt's that they're showing the people around them that they've spent money invested in buying the make up to make other people happy\nNow a lot of women say I wear makeup because I Want to wear makeup\nWhich is also true but in fact the way it's translated is the signal that you're conforming mhm and so likability is really important for women we see that in our politicians are women politicians\nAnd I'm to be angry as the kiss of death that makes you really on likeable for many reasons one of the first associations girls have is it being angry makes you ugly again this is a cardinal sin\nIt also makes you quote unquote masculine children by the age of four or five associate anger with masculinity and so when girls are women are angry they're seeing as violating these gender roles\nAnd we saw it in the last election right I mean Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump could stomp been\nHit their ... and looked slightly unhinged and deranged and they could leverage all this populist anger and it wouldn't hurt them it wouldn't make them on likeable but if Hillary Clinton had even come close to that she would have been even more held in disdain\nYou went into some of the behaviors in the book about what what Donald Trump was pulling during the election and one of them how was mystified when this happened at the time\nThat this was an effort on Donald Trump's part to score points and that's when he was shadowing Hillary Clinton around this old days when they were free to walk during the debate and he he hoped behind her and he looked behind her and he found her\nAnd I ... that must have been perceived entirely differently by men that it was by women will run every woman I talked to was like God that's creepy\nWell in the moment I mean in the moment women were horrified to like my God this is a hulking stocking man who's trying to assert\nPhysical dominance on her something that we're all familiar with is generally smaller people right and and so many women automatically associated that with domestic violence and with the kinds of behaviors that abusers engage in also well understood and so yeah I mean I think that even in the immediate moment that that was happening\nYou could see in social media this incredibly gender response to his physical presence on the stage\nIt it was really terrible mhm watch\nSocial media is a major double edged sword when it comes to women trying to be themselves to express their anger I even just God Forbid to have an opinion on something and that is throughout the book as well you have had trouble with social media sure I mean I\nWouldn't really call it trouble it's explicit rape threats graphic pornography of gang rapes and mutilation um death threats that there's a whole range of things you know having your personal information shared\nI'm having threats made against your family I'm the first I'm sort of ...\nAnd if I Am writing about racial justice I could maybe maybe maybe black maybe somewhere\nYou know that's when a lynching threat will happen I also have an Arab sounding name so maybe I'm Muslim So that's when the Islamic phobic threats happen I mean really it it just it just is a mirror on the world right it has nothing to do with me I've had to call the FBI only it\nOnly once did I called the FBI is called the police just to say hey this is happening or hey please be aware that this might happen because there's a technique called swatting which is when somebody calls in a fake report and says there's some criminal activity happening in your house\nInterest because the fact is that a SWAT Team might shoot you write so yes on line there is this\nInsane re assertion of masculine privilege in the most ugly in violent ways that's very easy to see unclear to understand and it's totally global end its networked\nAnd if we'd paid attention to it as an ... enforce that was moving through the culture ten twelve years ago we might not be in this position today\nSomeone the audience wants to know how do you think Kavanaugh testimony would have been received differently if he was a woman and act the way he acted acted away\nYeah [laughter]\nWell I mean is there any doubt we're still having a conversation about whether this\nMan can be judicious\nYou know whether his sort of sanctimonious outraged entitled aspect can be a fair reflection of visibility to make decisions I mean\nBy hand me actually wrong where she had and you see happening is true yeah I mean there are so many mhm they're just I'm ... I'm I'm struggling to come up with some right now but I Do list\nThem in the book because you have to at least laugh a little you know\nWe have Rebecca foolish here and she and she's in the book as well as you explained to is the one night that there was a person just as you are in using her book against her and ... and she had said several times I wrote that this money just didn't hear I wrote that and he just went on and I literally couldn't credit her with writing the book\nOh he was telling her about her book [laughter]\nShe's so gracious you know and so that's how she ended up joining the romance planning which she herself doesn't like she doesn't like the term she thinks it's too much of a generalization\nUm but yeah she did that and he went on and then when it finally her companion said stop what you're doing like this is you know she she wrote this book he just picked up his toys and left\nLiterally just heard and walked away [laughter]\nPeople are asking you about the price that you pay yeah when you decide to be a straightforward woman be emotional beat angry whatever mhm how can women especially Asian American women break away from stereotypes without losing credibility and I'll back to back that was another question about what if you lose opportunities\nSo chances are you will lose opportunities\nAnd that's hard because you have to make that assessment constantly what am I willing to risk what is it worth to me how ... because we all get fed up which is one of the virtues of aging I think this happens on many levels right there's the inter personal level the professional level the political level it's very\n[noise]\n\nWelcome back to Indy I'm Angie ... ... is my guest a sensitive four letter word pops up in this segment is leap but I wanted to give you a heads up ... Hitler's books\nOne or two girls so early and so thoroughly get the idea\nThat we are going to be rates that that is that rate is\nEverywhere it's what every girl needs to you know I\nLearned to walk with my keys between my fingers before a I had keys and B I didn't hear the what rape really was I knew that a girl would be attacked and as soon as I got my car keys I wouldn't go down the street without them between my fingers right I Am really know what rape was but I assumed I Would be assault and where do we get that\n[noise] so I think it's everywhere right we get it from a culture that shame people for their sexuality and polices girls' clothing and tell them that the way they dress will hurt them right we get it from um\nThese rules about staying safe which we learn really early I mean\nI got really angry when people make jokes about women going to the bathroom together\nYou know really snide commentary about women being vain or never being able to just go to the bathroom quickly and alone I'm like now I'm the kill joy at dinner I'm like what are you talking about we teach girls to do that so they won't get raped by men like before I'm sick so I Can't go to the bathroom by myself when I'm six every time I got up\nI had to have a companion right and I had to do with five other girls and so it's sort of just in the air I Will add though that it's excessive rights ... and it's based on rape missed because boys and girls are equally likely to be molested\nBefore the age of sort of ten or twelve boys age out of that generally speaking and girls and women never do you can be an eighty year old woman walking through Central Park and be raped [noise]\nYeah I mean I think that part of the problem with a deeply conservative culture that we live in\nIs that it necessarily involves portraying men as unable to control themselves in in need of sex which is of course different from rape but in need of this ... this physical urge and of women being tempting all the time\nMhm there's very surprised to find out in the book in surveys conservative women have the most anger\nThey did before the election they've handled at the time [laughter]\nWhat was that about what we're we're we're sending are coming from\nA lot of things one aspect that I haven't seen well studied\nIs from inequality conservative women\nLive with this much more rigid set of rules about men and women and their roles in society very often they're Catholic or Protestants evangelical in this country those are really authoritarian religions they have strict rules they punish people when they break those rules they're fuelled by a lot of contempt and disgusting fear\nWhen you face one form of inequality you leverage another form of status so if you're a conservative white woman and you're living in an environment in which complementary and is is the rule which is actually public power for men\nPrivate power for women which is not an equal occasion the equation anyway you can leverage your racial power to gain status right so I think that's what we saw in this election white women were able to assert racial privilege to offset gender inequality\nWhite women who are conservatives now they've jumped ship\nThey've jumped ship so far that even Steve Bannon left [laughter] right Steve Bannon's like the white women who've left I'm going to Europe to organize the fascist and so I think that there's a lot in the culture are very religious culture\nThat points to what's happening and the rest of the world which is that authoritarianism is on the rise everywhere and it is most likely to be adopted\nFirst by women in profoundly unequal situations and that doesn't matter what country you're in and we never paused to think that maybe the inequality of white women in their own homes in this country is related to authoritarian beliefs but I think it is and because white men were distressed and\nWhite women and men tend to be married more likely to one another you don't want to see the people around your distressed you know you don't want to see your husband or your father or your son's in that frame of mind\nAnd so what women all women tend to experience at much higher levels is vicarious stress which is that we take on the emotions of the people around us and ... and that becomes sort of part of our our lives and our anger\nWomen who are starting to assert their anger or learning how to win and the whole end of your book is about how to claim your your own rage\nThey may be disturbed or alarmed at how it comes out the woman who burst into tears trying to express and said she ... she has to do that a ... burden of being the crying women right so can you walk women through that step of learning what their own anger looks like\nI'm so every chapter in the book is sort of an examination of different stages of life\nAnd in each one of those chapters I Try and provide examples of what it looks like when we can't recognize acknowledge are articulated anger\nAnd so crying is a big deal because I honestly believe that if men understood how angry women were when they cry they would be shocked\nRight women cry because they cannot get the words out\nBecause to get the words out it's scary to say how angry they are\nAnd crying then reinforces femininity right so you feel this incredible anger that in your brain you've been taught to think of his masculine and what's the feminine thing that you do you can cry and it sort of dissipate some of the transgression of having this powerful masculine emotion\nAnd I don't suggest it's conscious at all I just think it's the way we learn to operate\nAnd um [noise] so yes I mean I think there are clearly women who have explosive rage we all know women who act that way but that's also a missed\nOut in a way that not useful I mean I started the book with a story of my mother who when I was Fifteen I came home one day and um she was standing on a terrorists overlooking a hill and she was throwing her China each one or the time it like a Frisbee\nShe what I'm saying anything she must have thrown twenty plates like out into the air and off they went and this is not normal right here like Fifteen or like gee what is happening and she came in back in and she looked at me and she said and how was your day\n[laughter] and I didn't ask her what was wrong because I was like that is not a good idea right now I think I'll go do my homework but I asked her something like Thirty years later\nI said do you remember this happening and she said oh that was just one time [laughter] he said I brought so many more place than that but the the thing about her doing that was\nThat she didn't talk about it so I learned she was she didn't fertilize it\nIt was scary and dangerous things were breaking and I didn't know why\nShe didn't impose her anger on her family she does but a lot of women do we tend to learn about models of anger say anger in an anger out you keep your anger enter you keep your anger out\nBut in fact women that's not a model for most women women it's relationship in our relationship out which is totally different what she did was get her anger out but she kept it out for a relationship\nAnd that's the model of women's anger men's anger which is another standard that were held to is it tends to be anger in anger out\nBut I'm all for checking the mail standard of our behavior and that's one of the examples of that\nSomebody brings up that we could change the way we talk about violence against women for example men attacked women attacks don't happen to women\nYes all of the change from passive to active language ... um is very important\n[noise] you said that Bush should be allowed to cry but earlier you called cabinet ... little boy yes how should we interpret the those two signals\nOh well I think we have a long history of conservative men sobbing right and in public in ways that women are not allowed to cry in public I mean\nYou know if Hillary Clinton had cried\nIn theory authentic Jersey right she was constantly being a denounce for her in authenticity\nBut if she cried like that she would have been perceived automatically is weak and hormonal and incapable of sound judgment\nBut over and over again we have these examples of men crying they tend in in interestingly I think someone pointed that does opt to me they tend to often to be conservative men and there's a really interesting dynamic in that which is that\nIn sort of this I'm very stratified sex roles of men and women in conservative cultures\nAll women are expected to mother\nRight they're all supposed to care and they're supposed to actually mother their husbands like how many people say I have three children but for us you count my husband\nHow many people say that and it's so common right and can I curse yeah oh I I tend to curse a lot I'm trying not to but I was sitting with another writer last week she was hilarious

this is indeed one full hour on one intriguing topic in deep we do like to disclose our bias are biased is that fracking is irresponsible and proven to be an environmental detriment\nThat is however a very easy thing to say from the comfort of Silicon Valley there are people who live where fracking is life fracking is a livelihood\nAnd unfortunately we hear again and again that it's rock and a hard place they can stay in poverty or they can have a chance to get some money\nAnd then end up with the kind of consequences we find out about ... amity and prosperity book written by lunch Griswold who spent seven years is that right was one family and their friends documenting exactly what happened with fracking amity and prosperity\nNot just the spirit of the books but the names of the city's involved Eliza Griswold is the author of the very much claimed tenth parallel she's also a poet and I'm really glad to have her here in the\nWelcome thank you [laughter]\nSo ... so happens that there is another political move this time in Connecticut I Believe that's going to be dealing with fracking when people here that fracking may become to their community let's talk about\nWhat that means there is gas in the ... in the rock that can be released how is that done and why does pollute I'm going to give you\nKind of a cartoon version because\nThat will make some sense of how the way it works is that is traditionally we think oil and gas we think it's somewhere near the surface then\nProcess is about drilling down up to two miles down into the earth that the vertical it's cold and then you can drill out what are called lateral are horizontal drills that go out as much as four miles away and the idea is that if you you said\nMillions upon millions of gallons of water chemicals and sand down into the earth and out sideways and what that\nLiquid does is it ... the rocket fractures ancient shale basically ancient ocean bed and the critters that carbon rich bodies of critters that lived inside that\nSo the the rock fractures the bubbles of oil and gas are that are trapped inside that rock are relieved at that all of that comes back up to the surface everything sucked back up the oil and gas and all of that waste\nWhich comes with it ... it carries not only the hazardous chemicals that are used in the fracking process it also carries\nA lot of radioactivity because radioactivity is naturally occurring and one of the things that industry often does is try to evade responsibility sidestep it by talking about arsenic arsenic is naturally occurring so okay it's naturally occurring but it doesn't have to come out of the earth\nSo radioactivity as ... as one of these naturally occurring elements that is actually\nObviously can be hazardous to what the health so it all comes back up and then the question is what are you going to do is a waste\nNow in many places what you can do with the ways in Ohio for instance and Ohio is has many of these deep injection wealth Pennsylvania has a couple too but they're harder to drill in Pennsylvania\nWhere you just inject that waist deep into the earth well this is what causes are earthquakes\nFracking itself is documented cause earthquakes but injection wealth as well so how are we going to get rid of this ways how does it cause harm\nYes and that's one reason this took so long because I was very careful about what I could document and what I could understand I'm going to tell you about what went wrong in this case and how there are\nPotential hazards along the way that don't necessarily say fracking will always go wrong\nBut this is where it can do wrong okay the industry itself will say the probably the greatest source of contamination is what happens at the surface because\nAt this site alone there were dozens if not hundreds of spills have talked sick material and diesel fuel and you know at one point to try to kill that bacteria the industry used um eight hundred pounds of a bio side that is\nDocumented to be carcinogenic so if they were here are saying well that's not fracking no it's not getting its which had to do to mitigate what happened from the fracking OK so there are tons and tons of problems but when you pump the the elements into the earth is\nOften well casings that cement that his case that cases the pipe going down into the ground well casings fail so and it's not always clear to know what when and where they have failed which was documented in this case\nHow they compare to coal mining in terms of you know the devil you know versus the devil you don't how much damage had cold on by the time fracking came in that\nSuch a great question and I think that that is really the question that I as an outsider another report are coming in to cover the fracking boom really needed to ask because if you sit down and you talk with old timers who live in ... and surrounding towns\nThey will explain to you that the industry as a given cake\nThey've been living next to and on top of coal mining for more than a century they've they've gotten jobs really in exchange for their health\nAnd things we wouldn't think about roads giant coal waste ponds so I had the pleasure last year of going to report on the most incredible young woman whose name is Veronica top death I wrote about her and the New Yorker and\nVeronica nickname is running because her mother gave all of her daughters gender neutral nickname so that they could survive in a man's world so Ronnie grew up in a part of an a neighboring county where the mine came through she was learning to drive when they came through and she she was Fifteen\nAnd they shut down the road that she was learning to drive on because of course they own\nThey own about thirty percent of the county it's not just what we think of like oh coal mining and you know ... and and these waste products in the air and in the water is literally the takeover of the entire\nCounty and and there's so many knock on effects from if a if a company or a series of companies owns thirty percent of your county where you can't find housing you know you think about cutting the tax base who's paying for the rose to be repaired all of these effects of what I Would call public poverty\nHow do you how do we look in a more sophisticated way at\nThe privatization of profit and the socialization of cost so companies that are extracted companies pass on environmental costs social costs infrastructure cost cost to education because people are going to drop out of high school if you can make a hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a coal miner\nTo high school what forget it and that's happening now with the natural gas industry as well let's\nAbout your protagonist she is a mother a woman who at no point has been ... anywhere in a region that is not prosperous in an ideal world what could the fracking money have meant to them if it weren't for\nSo stay he grew up um as the daughter of an out of work steel worker Anna Vietnam combat vet and at that person as being they inherit or of that identity really made her think how am I going to be helpful to my region and my family and getting out of poverty\nSo her hope was that she would or nine thousand dollars which is the price of a dream barn because she had aid acres and she was hoping to lease each of them for a thousand dollars each and that was going to basically secure her place in the middle class\nExpectations weren't really terribly army yeah putting a refund a barn putting a barn up she grew up in a family were water balloons run extravagance because water as an extra against so one of the roots of not just her family but that area what were the economic\nSo first of all I Love no one has talked me about the water balloons yet to me it was a shocking discovery when I you know of all the things that this family grew up without to think that water balloons were luxury just really helped me recess that what we all the ... that we all carry yeah\nUm so the economic roots of this area are very interesting you know we are all growing accustomed to this rural urban divide here division is born out of before actually the revolutionary war\nThe people who've who've gathered in this area who really settled this area a war European settlers\nOf course they displaced indigenous people Native Americans who are there and that place meant was pretty bloody and pretty intense and\nHow it worked was a European settlers would come to the colonies and the quake early in Philadelphia sent them west relate to unsettled plan where they fought these Native American wars so there was a lot of resentment among settlers among the American frontier about\nThe the urban elite all the way back this time because of course settlers weren't allowed to own land this was Native American land and in fact there was a law in place that said that the settlers had to get off his Native American land or the settlers themselves could be killed so\nThat is the root of some of the tensions that we're seeing today so people were small farmers but they were really eking out a living on very stubborn or is this was never a land very I mean it was absolutely\n\n[noise] well come back if indeed my guest is Eliza Griswold we're talking about her story of family in crisis because of the fracking industry\nAmity and prosperity one family and the fracturing of America so when did Stacey first start noting that things were going south with her family are houses they start noticing um things are going south before I met her she and her\nNeighbor best boils in the fall late summer of two thousand ten ... every year they go to the Washington County fair and the Washington County fair is really a pattern in our lives about it because they have these small farms and they show animals and\nFor a ... big big part of state is life with our kids\nSo she neighbor bass met up at the farm and that's told Stacey that their poppy had died um and that was enough they were both families they treat their animals like children really I mean\nThat there's always feeding our animals angel hair pasta zucchini and meatball subs and you know at so\nSee they are like people in their family so Stacey new comments this puppy very well in fact Carl Lee was already sick and one of the things that distracted Harley cause they'd miss most of his seventh grade year at home sitting at home was playing with this puppy the best daughter would bring the puppy you know they live next door so it just bring the puppy down\nTo play with ... with hunters with hunter who is hardly a puppy\nSo wed Stacey learned that this puppy had died she hadn't bass it wasn't long after that that they started to think okay we've lost this puppy we've lost a horse Harley is mysteriously ill and it was on the phone when Stacy was with Beth a couple of months after the fair\nThat a light bulb went off for ... for Stacy thinking my God\nCould whatever is sickening our animals be sickening Harley also and she called her\nUm she called the pediatrician that moment as because he'd seen hardly many times they couldn't figure it out\nAnd he said bring heartland right away and we'll have hurt him tested for arsenic exposure because that was one of the things that was sickening these animals and so that was the fall late fall two thousand ten and I met Stacey a couple of months after where she was she had\nGone from having Harley tested for arsenic poisoning to starting to understand what might be in her\nAnd her daughter and her family's bodies as a result of of exposure to oil and gas and because she was a nurse at the nearby hospital she could work up these tests with the head of the lab so she had had her\nSelf and our children tested for benzene and tell you in exposure and discovered that they that these gas related materials were in their bodies and she decided to speak out publicly for the first time at a local gathering\nAnd I ... it actually in West Virginia just about an hour from her house in a place called Morgantown Morgantown airport\nThey'd taken over the airport for the day these ... these people who are concerned about fracking and I happened to be their dad that day and I was sitting a couple of rows behind Stacy and her daughter\nWearing her pajamas that morning and she was grouchy I just didn't know who they were but I heard them talking and a\nPage was hungry states they didn't have anything for she said you should have eaten before we left the house and I reached into my backpack and pulled out some Ernest\nBar that I usually have with me while I'm working and a page very wisely you know the same voice that I don't want that gross bar [laughter] couple of minutes later Stacey got up and she started to talk and she said my name is Stacy hanni I'm a single mom\nOf two kids I'm a nurse at the local hospital and we have fencing and tell you in in us and we think it's from exposure to\nAbout a quarter of a mile from our house we have discovered a massive industrial site that's just gone in behind a high fence we discovered it because my daughter went on Google Earth in her seventh grade computer class and she her assignment was to find our land find our house and she found this massive waste beyond\nA that's just a quarter of a mile from us and so that was such a state she knew when I met her it was really the beginning of this mystery and\nI was with her over the seven years she and her neighbor began to piece together with the help of different experts they found\nOut what was going on and it turned out that this massive pond that was as large as her entire farm was leaking and it was not only leaking into the ground but it was off gassing massive amounts of of a of a gas called hydrogen sulfide\nAt lives really bacterial infection in the pond and and that also was leading to health problems they believe ...\nYou mentioned at the end of your books you were working overseas on stories when you suddenly when you realize the connection between\nThe reliability of infrastructure and care from the government in the face of this kind of thing and you saw the same thing happening now in America can you draw that connection absolutely you know\nThis to me I think if there's one take away from me from writing this this is really so I had spent most of my career as a journalist so probably Fifteen Years as a conflict correspondent working a war zones in Africa and Asia Afghanistan or Iraq\nI'm Somalia a and other places like Nigeria and I was in Nigeria I was in northern Nigeria a in a very fraught place when\nUh the bridge in Minneapolis collapsed in twenty Thirteen and Thirteen people were killed\nAnd Britain collapse in Nigeria also and I had to get a cross was covering a little local\nWar and I had to ... I had to cross a river where there was no bridge anymore and I did what you do as a journalist so I was riding on his empty oil barrel across the river and I was thinking about Minneapolis and I was thinking you know\nThis is the social ills sees how the our sense of collective poverty right the collapse of bridges of what we call lifeline systems\nBridges roads are reservoirs the Internet the grid these things are happening in America and what I learned is you know there's something that we have for liberal ... economists have cast abroad\nSince the nineties this idea of something we call the resource cursor sometimes the paradox of plenty which is how is it that people who are often live on land the richest in natural resources are among the poorest on the earth\nRight and we usually look at that in Africa and Asia we call it um the global south like we're we're we're to these problems happened the truth is they happened in America too and nowhere more so than Appalachia and that's really what I learned\nWas talking about when she started to engage with\nSome are both local and federal ... we're supposed to be protecting her let's start first with her interacting with Corp itself\nSo stay the as soon that very day which happened to be her birthday when she invest spoke on the phone a and she thought oh my gosh what if Harley as being sickened by what's happening next door um [noise]\nI think just to correct myself I think that that was a couple of the results of the testing came back on her birthday so\nWhen Stacy found out that it could be arsenic that was sickening her child um she called the company immediately she called them before she had test results and she said I'm afraid that your operation next door is sickening us and they responded\nWith sending immediately within twenty four hours they send something called the water buffalo over to stasis house now water buffalo is something she knows a lot about because growing up without drinking water which we can talk about some point\nThey often relied on these massive jobs of water and that's when the coal mine comes through and you don't have water anymore you often feed your cattle from a water buffalo\nSo the company started supplying her water and then she got the results back from Harley's testing and told them what had happened that and [noise]\nIt ... she dead hand delivered the results of Harley's testing to the company which is not far away it's about a half an hour drive from her home to their corporate headquarters in South western Pennsylvania\nAnd she heard nothing she heard nothing time and again finally she was she got a call and so did bass her neighbor to come in and meet with a company and that they had their results not only from\nFrom blood testing and they had the results from blood and urine of not only medical tests but they had conducted what they called independent water tests they had hired companies to come out and do what are testing and there were certain things that Stacy and that's where a particularly concerned about because they had learned enough about what\nHad been trouble for other people with oil and gas\n... glycol uh anti freeze and other elements that they thought they were concerned about and when they went in to meet with a company for the first time the company told them that\nUh there there was nothing to be concerned about with their water that they had the results of these tests and in fact the tests prove that there was nothing wrong with our water\nAnd they handed these test results over um they handed the results over and Stacey saw that glide calls were missing and she asked about whether or not they were had been tested for and the company to mirrored\nIt said do we have a little more time with the logic Griswold going into steroid amity and prosperity one family and the fracturing of America\nWas traced some of the legal actions which took seven years to resolve it Stacy and eventually the some others came in her girlfriend bass and her family became part of it and it became this wrestling between\nKnow would they be able to go to court would Kendra lawyer be able to get through with millions of documents to be able to raise your kids at the same time\nBut eventually it did go before the mediators and that took forever so can you give us a little path of how legal action west sure I mean for me one of the challenges was just keeping track of this just mug shrink mushrooming number of lawsuits that came out of what happened right so we\nWith a sick kid and you know a a dead goat a dead puppy a couple of dying courses and we lead into the state Supreme Court in Pennsylvania right so\nOne case there is a plaintiff case there's the case that Stacy and her neighbors brought against the company\nAnd that took years of documentation and fighting and you know what ... Smith the lawyer discovered as she started to drill down into these documents is that there was just a pattern\nOf obfuscation like I told you a little bit before about the difference between what the raw data water test would read and then the results that were given to Stacy in ... there were no major discrepancies in those\nUm and larger patterns of things that didn't show up right didn't didn't square right and a normal plaintiff attorney would have had to give up but because Cantor had this corporate she was from the other side she had this expensive training\nThat allowed her to keep going\nOn so that was the plane of suit that just unfolded at a grinding rate year after year judge after judge because that's another form of public poverty on the judiciary system here one judge would have it for a couple of years and he would retire than they were so swamped with cases another judge would have to come back\nTwo days a week thing just eked along\nThe same time the Smiths take on and this was truly her relax at no gain to themselves at only cost\nThey take on state um they take on the commonwealth of Pennsylvania because the commonwealth is trying to pass this new oil and gas law called act Thirteen\nThat is basically going to give drillers like range resources the drill the right to drill wherever they want in unity and communities won't have local say sell anymore at all\nThe case a book all that goes all the way up to the state Supreme Court and they know that they're facing a conservative Republican bench right they're going to have to make this case that drilling is dangerous to the conservative Republicans who have a history of supportive industry\nAnd they make the case of Pennsylvania and have the right to clean air and pure water which is actually a law and the books in Pennsylvania\nAnd that law and Stacey testimony which go all the way up to the state Supreme Court\nMake the state Supreme Court find in their favor and that is one of the most hopeful messages and something that that's not that people can really take away from this book the plaintiff case is more frustrating and\nIt settles at the end of the book and as part of the settlement which is confidential\nI don't know the terms I Can't know the terms they're sealed but I can report on how Stacey ... feel about the terms because I can ask them about that and what I can tell you is that they are disappointed deeply disappointed and I would guess I Would say reading the book carefully is is it is a good way to understand\nReally what happened to them and how this case unfolded has changed the mind that anyone who thought she was in it for money or ... or whatever [noise]\nI don't know I don't know um\nKnow I think the public perception and amity was everything was going to lead to big payday I mean even you know the ... the the lack of experience with journalism and book writing too I think that they thought that Stacy was going to make some kind of money from my writing this book\nAnd the opposite is true I mean essentially what Stacy did is just\nSit down for hours upon hours with me after working Eighteen hour days double shifts at the hospital and she would update me on what was going on and\nShe really sees herself and her family as needing to be an example of what not to do of how you can fight back and she felt that she was serving the public good by talking to me and what I did at the end you know the book is incredibly intimate there's a lot of sickness in there\nI'm Out along with a lot of stomach illness a lot of sick kids and the gross mis that goes along with that and by the end of the book we know how many barrage she has you know and\nThat it's that intimate this is immersion journalism this is really living alongside people for a long long time and when I finished it even though along the way I had described just to see what I was doing and Harley in particular\nI wasn't sure they really understood who could know what somebody else was seeing so I drove down to amity 'em and Stacey took a couple of days off of work at our own expense\nAnd I read them the entire book at the kitchen table because I felt like I didn't have the right to write about what had happened to them if I couldn't sit and face Sam I'm and read how intimately what I had seen and that was difficult\nIt was so difficult for safety to hear it there was no kind of glory and having a book written about her it was excruciating and for Harley too\nUh but they went through it at one point she felt there was something she was doing it was patriotic enough\nWhen she signed this lease for oil and death she was told by the company representative there called ... and the people who come out and and they're real estate agents there signing up your mineral lease as\nShe was told about American energy independence which is you know old as the hills this idea that we will be energy independent and we could have a whole discussion about how flawed that notion as um so what happened is she thought that by the energy independent she would help bring industry back to Appalachia\nSo job she had watched the steel mills close she'd watched her father\nJobs back here and it's also going to ... keep soldiers like my dad out of foreign entanglements over oil right we are going to strengthen our national security bite relying on ourselves by for energy and she thought both of those aspects patriotic\n[noise] we talked earlier about how the idea that recycling fracking water is a bit of a false would perhaps an entire fall for the house the water's theoretically recycled and where does that\nGo wrong so I'm not going to get into the technicalities because I don't feel to be honest well versed enough and how that really works and the idea though is that all of that flow back everything that comes out of the earth\nCan be stored it can be re used in more fracking and essentially they took a while to get to this point uh but some scientists at some of the ... they're both corporations local companies and this is actually in Pennsylvania one of the pieces because this is a complicated story\nI Would be doing a disservice to the Pennsylvania is to say that\nFracking had only brought loss to the region for landowners and some small business owners like those involved and recycling waste water it has been a big boon right um so the idea is\nCan all of that wastewater be used again and fracking now the problems have to do with where are you going to store it you're going to store it and one of these ... that's one of you can store it in what's called a closed loop systems in in a field tanks\nAs to the date of my reporting that was not happening these ponds we're still in use 'em and you need to think about how what happens with a concentration of these elements overtime in that water as they grow more as their reuse what is that\nWhat is that toxic slug sludge about so one of the things that's happening now in fracking which has to do with this technological innovation is that as I was saying a lot are all you can drill out as much as four miles we got to think if you're scaling up to that level and you're having multiple wells on these well pads\nWhat kind of waste you generate an arrow gender you got Kenneth many well he's got a ... a lateral that it's four times as long you need to use ... naturally more fluid more chemicals more sand\nTo reach to basically get the get the gas and the oil out of the earth and that in itself is something that people haven't looked at too much but that in itself is a problem that I don't think recycling waste water is going to solve\nI Want to correct something I said earlier it's not Connecticut that is looking at its prop one twelve at Colorado oh yeah getting right always do you know something about that\nI just a little bit about it again I like to really report to speak more about what I've reported on closely over time since I haven't\nUm but what I think Colorado is facing exactly some of these measures\nThat Pennsylvania they're facing exactly what Pennsylvania has right and the hope is so Pennsylvania has extremely strong local governments and

nine o'clock is the time time for indie with as you stay tuned to local public radio KLW San Francisco\n\nI'm Angie Clara and this is indeed one full hour on one intriguing topic\nThe phrase identity politics is becoming a slur it scoff at the issues groups down by race gender or other factors work to push into the mainstream some people do still use it impartial any\nPolitical scientist and political economists Francis Fukuyama splits the difference he does golf it when he calls identity ... American sub groups who he says put their own identifying characteristics above America's unifying principle\nBut he sees the critical importance of me too and black lives matter which others dismiss it's a fascinating nuance to take Frank's looking on his Nineteen Ninety two book the end of history and the last man for told the ultimate success of liberal politics a prediction badly challenge today\nHe's director of the center on American democracy development and the rule of law at Stanford chairman of the American interest and now the author of identity that demand for dignity and the politics of resentment\nFrancis Fukuyama joined me before a live audience campers broke from Menlo\nI got an email this morning and it was the public relations pitch there's a guy who is offering\nTwenty five thousand dollars for information on the personal history and character of the women accusing Brett Kavanaugh mhm and I thought to myself geometry it is the wrong not to tell me not to identify [laughter] I don't think you're telling me know identify as we now in us\nTell me what the proper role of identity as of identify as an Italian American ministers bisexual left hander whatever what's the appropriate role of that which relation to American society where does it fit\nSure so everyone of us feels that we have an inner identity that's not always respected and recognized by the society around us\nAnd I think for me too movement and what's been going on a with women in this country is an example of that so\nWomen have dignity but the way men treat them doesn't you know respect that dignity and we're going through this massive cultural change where men's behavior basic all that's the structure of all these identity movements says that the inner person is is right and the surrounding societies wrong and that's the\nStruggle that we're going through the cultural struggle we're going through right now and that is a necessary thing it's very important that that happened I mean black lives matters you know they're really big you know social justice movement going on the concern that I have is that\nWell it's a couple of things I mean one is that it's it's now triggered or been accompanied by a rise of a very nasty kind of identity on the right\nWhere you have a walking back I think of the kind of civic identity that we Americans thought we achieved in the wake of the civil rights movement\nWe have unfortunately got a president who I think it's basically a racist I mean\nHe you know uses every opportunity to exacerbate these conflicts of racial and ethnic conflicts she uses you know the identity frame that I represent you you're not recognize your\nYou know the elites don't care about you and it stokes a lot of anger and so the total result of that is a great deal of polarization which I think is the single biggest political problem we face in this country and we can make decisions on really basic things because we are\nThat is is that exclusive focus on on these identities\nWhen you talk about identity politics you mentioned ISIS we talk about the white nationalist hanging over their race has been decorated we talk about black lives matter whose primary objective is not to be shot mhm clearly they have different values and different reasons chilling didn't\nDo you have a different in Tempe and trying to get us to identify which identity arm beneficial to the country which are not\nNo so I think in a democracy obviously you want social justice and you want people to be recognized but I think the the reason that I I think that there's something in common is the psychological structure\nWhy is it that people these young guys go off to fight for ISIS first of all a lot of them are European Muslims or they don't feel comfortable in their parents' traditional religion they don't feel accepted by European society\nAnd what you know Islam is does is it says I'll tell you exactly who you are you're Muslim you're part of this rumor and we Muslims all around the world are being killed\nDisrespected and oppressed and this is your moment to be able to fix a exercise some agency and go fight back and I think it's that search for community and\nYou know knowing who you are and uh believing that you know you're part of a community with dignity the psychologically\nI was just saying now obviously you know somebody that goes on shops to head off of people or you know the sorts of terrible things I've been doing is not the same thing as somebody seeking you know equal rights in the United states but\nBut there is you know I think a common a psychological frame which really does have to do with this inner desire for dignity and anger when you don't receive respect\nYou actually go into definitions and analyses of words that you would think would be that in and I think the way that you went into what dignity years really mean when we say dignity\nIt's change that's one of the biggest shifts in in in times so in\nThe pre modern world dignity was not due to everybody was basically do the warriors you had an aristocratic class or they hatch status and nobody else did because they're the ones that risk their lives and you know in in battle I think that\nHistorically in the west of Christianity played a big role in shifting the basis of dignity to something more universal so Martin Luther says you know\nUh all of us have the capacity inside us for for grace which is the inter person which is the source of human dignity or if you actually it's interesting if you look at the use of the word dignity in constitutional language there quite a number of constitutions in Germany and South Africa in Japan\nThat preserve a right to dignity historically that enters actually through Christian Democratic parties or in Europe beginning with the Irish Constitution in Nineteen thirty seven and so\nThe religious understanding of universal dignity you know this this is something we all have a as as God's Children get secular rise in the course of the Eighteenth Nineteen centuries to be something that we now recognize as universal human rights\nAnd I think we don't recognize the historical genesis of these ideas I mean if you asked a politician you know in Europe more well why is the word dignity and your constitution they'd be\nCompletely tongue tied they have no idea why it's there but I Do think historically it has to do with democracy it has to do with this\nView that every single one of us are equal in this respect that we have agency that's what gives us the right to vote the right to speak the right to associate a and so actually this understanding of dignity is really critical to [noise]\nYeah we're their identity or feel in some cases the stump you can find your own trying suddenly go oh my God that's what I Am [noise] do you see that as inherently dangerous or do you see that as a release the recognition of diversity to be embraced\nWell it's so first of all it's universal and everybody's searching for that you know inner self sometimes it's completely individual like you're a creative artist and you don't really understand how creative you are ah so it doesn't connect you to other people but with others\nThat inner self is actually a community where you suddenly realize that you have a lot in common with another group so\nYou know everybody does that mean that that's a universal characteristics I think that modern identity politics goes off the rails\nAre only at certain critical points so\nWhen you tie identity fixed characteristic like race ethnicity or gender and begin to say everybody in this category has to think a certain way and that determines your views on politics and your views on\nYou know society in sports and they're kind of music you I mean that you know I think is not compatible with a modern democracy the other thing is it has to do with the way that we think about each other is liberty the liberty to be members of groups or\nIs it fundamentally the liberty of each one of us you know as individuals and I think the premise of our society is much more individualistic you know we we don't really recognize that you know it becomes a bigger problem\nWith certain forms of cultural recognition when the cultures themselves don't necessarily uphold liberal values or you know where that becomes a real problem but uh in this country it can also read a certain kind of intolerance or\nCan you give an example of a group that is recognized identity at a group that has found that tribalism is found in element of itself in others where they do say you have to think a certain way or you're wrong\nOr you know I think the biggest examples that are all on university campuses uh where you know it becomes very hard to um\n\n[noise]\nI'm Angie clear up this is indeed our conversation tonight is with political scientists ... with his book identity demand for dignity and the politics of resentment\nIt was a breach the touching moment in the book when someone who failed overlooked by its as flyover kind of people and he said he said there's so much focus on my not being allowed to use whatever denigrating word but it's okay to call me redneck mhm I Can't say the are worried about me and struck me as such common ground one could build on\nNo common ground I mean I think the one thing that did come out as the last two election was positive is a kind of recognition\nBut there's a lot of poor working class rural\nYou know whites that are also suffering I mean if you think about who's in the Ninety nine percent you know be an equal Ninety nine percent a lot of them are white people Seventy two thousand Americans died of you know drug overdoses in two thousand Seventeen by the last estimate a\nBecause there's this raging drug epidemic going on in those communities\nYou know I Do think that understanding how someone living in rural Kentucky\nFeels they don't have access to the media to education too you know opportunities as someone living in Palo Alto or New York or Chicago or you know I think it's important to understand that you can have that feeling of being invisible in neglected in that situation as well\nA couple of people are talking about the fact is social media on both polarization on identity politics might tackle that one\nI mean that's a no brainer [laughter]\nRight living here in Silicon valley I mean social media is almost perfectly uh adapted to promote identity politics 'cause\nUh ... actually as a colleague of mine was saying at a at a forum earlier today you know if you're a neo Nazi living in Palo Alto you don't have a lot of people to talk to write you know you know talk to a lot of your friends about how about all the the colored people are and so forth so\nOn the Internet you can do that you know you can find the thousand or there's crackpots to believe your particular conspiracy theory and you can talk to them and you can filter out everybody else that doesn't believe you are and so I Do think that\nYou know we're beginning to understand the way in which these micro identities are being shaped by the way that we communicate and these new channels of communication that have been opened up\n... you and I are both fans of Twitter and I'm curious about when you come across that sort of rhetoric on Twitter mhm do you respond to it and you let it go you know I don't know what I learned\nA long time I never read the comments when I post things or you know a articles and I do not\nI Try not to read the comments on Twitter because uh it's you know that's the other problem with Twitter and social media it's anonymous right ... and so in any kind of normal face to face social setting you feel just instinctively that you've got to be\nOh because they know who you are they can see you you know a a your neighbors can see you are on Twitter you can say anything you down one because uh you know nobody's going to know and there's not going to be any consequences for that and so\nI think that leads to a high level of civility or in some cases you might call that just honesty uh you know it's probably true that a lot of us are really not that nice you know when you scratch the surface but that's the way of civilization right I mean you know you make that stuff on Iraq\n[laughter] what about the role of the more traditional media ... what did you see them having on identity politics are perpetuating it\nUm [noise] well that's a you know that's a complicated thing I think that the traditional media has [noise]\nYou know what you say this is a function of of being a kind of gate keepers so certainly in terms of\nFactual news you know they play at a really important function that we're now beginning to regret no longer exists you know with a lot of the kind of stuff you see on the Internet but they also had been lining up as well and so you got you know Fox and uh MSNBC and you've got um you know I think\nThis is another thing that I think is not perceived by a lot of liberals the extent to which the perceived bias of the mainstream media you know has\nKind of enraged people and and you know built a following on the right for you know for the president and for people uh you know for the people like him\nBack and now they're saying that it's going to be very tough to tackle because I\nLiterally read an article about what happened to Nike's stocked after they decided to go with the county Catholic and I do read the comments and usually and there was a comment from the Trump supporters who said well that's not true\nThat whether you choose to engage in social media or comments sanctions there has to be a way to get to that person and you don't have much respect acts at the very least so there is the thing about identity politics here this person identifies as a Trump supporter\nBut if that can reverse into what nothing I hear from the media is going to be true that was pretty tough nut to crack\nA it's a it's an extremely a tough nut to crack I think that\nUh the way back you know a is first of all you've got to have more integrating kinds of institutions that build a certain degree of trust\nIn the book I say that really what you need is you know to balance these uh these very polarized identities is the focus on a an opening a liberal national identity [noise]\nYou know that Americans have to get back to fundamental agreement or on the political basis of their democracy that that's what their identity as it's not related to race or to ethnicity or it is related to the fact that we believe in the constitution and the\nDeclaration of independence you know assertion of human equality and the rule of law of these are the things that bind us as Americans are and I think actually that if you have the right kind of leadership or you could you could make that appeal because I Do think people are kind of sick of being as\nA as polarized as they are I mean there's other things I think you know in policy turns you could do but I think\nThat would be the focus is realize yeah I mean you're going to have these particular identities that's a good thing for the most part it's natural but identity as flexible and you need to have some balance because we live in a community of political community\nAnd if you don't have people that can deliberate and talk to one another and you know deal with each other in a civil way you're not going to have a very successful democracy\nWanted the arguments he frequently fee follow a very public event the department shootings say a police shooting\nYeah that's ... yeah and another person will say get over that is America until you realize that nothing is going to change you know when you're asking people to sign up to be American first you have to decide what America is near where I can agree\nI'll tell you I'll tell you what my view about that is [laughter] no because I I've got a chapter in the book on on the evolution of American identity so proud of the civil war it was it was based on race you know black people Native Americans women couldn't vote\nA citizenship really defines what national identity is and it said where excluding people on that basis so the thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth amendments after the civil war were absolutely critical and shit we in fact we just went with a bunch of my students we I I take them on a\nMidnight tours the Lincoln Memorial and ah you know we read the Gettysburg Address and the second inaugural but in the Gettysburg Address you know Lincoln talks about the new birth of freedom which I think basically was the fourteenth amendment I mean this idea that\nAll all persons born or naturalized on the territory of the United states are considered citizens from now on it took a hundred years to make that a reality that's the kind of identity you know that I Believe is the only possible one for a de facto multi cultural\nMulti religious you know society um but it's also something important because those are important political principles and so it's not as if this is just a lot of fluff you know\nUh so that yeah so that's my view of what a you know it's it's sometimes called the cradle identity or that you know I think Americans need and I think with the right leadership you can lead them\nBack to is probably going to take a lot of\nOther things like maybe some big external shock you know like a war a crisis or a you know financial collapse you know to really convince people that they're in it together um [noise]\nWe're going to get the integration and just you know what I Want to go back because one of our audience members want to go back to this idea about\nPublic policy in policy ideas you want to know why why you think there's ... there's a serious thinking about public policy for policy solutions for Thirty years it'd be kind of identity politics offered she has to do and what about the proliferation of professional graduate school programs in public policy studies\n[noise] uh I don't think it's yeah so I have a lot to say about that but that's a separate evening conversation [laughter] um no I think that what happened is that a certain narrative\nTook hold in the wake of you know the great society in the Nineteen sixties that that then a concealed during the Nineteen eighties Nineteen nineties which is that ambitious social\n\n\nI'm Angie Claire oh you are listening to indeed my guess is Frank Fukuyama we're discussing his latest book identity he's just punted two conflicting polls in the immigration debate the far right in favor of a wall in strict enforcement the far left wanting no restrictions I took him up on that\nKind of different here because I've been covering immigration for your time I haven't come across people who think that it should not be enforced period I've heard a lot of people injecting pouch in for Neal who is enforced on versus who is not enforced on you know taking kids away from their parents yeah very different than saying we don't want to enforce it off\nEverybody pays lip service to enforcement but the question is you know whether you actually\nTake the measures that would be necessary to do it if you really want it to enforce immigration laws you don't build a wall\nYou basically need some form of employer sanctions and to have employer sanctions you have to have a national I. D. system and people both on the left and the writer opposed to having such an ID system\nUh and then the employers themselves don't want this you know they they don't want the burden of actually having to be the enforcement agents\nAnd quite frankly many many American employers benefit from having undocumented people working for them because they don't have to pay benefits they don't have to pay the same salaries you know so and so forth so there is a lot of practical opposition betray real enforcement policy\nAnd by the way the reason you got to go to employer sanctions is that as many as half of all the undocumented immigrants in this country are not people that\nCross the Mexican border they are visa overstays lawyers\nWho came in legally but we've just lost track of them and you know they're they're in the country without you know legal permission\nSo enforcement is actually a tough thing it'll cost a lot of money and it will be tough on people because if you're going to say you can't work here unless you actually have some citizenship or you can prove you go you're on the path to citizenship you know a lot of people are not going to like that\nThat actually takes is one of the audience questions because they refer to the international relevance to some of these issues the whole world seems to be going through similar polarization and identity crashes said talk about how this reflects some of the I\nI I could have started there really easily 'cause I run this International Center studying democracy around the world and the reason we got into this whole set of issues is that\nThere is a global populist movement that has arisen in places like turkey hungry Poland the people that voted for breakfast in Britain uh every European country now has an anti immigrant anti\nThe Sweden Democrats got Seventeen percent of the votes now the third largest party and the Swedish of parliament and so this is a global phenomenon and in fact I mean I was talking to a journalist this morning about this upcoming election in Brazil you've got this\nTo compare him to Donald Trump is really\nI mean he's like a super Trump you know a a you know he actually\nHe praises the military dictatorship you know in Brazil in the Nineteen sixties or he's willing to use you know kind of race baiting a much more explicit way than you know than our president uh and so you're seeing a lot of examples of you know\nPopulist politicians opportunistic Lee using these calls to identity to get themselves into power and the big problem with this from the standpoint of someone like me that actually likes to mock liberal democracy is that\nYou elect somebody like that they're anti institutional they say why the hell should I listen to these courts these judges or why should I tolerate all this criticism from media mainstream media all these bureaucracies that aren't doing what I Want I'm going to dismantle all of these check and balance institutions\nSo that's really you know that's the agenda the\nPresident right now in this country but that's what's been going on in Hungary where they've dismantled their independent judiciary they're doing the same thing in Poland they are basically neutralizing any kind of critical media so this was a big problem around the world [noise]\nQuestion from the audience on the topic of good and bad identity Jay Stanley differentiate good and positive propaganda speech ... speech based on whether it supports forced to merge course societal values could this criterion be applied to judging assertion identity\nYou know I think so so if you say that the fact that I'm born into a group is determinative of you know a lot of things about me you are actually challenging a pretty core\nValue because in a liberal society we regard people as individual agents who can make up their own minds about you know politics and culture in life and everything else but if you say that because you're a member of a group you really have to think a certain way I think that becomes very problematic\nYou know there there's another a more extreme example of that in Europe or where you have Muslim families\nWho send their daughters back to Iraq or Pakistan to do and then ranged marriage\nOr and then you know they've had these controversies should the state's support the family on the basis of cultural tolerance or should they support the the girl that doesn't want to you know get this um arranged marriage\nI just think there is no question in a in a liberal democracy you've got to support the girl because our core values say that you know women are individuals you know they're individuals with agency they should be able to make these decisions and\nThey're you know their families should not a override that individual decision but you know the problem with that kind of multiculturalism that understanding of multiculturalism is that people say well we have to respect the culture and the culture\nYou know subordinates women or is anti Semitic or is anti you know eh LGBT you know I mean you name it a a there are a lot of very liberal values at stake there so yes I think that's probably a good criterion\nQuestion in the audience knows dissent than I've seen an action a number of times how do we expect used without being labeled with a bad identity and one of the conflicts that I had seen their minorities or identity groups who are sick and tired of explaining their reality every damn day\nIt being representative of my community you know totally get that on the other hand there's an opportunity to educate the get lost there that's a conflict of two very valid points of view mhm huh how do you have that discussion\nLook I think that you have to have two parallel conversations right so you need to build understanding of the specific\nOf forms of marginalization of all of these different groups and they really are different from one another uh but you know you also\nNeed to shift from you know lived experience to just plain experience right uh so lived experience is you know subjective experience that\nReally only I have access to but you also have have community if you can somehow transcend lived experience to just plain old experience which you know can be shared with people where you can have communal memories that are actually broader than simply a small group so I just think you gotta have both conversations\nAbout populism says someone from the audience I really needs to be a bright spot in Europe Seventeen percent of the population foreign born with no discernible populist movement can you comment on that\nYeah there's other countries you can point to so you know the United states has about Fifteen Percent foreign born right now Canada's got like twenty two twenty three a Australia's got a higher rate of foreign born in the United states none of these countries have serious populist movements\nIreland's a complicated case because it's a lot of that has to do with its relation to written in Northern Ireland but\nIn the case of Canada and Australia\nThe difference the big difference in their immigration policies versus a skill based policy\nOr so a lot of the people that come in these foreigners come in are wealthy skilled their doctors you know they find ready places you know within the economy but the second thing is that they really don't permit a illegal immigration\nKnow Australians deal with this by taking all these refugees and sticking them in and now we were popular in New guinea which is not a very nice thing to do\nBut the one thing that that has produced is there's no backlash because people think that the government is still in control and\nWe're only going to take as many immigrants as we think are good for our society and I think that's important so you can have a higher number of immigrants if you feel that you know somehow it's a it's a managed form of immigration\nBecause you happen to read a biking economics by George lake you know I didn't hear it meant admiration for the Nordic system is that you can\nIntegrate but you must work mhm and you don't necessarily get to live in the town you want to leave and if we find you a job and it's over on the other side of the country you will take that job and you take it for a year now and wants you to stab yourself you can do something else happening\nWell you know frankly I think that if you want to properly assimilate immigrants you can't just have a less safe fair you know liberal policy where everybody does whatever they down please the government actually has to take a positive role and the most important role is in the in the education system", "year": "2018", "show_name": "In Deep with Angie Coiro", "city": "San Francisco",

Angie Cairo and this is in deep one full hour on one intriguing topic\nMary Robinson was the first woman president of Ireland she didn't seek political office out of sheer ego or from yourself aggrandizement if she had she could have taken her long list of accomplishments her work in law academia then asked president of Ireland\nAnd called the day but instead she took on the mantle of the un high commissioner for human rights I don't know that same passion she publicly challenged America's human rights violations in the wake of nine eleven\nPresident Brock Obama awarded her the presidential medal of freedom in two thousand nine she founded the Mary Robinson foundation for climate justice eight years ago\nLast month the global climate action summit brought her to the bay area just as she ... her new book climate justice hope resilience and the fight for a sustainable future\nThe book collect stories from around the world about individuals who've taken a stand against global warming and had marked effect on the people and environment around them from a hairdresser in the American south to a defiant young nomadic early and chat\nThey transform themselves into effect is influential climate activist later this hour we'll hear from one of her subjects but we started by talking about Natalie in Australia who slowly started to question the impact of her own very comfortable life\nYeah I was lucky enough to meet ... several times in Australia when she began her one million women project and she kind of explained to me what she was trying to do and it wasn't actually going very successfully to her surprise because she had\nFound when she decided to take decisions in her home to have the right light bulbs to turn switches off to eventually abandoned her car which was the hardest one and that but she could save the hustle budgets\nAnd she felt well this is grace if I could just skip other women to do this we can all reduce our carbon footprint the one million wouldn't ... women found it it'd be easy but\nIt wasn't easy because for so many people it was you know I so many things in my life and this was an adult and it wasn't central mhm it had become very central for naturally you know she got very charged up about ... and I've watched\nHow she went back to the drawing board little bits and said I Need enough to make it easier for people need to do more things to help to make people realize that this is very serious\nAnd that's what he's here at the conference I've I've met her several times and uh actually I was just before this I was talking to a group of Irish bar on women most of the marriage for and who are here\nThe bay area generally I'm doing well in business\nAnd the other's consul general brought them together to talk with me and we were talking about women's leadership and the example I used was naturally mhm because she's the examples that we can all learn from the you know what I really like about her was that she had the vision\nAnd even though it it wasn't so easy she kept with such an modified lived up to ...\nTo make it better and now she has a very credible amount of followers some and some were eight hundred thousand or something who does not bother if you're looking for a million\nOther she learned the same thing that you've learned which is that you can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good exactly can't do it for you fly a lot but yeah if I Try\nI Love note to let my voice trouble you know I Do a lot of videos for conferences for my foundation offsets obviously when I traveled 'cause we're very conscious of the carbon emissions are but if you want to convince people if you want to make the case if you're ...\nThe book has to travel here so that her voice would be heard at this conference which is extraordinarily important if you wanted to convince people if you want to make the case [noise]\nWe have to sometimes be there and you know that's clearly I think the problem but then I Know that every day we are to the problem and that's part of our responsibility was no getting away from us\nRight and obviously going to talk a lot more about the book but I Want to talk about what's been happening in San Francisco it is quite to do there are celebrities there are big money companies that are pledging investments and research and investigation\nThere protesters outside they say it's too much window dressing going on there's not enough real action so what's been your part in all this last couple of days\nI think it's very important that there is a civil society that is protesting and wanting more and they have every reason to do is because we're not on track for say for us and [noise]\nWhat was actually being said especially by the scientists I've been on a panel twice now at this conference with Johan rocks from um of the punishment boundaries project in Sweden\nAnd he scares the living daylights out of me and then he kind of puts a positive way that we have time and that there were new energy is coming cheaper it we can do this and he's just issued a report with Christiana forget ... a road map of how we need to get there and um he gave me the copy of this and I kind of tried to look at somebody but it you know I'm not a scientist\nBut I really respect the fact that we are getting closer to that tipping points much earlier than science of ... and that's serious because we are the only\nA generation such fully understands the dangers of climate change except for those stupid I don't even call them climate deniers I called them fossil fuel\nHarvard has in the pocket of fossil fuel level they are and I have because nobody in their senses can deny climate change in our world today nobody I don't actually be anybody in good faith can stand up and say I don't believe in climate change it's not it's not possible\nBut ... and what we do know is that we have enough time just just enough time to change course enough and we must do it more radically must not have business as usual mostly transformative not unless we have civil society marching and pushing\nI took power to the big march in twenty fourteen and before the climate summit the Ban Ki moon hatch and before the Paris Agreement\nAnd I was marching along with a group of elders The Elders Nelson Mandela brought together that I'm privileged to belong to and I was working with Gruber influence of the Brunson commission of great pleasure to be walking with her as well because she's the mother of sustainable development if you like\nAnd um we've a wedge together and it was hard to move and we weren't actually making much progress we were slowly moving along because we're so many of the four hundred thousand people in in the streets of New York\nAnd I saw a sign not very far away but I really really wanted to get behind really wants to get behind because he was angry grannies [laughter]\nWith everything you know angry ground [laughter] and we need the hungry ground news and the you know the protest that says I Want the safe world for my children or grandchildren\nBecause you brought up trumping the beginning of the book we have to go there [laughter] I Know you have\nThe vision um someone looking\nOutside in and meanwhile we're living here and I think they might be difficult\nFor people who feel like\nJerry Brown who is our leadership in the state but then there's\nActively doing legislation to make things worse ... how does the international community [noise] make it best move against that\nThe international community is extraordinarily aware of this for obvious reasons and uh you know what happens in America politics with America's followed all over the world as you know is weakening America is\nIn the short term at least damaging the reputation of America and its allowing China\nTo become a kind of leader a leader anyway on solar and electric cars and other you know but it's also\nBecoming a leader almost all the values of globalization yes even though China has its own way of articulation those venues and it's not necessarily always\nAnd you know very much and the full democratic tradition to say the least and so it's not helpful what when President Trump said he was pulling the United states out of the Paris Agreement which technically cannot do until the fourth of November twenty twenty and you know when your next presidential election is so that'll be interesting [laughter]\nEm eh when he did that it actually\nSlowed the momentum of powers it means that other countries have\nEased up a bit there isn't the same driving pressure but was very important for parents were two things one was that the United states and China President Obama and present she forged a relationship that they would\nSupport a Paris agreements and you had the high ambition coalition which was led by the Marshall Islands\nTiny up told Marshall Islands and Tony ... who has since died who was the foreign minister remind you of the friends he just persuade us he talked about ... do you want my islands to go under do want us to lose our sovereignty you know can you\nCan you really do this to us and he was so persuasive that he managed to get this fair but weak agreement because there isn't much enforcement power in the ...\nWhat I Do value and what we're seeing here at this California action climate action and some of ... is that when President Trump said that and I make this clear in the book it was very important to see the extraordinary coalition of we are still in of\nThis is in deep I'm Angie ... talking to Mary Robinson former president of Ireland about her new book climate justice conscious and Uganda and then indigenous people in Alaska and then what was happening in Vietnam in a lot not all but a lot of these cases\nThese are small areas it not only has not a great deal of money but they don't have a lack of communication there aren't news bureaus they're sending out pictures all the time thing people are dying to land is no longer arable\nI Wonder if this were more in our faces by our I mean to western developed world it would be so much harder to walk away from it\nThat's a very good point that's something that I Believe firmly and we need to know about the lives of people\nAnd their attempts to be very resilience despite the fact that they have no insurance no money on the side just how brave and courageously are many of them and what they're trying to do and some of them are stories of the United states I mean to the stories are stories from different parts of the United states after\nKatrina be facts the Charles ... who had been a hairdresser in east bloc see a woman of color whose father had been involved in the civil rights movement but she was just a nice woman and nobody would tell the stories on her cell phone and that was is and then it was completely destroyed and she had to kind of\nFind the courage\nTo become an organizer but she never thought she would be an she was quite funny about you know I never thought I'd be the one to be organizing women in my area and the community\nTo be more resilience of start fighting back after Katrina which of course hit communities of color far more than others as we know that's very much a factor in climate justice\nAnd when she came to Copenhagen she ... and ... was the book Mississippi girls you know I was going to an end to see you know a woman from eastern Uganda under showering from east Biloxi\nUm both of them distressed by climate telling their stories of climate wise women and from different but but actually one of them in the richest country in the world I'm a nevertheless brushed looking for ... ... ...\nLet's see what happens with the car learn of that will be ... I'm sure of the Carolinas north and South Carolina that will be poor parts I don't know myself\nBut I fear for some communities there may be whether they will be really badly his and be how long it will take them to recover lights it's it's if it's the injustice the unfairness ...\nIt's very frustrating when you're trying to after reality in some people's eyes it climate change is happening it is having an impact on people in our own country\nAnd the president comes out and said they didn't die that's very difficult to and how how can you educate when national leadership that's coming down on griping there's really no answer\nThat [laughter]\nI actually I repeat what I said I don't think there's anybody know who doesn't know that\nBut I don't think anybody who doesn't know the mountains anybody who is trying to deny it was just doing it for a purpose short term getting fulfill few promotion muddying the science we know it's it's tobacco industry on on steroids [laughter]\nYeah one of the things that I enjoyed in the picture you paint it as Sharon and I think we saw the growth in every one you profile as as\nThere is just as beautiful moment where she gets planted garden any garden hadn't happened before and she mentioned her table I Love that she made a table but when she saw it a little ... coming up through their answers practically dance and it's just a moment of realizing that she had control over this tiny part of the earth yeah it was after her\nYeah yeah I Know that that was a lovely moment soon and\nShe's a slightly tragic figure because\nUm when I really wanted to delve more into our story we discovered that she'd had a very serious heart attack on um wasn't able to communicate and she could communicate to her daughter with difficulty and the one thing her daughter said his showering once for a story ... so we actually\nYou know told us um you know right up front yeah I'm a real right up front to but also uh we we went to great lengths to make sure that um her story be told them achieve would once told you know right so yeah\nThere's some Lebanon here and there with how far one can go I mean there's a lot of hope a lot of progress and\nBut then for example with not only and I think there's a new major coal mine going up in Australia and if I'm pronouncing this correctly ... yeah that's an island nation that is going to disappear and you profiled the outgoing president he's frustrated because the incoming government yep\nDoes make it a priority ...\nYeah that's you have to power hardly for religious\nReasons yeah partly for religious reasons and you know God will look after his right you know which is a problem [laughter] um but ... but\nI think I'm really keen to do is to see how we can make this\nAnd something that people take personally no I understand\nThat and this is something I Need to be engaged and because it's happening to people it's happening now this is how they're responding and it's in rich countries in poor countries I mean we we also have the dish example Sammy and a Johnny ... stuff that's on right now I'm In I'm a I mean\nShe she's a wonderful young woman she dresses and this lovely ... dress\nAnd she spoke very well at the Paris Agreement she's a woman who had the benefit of education has a degree in chemistry has had racism racists questions you're not a real member of the many cultural you I mean your education you know I mean you couldn't possibly be and you know and that's\nAlso part of the story but I was asked to serve on the panel the European Parliament\nAnd I asked who else would be on the panel it was a panel about climate justice levels the important thing was the women's committee of the parliament and to have the European parliament's have a a panel session in the in the in the in the parliament on women's leadership on climate justice was important those words even\nAnd so I was happy to do it but I Want to know who else was there and we were told that and that would be a commissioner of the day and I said well what about the voice of\nSomebody from grassroots soon as they and they said we couldn't do that and I said well why not a well you know we can't do that really and I said well if my foundation brings somebody would do less her you know and we proposed Johnny ethic and of course she stole the show\nBecause she told the story of being a reindeer farmer she told the story of the fact is\nA predictable way old was well\nBecause the reindeer could smell the nurture under FISA snow and you know ... and it's like an budge with this change from coal to suddenly warmer and then you get to ten sheets of ice\nAnd they range it would not be able to smells through the eyes and they would walk further and further and so with the herders on both rangers and herders would fall on the thin ice and die in quite a number died and this was a real real problem\nAh then she paused and with great kind of dignity and she said so I'm really glad that here in the European Parliament you have to sign it to have this meeting on women's leadership and climate justice what took you so long\n[laughter] twenty six year olds to you know\nWe need more of that kind of um I don't know it's just a it was just a lovely moment yeah of course she got a standing ovation but you know [laughter]\nThat her case in front of the other cases it seems that because of of racial prejudice or prejudice against what we consider an educated\nThere's first hand knowledge from the farmer and the migrant people I think they know the first you know what's happening here but they're first hand knowledge is locked yeah is that the prejudice is really\n... Hindu who is in the book cars sitting here in the front row beside my husband Nick spoke\nVery well this morning on a panel in front of investors and the next to this group of young uh went off to potential investors and climate change and they're actually a good group and they seem to have and good values\nBut she spoke very eloquently even about the Paris Agreement and I said afterwards that I as usual I learn something when I listened to him do what I learned was and it's true that the Paris Agreement is it is important for human rights\nAnd because ... and discuss you know references a whole range of human rights in the preamble notably uppers of text but in the offers of text it talks about indigenous knowledge as being important for conserving so as she puts it was and I think it's a points\nSo you take the indigenous knowledge is power just like bits don't concede the business writes in the upper as far as you know it was a very interesting points and I've learned so much from being lucky enough to listen to a lot of indigenous\nWisdom guardians of the seats those who've preserve the forest of the story in Vietnam of how to you know work at a level where everybody can participate and preserve the forest and the fruits of the forest and the ... the forest and you know ... it's it's very compelling\n\n\nIt in deep I'm Angie ... with Mary Robinson her book it's climate justice in the audience it's world can only handle one important issue at a time what's the most important women's equality economic equality or climate justice you actually look at that as an issue of intersection out you can't really put one from the other\nWell what I Would say an again I heard a joke in a restaurant say this as a scientist yesterday on the panel he was the same question and he said the difference is\nThat there are all these issues but climate change is the existential trash is the stretched to the future\nNot just of a human beings as to how we will survive the shocks of climate to be go to three or four degrees Celsius and five degrees but you know the world bank has brought her reports are lots of reports of how appalling that would be but also you know we're out of balance with the earth\nSo we need to do more restores at work we need to really get back into balance in order to restore bio diversity and get rid of the acidity of the oceans you know really work\nAnd to ensure that we have that sustainable future and that's why the sustainable development goals are very important but I suppose\nThe other equivalent threats are\nThe nuclear threats it's their you know we could see a lot of destruction of the um we could see 'em some you know terrible I'm I'm pandemics\nEm people fear that suffer but the one that I'm most aware of and most conscious solve is the climate threats and that we have this window of time which our children and grandchildren will tough if we don't take steps\nAnd you know have the country or would you change which we are beginning to have I mean that's\nThat's the prisoner ... I mean we I Do see a lot of change I see a lot more awareness and I see companies and and philanthropy and solar when they're all becoming cheaper and joke in a row strum said yesterday that I'm Sorry you have real strong that said by twenty thirty\nHe believes that fifty percent at least of the energy of the world will be clean\nHe was challenged by somebody in the hole and he said that is our predicts the moment on business as usual\nWe can make it better if we are game and it was a nice answer you know that is our predictions on business as usual and because it's coming down so quickly when you get to fifty percent and we're new energy you know\nThey are stranded ...\nWhen I heard first heard that expression stranded us it's a you know your question you know you look to question to me I said what's a stranded S's and the person that I said think justice justice is too dangerous to use too dangerous even to be you\nKnow in contact with who you love to see that idea penetrate well it's it's a merging you know why you kind of change of feminist issue M well let me explain a very careful here [laughter] our podcast is called\nMothers of invention\nAnd we say that climate change is a manmade problem and requires a feminist solution [laughter]\nWhen we say manmade problem that of course includes women that's a generic manmade problem in may ... human laid problem\nAnd feminism does not exclude men happily more and more men are describing themselves including prime minister is like a ... Justin Trudeau of Canada and many of those\nUm as being feminist and wanting some and it's more um to me the that approach is based on a real understanding of the color see between men and women and an inclusive approach and the approach based on Venus are that are basically the values of the sustainable development\nGoals mhm yeah I'm afraid of that answer no I just I just know that um it needs explaining okay yep got no afraid of us I'm very proud of it [laughter]\nI remember asking about the role of population growth in climate change is that something that needs to be controlled it's a very important\nQuestion but it's the wrong question\nUm because it it it kind of books but the control would be from the outside\nWe need to do what we can and should do to reduce population absolutely mostly can and should do to reduce population is education women and girls and have health systems that work to cut down on maternal and child pornography [noise]\nWell in European countries and in and indeed and Europe is not becoming an aging population because what too well in some senses were not renewing our populations enough them out as a bit better than some other countries but but the point really is\nAnd and that is the only way and we're in a situation and you know let me um you know give you the personal sense I have the knick has heard me say this over and over again and it you know he's involved as well it's our grandchildren but we're lucky enough\nTo have six grandchildren and of our three children\nAnd they've even done the boy girl boy girl boy girl [laughter] wonderful [noise]\nThe oldest is fourteen and they will be in their thirties and forties in twenty fifty and they would share the world we know with about nine and a half billion people that's that's kind of baked in\nIf we don't get that education to women and girls in good health systems in the country's a high population growth and then it it will go to ten billion\nVery quickly after that and maybe twelve billion of the world would find it very difficult to tolerate that so um yes we need to help countries I was in the lobby and not long ago I was my church does it ... and and\nIdentify in population terms with monopoly or in the Nineteen sixties mommy has the same population\nTreatment them cremated and\nHumid and [laughter] and\nIn Ireland we have now four point eight million in\nThe lobby they have at least Fifteen million but that's not the points at least Fifteen million you know it's just a little bit how they they've a census now so but they know sharply more accurately\nBut by twenty fifty they wouldn't have fifty ... ...\nThat's the thing now how do you plan for how do you plan for schools or the plan for hospitals or do you plan for jobs or they plan you know yeah it's a and that is the story of Africa that's the population would double by shortly after twenty fifty\nAnd planning for climate change is planning for that and these are all inextricably linked next\nAppealing to me that if you have stressed and you know because of climate ... M food production I'm an stressed water water being a very big issue\nAnd at the end we're not getting support for the clean energy which would help enormously on all of these issues and yet there are um you know there are a billion people in our world today and the twenty first century who never switched to switch for electricity\nWe've got to quite a number of them\nBut the ones that we now need to get to earn more rural communities more andme slum areas in big cities harder to guess and yet it would make a huge difference for their lives\nIf we can get them the energy to come out of the deep poverty and become productive become alternate ... you know and have little businesses\nAnd which is what happens when they got the energy\nI'm very pleased to say that you brought along kind of a surprise guest with us and we're going to transition to that I Do want to ask you one last question you were addressing a group and you use the phrase that I'd never heard before you talked about trying to bring people into the solutions and the benefits of climate change\nEver heard anybody talk about the benefits climate change before\nBut it's the benefits of and how we are moving to the clean energy world\nSo it's the benefits of the upgrades energy in particular the distributors and solar panels on small groove 'em at all the systems that exists only and there are a lot of people and working on this I keep missing them sold her sisters love people India lots of people and but it's it's not enough\nAnd it it's almost and frustrating that we're not understanding that we should be doing this we should we should we should have governments together saying in the next five years we will work on this and nobody would be without clean energy in the poorest parts of the world nobody\nWould get you know it's it's actually do [noise]\nIf it was a priority of leaving nobody behind of prioritizing the further behind first which is what is said and the and and the twenty thirty agenda and and just the difference that would make two women in particular because it frees up time they don't have to go ... miles for far woods\nFirewood destroying please an undermining\nI'm In a way there's ... understood very well with the need to replant and re forest and in order to uh have the soil and have the security and have the food production that goes with us and I liked projects

San Francisco from the dragon theater in Redwood City California I'm Angie Cairo and this is indeed one full hour on one intriguing topic\nThis hour we'll be part history lesson part rally of hope my ... D D gotten plant is incredible observer of America's political Meyer\nAs award winning journalist author and editor at large at the nascent his latest book weaves together American political history\nAnd profiles of today's Americans who are working to make history well to bend the arc of history toward justice\nThe book is called an extra public the rise of the new radical majority and he's here with us at the dragon welcome thanks so much great to be here about the evolution of words first because the word populism has become almost a dirty dirty word yeah what what's going\nOn and I and I'm trying to rescue it that's one of the things that this book is trying to do is trying to\nPoint partly because I live part of the year in Europe where it is almost only a dirty word at least in America it's still contested I'm so in Europe it's all about Donald Trump Viktor Orban you know the prime minister of Austria the leader of Italy or none of whom were ... people you would want to associate with politically\nAnd I think the reason for that is because Europeans don't know anything about American history they don't think we have any history so they don't bother to learn the populism is an American invention we invented it in the Eighteen eighties originally in Texas clever and Texas and then in Omaha Nebraska\nAnd when you say we invented what what would you define it I'm\nSure well it was it was an agrarian revolt it was a a revolt by mostly southern and Midwestern farmers\nAre against the system that was called the debt lean systems so the way that worked as you would have land and you'd be a farmer but you wouldn't have any money\nSo you couldn't buy seed or fertilizer or the things you needed to plant crops so instead you would go into debt to do that and the the furnishing man as he was called was the person who would lend you those things in exchange for a lean so first call on whatever crop you got\nIt was almost like Cher cropping except that it wasn't share cropping\nBecause your debts get larger and larger and larger as anybody who's for example a college student in the United states [laughter] I can relate to\nYou know your desk just piling up and getting bigger and bigger and bigger and so this was also at the same time that the railroads were imposing you know heavy fees on farmers who wanted to ship their grain to market John de Rockefeller was making sure that the railroads he owned\nGave preferential treatment to him and punish people who are not part of standard oil or part of his combine so people rose up together\nAnd it was what was interesting about first of all the the great history of populism is called the populist moment it's by Lawrence good when\nI recommend that anybody who hasn't read it should read it right after they read my book but it's fantastic and he he calls populism a cultural achievements of the first magnitude\nAnd that's because he understood something that the left has forgotten but that Breitbart understood and sad and Steve Bannon quotes a lot which is the politics is downstream of culture and what that means is that if you want to change the world and you want to make political change\nYou sometimes have to change the culture first so the culture that the populists were were revolting against we're trying to change the culture that said that farmers were ignorant people they didn't know anything\nAnd if they had no business arguing with the furnishing merchants or the bankers are the people who wanted to run their lives and sees their land and take their houses\nAnd so they came together and part of what they did when they\nWhere they would essentially bringing lecturers who would explain things like how economics works how loans work\nYou know what the history of land tenure issues in the U.S so that they had intellectual equipment\nTo base their revolt on a and they found it a political party called the people's party which a sense where the word populism comes from and the people's party Rand candidates\nBut they also did things like they issue these demands so the the first populist platform was the clever and demands and Texas the more elaborate one was the Omaha demands in Nebraska and the interesting thing is if you look at the Omaha demands they are demands for things like an eight hour day\nFor a old age pension is for\nEqual rights for men and women this isn't an era when women didn't have the vote ... uh and\nThey were dismissed as pie in the sky things that could never happen\nThey became part of the socialist party platform or by the Nineteen tens the same set of demands and the interesting thing is that then the progressive party which was the sort of\nLeft wing of the Republican Party or in the early twentieth century past a lot of them into law under the under Teddy Roosevelt presidency so you know these things that were impossible in Eighteen eighty were law by Nineteen twenty and\nI guess the thing about the populist for me is that\nThey represented a revolt of most people the majority of people against an elite the told them they had no right to a decent law right and they were a political uprising they were also an effort and early effort to build a multi racial movement because the populists\nIn the south or mostly white farmers but there was something called the colored farmers alliance\nAnd they would they would wage campaigns together against banks and against furnishing merchants and they also came up with their own vision for a cooperative economy where people would be able to borrow\nFrom the government based on banks were based on their the crops instead of borrowing from private bankers and from private capital\nThey want to basically land bags which is in fact they have these things in Germany and European countries where if you're a farmer you can ... you can borrow based on your land at very low rates and they had these ... they they wanted the ... the farmers to foreign cooperative to market there\nYou go to market their products cooperatively so they could get a better price than just one form or trying to sell stuff so a lot of things they did\nCame to pass but the political wing of the populist party that sort of running people for office that didn't work out so well I mean they they got millions of votes in Eighteen Ninety two and then in Eighteen Ninety six or the populist party and the Democratic party both nominated William Jennings Bryan for president\nAnd instead of running on the sort of broad populist platform he essentially ran on a kind of [noise]\nRepeal the gold standard and uh make silver legal tender platform which was much more narrow it was much more conservative in a way than the full populist platform and not only that but the he had I forget who his vice presidential candidate was on the Democratic line\nHis vice presidential candidate on the populous line because he was running on two two two party lines which you could which you could do then was a a Georgia newspaper man called Tom Watson Tom watching wasn't incredibly gifted campaigner an organizer who had done a lot\nSort of to unite white and black poor farmers in Georgia\nBut he was selling deterred by the the way in which he felt Brian sold out\nAnd and the way in which he felt that they were betrayed by the Democratic party\nThat he became an incredibly toxic racist instead of ... campaigning for sort of you know in an alliance of black and white and ...\nA white supremacy and on anti Semitism ... it was Tom watching the sort of after the the demise of the populist party\nThat was the main propagandist for lynching Leo Frank the Jewish businessmen who was who was the only white man lynched in the state of Georgia so populism has a mixed heritage mhm and the thing is you have to be honest about the mixed heritage but what people nowadays tend to do is they tend to only focus on the sort of\nYou know the disaster afterwards rather than the promise of the movement right\nIf we want to deconstruct what happened back then one of the things I'm most curious about is how some of the very same things they were fighting for than we're still fighting for now what kind of messaging was being used in opposition to the populist party that might be reflected in the opposition today\nWell I mean one of the message is used in opposition was that if if white and black farmers got together then that would end white supremacy and you would lose\nYou would lose your social position you'd be no better than a black man ... uh you know another another message that was used against them was it was impossible that would lead to economic ruin a the country would go broke because one of the things\nThe populists new which mainstream ... economics has forgotten or is that the federal budget is not like a household budget you know household budget you have an economy of expenses and as Dickens said I think it was ... he said if your\nIf your expenses or a penny less than your income that's happiness and fair pay more than your income that despair\nBut countries aren't like that country's control their own currency\nAnd you know uh the populist understood that and they understood it not because they were genius economists but because of the civil war because they'd seen during the civil war that in order to pay for the civil war Lincoln had printed money he'd printed greenbacks which were the first notes that were not backed by gold\nAnd they were ... and that's why they're called green backs to distinguish them from gold bills that were backed by gold held in Fort Knox or another federal treasuries\nAnd he'd done not to pay the union soldiers and to pay for the the goods they needed for the union army and it had resulted in a an enormous explosion of growth in fact in the American economy\nWell I come back and indeed my guest is Dee Dee getting planned the book under discussion the next Republican the rise of radical new majority and I loved this decision I Love this image of you discovering bits of essentially an old society\nWell when I Would when I was traveling around Ohio I Would come across these things like the bowl federal building in Canton or the rubber dome in Akron which were obviously\nBeautifully built structures and the boat federal buildings this incredible curve front on the streets it's got all these murals inside a documenting Ohio history\nAnd finally I came across one that had a cornerstone and of course John said project I dunno eleven thirty two\nPi Wu a and that's what I realized ... W H stands for public works administration I realize that was\nThe W. P. A. the new deal was this last civilization part of that was yes there was a time when government understood that expanding the comments the the thing that we all owned together the public sphere\nWas both good economics and good social policy because it created\nThese wonderful things that we still have that we still benefit from if you go to the Cleveland public library you see these wonderful WPN murals of bridging the Ohio River you know if you go to post offices all across the country if they have murals and then they were probably painted by somebody on the on the artist project I'm\nSo there was the role of the ... there were government understanding its role and its potential\nAnd at the same time because Roosevelt had to fight World War two he had to pay for this incredible ... mobilization and produce production of you know plain ship's tanks all all the things you need to fight a war like Lincoln he had to make incredible changes to the economy\nSo that they they raise the top rate on taxes to Ninety five percent they started in the state tax so that wealth as well as income could be taxed and of course they ran up an incredible federal deficit\nAnd the result of all this was something that economic historians called the great compression so if you look at income distribution in the U.S from Nineteen thirty nine to Nineteen Seventy\nInstead of looking as does now like a huge pyramid with a few millionaires and billionaires is Bernie says at the top and you know the rest of the Ninety nine percent at the bottom what ... what it looked like during those years was like a a diamond did it been squashed any chance so it ... out in the middle of the big middle\nAnd a small upper class at a small lower class and that was the great American middle class and that came about\nBecause you had this jobs program you had people who went and served in the war and then came back and we're able like members of my family to go to college on the GI Bill ... again which was free public college or in fact free college anywhere\nFor people who had served in the armed forces well that was a huge cohort of people and then you have programs like federal housing guarantees you a federal home administration you have this vast this vast middle class that was created during those years and it lasted it's long tale lasted up until really the Nineteen eighties\nThere were people who were vehemently opposed and I ...\nIt's time I have to wonder about what we're seeing now where is the pyramid where there are so many at the top and\nSo little money at the bottom how much of that can be recreated at this point\nWell you know Roosevelt always faced opposition he he made his great speech in Nineteen thirty six about economic Roy ... smell of factors have great wealth\nOr he understood that you can't have a more equal society without somebody paying for it and he was quite clear about who was going to pay for it and he was quite clear he said I rejoice than my enemies I mean he knew who his enemies were and instead of deciding that he was going to temper eyes and you know try and compromise with them\nWhich is what the Democratic Party has been doing for the last Twenty years\nHe's he stuck to his guns but it's also true that Roosevelt coalition his political coalition\nWas built in part on an alliance with southern Democrats who are committed to maintaining white supremacy ... uh and so at the end of World War two when you had all of these social programs in this great mobilization and again\nPolitics as downstream of culture so you had a big cultural changes in the Nineteen thirties you know you had African Americans Mexican Americans becoming much more assertive about their rights beginning to organize farm workers union so you know the cannery strikes and all all these things happening on the west coast but lots of things happening in the east coast and in the south\nAnd the southern Democrats were terrified\nThey were terrified that this newly empowered African American cohort who had fought in the war you know and then Harry Truman desegregated the armed forces a Philip Randolph had forced Roosevelt by threatening to march on Washington\nTo Institute a federal equal opportunities program so that all federal employment there was no discrimination on the basis of race um so they were threatened by that and they split off and they\nYou know they read baited they destroyed the most progressive unions through the Taft Hartley law on through making union leaders you know sign anti communist dose which many of the most progressive leaders couldn't do because they in fact we're communists uh so yeah capital fought back and you know eventually they weren't\nQuestions from the audience when you talk about public culture what do you think is the culture of Trump's base versus Bernie followers\nWell that's that's a really good question [laughter] I guess I think the ... the culture of uh of both we have a common culture in this country and I think it doesn't do anybody any favors to pretend that our culture on the left is somehow\nBetter more dignified more wonderful and the their culture is his crew we all watched TV we all laugh at many of the same jokes we all go to many of the same movies I Would say that um\nThat one of the cultural differences between us is that our culture seems more comfortable with difference and their cultures seems to be more about reinforcing sameness and keeping everybody it's almost like um you know the little kids who are terrified that the peas my touched the potatoes [laughter]\nDo you know I think I think that's a cultural difference I've observed I'm\nWashing the science of politics and the science of language both support that I'm Talking about George lake off the model of the conservatives want the firm's father figure were held them what is and then you have\nThe more liberal people look for more nurturing mother figure and and have more empathy and then you have all the science that Chris Mooney has put together that essentially underlines the same thing from a scientific point of view what parts of the brain light up when you're getting different messages\nYeah or you know ... or you I mean I thought that you know there's some data that says the the best predictor of who's going to vote either right\nAnd you know that may be so I don't know what I what I Do know is that\nIn a way I'm less interested in the differences I mean I think the differences matter and it's important to know who you're talking to\nBut I'm more interested in people who say the same thing to everybody\nIn a way that was one of the things that intrigued me about Bernie is that he said the same thing to everybody I went to see him speak or in Lynchburg, Virginia at you know ... Liberty University\nSo this was not a friendly audience you know if ten thousand people there might have been ten sympathizers ... [laughter]\nUm but he said the same thing to them he said look we differ on you know questions of religion and faith than we are and we differ I'm about lots of things but we all think that families are important and that people should be able to look after their kids and look after their parents\nWithout a fear of financial ruin so you know he made a pitch for common ground which I thought was interesting on the other hand or maybe on the same hand\nTrump made a speech in ... in Pennsylvania so hollowed out former steel town in western Pennsylvania where no politicians had come since John F. Kennedy went there in Nineteen sixty two\nUh and he talked about reviving American manufacturing and uh about the need for domestic production\nAnd his his speech was described in newspapers as a as a repudiation of a half century of Republican orthodoxy in terms of economic thinking because he he talked about the importance of manufacturing and the importance of what it meant to be a country that made things\nAnd you know I think first of all I didn't think he wrote his own speech and secondly I don't think he meant very much of it\nBut the fact that he said it and he said it to people who were desperate to hear it ... I thought was interesting because they weren't hearing anything like that from Hillary Clinton that what they were hearing for Hillary Clinton is we're going to put a lot of coal miners out of work and if you're lucky we'll give you some retraining\nAnd you know anybody who's ever been promised retraining\nKnows that the only people who get jobs when retraining is on the agenda or the people who are doing the ... ... so I think a whole lot of what happened in twenty sixteen was you had you had people who are desperate for change who were in pay and who were suffering and who knew that America was not great\nSo that when Hillary Clinton said America's already great they knew not to believe for cars their own lives were refutation of it every day\nBut the door to the left towards change was barred\nSo the only door that they felt was open to them was to take the other door to door to the right now the door to the right I think was delusional and you know hopefully people will be waking up to that but but if you were desperate for change you know it was hard to argue that you should argue that you should vote for four more years\nVery blue in the game\nAnd it's a little more time with Dee Dee gotten planned the next Republican the rise of radical majority this is Andy I'm Angie ... and let's talk a little bit more about union organizing to me that it's so key not just for the immediate you know here's a group of people who will benefit as a whole but this\nWhole philosophy that we can be empowered from below in from within\nWell I think so there are two things I mean Jane Mac levy who is this union organizer who's a subject my first chapter says that if we give up\nOn organizing together we give up the only weapon that ordinary people really have which is greater numbers you know if you look at the slogan of the later labor party under Germany corporate in Britain it's for the many not the few that's not he didn't come up with that Percy ... Shelley came up with that um [noise]\nBut that's essential to any majority are in politics that you have to be you have to mobilize an organized and show that you have the power of large numbers because they have the power of capital um\nBut there's another part of it as well which is what is the primary virtue of the union movement\nWhat what are we seeing a union routes we sing solidarity forever\nOr in the sense part of what my book is about is an exploration of the various kinds of solidarity not just within the union movement but\nWithin an across racial lines a solidarity with people who who have to dwell on the earth together and who have to you know be supportive of each other in our relationship to the land in a sense\nI guess I Would argue that solidarity is less cardinal virtue in the same way that may be the right thing self reliance on their car do for a tree you know we don't didn't need any help from anybody um whereas we have to help each other uh so I think that's another reason why I put a union organizer first but\nI also want to see them a against that I mean not against putting earring organizer first but you know if you are involved in left politics you will have heard from people who generally tend to look like me which is to say old white guys that um [noise]\nIf only women would stop talking about gender if only people have power would stop talking about racism that we could put together this class based struggle which would bring us to the cooperative commonwealth and I you know the identity politics has this terrible diversion\nAnd part of my motivation writing the book and in the way it's structured just to show that that is I'm not allowed to say the word I really want to use for baloney [laughter] that you know in a sense that's what destroyed the Roosevelt republic was the fact that it pretend at all\nThanks and therefore they were raised made it out of existence a and that the Democratic party pretended that they didn't have to to care that half of their you know the considerable portion of their legislative strengths was based on racist members from the south so\nI was saying you can't have a majority ... majority here in politics of this just class based yes it's true that there are more working class people than non working class people but it's not enough because you're then you're handing them wages they can use to drive us apart\nSo there's a chapter about a young man Carlos Ramirez Rosa who's a the first openly gay elected Latino in Chicago he's an older men from the city of Chicago and he's he's important for two reasons one is because\nHe's doing a different kind of big city politics or which is based on not advancing just his own career with being seeing himself very much is part of a movement and being always in a relationship with the movement that he derives his power from as an elected official\nAnd the others because he's doing a kind of really interesting immigrant rights rights organizing and work where in his neighborhood in Chicago around Logan square\nHe uses his older manic office and expense budget to fund classes which are\nSome of the classes are classes and writes for immigrants and some of the classes are called immigration one oh one and their their classes for allies on how to be supportive so that they've\nThey've organized phone trees in his neighborhood in his district so that if if ice shows up to deport family they can get on the phone and have a street full of people lying down ready to be arrested\nSo that the ice or people can't card away a family um so you know I think that's really important work uh there's another chapter about Chuck ... who's the mayor of Jackson, Mississippi\nAnd again he's he's in the book but partly because he's in Mississippi so you can't [laughter]\nYou know somebody said to him well how Donald Trump's election affect your your political work and he said well\nI woke up the day before election I was in Mississippi I woke up after the election day I'm Still in Mississippi were at the bottom of every table you know and it's the most racist state in the country\nAnd he's trying to turn Jackson which is both the state capital and a majority African American city into what he calls the most radical city in the country and he's doing that by these experiments in cooperative economics and\nSeizing vacant and abandoned land and turning it into into gardens to their cooperatively garden and are trying to do economic development in the way that doesn't involve forcing people out\nYou know he's he's trying to square the circle of economic development without gentrification and he's doing it all in the face of a continual racist assault from the Tea Party led Mississippi State government so I think what he's doing is really interesting in may he may not succeed it may not work\nBut he's he's tackling it head on and he's\nShowing a way forward that involves not skating past race not pretending that race doesn't matter but but treating racial justice is central to all his fights he's he's wager\nRight he's part of his success so far the fact that there is for somebody that residents there's so little to lose at this point [noise] well I think part of it is that there's little to lose I'm\nOn the other hand [noise] you know people in Mississippi a particularly in Jackson have ... have been promised so many things that didn't work and so many there have been so many false and betrayed promises that one of the things that he said to me is\nHe said you know I'd like to do all these things but I really got to fix the potholes because if I don't fix the potholes I'm not going to have any credibility and people are and the people can see the potholes you know they they can\nAre decent unsafe so he understands that he's got to deliver on the ... the nuts and bolts as well as the sort of you know program addict ideology [noise]\nWhy don't they don't want to make sure that we touched on because it's easy to have these conversations and talk about the one percent only as those who are working against us\nAnd there are for example the patriotic millionaires who are pretty much devoted to a left wing slashed progressive agenda\nRight now I I don't know if you're acquainted with what's happening in San Francisco with mark Benny off who's a multi billionaire versus Jack Dorsey who's another multi billionaire Benny off is with sales force which is huge and head of sales force and Dorsey is the head of both square and Twitter\nAnd this little micro cosmic thing that's playing out is bending office saying look we're billionaires we need to help the homeless we need to help clean up the streets of San Francisco it's for everybody in Dorsey is saying back I don't really like this particular plan to help the homeless\nAnd now banding office saying you're putting your money we got Seventy billionaires in ... square miles and half of you were just hoarding your money he's calling them out to watch this play out\nAnd to look at the world that you positive as possible in our book I mean there are allies among the one percent and it's fascinating to watch these two philosophies bought up against\nEach other I think they are allies potentially everywhere because I don't think that people's material circumstances determine everything about their lives I'm not that kind of crude material is so [noise] uh and you know and I also think that one of the things that the left needs to be able to do\nIs to take yes for an answer if you say we want to raise taxes we want to spend it on schools and hospitals and housing and somebody says okay then don't say to that person and by the way you're filthy rich person said yes it does you know vote for our candidates for our agenda but I also think that\nYou know part of what Donald Trump represents is to try to not just of capital but it's kind of celebrity as social capital ... and I think that's one of the things that we need to be\nWary of we need to be wary of annoying thing our own counter saviors you know whether there mark vennia for Bernie Sanders I mean\nThe Sanders campaign slogan said it's not me not me us a but Bernie didn't always act that way and I think you know it's important going forward and certainly the next time there's a presidential election that it be us that it be you know movements together\nUh and that doesn't mean we all have to join the same move went by the way that's another reason why I've I've not attempted to suggest or even pretend that everybody in my book knows each other works together they're all holding hands around the campfire singing kumbaya they're not they're each in their separate struggles but they're separate struggles are part of a larger struggle\nAnd most of them recognized that insofar as they are able to eight each other and so far as they're able to be in solidarity they do but it's not it's not about building one big coordinated movement it's about recognizing that each piece is important\nAnd the peace we haven't talked about the woman who's the subject in my last chapters effort teach s\nSo is that for um for west coast listeners was recently and unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic", "show_name": "In Deep with Angie Coiro", "year": "2018", "city": "San
