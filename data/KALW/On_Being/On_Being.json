sense of that is constantly evolving across life but there's some things you said about riding high science intriguing\nI feel like the way you've written about them as hell writing forms you as a human being like you wrote somewhere um it's an endeavor I go into a now provide solid deep joy\nPerhaps this story from writing seated comfortably in my court because of a life lesson it sure fight it writing has shown me what happens with patients and someplace else you wrote the surprises I've experienced in my writing practice have dislodged me from curiosity into love [laughter]\nI Wonder if you could say a little bit about those qualities and as a way into the question if what if\nYou're learning about what it means to him and to the likes of using\nI think they're writing practice um it was something that I had not expected to be a good fit I had never thought of why wouldn't it be a writer one day\nBut I went to the Institute of American indian arts and um they didn't have a music program that's what I wanted to study [laughter]\nBut I really wanted to go to school there so I felt like the next best thing is to study writing and\nIt was not easy a lot of uh I Would say the first three three and a half years\nI wrote some really really really bad bad bad poems like really dry it took me a long time\nBut I think it was that patients that is something I've learned through writing a sense of patients and their reward mhm that comes from that\nEven I'm just now thinking about the peace thirty eight but that piece for example took\nMe I Want to say\nMaybe a year and a half to two years to write but it was important to me it's kind of it's an ethic piece it's like six pages long yeah\nYeah yeah what did you just briefly say what what's happening and that he's\nIn thirty eight yeah\nBriefly in thirty eight it's a\nWritten two and four then duck ... thirty eight who were I'm thirty eight duck puts him in who were harmed\nAnd um as a result of this sue appraising which came at a time when the court to people there um territory their land was was getting smaller and smaller and um\nAnd finally down to something like a ten mile tracked and people ... people did not have um hunting rights beyond that\nUh and basically um and they had no se a store credit with the traders and so they were basically starving so there was an uprising and\nAs a result um these thirty eight men were hung and then ... ... people were moved west to South Dakota area in different um\nBasically they lost their land\nAnd if it was really large this is a legal mess execution in us history and yes and it happened the same week that President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation yes that is raised tree we don't know ... or we don't teach 'em yeah [noise]\nSo so you were just talking so this topic along this emerged to patients writing all of this\nNo absolutely I just think um that I've learned through writing the reward and the joy that comes out of just being really patient with a piece mhm and patient with yourself I think at least for me the imagination\nIs something that I have to really respect like its\nOwn little person yeah [laughter] and so I Can't do man too much of it sometimes I have to\nLet it take a rest and then come back and being conversation with it again but it's a beautiful process that I've learned through writing Mm yeah\nI was

beginning he was engineering number one o seven [laughter]\nAnd um when Google went public they told their engineers set who no longer needed to work if they didn't want to um [noise]\nThat they could stay but they had to do something that would in some way advanced Google's mission\nBut they could decide but it was so men decided it was going to be bringing meditation and he said I posted it and nobody signed up I don't know what to do and I heard you could help so I went out there and we talk to and we looked around and\nWhat we identified was that people are employees there are all costs\nI joined the top of their class from MIT or Stanford um had been in front of their screens most of their lives so I'm\nAfter talking for a whole day and figuring out what was going on there\nI suggested that we could offer the same practices but emphasized the practices that\nThat more directly cultivate emotional intelligence and that we could frame and then a different way and so we called it of course a big came up with this great name since they're the big search engine search inside yourself\nAnd then the subtitle is mindfulness based stress reduction and we asked Danny Goldman who also was in bug guy or with us back all those great guy I'm asked him to uh give a talk at Google about the relation between about ... just so important in the workplace and\nOn the relationship between meditation and Marshall intelligence he did that and then we posted the course and in four hours a hundred and forty people signed up and since then you know over two thousand Google lawyers around the world have taken the course and there's a lot of talk now about\nBringing mindfulness into the workplace yeah how's superficial it is and how it helps bad people do bad things better and and it doesn't help people question\nAnything it just makes them more satisfied with what they're doing but\nThis is a serious course and when you sit down and quiet down come calm quiet stable you have to do that in order for any kind of insight to arise and you do feel better usually although sometimes\nYou know really disturbing emotions rise but it needs to be taken to the next kind of level of depth in order for people to begin to\nQuestion right there but this course actually offers enough time practice and a teaching to help people do that\n[noise] I mean yeah and I think that's an important and refreshing thing to name that if you can be a great meditate or and also remained narcissistic right [laughter] I mean this can be superficial and it can be abused like any like any spiritual practice like yeah political correctness um [noise]\nBut you know nearby something that really\nSo intrigues me in um in your work and in some of your writing is how you know like the language of emotional intelligence that you've just been using and that's now so widely familiar including workplaces um [noise]\nThat what this tradition is bringing forward and bringing to the surface for modern people has\nYou know has this faring noble lineage um [noise] you know it's something that is a tradition that has focused on that for ... years but you know you wrote about how in Eighteen Ninety William James and the principles of psychology\nSaid that the faculty of voluntarily bringing back I'm Wondering attention over and over again it's a very root of judgment character and well\nAnd I mean I don't know I don't think he was asked but that is the intention right have yeah that is in and that is just quite amazing and then in the seventies you had a somebody who actually I had never heard of David McClelland\nYeah and William James hall mhm um who became a teacher to all these figures have gone on especially in narrow science to this you know Richard Davidson Danny O'Connor\nFascinating is that he was Quaker and then there was something in your work ... through\nAnd seeing that this contemplative impulse\nIs a kind of human and tradition as much as it yeah it's in their religious traditions I'm In ... center oh and cs Lewis send the idea of holding that goes back to play down high tech are somehow that you're just looking at your work has brought all that far away from me and it's really crazy him\nSo much [laughter] I'm honored [laughter] yeah but\nBut it's true when we started the center for contempt of mind we are we're looking for ways in which these practices might be helpful and sectors of American society other than health inhaling which is where it had started right and um we interviewed\nEighty people we identify this isn't Ninety six and seven so it was early but we kind of word of mouth heard and knew a number of people in different fields who\nWere beginning to integrated into their work or their organizations and we interviewed eighty people and we ask them for what practices they were there's and that they were teaching or [noise]\nAnd um we gathered these other little hundred practices from all the different traditions it I mean\nAll the religious and spiritual and of course psychological traditions to they are human practices they really about waking up to who we are appreciating we are opening our\nHearts recognizing compassion recognizing that you know there's a way in which there's much that we all share even with all of our differences and waking up to that can happen through these practices so we created on called the tree of contemplative practice is on the website\n[laughter] as soon as like breathing in and breathing out about three brass fan and I saw these arm's reach out\n[laughter] for their phones and brought lying down [laughter] for far right they brought their phones in front of them [laughter] I couldn't believe it was like the little Catholic girl and ... what's the second one just right [laughter] right\n[noise] well okay so and you did I get off work has Google and Google is part of the problem here to the point that nothing is pure and um but you also written about and\nIt's very practical like mindfulness practices like social media practice mindful emailing what do you talk about that yeah that's really ...\nYeah yeah um we devise that at Google\nFor loved that she put it in her magazine plus I'm I mean it's so simple but like most mindfulness practices [laughter] it's so simple and we don't do it um\nYou just type out your email either a response or an initiating email and then you stop\nTakes a deep breath follow your brass\nIn and out in and out ... and in and out and then you read the email\nAnd you read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it and there we were focused on emotional impact so you know is this person likely to be agitated or angry or you know frustrated or whatever the emotion would be negative emotion\nOr maybe even as this person likely to thank you I mean you're offering more than you actually are what whatever we ask them to think about it from that person's perspective and then either you know change it or not and then send and the first time we we did it\nThere was a week in between the classes and so a week later they came back and said how did it go\nAnd um they all said that was radical knows me using and then one guy said I did something really radical I said what is that I picked up the phone [laughter]\nAll right so you know I mean there we all are emailing to the people in the next cubicle you know and so uh that's really helpful really helpful ...\nI wanted to go back for a minute 'cause I didn't answer your question about social justice activist some really ... I got off on the leaf but yeah one theme that comes up so often with activists is that if I give up my anger\nWill I lose my motivation right and it's my anger that keeps me working for this change yeah what what mindfulness compassion practices others help with is the understanding that it's not\nActing out or on your anger and being driven by it on the one hand or repressing it on the other hand but there is a way to\nNotice your anger begin by noticing the sensations in your body and then notice what your anger is see it and recognize it as energy energy in your body\nHolds a compassion and echoing immunity for the situation because you're more likely to be able to see what can be done to make that change if you're not driven by anger because it causes your mind\nAnd it also makes communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult yeah whereas if you can cultivate equity and compassion for the situation you're much more likely to boats see interesting ways to resolve it\nAnd to be able to act on it I communicated\nWe did a lot of work with lawyers and judges\nAnd that last hundred is there anything about that I wanted to ask you about that are so interesting every special retreat for judges where they wanted to learn how to be non judgemental [laughter]\nIt's I mean we we laugh but it has you know it's a date with lawyers worry that\nCan they be zealous advocate for their client at the same time have compassion for the person on the other side of the case and um of course the answer is yes and what that means and what those judges men is not eliminating wise discernment\nIt's eliminating pre judgment so that day judges are\nUnbelievably overworked\nThey have so many people coming in front of them all day long one after another and they said you know\nSome young guy comes up in front of me and before I even know his name I'm already thinking\nThat this is probably who he is and what he's done right and they can't not having that arise because they're they're they are all day long hearing all this stuff\nBut they don't want to prejudge they want to be really there in the moment clear and open minded with whomever comes before them when it's really hard so\nJust being there and really listening to what's actually being said that can be cultivated through mindfulness practice and\nThey loved it oh yeah I just read in a a science magazine that the present moment as we experienced it has about two to three seconds long\n[laughter] kind of interesting great like physically like what we experience as a press about why that is true yeah and also that you can that it can feel longer\nRight which is ... have said oh yeah absolutely and that you can also completely not be there [laughter] you can just sit and be be uh [noise]\nI'm Krista tip and dishes on being today with what his teacher mirror by Bush who works at the intersection of industry social handling and diverse contemplative practicing [noise]\nYou know you said a minute ago like with everything with\nMindfulness and contemplative practice [noise] it's so obvious and in some ways easy but we don't do it and uh and I should say like for myself I have um\nI've had many experiences across the ears on different settings retreat settings or something less intense we're having the irony is that uh\nEven a kind of one off contemplative experience can be instantaneously gratifying right it can be just transformative and now they're asleep and all this science about how good it is for us\nAll that but it's very hard\nCreate this habit and has been hard for me I I have recently I wanted to ask you about that since I have you [noise]\nYou know I recently decided that I could do six minutes in the morning while my piece tapes which just seems so pathetic but yeah it's a it's a hard time yeah\nAnd I wonder um I Want to ask you this you work with so many different practices I mean are there\nIs this something where you really do have to find a way that works for you yeah well\nAt the center we we've done all kinds of things I mean we've had retreats where we've offered\nYou know we've had a Buddhist teacher and a Jewish teacher teaching traditional Jewish practices ... David teaching Christian practices um someone doing should be chanting we've done it that way and then\nInvite people to find something from all of that that works for them sometimes we've offered really simple practices like um\nMindfulness of the breads and walking meditation right and mine for listening and so on as an opening for people and then knowing that if they begin to appreciate the began to reshape the inner life\nAnd the benefit that comes from as you said I mean it's amazing that they found the reduction in stress and cortisol levels yeah after ten Fifteen minutes of meditation or that once people begin to experience that that they will\nFind what works for them the other thing I wanted to say is that there's so much work being done with mindfulness and that is a great introductory\nPractice but when I have found in the beginning you couldn't ever say what the ah environmental leaders called the L Word and they didn't mean lesbian meant [laughter] what what I meant the L Word was love\nAnd there are practices and most used is the love and\nKindness practicing rank Sharon ... has really written a lot about and the compassion practices are related to that in which you're more about appreciation for others and a desire to relieve the suffering of others", "show_name": "On Being", "year": "2018", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "28", "locations": [["Brazil", -10.0, -55.0], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Pittsburgh Pennsylvania", 40.44062, -79.99589], ["Sri Lanka", 7.75, 80.75], ["MPs", 33.09528, -94.96139], ["Turkey", 39.0, 35.0], ["Syria", 35.0, 38.0], ["Russia", 60.0, 100.0], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Russia", 60.0, 100.0], ["Nigeria", 10.0, 8.0], ["England", 44.0, -71.0], ["Jacksonville", 30.33218, -81.65565], ["London", 51.50853, -0.12574], ["India", 22.0, 79.0], ["America", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["India", 22.0, 79.0], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["India", 22.0, 79.0], ["arc", 48.86673, -72.08221], ["arc", 48.86673, -72.08221], ["New Jersey", 40.72816, -74.07764]], "not_found": ["u._s"], "ep_coords": ["San Francisco, CA", 37.77493, -122.41942], "in_country": ["U.S", "Pittsburgh Pennsylvania", "MPs", "Washington", "England", "Jacksonville", "America", "U.S", "New Jersey"], "out_country": ["Brazil", "Sri Lanka", "Turkey", "Syria", "Russia", "Russia", "Nigeria", "London", "India", "India", "India", "arc", "arc"], "in_state": [], "out_state": ["Brazil", "U.S", "Pittsburgh Pennsylvania", "Sri Lanka", "MPs", "Turkey", "Syria", "Russia", "Washington", "Russia", "Nigeria", "England", "Jacksonville", "London", "India", "America", "India", "U.S", "India", "arc", "arc", "New Jersey"]}, {"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KALW", "content": "\nOh early hook shelter book strangers and they're on land is a kind of map of what she calls the deep stories of our time it's based on five years she spent in Tea Party country far from her base an esteemed ...

you might end up closer to their perspective\nThat's it [laughter] I think I think that's true mhm that we are products of our own experience and what if you\nGrew up in a family um it's so many said oh we were poor but we didn't know it had a great childhood but we were poor you know [noise]\nUm okay what if that have been your experience and what if your dad's job and how much you earn was the

vocabulary we have for talking about social class yeah 'cause I didn't go just to another region or ... people with different political\nViews I went to a different social class and there is a lot of

[noise]\nWho are you know to put that down and there's a lot of humble pie to each year\nAnd a I think it's a problem I didn't know when I set out that I Would come back and be as critical of old

a reluctance to to reach out it's as if\nOn the left there's a lot of good political will but it's gotten curled up in\nOnto itself and become a kind of self monitoring program oh you said this wrong on instead of reaching out to build coalitions 'cause we're a big country not ruins like us I was like them\nWhat we need our sturdy coalitions and I think\nLabor unions when the labor movement was much larger him and [noise]\nThere there was a way that people of\nDifferent colors and classes got together and when you had a compulsory draft\nRight right with different colors and and classes got

[laughter]\nOur station myself that um [noise] there's critique that you know [laughter] they're all kinds of groups of people including like people of\nColor um who have long felt like\nStrangers in

when it's about other white people um\nHow do you have you work with that in your mind [noise]\nLet's see it's true and I think it's a it's an important insight [noise]\nYes I I think it's an excellent point okay I mean for example opiate addiction problem has has been oh now they're called a diseases of despair which is kind of a compassionate way\nCrack epidemic\nWith no yeah yeah oh whereas the crack epidemic in the inner cities which blacks ah wasn't it was a criminal and timely yeah yeah that's right now in worse [noise] so and so it's a point is that should be broadly received\nMhm [noise] so and when to draw too close to suspend just such a big wonderful conversation I'm just kind of curious about that you say somewhere that\nThe English language doesn't give us many words to describe the feeling of reaching out to someone from another world and Dennis is and I ... I ended up having that interest welcome and [noise]\nAnd he said some of its own kind mutual is created I just found that intriguing 'cause I think so much about the power of words and I wonder if you had 'em or their words you're using now he's thinking are there and and branch that gets out of symbols and how important that is frustration in constructing our world [noise]\nWell I use the word empathy and uh it's uh something we're all capable of\nAnd uh we in a way to carry around a little empathy map who we should and shouldn't feel and ... of and we need to enlarge those maps right and a

University of Montana in Missoula a blue city in a red state invited on being to attempt an outside the box civil conversation between two pundits with big following on contrasting ends of the U.S political spectrum\nIt became a sold out public event in the spirit of Montana's Senator Mike Mansfield who famously modeled integrity courage and humility across the partisan aisle in the gym onto the Nineteen sixties and seventies\nWe first reached out to CNN commentator Sally cone who for several years was best known as the liberal lesbian contributor to Fox News\nShe just written a book which gathered its own controversy called the opposite of hate Sally asked to be paired with Erick Erickson he was a long time executive editor of the conservative blog red state and he's an evangelical daily drive time radio host in Atlanta he enthusiastically agreed\nSince we recorded this conversation to two of them had been on polar opposite sides of the Kavanaugh hearings and as controversial as ever before\nBut I couldn't let go of a conversation I had after the event with two twelve year old girls who waited in a long line and they told me that come at the insistence of a teacher and had expected to be bored\nThere were instead exhilarated\nIn the short span of time in which they've come into political awareness they told me they had not witnessed or imagine that this was possible\nA true back and forth marked at once by bedrock different and goodwill humor and a willingness to bring our questions as well as our arguments our humanity as well as our positions into the room if only for an evening Mm\nI'm Christian ticket and this is on being this conversation unfolded at the Denison theater in Missoula, Montana and was co hosted by Montana Public radio [noise]\nSo you know as as I Move through two thousand sixteen um what started being clear to me kind of midway through the air is who ever won\nUm\nDeep work that we were going to have to do as a society was about was human work\nAbout repairing like stitching relationship across that rupture that had suddenly become on you know we can no longer nuts\nThat was going to involve each and every one of us wherever we were on the political or social spectrum\nTaking some kind of stock in terms of how we got to this place and um\nYou know Sally you uh\nYou know you you mean you say you're a liberal like your credentials are from\nUm thank you and I don't think so [laughter]\nI've worked really hard I yeah\nThat you tell a story that I found very you know and you know how you\nYou grew up as a community organizer and you know if you said that you know right wing or is more than my enemies and I hated them and you even grow up in a kind of ... up with a philosophy of community organizing that formed a lot of people that you're political enemies or devils\n'em and you you've worked to not be that way but in this election that all re service for you um you tell this story and I think also something that you both have in common is you're both parents are right in the thick of parenting and that's influencing how this reckoning are doing and you tell a story of being in your\nLovely leafy neighborhood block party and Brooklyn in the summer to sixteen and and there was a penny out of Donald Trump's head\nAnd you complained uncivil e [laughter]\nOne thinks they're mean and again it goes back to ... it's not just pulls talking to neo Nazis and talking to terrorists people think their motivation is fundamentally good\nBy mark\nThese trials didn't think they were doing something mean in fact they\nAnd um and and in fact when I heard some of their stories I was so struck that here I Am mildly irritated by the annoyance of\nBeing called things I Can't repeat on public radio on line um and they're going through real hardships in their lives and I think it's unfortunate in a number of ways that this was one of the things they choose to do with their time but still\nUm no one thinks they're mean\nNo one thinks their hateful no one wants to be hateful\nOkay how do we do with that what do we do about that because because we are we're we're meanness well\nThe only thing I was just saying that this was I think part of that is that they also didn't think anyone was paying attention to their tweets which I was like right now but still there were like I didn't think anyone was reading them I mean they are and ready forgotten it's ...\nOr it could hurt you that they make you feel that way you were feeling and then\nThey they have the opportunity a lot of them apologized ... thanks but why did you then do it right and the sort of\nIt has something to do with a lack of accountability it also has to do with this way that the Internet comes to exist within our own heads\n... and so I mean there are studies that when people have\nTo ah you know are sort of challenged to engage on line and a computer scenario but where they can see the eyes see a video of the eyes of the person that they're writing to we behave more kindly to there's this dehumanization of technology that then allows us to fuel\nThe dehumanization that you're exactly right Krista didn't begin with technology but but they they end up sort of\nNurturing amplify it yeah yeah yeah\n[noise] um mhm so I mean part of what I think we do is start to understand that we all have a problem\nRight and I don't look I don't I don't care who does it worse I happen to have an opinion on the matter about uh I'm actually unemployed I really think I'm curious do you agree with Eric as I come to think that\nAh that the left by and large uh is\nNicer to humanity in general but not people in specific and conservatives are nicer to people in specific but not humanity and Jack [noise]\nThat's actually something conservatives say regularly [noise]\nSo that's really interesting right and and if we can somehow figure out a way to say okay you know what I like let's try to\nYeah do books um but also from I think that point of recognizing at the at least at the very beginning nobody we all have\nHabit of dehumanizing and demeaning the other ... and we all think were justified and doing it because of them I've heard so many people in this election I've been a dinner party so many people\nMy liberal friday say oh they're game Trump supporters me that there are so bassist and they're so Islamophobia and I hate them [laughter]\n'cause they're so hateful I hate it out I Know\nAnd we blame the people for than expressing these views as do not it's been done to them but it's an inherent in them that that's who they are as people how can we say those two things at the same time so I Do think we have to have some faith in people's\nIntentions to be good and\nAssume I Try very hard and this is where I think it is a spiritual quest I tried very hard to assume\nI tried very hard to assume that you liked me\nIn spite of some of the but in spite of some of the things I Know you've read and and and there and it's written and said about gay people I still don't assume you mean\nMe uh well I don't\nCan and that and that the rest of that is sort of in the pension but it's also I I I Want to believe the best in people\nOh there is if I Want them to believe the best of me you you actually called that a daily spiritual practice that says\nYou know I mean Eric I feel like you also have been caught and one of them they're related dynamics of this which is that the culture we have created that dynamic is that we also really want to freeze people and the worst thing they ever said and then associate everybody who might be remotely like them\nOr who voted likes them so they didn't have been a very particular instance are you said something\nI mean you said a lot of us here at pundit but a few years ago you you made a comment which you later really have said many times in many places I regret you said something and coarse language about a Supreme Court justice\nAnd I'm wrote a whole chapter in the book about that one yes\nAnd um and the word goat was an inch of yes yeah and I've talked to my natural about this okay and and and when we announced on Twitter that we were doing this interview and I said how excited I was I talked to both of you you know and I hadn't actually picked up I hadn't followed the saga yet but\nSomebody came through and it shouldn't be on ... ask Erick Erickson what us you know saying this has to do with repairing civil discourse\n... you know it was totally made earlier that we sometimes in in when I did that it was I think two thousand nine\nAnd ... it was just I didn't know anybody but a couple of dozen people on Twitter at the time and it was just friends and it wasn't my remark it with someone else's and we were laughing about it and I took ownership of it though and I've had to apologize for nearly every day since\nUm but the number of people who still bring it up because they think I Need to be defined by the yeah and I've gotten a lot of people you wouldn't see this above right actually our route several weeks ago about people in the right suddenly being okay with dictatorship as long as it goes their way ... and\nThe common themes or one people don't know the record but to the fact that both sides really are at a disturbing point in this country where as long as their site is winning they don't care\nUh and I think that is only possible again and I hate to sound like worker record all this but it really is where my heart is right now that it only matters when we're oblivious\nTo the people in our city block\nTo the homeless people in our community when is just national politics when Washington is the be all end all of everything everything's obstruct because none of us are in Washington\n[noise] um you know look I think it's very\n... to point just it's dangerous to suggest the justice sort of return to prevent ... it could be the solution right because we have to remember that\nBefore the Internet before globalization and global interconnectedness and global awareness we still had segregation and we still had sexism we still had homophobia we still had all the things we had a lot of things that I think made this country great but a lot of things I think that we had to work on and that that\nProvincial as them that that especially given the historical way in which our neighborhoods have been shaped\nLed to a a lot of my opium so I'd say that look I have a bent on this and I I'm clear on it which is I Will never be nicer I Want everyone to hate last and I think progressive should lead the way the skull first\nLike look to the points that were making here or if there was a sign that said that professes um that people can change and go and in fact that is a core of progressive politics\nIs that please don't stay where we've been as a country in the\nSegregation and slavery and the subjugation of women and the you know yawning inequality economic inequality\nWe are not we don't have to stay there please don't stay there let's progress that is the idea of progression that that didn't make it invites change in the country and individuals\nAnd so if you if if your vision involves people changing\nAnd growing then\nYou have to be able to literally practice what you preach and creates space for people to change and why ...\n... when you see this because I said something somewhere on the right that you know we we've gotta we've got to improve we get a preview others are we going to reverse I\nAnd I get a lot these days we'll that's unilateral disarmament we we can't be nicer because the other side's gonna and there's just this is absolutely use those ... lack of faith to believe the other side is capable of growing\nYeah I um I get it to 'em I still have friends and you know activists and organizers who feel like hate and and ... says one of the strongest tools in their toolbox um\nYou know look I just I always returned to I'm One of my favorite quotes Martin Luther king quote and he says darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that yeah hate is not the answer\nTo hate and he said hey is too great a burden to bear correct yeah and it and you can't hate your way out of ... yeah I don't know what I Want to say liberals and I love\nThat definition of progressive\nBut I don't think progressive have you know a corner on the market of believing in human gross and change right and and you are a ... a a devout evangelical Christian and conversion is an important value and belief in Christianity\nUm I mean look we have to do something about um the way in which our lives in our communities are segregated and that is increasingly ideological or it's also racial economic um\nAnd you know it's a very interesting thing about the gay thing right like you could have the stealth gay people I was one\nWhere I was like ... in my family that whole time and then suddenly surprise I'm gay and they already liked me so it's sort of worked out well and that's why we have a quick progress on gay rights as a country that doesn't usually happens say with like black people are Muslims\nYou know like your cousin doesn't just suddenly one day come out of Mexican for so [laughter]\nBut if there are studies that\nYou know look kids who go to racially integrated elementary schools\n... grow up to actually they have less racial bias and college students who participate in racially integrated uh activities and after\nSchool programs are are actually reduce their racial bias so there's something about us knowing each other [noise] being together relating to each other but then\nHas a much more positive effect more broadly Mm mhm [noise]\nActually I actually leads me to one of the questions I Want to ask as we um [noise]\nAs we wind down which is\nIf the goal of a robust civility\nIs not that we agree\nRight and that in fact ah\nWe really do have some deep deep differences where there's not even going to be a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or a proposition\nIs that we we're not we're not going to let common ground easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist on creating something called con life that if it is about\nAlso just learning to disagree better when we're integrity more personal integrity not hating 'em what what difference does it make and like the two of you have been and you're both really good at saying you know I'm not perfect at\nThis you know Sally said I haven't learned to stop hating it and and and and Eric ... yeah you said some of them not what your book you know you said the need for a relationship and community is why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have men and\nCan still be on social media so so this is a work in progress for any of us and we're all centers um\nWhat is the experience you have\nOf what does shift what shifts what becomes possible what difference does it make\n[noise] I um\nHave\nThe experience myself of being unexpectedly kind in the face of people being cruel on line or off\nAnd seeing the difference it makes in yourself\nHim up for it and I feel better I feel better when I'm not a jerk I just do\n'em try it\nIt in them as well mhm uh people\nWrite back and say hey you're you're All right you know I'm your friend warning you that you might like [laughter]\nPrivilege of finding example after example I mean there are in credibly powerful stories of people who were you know professional hate mongers or\nKids who were just saying nasty violent racist\nThings and who the targets of that hate showed kindness and generosity and transformed those dynamics\nOn Twitter people who left entire hate movements because the people who they hadn't been raised thinking more hateful showed them kindness and I have to say I'm aware of\nThe power of the burden that\nIn a way this suggests is that those who are perhaps if you believe it's not even those who perhaps are at\nThe receiving end of more of the hate should have to shoulder the burden of taking the high road I I get that there are times where it feels daily unjust and him and in some cases it's too much to add to laugh at us and the other hand this is where those of us who are yeah privileged can in fact step up yeah\nAnd also I Want to say I I look I Believe in the high\nRoad I Believe in treating people\nLike they are all extraordinary and beautiful an equal\nAnd so I Do feel like that is the that is it that is the work\nAnd I I Am blown away by the difference it makes\nYou know I'm always struck um ... ... if it just riddle to some degree or what is the first bad\nIn scripture but what is the very first bad thing that happens in genesis it's not Cain and Abel and it's not the fall the circuit in the apple is actually in the garden of Eden before evil even ears the world God says it's not good for men to be alone\nThat's the first bad loneliness and so many of us concoct relationships in communities on line\nAnd we're still alone and then we get in our tribes a Republican conservatives liberal progressive Democrats will try then becomes alone insulated we don't mix and mingle\nWith the other and when you don't mix and mingle with the other it's a lot easier to believe the other is the enemy\nAnd I really push myself more and more to to make sure I'm actually having physical interaction with other people and you know we were with a wife\nWho has cancer\nAnd I know we're we're running out of good years\nUm and being in middle Georgia where most of my friends are on line or and not there are more and more mindful of the fact that it really is necessary for people to have actual real friends\nAnd I don't think there's a coincidence that all related Lee that we both began having these internal conversations um with having kids\nUm that level of local and I don't mean to keep our local here there's not an additional just community physical real break bread community ... in my book I Am a firm believer\nThat everyone should learn to cook\nBecause you should open your home and bring people in who you want to be your friend that you don't know um there's a there's a great Christian ... Butterfield who was a lesbian scholar at Syracuse and she writes to the Christian Community a lot that you and they're\nWe're an unlocked door in a war meal could be the difference between drugs depression suicide and that if we want real community it needs to be radical community we need to recognize that are ... are blessed to be sure with others\nFree\nJesus um\nWe under value in the twenty first century real community and real meals and if we get back to that I think lots of the world's problems can be sold around the dinner table with the war meal with strangers getting to know them\n[noise] I'm going to fit and this is on being today with Eric Ericson and Sally [noise] okay we\nCould finish one minute early which would please something deep and my radio bonds but I'd really like to get can we just keep going for five more minutes you're better I\nI don't know if this is a kind of just want to bring\nUp with the two of you and in this room that very much on my mind is that is so happy we haven't talked about the White House tonight right just because we're so\nFixated road from William for really because there's more\nTo life and there's more to politics has more to us in politics\nAnd um some things that puzzles me am curious about the two of you because you are in that world is that on so many of these things on which were so divided in which a lot of hate gets thrown around by the extremes which we allowed to define and frame of are important discussions\nThere's this middle ground this vast middle ground where people aren't the same but you know for example I mean you know\nFor a long time it's been true that on abortion\nYou know something like sixty to sixty five percent of Americans across party lines saver you know abortion with limit now there's a big conversation about what those limits are but rather than always having a same fight about it's always right or it's always wrong", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being", "city": "San Francisco", "day": "14", "locations": [["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Saudi Arabia", 25.0, 45.0], ["Istanbul", 41.01384, 28.94966], ["Saudi Arabia", 25.0, 45.0], ["Saudi Arabia", 25.0, 45.0], ["Cuba", 22.0, -79.5], ["India", 22.0, 79.0], ["Bollywood", 15.27642, 73.91271], ["Iraq", 33.0, 44.0], ["Hebron", 31.52935, 35.0938], ["West Bank", 31.66667, 35.25], ["West Africa", 9.56, 44.065], ["Egypt", 27.0, 30.0], ["Missoula", 46.87215, -113.994], ["U.S", 39.828306, -98.5795], ["Montana", 47.00025, -109.75102], ["Atlanta", 33.749, -84.38798], ["Missoula Montana Montana", 46.87215, -113.994], ["Brooklyn", 40.6501, -73.94958], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["Washington", 38.89511, -77.03637], ["genesis", 17.84345, -91.24932], ["Georgia", 41.99998, 43.4999], ["Butterfield", 36.75007, -93.9077], ["Syracuse", 43.04812, -76.14742]], "not_found": [], "ep_coords": ["San Francisco, CA", 37.77493, -122.41942], "in_country": ["U.S", "Missoula", "U.S", "Montana", "Atlanta", "Missoula Montana Montana", "Brooklyn", "Washington", "Washington", "Butterfield", "Syracuse"], "out_country": ["Saudi Arabia", "Istanbul", "Saudi Arabia", "Saudi Arabia", "Cuba", "India", "Bollywood", "Iraq", "Hebron", "West Bank", "West Africa", "Egypt", "genesis", "Georgia"], "in_state": [], "out_state": ["U.S", "Saudi Arabia", "Istanbul", "Saudi Arabia", "Saudi Arabia", "Cuba", "India", "Bollywood", "Iraq", "Hebron", "West Bank", "West Africa", "Egypt", "Missoula", "U.S", "Montana", "Atlanta", "Missoula Montana Montana", "Brooklyn", "Washington", "Washington", "genesis", "Georgia", "Butterfield", "Syracuse"]}]
