I'm Jesse four and my guest Eric Idle is a founding member of Monty Python you start in movies like the holy grail and the life of Brian in so many more he's got a new book out it's called always look on the bright side of life ...\nA memoir ... one of the things that you have to deal with is the important people in your life who you are I'm remembering after they're passing ... was added difficult part of writing the book\nIt was it was the hardest part I realized I mean I what I did this I sent out to write the story and I didn't want to go to a publisher I Want us to just write a book that I wanted to writes how I wanted to write to us on just let's see what it what happens why does it go to what subjects do I find [noise]\nAnd then off to bed I realized that I had been avoiding dealing with some people I knew who recently passed and I particularly Robin I haven't face the fact that I really didn't believe he was dead it totally and I owe it to him to write about him because I known him since Nineteen eighty and we've been very close\nUm to write something about him and says thanks fresh wants to kind of an extraordinary person he was and so that was sort of hard to do\nBut that was the that's the discipline of when you come back to a thing you try and put some shape into its ... knees what's missing ... can you put into the cake you know they make it make it better as a book\nWhen you did that when you're engaged with I mean Robin Williams is one of the people George Harrison is whether folks that you write about um Graham Chapman although Chapman has you know you've covered in many more python centric things in the book [noise] um\nYeah how do how do you feel differently about they're passing as a you know as a guy in his mid seventies like as a person who has a lot to retrospect about\nWhat you look around and suddenly all the people I found really funny and renting right we're going to dinner or I've gone Garry Shandling all Carrie Fisher I'm Mike Nichols you know they they you know and that's you suddenly there's oh I get it so what wait so the death thing that that does apply then okay\nUm and you know I think the fact is that you just it'd be ... to ... put things into perspective and then you know I like to encourage young people um and just you know ... to write about people I Want you to write about titles lights um\nWhat's that looking straight she broke eminent Victorians these an ambulance Elizabethan but uh I I I liked the idea of writing about ... says people who who you knew or have some insight into I think that's that's interesting for people and it's also interesting for me to write about\nIf the fiftieth anniversary of python coming up and you've done what you say will be your\nLast shows [laughter] um and you know you just wrote your memoir like you're in you're in looking back mode right do you still look forward to to still make the kinds of plants that you made ten years ago or Twenty years ago or fifty years ago\nI mainly one's a server read the books and [laughter] they're like a child you know [laughter] but um we can't do it again because sadly Terry Jones is not able to do it again and then so that's just a few of his left of able and it wouldn't be the same I think we did a big show in a big fat well\nWe have a little we may have some surprises up our sleeves but um it will be certainly\nNot us particularly performing it will be encouraging other things to take place I think that's the best I can express it um [noise]\nYou know ... fifty it's it's not our anniversary [laughter] ... somebody answers wedding anniversary [laughter] it's a very strange one but I thought I Would write my book because I knew I'd be ... questions\nAnd forgotten [laughter] do you think of it all differently now than you did Twenty years ago or even like I'm Talking about after the movies were made and so on and so forth but still a long time ago\nA very long time ago and it it just it's amazing to me because it just seems to get big I mean it doesn't seem to ... becomes more ... in the end you just you know well what can you do\nYou embrace it enjoy it and be grateful for all those wonderful people that you met along the way and all the many laugh we were doing comedy so we have a lot of blood is often that's really right\nEric I'm so grateful that you came here to be on

I've never been [laughter]\nI Know I was going to be a representative for single but um\nUm I don't know I guess like the show of it is that um many aspects it's it's almost like then\nIn New York that's excellent and I guess in terms of just like places that are on the outskirts of major cities\nAnd write what that kind of breeds in culture and uh yeah when people I mean it's it's it's kind of a weird place I mean I mean you know actually that mess of all is not even a masterful because\nThings and feeding as I tend to make actually these like playlists and mix tapes for myself of other people's music that\nFeed into it but then within that I've I find I see the things I'm missing or the things I Want to\nFill in and meld together so that's kind of Forman but it like the music doesn't exist you know like it's in my head this kind of thing and then I'm Bryson words down so I started rising level of ... and then I kind of like\nKind of work it out like I have an idea of why I think a track list and would be so I knew I wanted to open a record and use a change I wanted to go for in the middle and I kind of knew how and it's and it and then I kind of like fit it in and I make that mood\nYou know [laughter] it's kind of a weird way and so old attracts tend to actually finish\nAt the same time in the mix and versus region when I'm ... makes in Iraq and we'll just before that the ... start to finish because it's hard for me to finish track to if I Know I haven't finished checked three\nSo it's really rare that like I could play a track to someone but I'll ...\nIt it

any way they want because I'm\nGiven myself as a service to them and so if they want me to just sit and come up with many of these wild as a producer I'll do that if they want me to produce truck I'll do that you know it's\nWhatever they want to write in the room together just me and them create something then I'll do that I'm very like\nIf I've given myself\nTo that person and in that environment

path and if you know I knew about jazz which to me he was about learning to standards they provide them off of the changes and I knew about kind of more power you know\nI wasn't a rapper you know I didn't have the skills to be a nasty\nAnd this is like a third pack is like you could be a singer songwriter like our dream but it's still full of jazz information instilled parking and direct

foreign I'm so excited to welcome Susan Orlean back to our show Susan is a staff writer at the New Yorker she's also appeared in vogue and Esquire on this American Life she's the author eight books covering topics like New England\nSaturday Night in America an orchid fanatics last one the work at the F ended up being the basis of the Academy Award nominated film adaptation\nSusan is uh disarming interviewer meticulous researcher at a beautiful writer Newsday she lives here in Los Angeles where we make our show and being an author and to read or she has visited the beautiful historic central library here dozens and dozens of times\nHer latest book is about that library and its history and particularly about the devastating fire that almost demolish the librarian Nineteen eighty six the book is also kind of a pay on to libraries everywhere what they mean to her with us why every library is a vital institution\nThe book is called the library book it's one of my favorites I've read this year Susan Orlean a welcome back troubles I always happens you\nIt's great to be with you\nSusan what is your relationship with libraries personally other than your obvious\nFinancial relationship [laughter] one would hope um well I grew up going\nTo the library that was very much a part of my childhood and my parents were great\nLibrary doors they didn't really believe in buying books they I think they felt like why would you buy a book you go to the library and borrowed the book and if that's not end you put your name on a whole list and you get it when it's available\nAnd they were born in the depression and I'm sure that's a lot of it which is that buying books seemed like a bit of an indulgence that wasn't necessary\nI grew up going to the library a couple of times a week with my mom and I found it\nAbsolutely magical it was not like going to a bookstore or a toy store it was partly because there was no money there was no financial relationship and when your kid to the idea that you can have anything you want is really intoxicating\nAnd a library is one on on a real short list of places that welcome everyone including kids were a hassle\nRight [laughter] well and I do think that in the last Twenty years we've as a society become more and more conscious a kind of call it the Starbucks effect we've become conscious of\nHow\nThere's home and there's your workplace and there's kind of a desire for another place somewhere to go somewhere to see other humans and just sort of share the space with them\nDoes I think it's why people go to public parks even if they've got a backyard there's something very special about being somewhere around other people and you're not there to interact with them you're just sharing space with them\nAnd that's definitely some quality of libraries I mean they're they're closes analog is probably a public park\nYou have written for the New Yorker for thirty some years [laughter] and you are a New Yorker for a long time how did your experience of living in Los Angeles\nCompared to your expectations about Los Angeles [noise] I had\nTravelled here a lot over the years before I moved here and ... had been downtown once as far as I knew [noise]\nUm my expectation of Los Angeles was that I Would never spend time downtown and at the time I moved here which is now seven years ago\nDowntown was just on the brink of really changing and revitalizing and re populating\nI never imagined that I Would be doing a book about the library I moved to Los Angeles because my husband was asked to help with the company and that was starting up and we thought well that'd be fun and we'll go for a year or we'll get some nice weather and go back to New York at the end of the year\nIn the course of being here I was given a tour of the downtown library and first of all I thought oh my God this building is amazing it's a beautiful building and a very eccentric interesting piece of architecture Nineteen twenties era but\nInflicted with all of this sort of addiction and Moroccan kind of a aesthetic and it's a really interesting building so I was kind of struck immediately just about what it called building it was and how I had never been downtown to see it [noise]\nBut walking through the library and thinking boy this is just an incredible repository of amazing stories I was being told some of the stories of of various city librarians who had run library over the years many of whom were incredibly eccentric\nFascinating figures and I found myself just being drawn and more and more thinking oh my God this is an amazing place somebody should write about this not thinking that somebody was me um\nAnd right at a moment the person giving me the tour had pulled one of the books off the shelf and took a deep whiff of the book\nI thought well I guess I'm In a new city where people do things like smell books and I I kind of dismissed it until he said well you can still smell the smoke and some of them\nAnd I thought how they used to let people smoke in the library that seem very bold and I said well you know was back when they allowed smoking and he said\nNo no they didn't never allow smoking in the building it was from the fire\nI said what fire and he said the big fire the big fire in Nineteen eighty six and I said I don't know what you're talking about he said well the big fire closed library down for seven years and you\nKnow he moved on and I was going like what was so wouldn't no no no don't I don't want to see the next\nIn her new book under fire is reporting from the frontlines of the

public library and so much more it's called the library book hits bookstores this week\nThe arson investigators ... eventually decided that our son had been the cause of the fire\nWho was the person who was accused of having started\nA young man in his twenties named Harry peak who was um\nI guess predictably a wannabe actor\nErrand boy I'm you know did odd jobs parked cars that kind of thing [noise] um [noise] was well what what happened was he had told a number of friends that he had started the fire so very quickly ... ah [noise]\nOnce there was a reward\nAssociated with anyone having providing a tip for solving the fire a one of his friends good to have friends like that came forward and\nUm basically connected the fire department to him and they began following them around and ended up\nI'm interviewing him to figure out whether his boasts of having started the fire we're we're in fact true\n'cause she was a charming liar\nHe was from every description I had from anybody he was an immensely likeable guy charming and just a crazy favor own would just said that stupid thing not\nJust the tip you say where where have you been to I was having drinks will share you know he just couldn't tell us straight story and\nHis friends would it were exasperated by him and at the same time also said he was a really good guy would give you the shirt off his back and that was interesting to me they all use that exact expression he would give you the shirt off his back he was\nThe love and and also drove them crazy\nSo in a way this is what might be called a\nTrue crime narrative I guess so\n[laughter] and I wonder if you felt pressured by the fact that you were telling a crime story to have a narrative that resolved comfortably to provide an answer to that question\nI I did I\nFirst of all I thought I'm going to solve this which is utterly veins [laughter] I mean\nThat there is no way that a civilian with no access to the evidence and no knowledge of how to investigate and arson would be able to crack the case but that was my first thought is I'm going to solve this [noise] um and\nMaybe if you had a ragtag band friends it right and like the actual van has\nCome on guys and a big dog right isn't that the that we do ... but I'm\nI'm fairly comfortable with the idea that\nDon't have to come to a final conclusion and it may be out of the reality of so many of the things I write about don't have a tidy conclusion or don't resolve in the way that I might have expected\nAnd the different possible outcomes it's a bit of a choose your own adventure and and you come to your own conclusion essentially a because there's no way to reexamine the evidence\nAt this point what I\nTried to do is lay out all the different paths of thought that could lead you to a conclusion [noise]\nIt may be that when I wrote the orchid safe and I was determined to see it goes to work at it and as time has growing short and I thought oh my God the book has ruined I'm never going to see a ghost shortcut and I finally had a deadline that I had to make\nAnd I didn't see one\nSuddenly it seemed like well of course I'm not going to see one\nThat's that's the point it's\nIt doesn't matter that I'm not going to see it it it would never\nThe anticipation of seeing it so it was the first experience I had a ... conclusion conclusion and in its own way it felt I mean it is the reality it is the fact is\nWithout giving anything away it's it's not possible to come to a conclusion I mean my my notion that I Would solve it being something that very quickly I realize that's nuts but it isn't possible to\nUltimately now what happened and\nI was comfortable finally thinking that's OK I'm giving you the different paths of thought and and um\nMaybe you see the one of them being the persuasive one\nWell Susan Arlene I really loved your book and I always love having on the show thank you so much for coming over and taking the time Oh thank you it's a pleasure

I just walled off that part of my ... my life experience ... and the wall just crumbled but all in one go [laughter] mhm\nUm and I wonder what it's like for you to live with and the way that you live with this subject when you're making a TV show live with divorce you know every day when you\nThe experience is I'm not I'm not a personal exploration for me you know in terms of trying to sort out my own home life but rather I guess in some ways what you've described as witnessing your friends marriage fall apart you know for me\nIt's a fascinating way to spend a lot of hours because\nI I guess you know the reason that I was interested in it initially and developing the show was because I I I like yourself I was watching friends marriage a fall apart I was witnessing friends um contemplate affairs\nFriends have affairs marriage survives affairs marriage be better for having ... having one party I have an affair you know I um people contemplating divorced not divorced and all those things that surround\nUm surround you when you reach a certain point in your life and people have been in committed relationships meaningful\nSubs and relationships and I liked very much exploring it it's the exact way I wanted to do it it's the tone that I was hoping for\nBecause it's for some it's devastating for others it's I'm an opportunity to sort of um make alliances um and I think it's really complex I think people's reactions to divorce when it's not their own are really\nOften surprising to themselves\nDoes it does it freak you out I mean the ... like ways when you spend time with it in your heart do you do you feel for God and I don't mean like in the sense like or does it make you feel like a you and your husband are going to get divorced\nUm but like it's it's like an extra central dread for\n[laughter] [noise] I think I think it doesn't freak me out sometimes it makes me very sad\nUm and I'm I'm I I don't know I'm not I'm not freaked out by\nIt because it's both an artistic an academic exercise in some ways and for me I guess I've been an actor for so long that I\nUm I have found a way to compartmentalize the work um I also come home to three children in a ... active household and chaos and um I don't I'm not at liberty to let it um\nPenetrate really beyond the threshold in some way of my own home um but I Love the story I like pushing on the bruised I I've always been that way and\nUm I I'm\nMuch more interested in the potential to be freaked out than not\nI Want to play a pushing on the bruise scene from divorce\nSo ah your character's name is Francis is a head hunter and this is that this is the cold open to the third episode and she's sitting down with a client who's looking for a new good um and they have this conversation\nFor members would be the kind of growth is\nGrown and it was okay uh what are you looking for I'm not sure\nThis job for twenty plus years says the same thing over and over and over and over here are getting any younger goalie bruises on a new challenge\nIs all big world out there [noise] last one into\nLearn more at NPR wine club dot org ... this is NPR\nIt's ...

[laughter] I ...\nI since I don't know a whole conversation we are cheering hoard and on the show really wondering a couple of months ago a tree and I had an extensive conversation about Iraq stage I Am ready to make out with him\n[laughter] like a ... with the moustache me too I mean it's so great and so and it is also a little bit is both incredibly wide dashing and handsome and a little ridiculous\nWilliam and Mary perfect way it is that really helps define that character who has lost qualities\nAt top totally absolutely and I will say one other thing which fits into this idea of when we were in ... for the show\nAnd in fact earlier than that I started thinking about what I Hope that this show would look like cinematic ally and and what I Want it the music to look like and the costumes and seventies cinema played\nWas the central ... inspiration for me I mean that's what I kept circling around and I encouraged everybody else to circle around and um you know all the great movies and the seventies and how they were shot and music from the seventies I wanted that to not only play really important role um but I imagine that that\nMusic was the music as separate young people they fell in love\nTo you know a first kiss um you know skipping school all these things that were um narrated by seventies music and um you know Albert will skiing all the great costume designers and and so this moustache\nWas ... it fits so beautifully into those ideas and just glimpses of things that show is not a period piece um but it is we help tell it with music from the seventies and even there are composer I really wanted him to find ways of I'm using the flute\nUm because I felt like it had been ignored for too long and [laughter] I Love the sound and it's so evocative and anybody of a certain age group or\nWho is interested in music would have a reaction not just to the obviously to the source music but to the compose music as well so the moustache\nWas this gift because it was it so beautifully fit into these ideas\nThey're just good worker or a um\nUh you came in to talk to us uh I I really appreciate you taking the time oh it's such a treat and\nYou just did not let me down at all and you\nAsk such good smart interesting questions and it's been a real privilege to half time with you said thank you so much [noise]\nSarah Jessica Parker you can currently washing the first two seasons of divorce on HBO Now an HBO Go she's also starring in in producing a new movie called here and now that set to hit theaters November ninth [noise]\nGets bull's eye I'm Jesse for my next guest is Chris gathered Chris was of course the host of the legendary Chris gathered show\nIt aired first on New York city public access television then later on the network fusion you might have also seen him on broad city or in don't think twice the micro ... improv movie\nCritics also stand up and when we talk you've done a really interesting special it's called career suicide it's kind of a one man show gathered produced it with Judd Apatow\nGenuinely moving special got their talks very specifically about alcoholism about depression and even death but he does it in ways that are totally human very identifiable very funny of course has a new book coming out it's called lose well and it's sort of a self help book\nHe talks about the lessons that he's learned in life shortcomings and successes in show business stories of family and friends and there's even a section on his high school band\nThe lesson if you really want to be good at anything you're going to fail and if you want to know the right way to fail Chris gathered has some advice anyway let's take a listen to a little bit from the one man show here she's talking about his early days in show business running from audition to audition to get bit parts in commercials [noise]\nI get stuck in acting work I'm getting most of the commercials mostly commercials if you start to ... to\nTo this day you go deep enough in the search results you can still find him very annoying\nCommercial for H R Block where I where later holiday [noise]\nI once audition for a subway sandwich commercial to play the role all man who is on attractive to women\n[noise]\nI couldn't even call them or something like [noise]\nI didn't book that part I'm assuming because [noise]\nChris gathered welcome back to bull's eye it's good to see a great to see you too so your new special or one man show or whatever you want to call it was called career suicide it's largely about your mental health do you feel exhausted by talking about\nYou know what [laughter] you know what I mean one hundred percent yeah one of the great things about the special coming out is that maybe I could talk about I can stop [laughter] everything I have to say about it in in that special and when I get asked about it I can just\nTell people you know find it out all your uh HBO driven streaming platforms from the ... 'cause that's really what I have to say about it um 'cause it had been many years of talking about it in some form or another and definitely it's exhausting and doing the show more exhausting than I thought for sure\nHe feels like part of what you're doing in the special and also in your memoir which was the last time you were on the show I think is in writing about it I mean performing about it you are talking yourself into engaging with it fully\nI think that's a very astute observation\nKnows that if it's not hidden it has less power over me if it's not something I'm trying to\nYou know overcome quietly in private than other people might actually help\nAnd there's something he said to for\nYou know anytime I anytime I put it out there and ... and other people respond to it like it sometimes people you know people have seen the show and they'll wait afterwards and say oh like I really identify with that thank you for saying that it rang true\nYou're listening to ... I'm Jesse for my guest Chris ... is a comedian and the star of the one man show career suicide which is washable now on HBO he's also the author of the new book lose well which book stores October sixteenth we talked last year\nWhat are the things you talk about in your special show\nFor suicide is the extent to which you had linked to your emotional health to\nYour career this presumption that if your career was successful that you would be emotionally healthy because of that yeah um two part question do you feel differently about that now are you able to feel differently about that\nThe second part is do you think you would feel comfortable doing work in your career that was good work but not\nCapital G. capital W good works you know what I mean like just if you were like if you got cast on as the second guy in a funny sitcom and you were doing a good job of that yeah and the sitcom was an evil but neither was it a place for teenagers to come out right\nRight it was a it wasn't A Guided by this sense of urgency or a chip on his shoulder that might work clearly has now [laughter] at it like I'm definitely work a ...\nThere's still wrap my head around his then I get caught too caught up in career stuff you know a lot of that is that there's the anxiety that it could all go it tomorrow which could getting better about that you know I have a little bit more stability and I've ever had before\nThat's a nice feeling but it still is this thing I have to remind myself of ... I always had this feeling of like a you know like if if I can just get one of those big jobs everybody after noticed it and\nIt's I have to admit that I was right going for this and they'll have to admit that I have what it takes\nWhich pre suppose that they were all these people doubting me which was not really true like I had this chip on my shoulder about proving everybody wrong and then I Would accomplish certain things and I wouldn't feel that validation I had to kind of a cop to the fact of like\nThat is there is no them that I can prove wrong and then there'll be this victory like something's going on inside actually wants witnessed that asks cat in New York backstage at UCD and there was a friend of mine who was a cast member and that's been out talking to a friend of mine who was a correspondent on the Daily Show\nAnd they were stressing so hard man I don't know what's going on and we're going to get what's my next gig ... but I might have to move across the country and there are so stressed and I was like man I always figured if I got one of those jobs I'd be happy\nYou're on the Daily Show you're on SNL you've reached the mountaintop now you can kick back 'cause you've proven everything you need to prove and I was like oh they're still so stressed out\nI have no hope\nSo I better just learned to enjoy the things I Do because getting stuff is not going to fix any my problems as far as I could I you know could I settled in and really enjoy it if I was doing something that was maybe a little more square some of the er standard you could say\nSome of the stuff I've done I don't know like\nI mean you could be for you could be the next thirty rock throwing rocks the funniest show rate shows more funding if in that show than there isn't but if I'm not about it's not about much more than being in front of it is about some of it yeah I'm not trying to diminish thirty ride when my favorite shows of all\nTime course but it doesn't have that fire and it to cut trying to prove something [laughter]\nYou know they have their mission statement of trying to like break the system and sneak in the back to\nI feel like I probably could I imagine you know I I think hard about it because there's all there's a part of me that's also like if something like that would have happened like I don't think anybody's going to doubt that I tried at this point you know anybody outing ... or by indie credibility at this point like I think anyone who knows\nMy work would say that guy spent years bending over backwards to try to do this thing and that time he was the only one who knew why he kept going at times I had visibly quit and other people's fans rather be working on the show would convince me to keep going so there's a part of me that's like at a certain point\nI've done my part and maybe I could move on and just do something I uh ... sure I'd find some side project very quickly to um push the buttons that\nFuel out of my my ... one of the things that makes me want to keep up accomplishing stuff is you know you see people in this industry who eventually get to a point where they can produce other people's work\nAnd I'm not quite there yet but I Would love to see because I I feel like one of the things that I have going right now is I remember what it was like for me seven eight nine ten years ago nobody\nWas particularly interested in the hat to just like kicked out some doors and make it happen for myself I'd love to find the comedians who are in that spot and help them not to have to spend half a decade on public access TV to make it happen\nSo that's another thing is like maybe if I was to get one of those bigger jobs\nThat could give me that credibility and that could bring some other stuff into the world but who knows\n[noise] it's bull's eye I'm Jesse for I'm Talking with the comedian Chris gathered about his special career suicide you can watch it on HBO Now\nFriend of mine was telling me this past week has a friend who sold the company for sixty five million dollars and he said this to me as a kind of warnings are my friends told his company for sixty five million dollars not only does is make bad art and I was like a dream make bad art yeah\nI mean that's already make it better I Would have been doing for years [laughter] yeah [laughter] not really getting paid that well for him yeah certainly don't have sixty five million dollars sure [laughter] I don't have to find a market for my bad ours that's perfect\nYeah it is funny they're talking about the idea of moving on it you know they get their show when I talk about the gathered show for years that has been my people and they're still my people\nTheir punk kids they're weirdos they're artists\nA lot of them are clear a lot of them are doing things their own way you know a lot of them either by choice or by necessity or people who have walked their own path and they find this and it's like oh this is a community of people over there I'll bet it's a beautiful thing I'm very very proud of it those are my people but it's funny\nThey are so why is that like\nI get the sense\nOnline sometimes I'm really in tune with these people this past week I was in a fight with my own thing club\nI might they banned they shut they stopped comments on my post and the Facebook group that's my thing club the get the ads and I was obviously mad about it and they were like we don't care where shutting down like I have this contentious relationship and I get the sense\nSometimes that like they are such underground people and so passionate about the values of that\nDebt me being in ... movie is a little bit of a sellout [laughter] beautiful anonymous ... a pod cast they're like you're getting a little too mainstream press buddy and there's almost like a counter cultural element to the gathered show where I have to grow and I have to evolve\nAnd I'm In ... it's a very fascinating thing to realize I don't know if they want me to and that's a very odd feeling very odd feeling I can steal them being happy for it but I can also feel to feel a lot of my older school fans feeling like man like he's really\nHe's really growing up and moving on and I don't know exactly how to handle that because I feel like that's what I've always been working towards is trying to get a better head on my shoulders so weird I don't know how to go\nI'm heading you know especially thinking about H.
