the modulation and try and play it properly but I'm I'm not knocking it quite amazing to me that anybody ever gets to do what we're doing right now and it would be ridiculous to get picky about what you did when you did it and what you're doing when you're doing it\nVery true I'll ask you about something that you you did one time that you've you've written about which was a mysterious episode when you were a teenager aboard a submarine and you are on deck on watch and\nIt sounded like you encountered the great white whale or a great squid somewhere at to see it was\nBigger than our boat and um we hit it we rose up on it and I was on what shows up in the sale on the port side and it was all I can tell you as it was a ... other than that is that it was a thing of some kind [noise]\nBut you\nDo such a good job of it well I I'm I'm trying to\nLeave it goes against by nature as I've already\nYou have a new CD called clone that's a that's kind of a a goal full title\nWell there was a clown that's Mike gardens clone he found his clone floating around or the north east somewhere and the clown would appear with him on stage a\nBut not before the clown appear at first as Mike and Mike would walk out a little later this thereby disturbing some people\nIn the audience but others have just seen oh pardon my vision tonight I think so I\nThink so and eventually the clone a Mike began to get a lot of questions about the law and the clone began to get a lot of questions in his girlfriend started talking to the clown that was the end of the cloth [laughter]\nSo we brought her back for the for the record it was a lot of fun to make that record and were were threatening to make another one at some point\nYou have another restaurant here for well I now that I'm In tune on the twelfth

by what's coastline thank you it's good to be\n\nThe only thing the west coast guard [noise]\nYou already for Halloween costumes you tell Halloween ... stories do you hang up stockings I mean what are your traditions that you have\nWhat about the luck to you that tried to save Christmas or [noise] but a lot to the Santa ate\nWhat was the exact name of the book the lap cat who couldn't stop screaming there you go which is of course our holiday classic my next guest and west coast was written illustrated another one album which marks as major holiday will you please welcome the author of vampire boys good night and Lisa Brown\nOr what [noise]\nYou were wearing an absolutely elegant which has had red and white stripes stockings and the point is black pointed shoes with silver buckle where do you shop\n[laughter] in the hate the hate\nThe oh this is sort of normal day to day street where I forgot yeah quite All right so this is a book that you've written illustrated you tell the story of a vampire boy whose secret and the secret or I don't want to give a plug quite away here I don't know how to do this\nAnd it's a little vampire he's brought breakfast by his butler like most children on and he has a friend who's a little which my eye and portraying the little bitch and that they go out to look for real children because they've been told that real children do not exist and they're not quite sure\nAnd so this was a story to encounter the world and the same way that human children are told that vampires don't really exist\nIt's about being an outsider and then finding yourself inside for one night only and being accepted sort of accept that there's a costume contest in the book and uh the actual monsters do not when they're not authentic looking in [noise]\n\nWhat does that say about our culture that we cannot see authenticity within the original\nUm yes it's very true it's it's for all those little a ghoulish children who feel like they're on the outside looking in\nIllustrations are filled with little visual trees and the way the kids like to look at details I don't know if it's a tribute to to the film Kerry or not but you've got it\nBox we kind of a hand you also have a number of books that are lying around music or ... of the devils true score things would engage a parent as well as a child\nI well I Am a parent as well as having a child so I Need to be engaged [laughter]\nMy favorite hidden piece of the book is the butler and on his he's bringing a glass of blood to his little ward is this by balloon blood is blood I have not I've not specify the kind of what because you have a drawer baboon blood that's for the which Rudnick Beth [noise]\nBut the butler has a band aid on his neck fresh wound [noise] so if you're very perceptive child you may figure out where the blood is coming from that so the butler is a full service butler\n[noise] only the best in what is it about Halloween the truth young euro feels\nWell he doesn't know about Halloween he's a vampire um what what this book really is it's a it's a reverse bedtime story because the vampire boys getting up when it's dark and he's going to bed when the sun rises so everything turning on its head and I think that's what I Love about Halloween is everything is turning on its head\nAlso what about Haight Street [noise]\nYou did a presentation about this book out on ... street at the ... and he would come up with a slide show showing you in your day to day work your work life one of the things that you talk about how one day and it was and how ordinary and you've got an every frame there was a vampire that you couldn't see but everyone else could\nThe kids for white agitated with me [laughter] um I had someone dressed up in a vampire shoot\n'em and I was saying that ah here's my office here's my inspiration there one thing I'm not inspired by our vampires because they do not exist and yet I had the vampire in every frame and they would be screaming with frustration which um is good for children\n[noise]\nWho portrayed the vampire and where do you go to ... street but who portrayed the vamp her\nWith a vampire crouching was from history costumes on hate to give them a plug the vampire was uh my husband who also goes under the name Lemony Snicket so he's now he's no stranger to ... or disguise\nThere's something about flight that is good for children's fantasy as well as adult fantasy you know the idea that you could ride on a broom how fantastic is that an ordinary object is invested with this power the concurring you anywhere in the world a great speeds and almost perhaps even in discipline\nAnd yet you have the page open where they're going looks like the suburbs so it can you can go anywhere in the world and they chose the suburbs but does that say that says that's where the candy is\nWell did you well you\nWas going on the show\n... ... ...\nMm right or that you will you\nDo you get to tell me I'm\n... ... ...

this this particular deal where who sticks\nSo Paul and you haven't gotten into water you're got wet\nBut because I Know I've been a beach guy all my life I've never been a serious there for like a guilt and some others but actually that's one of the myths about ... music a lot of the ... musicians weren't necessarily surfers\nWhere did you meet did you made it like a beach house that we were

where the heart beats John Cage then Buddhism in the inner life of artists and how John pages relationship to Buddhism shapes not only his music\nThe fifties sixties and seventies\nRubbery shaped the musical world it was a digital music pioneer who founded listen dot com that became wraps it either folded into real networks\nAnd was part of the music streaming business he's written a novel called years zero an entertaining look at the intersection of the music industry Washington DC the vagaries and the complications of\nCopyright law that in tangles the rest of the galaxy and the aliens are furious and the Internet culture\nYou remember the Internet it used to exist in this country for more information about the broadcast WTO that or gee\nThe book is called where the heart beats it's John Cage is then Buddhism and the inner life of artists by Kay Larson\nAnd she was writing this book over Fifteen Years I had the opportunity wants to go to this extraordinary sound conference out of the Skywalker Ranch with various sound designers been birds and so this was\nI don't know Twenty years ago and John Cage was there\nAnd I remember I asked him a question about Beethoven and other sounds and\nHe gave the most profound an enigmatic answer which all I remember as the feeling of it as a and I don't remember the specifics of the question of answer he'd clearly fought\nA lot about something far more than I had and in this book where the heartbeat K Larson examines exactly how John Cage came to think the way he did\nAnd the great pieces such as four minutes thirty three seconds or the piano sits at the keyboard I thought about doing that today and the second half\nWe might have time for it he also did a piece called zero zero where no time at all I don't know maybe that would be more appropriate [laughter]\nTaylor some has been a journalist she's been a an art critic for many years for the village voice and for New York magazine in Nineteen Ninety four she got her ... practice at a Buddhist monastery in upstate New York please welcome K Larson to west coast [noise]\nWhat drew you to John cages of subject oh I fell in love with him uh\nI I also had a meeting with John Cage that was very enigmatic and and deep\nThis happened when I was um I was an art critic for forty years I suppose I still am\nAnd in the middle of my rounds one day a through the galleries this is a friday afternoon in New York and I was going to a Russian bird extradition um and I walked in the gallery there was nobody else in the gallery except John Cage\nAnd he walked over to me I later found out he did this because he always wanted to kind of ties up whoever was around and see what they were on his side and he he walked up to me and he said something I don't remember what he said and I says something flip because that's who I was back then and uh\nAnd he looked at me in a way that I'll never forget because it was a a a look that size up look through me said who are you\nAnd not in a judgmental way just a very out of pure curiosity and I only later saw someone look that need that way when I met my son's teacher so\nWhat changed and how would you describe John cages a composer as an artist\nAmazon but as it came to the United states in the Nineteen fifties who was the what was he trying to do it as an artist\nWell there's an ark and John Cage is music that parallels the arc of his spiritual path\nSo I I did not set out to write a biography of cages music although there's a lot of music on this book I set out to write the biography of that spiritual ark\nAnd uh it begins in a certain sense and then it begins at the beginning of cages life but but there's a certain point at which\nCage falls apart he enters a dark night of the soul uh he he is completely confused who's just the gun falling in love with the man who would become his life partner Merce Cunningham and Federer idea of reasons are complex reasons including the fact that he was going to have to divorce has watched ...\nCage fell apart and there was a piece of music that reflects is falling apart is called four walls I saw it in performance in New York in Nineteen Ninety nine and it's a piece of ... which cage bangs his head against the wall of his own suffering over and over again then there's a long period where he sets out to solve this problem\nAnd he interestingly enough it turns to the the Asian or religions not first he turns to Christian mysticism and hindering mysticism and eventually the Hindu it as the tensions\nHe doesn't go to psychoanalysis he thinks about it he says nope he goes in a different direction and his new music through that period reflects this change because he gets he created ... so not as an editor lose which is one of his most beautiful pieces\nAnd it's about Hindu aesthetics in in ... and it he's looking for serenity simplicity silence quieting of his hurting mine then in Nineteen fifty duties as if it comes to New York and settles down and\nHe begins lecturing on send Buddhism and\nUp until then cages past had been about ideas he was looking for the idea of silence and the idea of serenity\nSays if you sit down and says if he gets in the Buddhist teachings which are about ... these qualities in your own life and cage gets it his music changes all the famous physicist that cage created that changed music and changed\nI argue the visual arts they all began after duties as if you came to town\nWhen you say it also changed the visual arts the suggests really profound shift in what the artist world certainly if Newark was doing at the time I mean how does affect the visual arts well\nUh this is partly an answer your question of how I got involved in this book because as I said I'm an art critic um I was teaching a course on the origins of art in the Nineteen sixties at a certain point and I kept finding John cages name associated with these artists I couldn't figure this out because it's not standard art history um and\nAs we've been dealing with just the person who does the visual art that there'd be a somebody working music adjunct with it\nRight he's a composer and so why is he in imposing all these digital artist and they began in Nineteen fifty one with Robert Russian bird who had at the time but virtually done nothing important then Nineteen fifty four which just for Johns who hadn't done any work at all\nUm and um then Ellen ... oh no Robert Morris you know all the pantheon has you know people we think of is changing the art\nOf the early Nineteen sixties they all have this relationship one way or another with John Cage so I said what's going on here and I looked at what cages learning from\nSuzuki and I said oh there's stuff which cage here's what specifically is teaching Suzuki teaching changes cages worldview\nAs John said to me at one point he was teaching and preaching\nAll through this period a all these artists heard him they heard what he was saying so there there's this new vocabulary that enters the art scene art is not an object that hangs on a wall or stands on the floor it's and vine metal and ... action throughout space and time\nIt's it's a formative thing it's is involved with process it and change its a condition where art in life are are the same thing not separate and on and on and those are the qualities that defined the art that was created after Nineteen sixty and we now think of as post modern and\nAs I said John Cage was doing this in Nineteen fifty to Nineteen sixty two\nWhich is a musician David tutor for them\nDavid Souter was a a David Souter appeared in this amazing way\nAt the very moment when cage and a kitchen is friend Morton Feldman really needed David tutor he showed up someone introduce them and tutor was brilliant musician I have a David Souter store this really comes from John Cage and it's really great\nSomeone sent David Souter and John Cage\nTo packages of Indians spices and and the post office shuffled boxes both got a little broken up so all the spices were mixed up with each other David tutor sat down and went through every single piece of spice put it in the right place and got through reconstructing the entire box and then said the John Cage\nYou want me to do that for you [laughter]\n[noise] tutor was the\nPerfect person to play he was a pianist it was a perfect person to play this very demanding music that cage and his cohort was developing it in the early Nineteen fifties\nWould John Cage of answered no I think it's fine that it got mixed up in the in the shipping\nYou know I don't know what he answered a he could have easily said that because the whole point of it in a way to accept what comes and not get attached to your own judgments about it\nI'm Talking with Kay Larson whose book is called where the heartbeat John Cage then Buddhism and the inner life of artists blaming the role of duties Suzuki and who's Buddhism and his teachings influence John Cage wouldn't turn influenced of the most major American artist so the fifties sixties and then subsequent but\nAnd then nothing is the source it's the it's the it's the origin and it's the ground that says if you called it the God had so the world and\nIts source art there's no distinction between them they are continually rising at all moments in returning to the to the void and then a rising again\nHe has a a piece called zero or ... Golan zero zero and says you're just briefly is nothing but the continuation of one's daily work whatever\nIt is providing it's not selfish but it is the fulfillment of an obligation to other people don't with contact microphones without any notion of concert or theater or the public but simply continuing ones daily work now coming up through violence speakers\nWhat's a peace tries to say is that everything we do is music or can become music through the use of microphones so that everything I'm doing apart from what I'm saying produces sounds\nYes he was a sitting on a I'm a staircase landing typing letters to people who had written to him drinking a glass of water and um the chair with squeaking and all of this was might\nSo that this is what you heard when you came into this John Cage performance and it seemed like a joke I've heard actually other biographers call it a joke but\nIt's not a joke if it's another profound moment in cages Buddhist path where he realizes that everything we do is fine everything we do is okay and ordinary life is OK and there's no distinction between that and art\nAnd also he realized that in writing letters to people who wanted something from him he was he says that that this piece is about fulfilling an obligation to others there's a point of the spiritual path where first you're doing it for yourself because you're hurting like crazy\nThen you're doing it for yourself because you start to feel better and things start to clear out and finally realized that yourself is not the issue with other people who are the issue is the rest of the world is the issue and so you fulfilling obligation to others because that's the mandate and that's the\nWord ... cage was at this point with his piece is zero zero zero which he called for thirty three number two\nThe biography doesn't cover is complete life but it covers the spiritual growth and and probably the most significant part and I I think that you've also changed art criticism by this book by reassessing how it is visual artists shape their life and their work because of what you did\nTwo things here first of all of the biography and around Nineteen sixty two because of that was the end of the arc of cages revelation so he continue to use these things for the rest of his life and since this is a spiritual biography not musical biography I felt this was a good place to end\nSecond there's a proposition here in this book that it was not Marcel Just shot her created postmodern art it was John Cage speaking from his own point of view about the shot\nWho actually created\nWhat we now think of as the article last fifty years and this is a proposition that I've not heard anybody propose before so in terms of\nYou know may dealing with judgments I'm kind of waiting to see what will happen after having said that\nWhy do you have covered photograph with his back to us working at the garden\nStrict well the first place it's the the ... the only photograph I found that the eleventh hour that appeal to me at all most of the rest of them have been published but this one hasn't\nUh but also its cage not looking at us he's looking he's turning around and looking into his in garden because he's looking into the deep\nInto the deep teachings I mean these are huge leap or phone teaching they are there's a whole a strain of in a whole discipline is and that just ask one question who am I\nWho am I who am I who am I and it goes very deep into the answer that's not the end that I practiced myself but ah\nBut it's still it's present and so cages looking into this and garden and saying what is this life what is this world\nWho who am I in relation to it because we were organisms noteworthy observers of miracle all you have to do is go straight on leaving the parents at any moment and to the writers were to the left coming back or never coming in of course out of the rain\nTo live with a book title arson and we'll just go\nWhere the heartbeat John Cage then Buddhism provide\nI find myself thinking about cable arsons book a lot\nAnd the notions ideas within\nThose in the west coast Florida My name's ...\nHow many have you on the radio audience as well as here at home raise your hand if you're at home and listening to a\nBetter taped and you find is changed your life I mean anyone of you've found that it was useless and give you headaches [laughter]\nMy next guest has written several books and she was a leader in the field of meditation her new book is called real happiness the power of meditation she's the author of loving ... was welcome Sharon prosper cost us why [noise]\nYou weren't always happy I understand that's true [laughter] that's very true how did you discover where are your feelings were up by looking within I thought you were going to ask me if I was always happy now so no I didn't excellent [laughter]\nThat was harder as a young girl your parents were unavailable to you when when ... when you were nine the other had mental illness by the time you were eleven you're on your own in the world and trying to cope without much of a guide to looking inward was the best place you could go\nWell I went to India actually went through school I was going to State University of New York at buffalo and they had an independent study program where few created a project you could go anywhere in the world theoretically for a year\nAnd then come back and do another year kind of cross cultural studying and you were Eighteen or Nineteen I was Eighteen yeah uh and I went I as a junior in college I went to India and trench drawn totally change when it made my life ... yeah\nWhen you get into India did you know that you were going to go look at meditation was a reason you went to and do you did you know why you were going\nI was going to learn how to meditate I've taken a course in Asian philosophy when I was a sophomore and honestly I think it was kind of happenstance I thought I Need a Tuesday chorus let me do that now\nI did something like that and it turned out to be a course in Buddhism and there were a couple of things actually in the course that were tremendous for me when was\nThe mood is very unafraid and ashamed acknowledgement of suffering in life because there had been with all of that loss in conflict in difficulty and no one ever talked about it just like it is for many people and so he was someone saying right out loud when I knew to be true and then\nHe said apparently that there were methods that one could use that anybody could you know one left out if they chose to that could transform the way you related to everything that happened including the suffering so I thought I'm going to go to India and check this out\nWas that immediate or did you have to be you know what was your course of familiarity\nIf it wasn't interested in talk more belief system or a new identity or rejecting anything else I Want to know what those methods might be and had to actually use them and that took a while to find\nDid you approach it as a method to or did eventually come into it as as ideas and philosophy\nMostly it's method I I have a great love for the ideas and philosophy and the ethics and and the way of life but really just into the method\nWhen you teach somebody how to be crime is it something that's ingrained in us to be kind and loving and its beaten out of a somehow\nSometimes sadly this beaten address literally but I Would say mostly I see this covered over obscured sometimes hard to reach sometimes hard to trust but I Do believe it's there\nAnd so what qualities do you think you have as a teacher to inspire others I mean you've sort of a major school and in New England in Massachusetts to do just tell me about the partners would you have in the ... in the teaching Institute\nA logistical jak cornfield and I began to retreat center in Massachusetts and Jack of course moved here and began spirit rock some years later\nWhen you would have a business meeting as an imagine you would you like meditate or would you sort of\nAttuned yourself [laughter]\nCertainly thinking that when I was thinking of secret dancing [laughter] we we kinda have our own means of secret dancing but it's very secret and that's actually one of the things I always treasured about the meditation practice\nThat it's a private you could be maybe a contentious meeting at work and you don't have to say excuse me men end up in the closet and political us equipment and set up and look obvious you know you just tuned into your breath and you're there\nThere are stories of a firefighter who's up all night doing a lot of work in New York and ... cab and and just take a break and meditate and find a place of peace and be restored mhm\nUh actually because the um part of the book is uh twenty eight day program we have a number of people including two firefighters and two police officers and some finance people doing the program blogging about it on my website ... and one firefighter did just that he said that he'd worked a lot of overtime as many people aren't\nHe had to sit by the burning man haul for three hours and he thought I haven't done my twenty minutes yet let me do it now what's a burning\nManhole [laughter] that I can say [laughter] we have some in New York and there is [noise]\nFriends on the neighborhood I don't know I suppose but is happiness or a natural human state or is it just sort of a temporary thing that we can achieve for\nWell I guess of course it depends on what you mean I'm pleasure is something we achieve and a temporary way and I actually think we should be very grateful that we have the amount of pleasure and the light that we get I think it's a tremendous thing but um even though like the book is called real happiness I think a more accurate title about perhaps not as poetic\n\n\nO. U. Mike good\nGood good when you get your music royalty checks how much comes in from outer space you wear that [laughter]\nIt's not that I Know none of the general well you're about to find out I get a dollar sixty from Canada once every six months well that's close enough to the inter galactic world here [noise]\nMy next guest is Rob breed is the founder of listen dot com which created the rap city service and ended up going on to go to the real networks he's the author of you won a memoir about student life at the Harvard Business school and architects of the Web but business history of the Internet he's written inter galactic novel about\nSpace aliens who come and have to find a lawyer to do with their music rights issues please welcome Rob read author years zero\nHaving been in the Internet music business in dealing with a jumble of confusing writes I suppose the idea of trying to explain the right structure to group of aliens comes naturally to\nYeah I was the alien for about five years in their um our copyright laws earning arcane set\nOf laws in international treaties that literally date back centuries\nAnd going through copyright law is not unlike doing archeology and the Mediterranean um laws they're sort of like these layers of laws that go back to certain eras there's the player piano laws which are still in effect laws that were made a great deal of sense in the year of the player piano then you have\nThe laws that were created when America needed to deal with the fact that we suddenly have broadcast radio when they go up layer after layer after layer until you get to\nA set of laws in the nineties that we're basically designed to strangle digital audio taping it's crap and they succeeded\nAnd then it kind of stops and we've got this mess that is in some ways very outdated in some ways was very visionary at the time but no longer is et cetera and um the aliens get very puzzled by all of this too great comedic\nEffect which is wonderful the aliens ... what is it it's a welcome back Kotter theme that they first here somehow and they learned that there's intelligent life from planet because of this yes well actually they intercept it how does that seem go are\nWelcome back\nAt the John Sebastian song John Sebastian of eleven spin falls into what happens is the uh the aliens dedicate it's a huge universe spanning population civilization they've all conquered all of the difficult problems of science and technology\nSo they ... dedicate their entire existence is to the creation and consumption of great parks and\nGreed will either music is appalling lead that and the reason for that is actually conversely ours is extraordinarily good for evolutionary accident\nReasons that I go into in the second paragraph of the book and then never go back to again it's kind of a suspenders disbelief point but so we make the world's most fabulous music were were quite battered most other things like stained glass and ... synchronized swimming and the other arts that the aliens revere\nBut we're really good at music and so they're always on the on the lookout for new primitive civilizations that have some kind of artistic potential\nAnd I'm so one day they pick up a first round episode of welcome back Kotter it's October thirteenth Nineteen Seventy seven was anybody remembers it's the one in which Arnold ... joins as any you've called but um so they pick it up and about midway through\nAnd it turns out like I said were terrible and everything else and they're looking at it as like how do these primitive have even broadcast television I mean look at the fashion sense the visual jokes the editing choices\nAnd then it happened and to the episode the music starts it's considered instantly to be the greatest creative achievement since the dawn of time itself [noise]\nSo they start collecting and playing it absorbing this music comes to them through outer space and then suddenly they materialize in the office of a lawyer who they've confused or at least one person who was confused with a member of the back street boys\nYes so what happens is the ... reasons that are big deeply into the storyline that the aliens are obliged to honor our laws and customs as they pertain to our own our own art\nAnd this means you're on the hook to obey are copyright laws which they misunderstand for about thirty five or forty years\nAnd then they come to the horrifying realization at the very beginning of the book that all of this music that they've been enjoying by our rules has been pirated and buy American law the maximum fine for pirating single copy of a single song is one hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nAnd the total bill for the advanced civilizations has thoroughly bankrupted the entire universe or is it all the wealth in the universe is owed us particularly to use er and um\nYeah and so um this self appointed alien delegation decides we've got to go to earth and straighten this out and and they get here and they quickly realize that they need to reverse this complex ticket of laws and so forth and\nThey figure that to do that they need to get an ally a human ally\nAnd they need somebody very special first of all ideally somebody with an enormous artistic credibility because they figure that we review our musicians as much as they do so ideally one of the greatest musicians who ever lived they don't have re taste in music and then secondly somebody with incredible political might ...\nWho's the sheer force of will can just reverse all\nThese arcane laws and they think in Plano and that's pretty and I don't think we can do better than that and they continue their research\nAnd they realize that the most powerful media law firm on earth is called Carter ... marks the young man they're named that Carter and yes that is the name of a back street boys and they're like bingo we got a back street boys\nAnd they go and it's not a back street boy it said like I actually kinda hates the back street boys but it's too late the aliens have allied themselves with Nick Carter very low ranking and not particularly good copyright lawyer\nAnd he has forty eight hours to help them untangle this mess or something very bad\nMight happen so they're your that's your zero\nIs one of your hopes that Lawrence Lessig will read this book and it will help lose battles with the Supreme Court and evolving copyright law does something a little more\nNo I'm is written a lot of very very intelligent and cutting edge um ah actually three books on the subject of copyright law and how it should be for reform to the benefit of of you know lovers of of copyrighted material music lovers musicians um the country and so forth\nI thought when I was writing the book that he was the only person on earth who might read it [noise]\nUm because it was such a strain and I was like and I don't know a plastic like science fiction so I might be the only reader myself um I happen to know him just through Internet circles and so forth and um I called him a number of time we met one somebody's flotsam email and we spent some time on the phone\nJust because I wanted to make sure that my representation of copyright laws that existed in the book was as accurate as I could make it\nA so he has not only read the book\nBut he's tweeted it well\n[noise]\nWhen you started listening dot com was your vision and music ideal or was it an ideal to get something that somebody else would buy\nWhat will I was I'm a rabid lifelong fan of music and a a very poor musician and songwriter but I spent a lot of time you know playing guitar and recording things on a four track I at that point when I started the comedy probably at about a thousand vinyl records and a thousand CDs\nAnd I've been very fervent about music the other thing I was ... at that point in my life and this was Nineteen Ninety nine was the Internet\nThrough a couple of accidents I started working on the Internet really early in its commercial history right around Nineteen Ninety four Ninety five\nAnd I became very emotionally I Would even say it'll sounds silly but spiritually excited about what the Internet was going to enable and what it meant for all kinds of things and so I sat down and I wrote my second book I I took eight months off and wrote a book about the rise of the Internet as a commercial medium\nAnd uh then I because I was so deep and all this I managed to to talk my way into\nA job as a venture capitalist investing in early stage Internet companies and there are at that point I was pretty good at judging when things were ready for you know the next big wave and I judged in late Nineteen Ninety eight on music is music time is coming\nBecause the the net is getting fast enough\nHard drives or getting big enough and in late Ninety eight I saw my first portable MP three player and it's like\nThat's going to take the music off the Internet it into our lives and so it was really somebody who was fervently passionate about technology and specifically the Internet and somebody who had a lifetime adoration of music and it was like this is what I have to do\nAnd it's evolved so much could you've mentioned did you imagine them for instance you know people can listen over the Internet to radio shows anywhere in the world and sort of local music radio broadcasting the toll shifted profoundly\nAnd I I saw um I the second chapter of of the books I read about the Internet many years ago was about specifically ironically about the company that ended up buying mine I wrote up a bit of a biography\nOf a company called progressive networks which is now called real networks and they really pioneered streaming media and radio at the time there wasn't any

leg broken foot and a broken ankle and the way it's cast where he can only reach so far out of cash which makes you can only reach the eastern\nSo we wrote this beautiful song on the east during and after is correct issues in this crutches in his wheelchair\nThe music helped him kill and I think as Dr knew that it was good for a soul as well as the circulation so I Know the story about this

riding the description of that in in the book\nI suddenly thought as that I think it probably had something to do with having read Peter ... wonderful book London the biography\nI don't think he uses that phrase but some something about his description descriptions of of London and a Fifteen to sixteen\nGarcia and mass ...\nSomehow pulled that pulled that phrase a\nIt's a it's it's descriptive and throughout the book you deal with issues of is it conspiracy or is it coincidence a there seems to be a room and the subsidy both in our lives\nWell that\nPsychological term at the Phoenix area which I had never run across before I wrote this book and like right now I can tell you where where I found it that way which is\nThe perception of patterns that perception of meaning where there is no meaning the perception of significance where there isn't necessarily\nSignificance ... was very him became very important to me when I was writing this book because I had started looking at pattern recognition as the essential human activity\nThe thing that distinguishes us from almost all of the other critters on this planet and which we do apparently better than any other critter on the planet\nAs far as we know as far as we now so the idea that there was an inherent potential\nFlaw in that fascinated me the the idea that if we're so good at it we're also revolved hon to seeing patterns that aren't there and that that might be part and parcel of being human\nBut there's also a a a for instance new romance or when you were working on that book or you were always into it and he went to see Blade Runner a movie that a sort of did not do well at the time and you walked in and you looked at the movie and you saw\nThe art design of the of the film and\nWe're concerned that your book it was something about transcending your book in a way which it did not but there was something going on in the\nCommunal culture of that suggested that somebody in Hollywood be imagining a set design that look like out a way of life and the future and that neural Mansour was also have that same kind of a feel a I mean how do you think that kind of a\nIn the the museum of kind of ... technology consumer technology that nobody was ever going to get and the reason that happened is that we already have it\nWe're already there we just don't realize it but that's what kept people from going out and buying those those gloves and goggles says that if you're if you're paying enough attention to your computer monitor you don't need these kind of cutie infested things around\nHer head [laughter] actually they talked about the ... factor that people who that people have failed to become\nThe man who invented men and women who invented television afterwards when I said what didn't happen what do you think it was nice it was the ... factor nobody wanted to like put on somebody else's VR helmet\nIt's amazing that libraries having closed down people borrowing books with other people have had who knows where in\nTheir house yeah but those are I tracks you can't you can't get anything from other people's eyes tracks [laughter]\nLittle traces that that are invisible traces on the page when you as sat down and ah and thought about pattern recognition their number of icons that that come up a there's the Curtis calculating machine a\nWhich is being sold from a trunk and so hold or other kinds of brand name issues that come up a there's a wonderful mantra of where case when she gets into a stuck pattern in their head says I took a duck it two hundred and fifty miles an hour or through the windshield\nOf I mean these these wonderful kind of catch phrases and images a populate your book and give it I'm I'm\nSort of a residence that seems to go beyond the book itself into your own experience\nWell each of those each of those aspects of the book\nBears some sort of one on one relationship to something I've encountered in in my life and often in my life during the time that I that I'm writing a book that the duck in the face mantra came from a story that a friend of mine who's who's\nBeen an airline pilot for years ... told me about why what happens when\nYou get a a a duck you're taking your climbing out of ... Sioux City in it that kids the windshield of your of your airplane than it was just this horrific story of this friend of his ... like the\nWindshield him but the windshield imploded and glass was driven into the guy's guy and he\nThe cockpit became a hurricane and he may he managed to land safely any recovered and went on to fly with like ... glass in his eyes but it but this phrase that my friend has a you know he took it back in the face it a hundred and sixty not\nJob that it jumped out at me and my head because I had this\nCharacter had this this tonality to personality that that sort of it had a kind of a kind of OCD feeling to it somehow it seemed right that she would have uh\nWhat what do you mean OCD feeling obsessive compulsive disorder [laughter] so I wanted the the mantra to seem a ...\nWanted to be obsessive so that the times in a book when she can't not say it out loud and the other characters got what\nYou deal with email correspondence in in the book and websites and people trying to connect in various places of of the world how did you uh imagine the continuity structure of the story how did you\nUm because one of the aspects of emails and Web sites as it in and visiting them is that our live in our times become kind of fragmented and they jump from one place to another uh how is a writer do you manage to think about those issues in and maintain a narrative\nThrough a through line of of your story what kind of choices do make\nWell I had ... one of the parameters I set for this book was that that I Would have only a single viewpoint character which is actually something I haven't done before that you would always be in her point of view and you'd never cut away to that\nCut away from that to the point of view of another character\nAnd I found that a temporal quality to the Internet life really really handy because I could stay in her\nFictional narrative real time and yet when I needed to to break that break that up for the you know just for the for the sake of interest in them I could have her get online and\nAt that moment realistically all of this interesting correspondence with arrive which is very much like what happens in real life but as a as a literary can convenience it's fabulous\nAnd the idea of a of a mirror worlds worlds that are similar but but different or for instance you describe England as as a country\nThat like Japan made so many of its own things its own items that its window pains of different it's tea pots are different not to mention select trickle system that the way pens or sugar packets of it's it's kind of like our world but it's different in for a long time it remained\nInsular yet uh nowadays countries are importing objects culture from from elsewhere it's or was that kind of member quality be maintained\nIt seems to be going away and that causes me causes me some sorrow\nBecause the the Europe the Europe that I see now when I go there it's not really the Europe that I saw [noise] Twenty years ago but that's just change and there's nothing you can do about it you can't have changed without loss and you can't have\nNews things with that changed [noise]\nAuthor of pattern recognition\nMore on humans and technology from the first designer of the Mac icon Susan care own you're on we Gibson's observations about how we recognize patterns this is west coast lived for more information WC of orgy\nMy great pleasure here to introduce the designer whose work\nHas seeped into all of our neurons overtime you may not have a Mac but she's also designed for windows icons\nShe's also designing for cell phones and we're going to talk with her about design and how it seeps in to remind we please welcome the creator it's now been some Twenty years of the happy Mack the wristwatch the trash can file folders and many other icons that have become an integral part of our lives that are visual sensibility please welcome Susan care\nLook at some of her work on march Susan care home care with Cary thank you very much\nYou're welcome thank you for inviting me appreciate it what what art do have on your walls uh have all kinds of images folk art big map a squad valley\nUm I\nThink a fish with wings from Bali that I bought somewhere eclectic\nThe but nothing to depicts a somebody who spends her time working with very tiny amounts of pixels seven point phones how do you create image and sensibility and a hundred pixels were less\nPlow I say I spend all my day's journey dots off and on one by one and a a really good program or a friend of mine ... he said well season that's what I Do it that way at least you don't do one at a time [noise]\nAnd you do it one of the time in order to try to get in shape and shot oh this must have been a challenge Twenty years ago when you were first trying to uh people of apple had asked you to come up with ways to a direct images process was on the screen when\nI first started I'm a programmer ... Andy hurts fell invited me to he said go ahead and get some graph paper with the smallest squares you can find because we just need some images to try out on this new computer and that's what I did and then we gradually they wrote up\nA bit math editor so it wasn't quite so so much of it is it or it is that obviously coloring in a square in a racing it after you look at the whole thing isn't very efficient way to do that but I Do you know I I used to say I pay attention to every dot so I Do like to look at everything magnified just like big graph paper and\nUm you know I I've ...\nComing out of an art background I still find it very much like making art and designing but\nIf you love smearing globs paint across canvas as you are a form of expression you probably wouldn't like bit editing much much much more like ... or needle work or what kind of that kind of technique\nI've sort of at work when I was even photographs of truck clothes for instance or works of his uh where in fact you have to stand forty feet away to see the whole image but when you get closer you see the individual bits and pieces of it and that that somehow if you've used them we are the opposite of what you do because he's got a large you've gone tiny\nWell small solutions to a big problem [laughter]\nWhat a ... so much fun history is designed to of read ability and how does how do you shape you know the curve of a letter to make a legible and if you're working with such tiny amounts\nI'm having a picture of the hardware in general I think it's good not to have pictures of hardware so that when I think about the things that don't work so well anymore it's like yeah having a three and a half inch desk\nTo mean storage isn't so good yeah I Try and steer clear of representing anything hard it is even a monitor because if you want to go for a longer throw\nThe number of composers are also working with the shoes of cell phones for writing tunes and it's kind of look very Bernard bird I mean you're working with a limited tones structure which as you working with limited pixels or do you collaborated with with musicians agreed on a cell phone package music can visuals\nNot too far but I think that would be great I'd love to do cell phone games too because as soon as I observe that gets a lot of work out at least in our family but um\nHow your thumbs holding up pretty good you know you've you've brought a couple of things along her to show our radio audience [laughter]\nYou know I just brought this case as kind of a portfolio book so I thought if we needed if I forgot what I had designed I Would have to remember\nIt's Kara dot com it's a ... or ... dot com thank you I really appreciate my only work you've done but coming to the show today\nThanks again so much that\n\n\nYou're listening to west those laws [noise]\nMy name is ... my ring so at the keyboard [noise]\nMetro home and at the controls before Susan cure the Mac was the apple two out of that come about Willie rebut the story of one of the creators of now presented by west coast live\nMy next guest actually worked on automated systems for a while for how sliding and perhaps we should have him help us [laughter]\nAlong the way he figured out how to get letters into video inputs when he was three years old he later went on him he developed circuit board designs and developed the apple two or apple bracket one way of apple bracket the other way\nComputer and with Steve Jobs started the apple computer company he has a memorial that he's put together with Gina Smith the book is called I was actually he's still is we please welcome Steve Wozniak\nI mean it's like you're everything I Want right except for seven words\nWell I'm not sure that the ideas the fleeting expletive as ... goes and it was an incidental it was accidental live show I mean if we found a group of aliens and they were talking as if any alien said why weren't they stole them and put them away and kill him and all that when they come to us we'll show you what civilization is [laughter]\nWe came close to that here in this country may still be there at some point again but I was fascinated that there were a couple of things that you wanted to be famous for it and most predominantly it was the creation of dial a joke in the in the bay area\nThat's always been true yeah that was a tough thing to do because that was Nineteen Seventy two and it was a time when you could not in the United states you could not legally bone purchased or use\nA telephone you I think that was an FCC will have your own and you could not own use or purchase an answering machine of your own\nAnd so you had the least the one answering machine that the big phone company supplied for theaters we have lots of money so that the answer machine costs as much as my apartment rental you don't have as a young student still in college even working as a\nYoung engineer and that's pretty steep when your apartment rental is double but I Want to do it so badly I just grew up with this whole sense of humor and feeling it was important in the labs that people to good places you know and I can't stop a lot of the bad things in the world but at least if I make a few more laughs I've done my part\nBut the diner jokes and you have you tried it out in front of the joke book and you told jokes there was a time when you were telling polish jokes and you heard from the Polish American cultural society\nYou know the most successful joke book ever in the United states was the official polish Italian joke book by Larry wild and start to polish jokes and then the Polish American Congress got upset the polish people were being disdain and I said what if I change them telling jokes and they said that's fine [laughter]\nSeventy two so as you know no political\nCorrectness yet in the mid seventies there was a radio station in public radio station in San Francisco area which carry a lot of very sort of specialized programming and they carried a show called the polish cultural our and after a while it was cut back to thirty minutes\nAnd it was still called the polish cultural our\n[laughter]\nEvery time I had to announce that that's just telling it and it is it's just totally funny and you could ... yeah you could get accused of oh we're making people bunch of people very upset you met your first wife through dial a joke\nThat's actually true um I was one of those shy people shy nerds and I would probably never meet a girl and my wife\nWouldn't know how to get married of course I knew that eventually I'm going to be just a stable normal person and have a home in a family and all this but there's a little problem in there I'm not going to able to meet girls but then I had to tell a joke and I was in ... I was the first chat rooms and so I can come home from work and turn off the machine and take calls live added\nAll this is family what can I tell you today and I actually met my mentor medical in my first wife yeah [laughter]\nI mean she put up with my humor\nThe first of three successful marriages according to remember\nThat's right I'm very I was I was recently speaking at a um jewelry convention of jewelry people and I said I'm I should be your hero in I've been married three times and they all applauded\n[laughter]\nYou'd also start out with the belief that you would have won marriage in one job you're going to stay at Hewlett Packard a all your life that was where you were dedicated ... devoted\nYeah and I say I really said there in my heart to end but Hewlett Packard is change runs thought the old you'll at Packard and more than the new\nOne along the way you discovered that you have this great gift for designing computers you would get computer design skim addicts in your head and you would create chips in and make things as efficient as possible in relatively short order\nDon't like to say unfortunately it's true but you are wrong to say that it was three years old it was like two countries [laughter]\nThat was actually believe it or not ten eleven Thirteen pretty much yeah I had it all down and designed\nThere's tons of all the computers that you'll at Packard sold and very unfold\nDigital equipment sold and data journal sold all my versions and boy did I get skilled from that just\nTrying to beat myself and do better and better designs with fewer and fewer pieces and I would say to this day I tell companies if you have your employees challenges to do something that may not even have to work project but try to do it if you were programming steps or fewer parts than someone than anyone else could possibly come up with and you know you put people through that\nFor a couple of years and they get extremely skilled or coming up with techniques it couldn't be put in the book\nOne of the things that was a a important about that saves you a Packard was the doughnut and coffee trolley that came around\nAnd that was very delightful twice a day twice a day that don't and coffee trolley came along and we all gathered in one little place all the people on the same for\nThe normally don't talk to each other gathered sorted thought to hear each other and chat and hear what other people are saying even if you're not talking directly with them and I just love that little socialization time there's a lot of us engineers just you know our on our own independent and you know inside\nWhat about the role of pranks when you were growing up but I mean just to kids sometimes are now getting in trouble for pranks\nYeah my mom always said have a sense of humor and I think she meant laugh at jokes but to me it meant played jokes [laughter]\nYes and I found out that because I have a skilled electronics in the early ... you could make devices that other people didn't know people other humans could make and you could trip them and make them think where things were happening in the world where it was just an electronic device doing it the TV jam or in class but the generals who get much of a first year college yeah\nBuilding with a little high speed transistor break in tune with my some nail it little device that held in my palm no one would see it in the dark room a college\nStudent and the court t._v. picture would ... up\nAnd a friend of mine hit the TV\nAnd and then I made a good [noise]\nAfter that I jammed it again and he would hit the TV harder and harder and eventually that for weeks they station one person next to that TV [noise] whenever went bad it was their job to tune the tuning controls and fix it 'til at work and then I discovered I could make it work when their body was touching the TV and fail when it wasn't touching\nSo I I was able to start controlling them just like your control trading maps strange things that amaze you know run around the circle three times in the dark this way and run this circle the opposite direction two times and they get the cheese you could trained to do anything I had these people one time I sat there with a hand in the middle of the TV screen for half an hour during the mission impossible because it made the TV work\n[laughter] I should have had a psychology credit [noise]\nDid you ever get caught never got caught that one and I'm so amazed I had them sometimes holding the antenna up in the air and it would work for a while and then they'd have to climb on a chair\nAnd then I'd have to stand on their tips throws and they never once assumed that another human being in the room was doing it I was good them [laughter]\nSo you keep a good straight face in the midst of a [noise]\nA joke as a favorite of my six year old would you do when you see a space man\nI don't know park in it\n[laughter] I Will remember that one that's a great show\nWhere you broken hearted when apple ... computer from its name\nOf course not of course I mean I think any company can have a you could probably think", "station": "KALW", "city":
