of questions why do the drug costs skyrocketing might be on candidate fake forty percent less for medications and we do in America why does the whole system feel Rick\nThere's an answer big drug maker spend a lot of money laundering to protect their profits over a hundred and Seventy one million dollars to be exact\nBut there is a bigger lobby in America are politicians must answer to we the

were able to associate this sound with a nice stimulus [noise] like the food we've achieved pulling in natural response from the [noise] the food\nYet there's and there's quite a few names that are being floated um there's certainly a you know the the the current CD you general secretary as a woman very close to Chancellor Merkel is considered to be the closest person to Chancellor Merkel\nUm she hurt her name her first name is Anna Gratz a last name as ... bar she goes by the initials K. K.\nAnd um she certainly could be I think if if Chancellor Merkel had a chance to pick he would pick AK\nOr she would pick AKA and and they both worked very closely closely together so um she's one name I think ...\nWith the current health minister who has Ben I'm kind of the the the conservative wing of um Chancellor Merkel's party\nI he's been a thorn in her side I'm trying to get her to move closer to um the conservatives he's been the leader of the young\nCD you movement I think he's got a very real chance I'm certainly uh the the defense minister minister von der lion Ursula von der line she's a in a very impressive person um ... has been a member of the city for a long time she's done well at the defense ministry\nUm so I think she's got a chance or one of the issues I think in in German politics is they tend to look for somebody very young because they want somebody to be around for a long time\nI'm not sure that that's going to happen this time there have been some talk about just getting somebody who can do a really good job for a couple of years and not have to have somebody who's looking for you know a ten to Fifteen Years fan\nThat's very kind of an German they usually want somebody who is going to bring stability for very long time if they went with someone who um you know really knows how to how to run the country has been in in uh in power\nUm seats or you could look to what's gang shy blah who is a long term um finance minister and now he is um [noise] the president of the boom just dog\nWe're going to be six years old and he's a little bit older but I think the the business community really looks at Wolfgang shy blind says this is a guy who really knows the system and knows how to carry us through\nWe're gonna want stability in Europe that's to me I I Hope whoever emerges from this and that you were working with those are embarrassing or provides for instability in a post brags that you have to ask you a ... you know it was a bastard or to Germany a neo Nazi\nAttacked and killed Thirteen eleven people in Pittsburgh and we've been grieving that but I look up and I see my friends at MSNBC with a ... that says how Trump quote sets the tone quote unquote for anti Semite and and my heart just fails because\nThe president is the least bad I mean I've got my problems with them I always have but but he's not got a liquor anti Semitism in\nIt it's outrageous and you know him better than most ... what do you think of a crime run that says how Trump quote sets the tone for anti Semite\nCompletely outrageous it's completely divisive the president has made a key policy decisions um and and really focused the U.S government\nOn a on a number of issues that really are not only pro Israel that are a pro Jewish community but\nThat have really set the bar I think unlike any other president in trying to to make sure that I'm tolerance and diversity celebrated look it's no secret I I'm I'm gay and and I've seen some of the the same types of\nOf arguments about the president um when it comes to gay rights and I have to say just from my personal experience I've waited a very long time to have a president\nWho would embrace me embrace the community and and really Sunday very strong message of diversity intolerance and I think this president does it\nA similar smear that spread yesterday was against GOP house majority leader Kevin McCarthy who would criticize George Soros and others for spending lots of money\nOn Democrats which they have done and the mean began he use those names because they are Jewish names these implying that Jewish money is attempting to her politics of course\nThe Koch brothers spend a lot of money and Sheldon Adelson who was also joined spend a lot of money on the Republican I think it's just an outright smear record now you've been around your your in diplomacy now but you've been around American politics a long time is there no limit to how low the left will go to smoke\nOur time is there no limit to how low the left will go to ... smear people\nWell let me just let me just say this um because you know I Am in a diplomatic position I Want to be very careful [noise] um I I Want to say unequivocally that I'm Kevin McCarthy is my friend I Know him from California\nAnd and that's an outrageous charge against Kevin it's wrong it's not it's outrageous and and we should not have politics of destruction like this\nThat is exactly at you and I both know McCarthy and the idea he that he talking about SARS and Bloomberg and stagger giving money that that is somehow anti Semitic when in fact that it's simply an objective\nLook at who is funding just like eight or something and coke or funding us a record outlet make let me caused by asking is um how soon will it be when we will have clarity as to who the next German Chancellor will be\nWell first of all we will know in December who the next party chair is and that will be um largely the signal so I Would say in December we will know um how the transition will go in and how quickly it will be\nI appreciate your joining me on short notice Ambassador Richard gr now the United states ambassador to Germany always a very powerful and effective voice for America abroad and in Germany good luck in keeping us posted in keeping our interest represented well in Berlin is he has done\nFor the past year I I Want to tell everyone out there as well [noise] that one of the uh\nI Will not let this Kevin McCarthy is let her go unanswered right it is it is traffic in the left I've known Kevin since Nineteen eighty nine years as a Middle East and I ate there isn't a\nInch a tank sure of anti Semitism in his as welcoming everyone of all races and backgrounds as anyone you possibly could\nAnd that that it's being ginned up isn't it I again I'll tell you the Democrats are desperate they thought they had a blue wave they don't have a blue wave\nThey thought that the bomber would help them it hasn't helped them they thought that um ah they could somehow make the president responsible for Pittsburgh that didn't work nothing is working for them because people don't want Nancy Pelosi backers speaker and they are voting to increase Mitch McConnell's\nMajorities in the Senate and therefore it just bottom of the barrel time and smearing Kevin McCarthy as an anti Semite is the lowest of low not the lowest of low and I won't let it pass\nNot pass either it's a time to tell you about really factor dot com Monday morning I Hope you had a good weekend\nI'm feeling better though my voice has donated like

it's not a that's a great honey destination it's the sunflower state the state of Kansas and with us here to tell you more about it is Mike Miller who works for the state and knows\nAll about hunting and fishing there Mike welcome to the show\nGlad to be here John So Mike let's start off with deer because I think most folks do know that Kansas is a great place to look for white tailed deer in November is a really good time to go after\nYeah we're kind of known as one of those a trophy whitetail destination states and and that that is just really you know grown in an interest over the last say seven or eight years we've always had a one book policy for residents and non residents and I think that's allowed I think our biggest secret us we let\nTheir kids to be four and a half and five and a half years old and that's one of the reasons we have you know good trophy a deer\nAre usually starts the ah in October that first week of November and that's when the bow hunters really like to be in the woods here because when the rockets going you know things here crazy\nWhen it comes to non resident opportunities how does that work in terms of getting a tag in terms of getting access is there a lot of public land or is it mostly private land and outs that are you working with\nWell the first question is it is a limited draw for non resident hunters\nThe application period of the month of April and it's an online application that you can make to our website at ... dot com and then there is a drawing held um chess rates are very high we set our quotas to try to meet demand demand has shifted and has increased in some units in recent years and so in the eastern part of the state where\nWe used to have leftover permits we're now seeing some of those units over subscribed but we do have adjustment factors and we do make adjustments from year to year that application period again is in the month of April and you'll need to do that\nTo be ready for the next year season\nRegarding access is there a lot of public lands for hunters to to find their or is it mainly working through private outfitters and getting on the leaf plants\nWell Kansas is a private land states so it's Ninety seven percent privately owned so most of our hunting does occur on private lands we manage how probably close to one point seven\nMillion acres most of that\nOne million acres of that is in our walking hunting access program which is private lands release as an agency and opened up public counting the rest of that is in you know areas around reservoirs and lands that we own and manage for public land so again most of the hunting is done on private land so you need to either have a contract with landowners were worked through and after\nAll right so I was going to ask you about el because of folks believe it or not I didn't know that there is no honey to be had in Kansas but it's very limited it's only open to state residents so let's turn our focus to birds because I'm guessing you can buy an over the counter license and you can do pheasant hunting the Kansas right now\nYou can see that opens a second Saturday November this year so off until November tense power it's all you need is a non resident a hunting license which is Ninety seven dollars and fifty cents the season last in the end of January and our licenses as of this year or three hundred and sixty\nFive day licenses so if you buy a license now it's going to be going through the entire pheasant season we're always in one of the top three states in the nation for pheasant harvest I think last year we were probably number two we're looking at what we consider fairly good pheasant hunting and most of our primary regions this year um we'd come off a series\nOf dry winters and so that isn't the best nesting habitat for pheasant early in the spring but we still are going to be one of the top states for pheasant hunting this year again\nAnd when it comes up land birds I'm guessing it yes doesn't you've probably got a pretty healthy population of ... too don't ya\nYeah we were actually the top state in the Niger prequel harvest last year how we're usually right there with Oklahoma Texas as far as harvest\nAnd we've we've seen in the last three years of modern quail boom especially in North central south central south west parts of our state and the the dry winters haven't hurt the quail because we started getting rains and in fact April and may and the way on that later than pheasants into our Bob White populations have been very very good the last few years\nGetting back to access so you already explained that primarily for talking private lands here the state does have a lot of land center manages walking property is that what this\nHave a lot of lands that are managed as walking property is that what these up Lindbergh hunters are taking advantage of us he's walking properties or they again going with private outfitters\nYou know the the walking properties or wherever hunters really shine because a lot of times it Cherokee or it's native grass or it's the deer hunting leases are really tough for us to compete with because of what people are willing to pay as to how white tailed deer or we can least lands that are very good bird hunting\nAnd solve majority of our a walk in areas and the western part of the state our for our good open birds and so we have an outlet we call it you know our hunting outlets that we make available online and we have printed copies will mail for people that I can pick him up wherever they buy their license\nAnd that shows all of our walking areas as well as our federal and state areas so guy could pick up one of these and and really travel around and look at these areas and find a lot of good bird hunting I'm Serious it's like anything you have to do a little bit of scouting\nCars from one year to the next farming practices change whether you know a circumstances are different and so it does take a little bit groundwork for the hunter but you've got a million and a half acres at your fingertips without Alice\nYou're listening to America outdoors radio we're talking with Mike Miller what the Kansas department of wildlife parks and tourism about the eighty three thousand square miles of hunting opportunities alone with fishing bird watching that weight in the sunflower state\nSo we talked about pheasants we talked about well we talked about here all great opportunities this has got to be a big economic boom to the state of Kansas\nAbsolutely you know ... over well over four hundred million dollars a year and Kansas I'm In the western part of the state if it's a it's really important to a lot of those real communities\nI grew up in one of those communities and that was the only time I ever saw the motels in our town full was that opening weekend and maybe that second weekend to heaven season and so it's a big deal they roll out the red carpet for bird hunters and hunters in general um they had hunter breakfast they or their dog friendly motels they really do I want to attract\nAnd accommodate hunters in these smaller communities in western Kansas\nWill tell you what you've got people to come out to Kansas right now to enjoy some of the little one other opportunity we need to talk about duck hunting I don't think most people think of Kansas is a great duck hunting states but you've got a lot of opportunities for both ducks and geese don't ya\nWe do you know again were highly agricultural and so we have some large marshes reservoirs are through the central part of the state and eastern part of the state and so the waterfowl will come and when we have good water\nConditions like we do this year we had an awful lot of rain the last two months those waterfowl steak chase both will stay in the area for a link or the\nFall because there's so much food available they can research on the reservoirs and marshes and then she'd on a a harvest the crop yields that are just you know a short distance away I'm from anywhere in Kansas basically because we are so agricultural so we can have some very good a duck and good hunting and federal\nLast quarter and to you know the seasons that'll go into a February so we can have some really really find water hunting for both ducks and geese\nWell there you have it folks as you just heard Kansas is definitely worth a hard look and I'd say that trip whether you're a white tailed deer hunter whether you're a pheasant hunter whether you want to go after Bob like ... or if you want to go after ducks and geese\nThe sunflower state is definitely the place to go what's the website where folks can find out more and start planning a trip like\nIt's WWW dot casts outdoors dot com and you can find everything you need

there's guides that fish there year round and most years they don't have ice but even when you have ice it's a great ice fishing spot but Lake Erie east to west it doesn't matter where you're fishy on Lake Erie most of the fishing is in the western base in\nCleveland area over to the west end of the lake and it's just a tremendous tremendous wildlife fishery for not only numbers John but big big fish\nWell I Love it and and we talked to a somebody else the owner of Dutch for customers Keith ... he's a tournament angler too and he was singing the praises of Lake Erie I get the impression that right now at least this year Lake Erie might be the hottest walleye fishery in the entire country\nWell it is I had a friend of mine go out on Lake Erie just a couple of weeks ago and his first for fish that he ... he was trolling crank Bates his first for fish were all over ten pounds\nOh my gosh that is right up all All right we're starting to run short on time Jim but before we go I Want you

were designed it might seem like a no brainer flag makers just added\nA new star for every state I\nOut not that simple each new flag very careful design and the arrangement of the stars must be precise symmetric [noise]\nFor the flag we know today that arrangement was designed by a junior in high school from us\nThat arrangement was designed by a junior in high school from Ohio [noise]\nIt was Nineteen fifty eight in America only contain forty eight United States flag at the time featured six rows of eight star\nBob past history teacher assigned a class project where each student had to bring in something they may\nNot have my facts then he loves politics\nSo having been inspired by the Betsy Ross story the class just study in the in the news that Alaska was poised to become our nation's forty nine states with Hawaii soon behind has decided to make a fifty star flag\nSo he made some adjustments to his parents forty eight star flag brought it in and triumphantly placed it on his teacher's desk\nHere's Bob\nIn American history class we had to do it outside of class project we can make a new whatever we want it as like a science fair or something like that bring a project

it up past smother walked in from the kitchen and found him cutting up their family flag and promptly began scolding him\nShe told his father when he got home and has received another tongue lashing I'd always been in the boy scouts and I had always been patriotic have told the Lancaster eagle is that in two thousand seven they wanted to know why I Would turn on the flag\nI had never shown in my life watched my mom so but I never soon and sense making the flag of her country I've never so and again so anyhow we get the class I had my flag on the teacher's desk and the teacher said watch this thing on my desk and so I got up and I approached a desk and I'm shaking like elite\nAnd he said why you've got too many stars you don't even know how many states we have\nAnd that he gave me the

the words as the only known person to ever ever volunteer to be a prisoner there his name\nWas vetoed Polanski\nThey told ... family going back as far as his great grandparents were foreigners in the side of the SARS regime in Russia which at occupy Poland along with Austria Hungary and pressure since the Seventeen Ninety\nBecause of their opposition to the tyranny of theirs are associated the family was exiled seven hundred miles to the northeast of St Petersburg Russia\nSo for several generations this polish family was not on pulley saw or they were exiled survivors are to a place that they were completely unfamiliar with Polanski himself was born in Russia in a small village called all and that's\nBut he always felt that Poland was his home and would someday be his home\nIn Nineteen eighty when World War one came to a close\nPoland was a re carved as a country and re feared on the maps and the first time in a hundred and twenty three years but it needed ... the Russians under the new regime of flooding Marilyn and and as both cervix invaded Poland they did not want to give it up so to secure polish independents that\nAt least for the moment was on paper\n... while he was still a teenager in so many other brave polls had to\nPick up arms against the ... and in a three year war they were successful and expelling them and London had to bring the troops back home so it wasn't until Nineteen Twenty one that you could say Poland had indeed secured its independence as a nation for the first time\nSo ... settled down and raised a family and painted [noise]\nThere was no indication that Poland's independence was going to be threatened again only in the late Nineteen thirties says Hitler began to rattle a saver doesn't it seem as though there could be yet another war\nBut still on the evil and lots of people didn't see it coming we had the Munich Agreement that was agreed to in September of thirty eight that basically said hey everything's fine that we have to deal with Hitler and as long as he doesn't go any further uh there'll be peace in the world so\nThere was a long period of almost Twenty years when Poland was free of conflict and they've came on them with\nGreat ferocity when the Nazis and faded from the west and the Soviets\nA couple of weeks later he made it from the east in September of Nineteen thirty nine\nThere was tremendous resistance from the polls on only the polish army but an underground resistance to the rose pretty quickly so the Nazis and the Soviet never had a quiet day\nPolls were have always been courageous people who don't take tyranny lying down and they've resisted in every way imaginable does Polanski was one of them along with another gentleman he cofounded a resistance movements and\nVery bravely [noise]\nIn Nineteen forty after years of fighting ... realize that something was going on as a sprawling complex near crack I'll pull itself would become known as the outfits concentration camps wasn't yet the notorious death camp with Suzie come\nBut ... and his men to realize that many people were being taken they're not just Jewish people and they wanted to know\nWhat's happening there and they felt that or whatever it was the world needs to know about it so Polanski volunteers to get arrested five of Germans in the hope that they wouldn't shooting that they would in fact send him to outfits\nAnd of course there was no guarantee that they wouldn't simply kill him on the spot\nAnd no guarantee that they would send them to outfits\nThere were a periodic round up by the German polish citizens and in one particular round up some two thousand or he simply walked into it and was one of those two thousand people arrested by the Germans\nAnd he did not supply his proper identity papers she had the forged ahead of time and that was largely to protect his family did not want\nHis name or his activities will be traced back and make them the objects of any reprisals by the Nazis\nDid veto holds wife know about and approve of him doing all of the\nSheen fully supportive what he was doing knowing full well what an enormous risk it was probably expected to never see him again but he got his wish and after an interrogation and being rushed up he was sentenced to ... he was ... in may number forty eight fifty nine\nPolanski knew what he was sentenced there than it was a place of no good but it would be the next two to three years went outfits really blossomed into this ghastly concentration camp\nThat the world now knows upwards of two million people ultimately would be killed al ... [noise]\n\nI'm sure that Polanski has to think long and hard about how to get information out I mean he was stealing documents along with others that he recruited into his movement whenever they could\nA movement that he built up to more than one is now an insurrection died off [noise]\nAnd then they had to find some way to get them out there were a hundred and forty one people\nWho did manage to escape and some of those were people that Polanski had recruited and he was sending material with them\nBut Polanski the OSCE which volunteered didn't try to escape\nYou had more work to do\nThere was a time in Nineteen forty two when Polanski and some of his closest confidant in the resistance movement were able to rebuild the remnants of a radio transmitter with very spare parts and things that they could find around the camp\nTo the point where they were actually able to broadcast and for about a six month period they were broadcasting from this crude radio transmitter from inside outfits when you're measuring hundreds and hundreds of guards on watch fully armed at any moment\nWhen they were in power to shoot us I suspect that anything and yet this man and his men were able to get information out those reports along with the\nDocuments he smuggled out and the testimony from people who escaped became known as the told to report the most comprehensive eyewitness accounts\nEver compiled of the happenings inside the outfits concentration camp [noise] I'm\nAnd the outfits concentration camp [noise] I'm\nSure that the polish resistance had to find that incredibly inspiring to think of one of their own was on the inside and was getting this information out there that was reaching the capitals of the allies Asians and this happened to be an incredibly [noise] his racial thing to them [noise]\nJust imagine if the opposite was the case if they'd never heard anything from it if no information was getting out [noise] that would have been tremendously demoralizing\nWould have said hey there's no hope\nBut the fact that he was active and busy and hadn't given often was getting this information to be a great inspiration [noise]\nTo be told what his report had on his part\nWas over one hundred pages long and reported that where he was was like another planet\nThere were sterilization experiments going on there were three criminal tore up with the gas chambers that we're able to burn eight thousand people daily at one point he writes about some recently murdered Jews quote from the new transports over a thousand a day work gap\nBritish officials receive this report and found it so shocking that they didn't believe in thing to themselves and why would the Germans who shot and star Jews on a daily basis put in all this effort they thought it was an exaggeration from a desperate for some\n... was seeking more help from the allies [noise] it was what they found a reporter way to know that there was no indication\nAs to which reliability\nThe Nazi hookers reports seriously [noise] they just didn't know it was [noise]\nAnd when we come back we're going to continue with the story of the tone Polanski [noise] and by the way we tell these stories for an important reason a recent survey found\nThat two thirds of millennials don't\nKnow what House with his it's unimaginable for and that's why we do these stories and why we partner with the U.S the Shoah foundation to broadcast they're incredible archive\nOf fifty five thousand video testimony from survivors witnesses and perpetrators of the Holocaust course it was a

special place were students study all the things that matter in like\nThe imitation of Christ\nPolanski was a devout Catholic the very end\nOn the day of execution in May of Nineteen forty five may twenty five in fact his last words were recorded as long live\nFree Poland and that certainly was the model by which he lived his life from the day he joined the polish army at the age of Seventeen the man was absolutely fearless and totally committed he endured unspeakable cruelty and hardships\nAnd all because he wanted his country to be free free free forward invasion free from a tyrannical government since even though we had a family to think about\nOr his first love I think was freedom for not only his family but all of his native country of Poland and I have just enormous respect for that\nAfter World War two with Poland being a communist country now governed by a puppet\nSoviet regime really\nThe story of Polanski was suppressed\nAnd the reason was the polish communist government knew that you couldn't tell the story the full story of the told Polanski\nWithout revealing what he had done after the time that he resisted the Nazi so they they would have loved to have had the story told\nOf what he had done to resist the German\nBut of course everybody was then asked what what did he do afterwards and then you'd have to tell the story of the fact that he was against the tyranny of the Soviet Union to it was against the communist regime so instead of having any of that story being told they decreed that his very nice to not be spoken in public his own family\nWere advised by the government that they could be federalized wouldn't be penalize jail if they spoke of the top ... in public it wasn't until after Nineteen eighty nine in the liberation of POWs from the communist yolk\nThat finally it was no longer illegal to speak of veto Polanski\nOn march ... two thousand sixteen Larry Reid got the opportunity of a lifetime visiting with Polanski sun\nIt was apparent during our conversation that even though\nHe suffered the loss of his father a all these years later he seemed to be a a a man content and and happy and when I asked him why are you happy or something of that affect his response was\nBecause my father's story is now becoming known\nIn great job on that out is always and thanks to Larry Reid and his book by the way real heroes is terrific forty stories about forty different heroes and it's available on Amazon dot com\nAnd we tell this story for a reason because first ten million polish Americans know it more than likely or should and there are Seventy million Catholics in this country and we also tell us because well we know the power of God\nAnd how to ... feet and drive out God anytime they can and we can tell that story the
