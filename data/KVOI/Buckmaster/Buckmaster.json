just common sense with Joseph Morgan Phillip I Know that you were there earlier um if you'd like to call in and and get your thoughts and I will take your call I just I had to get through my opening up of remarks on things so anyway back to this this this bomber\nThis man safer but\nOne of the reasons why I literally a and confused by this whole thing and again it it it\nIt deeply troubles me that we cannot trust our law enforcement in this country everybody goes oh my gosh how can you possibly say those kind of I'm going to just explain something to you\nA real fast she did this and this is just a little bit of the ... the the stuff that I've been able to uncover with regards to this story that still stinks to high happens to me I mean it just it stinks to high heaven\nNo and I'm not talking about the hit stickers and everything else although I Do I thought it was a little strange that the the FBI would allow pictures to be taken up a van then cover up ... y cover up the van I mean I I I didn't understand that and then of course I thought that was hilarious as a driving down the highway that the the tarp comes off the ban is just kind of flying so everybody can see the stickers anyways\nUh neighbors all these new jobs but I mean why why covered this ban um if if if this is how he's been driving around\nAnd and that was my that was something that that troubles me as well\nAt this management ... a driving around like this for months and months\nI mean wouldn't have been vandalized or attack I mean we we see we see signs a Trump signs destroyed all sorts of everything's net and here's this man will literally as a shrine to Donald Trump and nobody messed it up in in Florida okay I I guess and and maybe ... I don't know\nBut that really isn't that that big of a deal to me that the the issues that I have is\nIs this OK so first of all because again I'm Talking about the way that the the national media\nAt the national media spins things okay this is what troubles me one of the very first things they said and this was in multiple things and they kinda damp and that down sense that that is that he's white a white Trump's support that was an immediately out they're all over the place well he's not white right in and do what you could you describe him as white I\nDon't even know where he is a Native American Filipino I don't know but I did think it was interesting all the major images that are being put out on on a national media or all of an altered photo look where they've white skin it's an Indian whereas if you're going you actually look at other ... uh\nImages of this man everywhere else in his stripper days and everything else he darker man who I mean it doesn't matter to me my point is is the media is about a narrative that's just what they do they push a narrative\nAnd even when that narrative is not true they don't care because that's their narrative so then there's other things about this and I'll get to it on a second but I see a Philip has called back Philip you're on the air brother go\nWell sorry to hear about your situation but um I think that you're a you're very special you're ready to get up in ... shows\nWell maybe it's still in or something out of the nation and um I I think that you're in a nature I benched arrow you got the same type of style and I think you're a you're a good first this is only about a year that I wouldn't be here\n[laughter] oh I appreciate that Phil ... hey listen I'm not saying it's over but for right now it is it just it wasn't a fit and that's all I can say about it\nBut it takes a lot feel and not thank you for a for Conan thank you for listening I really appreciate it and thank you for those kind words\nSo back to back to why this story still just I mean doesn't pass any kind of melted and again I'm Talking about the way the media present things and the the corruption in our law enforcement at the highest levels FBI and the bird goes how can you possibly say that shouldn't you be patting them on the back no not exactly not if you want to actually\nBe analytical and actually look at the facts\nOn the ground and I'll say facts on the ground things that we know so the case in point\nEverybody early on this with law enforcement this was the national media was calling these fake bombs hoax bombs and everything else and we now know that that's exactly what the the ah the states are has said that's exactly what he has said the alleged bomber has has declared that\nI didn't intend to hurt anybody with these and everything else well you shouldn't have said in many ways and I hope they do throw the book out yet there's no place for that at all but the fact of the matter is\nIf none of these bombs put him detonate it not a single one of them and that's what was early on going on but no we have Christopher Wray of the FBI come along and say that these were not hoax bomb that that his official statement on it\nDon't read the indictment against the man that was brought into to a court of law because I Want you to understand something\nThat if he were functionally explosive bombs and now I'm not making this up if these were functionally explosive bombs they would fall under this category weapons of mass destruction which has its own US Code Eighteen US Code to twenty three thirty to eh okay but that\nThat was no were found in the official indictment nowhere\nDo you know why because they weren't weapons of mass destruction if you go read them a new show of the indictment it says that they had energetic material along with alarm clocks and wiring and you\nGet nation device no nothing\nNothing okay it's\nYou know along with alarm clocks and wiring and you'd be known detonation device no nothing\nNothing\nOkay if this man had a decent lawyer he's probably not going to get the whole book which is why yes what\nWhich is why he was only ... and this is what Jeff Sessions said at that press conference adjust ... Jeff Sessions says fifty eight years he faces up to fifty eight years in prison and then they clarify that know up to forty eight years that's where they clarified later on an incorrect\nFor each and every one of them if they were actually explosive devices he would face a minimum of a lifetime in prison so he'd have fourteen multiple life sentences built on that's what he'd be facing people if he had actually sent this but\nChristopher Wray made it seem like they weren't that by saying these were not hoax bombs\nWell it's serious enough without it my point is is is continuing the narrative that they want to put out there\nIn the days that followed a the the alleged bomber doing what he did he he can't he tweeted out something and I found myself agreeing with Jeff Flake oh gosh you know forgive me but you know and broken clock is as right twice a day you know as I say\nI agreed with Jeff Flake\nDonald Trump should not have pointed out the thing about how this this just look so bad for Republicans in the midterms get out and vote you shouldn't you shouldn't even care about that with regard to this not if you're the president you shouldn't make those kinds of statements at all have some self awareness\nBut he did\nAnd so again you you you take the bad but the good I Love the policies of president Donald Trump absolutely love them I support the man I understand he's up against so much and this is part of what we see\nAnd it it it it truly disturbs me as an American that we we can't I cannot trust or FBI anti OJ right now I mean here we are all ... a year removed from the slaughter in Las Vegas\nLast October remember that\nAnd we still don't have any answers they released their official findings on it earlier this year and they didn't they didn't find anything we still in the world a missing hard drives are we still know anything all these things that should have been to answer they were never answered it's just like man let's just move on let's move on\nAnd it's sad\nThat we find that and yet here we have all these supposedly answers right away in three days with with this guy I it's just okay whatever\nBut the media and and and the FBI and it's all about a narrative and so here just guess I don't know if you missed the story I don't know if you missed it\nThis story just happened right now\nOkay this week but you might have missed it NBC got caught in a major lie because remember what we said about the Kavanaugh hearings all they were doing was pushing a narrative that would hurt Republicans I specifically stop Donald Trump\nThat's all they were doing that was what they want it to do constantly was made sure that that happened and the and the press was all with them\nEvery single person in the mainstream media for the most part was like yeah\nAbsolutely every story was against Donald Trump every story was was promoting what a bad person Kavanaugh was and how we had to look into all these women\nWho remember that third accuser Julie sweating it will we see what happened earlier this this week Senator Grassley from the Judiciary Committee he said the criminal referrals and he said that now there are a criminal a referral against Michael ... you know the porn lawyer\nStormy Daniels' lawyer he sent this criminal referral and suddenly because of this criminal referral that we see breaking force here we didn't see NBC secrecy put out the story\nThat says well we actually had all this exculpatory information from the woman who was supposedly the corroborating witness to Julie ... next a story and if you forgot who ... what what if she was claiming was that\nA Brett Kavanaugh young Brett Kavanaugh hearing a friend my a judge mark judge were spiking the punch bowls of these parties so that they could organize gang rapes that women if you remember that that's what this woman was she was a third accused have come forward\nAnd NBC ran with this woman's story now the timeline shows you what a bunch of wires NBC is on this\nBecause NBC is trying to claim well we didn't actually know until after the Kavanaugh story was done and then we decided it wasn't much of a story to run anymore so no big deal because he was already confront that's a lie\nThey had this conversation with this woman and what she said I never said\nTo ... that I confirmed what ... does she said I never said that he was twisting my words they had this conversation with a four days before the Kavanaugh hearing so they had this exculpatory evidence and and information and guess what they didn't run it\nThey sat on it why because it went against their narrative and the only reason they're producing it now with the spin on it is because I have an Audi has now been referred for criminal charges\nFor lying to Congress because it it's it's a federal crime to lie to the Senate Judiciary committee this man is such a fraud Michael I haven't I I Hope he goes to jail I Hope all these people go to jail but this is what I'm Talking about about NBC because here's a major news outlet\nWho had been exposed I mean completely exposed for running a hit job on Brett Kavanaugh why because it fit what they wanted it fit their narrative\nThey don't care about the truth none of these organizations care about the truth not a single one of them and are you hearing much about this and the other media outlets nope all we're talking about and again I'm not saying you shouldn't talk about the alleged bomber I'm not saying you shouldn't talk about what just happened in Pittsburgh I'm not but this is a massive story and you're not going to hear about it\nYou're not going to hear about it for many of the rest of my other than Fox News and of course you might say well that's because Fox News's contributor but no this is news this is the truth is is the way these people that have\nThey they have they don't have the best interest of the United states it\nAt heart they don't and they cover for one another\nAnd this is an absolutely sickening thing from the national\nMedia and it's all the way down here on local media and I had the audacity to call out and then so and stellar and the rest of their ilk care and they don't like it but I don't care I'm going to continue to call you out you're a bunch of fraud you're not journalists hang it up right opinion pieces go ahead because that's all you while you're not journalists\nAnd people have ... I I have have\nUncovered the truth about you I'm not the only one that can see this and this is why when Donald Trump says from his bully pulpit fake news you know what\nMost of America Says yeah he's right it is fake news and that's a tragedy that's a tragedy because we should have a fourth of state we should have an unbiased or a watcher of both parties but we don't\nWe have we have this uh this this group that has invested\nIn one side of the argument I'm invested in it and this this NBC stories just prevent and I'm going to get to the department of justice next segment the last segment because something just happened to prove all the corruption that is going on then we're surrounded by Russia Trump stuff\nYou can't believe anything and the FBI audio Jay and I'm just here to tell you that is sad but it's true but it I'm gonna go to some callers Paul you're on the air go brother\nIs good program and I'm Still well above have sick over over here leaving stations you have two more like you are on the on local radio instead of losing the only good\nQuality but what I call about was I think these\nThese are these birds from from uh some people go I don't think it's it's his mind as do I think he's being influenced by his wife and his daughter to put up some of these things that you put it\nThat he put on the on the network I don't I don't think the flute playing and you know I think that was of a test to prove you have done the same thing\nI don't I don't know about that part I mean that's that's total speculation may may maybe you're I don't know but I I Know that Donald Trump us links from the hip again I said before and I'll say it again I I I mean some of it I Know is is to to get them off a\nKilter the media to get them you know as a friend put a chasing the or they're like mice and amazed just chasing the cheese\nSo he continues to get his policies through and what not they're not actually paying attention to what matters and I believe some of that is very strategic but then others of it honestly I'll just give you this is my opinion I I again I think like that tweet and the reason why it's so Calif some time to build\nIt because he demanded to brag a do shift human being he really is he's a a total Marshall says he believes about himself\nAnd he and and now in this sense I think it works for America because\nHe's a path himself to the American brand and it it has become if Trump succeeds America succeed and so in that regard I'll take it if that's if that if that's what it tastes fine I'll take that ah so that's where I'm coming from a lot of this when I see some of this behavior from him and I'm ... it's just so childish and ... certainly not prejudiced presidential but again\nI'm I understand some of the others is clearly because I mean he really is being assaulted daily with nothing but lies from the national media I mean it's unbelievable what this man has to endure ... if anything that was going on with our economy and and this nation as a whole was happening under President Obama I mean he is\nAnd and this nation as a whole was happening under President Obama I mean he has his ratings will probably be through the rough because his press would just be constantly how great everything it and they tried to tell us how great everything under Barry Obama even though it was awful\nBut that's because that's their narrative and that's the sad thing Paul we don't have an objective media we just don't it's just a it's the truth\nWell don't you tell us a long term goals of the meeting new people are women covering this takeover\nWell I think the long term goal of of many and the national media is globalism is is a is there is a is a total destruction and at a turning of the United states into a socialist slashed communist uh paradise because that's what they believe all of them are leftist all of them to a person\nA and that's what they believe in and they will not totally get rid of the constitution and have it as a maid in the image that they want it made him\nUm and that's that's a fight rub against an ideological war listen Paul thank you for your thoughts thank you for listening I I really appreciate your support and who knows maybe someday again I'll be on the air I'm Alex I Will get you as soon as we get back from the break after these messages\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nTaller I is there on his ...

life for very long time\nAnd this was during a period of time when you were making a pretty good career for yourself as a writer you or you've been married for a while right\nI've been married for Eighteen years and I have a son and the whole time I was still and you know I was a you know basically like a professional hipster right up you'd have published\nThis raise is going to be critically

um his not only a writer but a rock star he's a band the Neal Pollack invasion\nHas done a um a couple of albums and he's a little bit of everything but he did a lot of marijuana but no more\nHe was the author of a powerful piece about kicking the marijuana habit to questions and we'll get onto our calls Neal you a question number one is\nObviously you you wrote so beautifully frankly as the world's greatest living American writer um\nHe was so beautifully about what marijuana meant to you and how important it wants to you or it's obviously an empty place in your life where you no longer smoke and haven't for a year almost a year and have you filled up that empty place with something else\nWell you know I'm doing pretty much the same stuff I was doing when I was high I still I I go into the movies or watching TV and hanging out with my family reading books doing yoga or exercising walking my dog I've just do get sober\nAnd uh and in some ways it makes things a little more boring in some ways and in other ways it makes things a lot better because I'm able to be more ... more attentive spray\nYou you haven't you haven't replaced the marijuana was some other I'm just a stimulant or ... or\nI wouldn't I wouldn't say that I had a little I had a period after I quit a weed where I uh I was I was playing a lot of poker um\nStuff that is also addicted\nAnd I felt a little bank roll and then I lost the bank roll than I thought I was playing for free and some of that but I I had to back off of that because because that that kind of became all consuming as well I mean I had this big wide and twenty Seventeen because my mother died very suddenly\nThen I watched it happen and it was very traumatic and so the following nine months were just a you know I dealt with the group or did a lot of drugs\nAnd the way I did a lot of gambling and it just was not good and so yeah I was but once I sort of move poker into the background and I I'd say that I've replaced it with um\nYou know just a a filled up with books and movies and music and um you know other ... as as they say and in the twelve step program you know our circle activities things that that are are fun and healthy that don't have to do with your addiction\nAnd you have a is your son allies are you still fourteen he's fifty almost sixty he's sixteen okay because I think you've got a freshman up your website do\nOne thing about your website it says that the uh toward a the very end it says public loves cheese marijuana Boston terriers the Los Angeles Dodgers classic cinema and do you ah all of\nThat is true although I'm not doing the marijuana anymore um yeah I Know I I eat depression it up I don't have you know I I got to contact the guy who was doing that for me I'm I'm not I'm self promotion I'm good at it in some ways not so good at it now\nOh let's go to Robert in Naples, Florida Roberts you're on the Michael Mann that show with Neal Pollack\nDoing that my dad used to say the pork ... what branch tool\nBut I have been through a lot of friends of different kinds of ... alcohol affects\nFood wherever the case Las ... basic with animal what they told us some ... an hour non as a person that you have a personality disorder where you need something to make yourself strong one and in retrospect you're a strong all along and you didn't need to do that\nSo I don't think just to marijuana as a personality\nOr Neal yeah I mean that that's the thing about addiction right it's like it it emerges as a response to some sort of drama\nUh which create character flaws and then you try to fill the gaps with whatever the addictive substances and he mentioned do a whole list of them yeah alcohol drugs gambling sex eating shopping list goes on and\nSo yeah I mean that's an absolutely accurate a statement and I I don't think anyone who's ever I'm for drug addiction which would disagree with that\nLet's go to Steve in Louisville, Kentucky Steve you're on the show was Neal Pollack\nYeah Michael thanks for having me on so you just\nListening to talk it seems like we live a very weird life just just in different places\nUm I kinda wonder how many people are out there like us\nI'm certainly the years of consumption of marijuana or I can talk to the um you know what has it affected you know you mentioned it seemed like you were a little conflicted [noise] has to in order to help your life or in your life\nFor me you know I didn't have to avoid that I was trying to fill fill a marijuana we just kind of stumbled across to each other but certainly the creative aspect that may be a little bit more artistic side of the visuals side but I feel that\nIt's it's certainly a struggle and and my main question was what ... for the show was what finally made you quit\nYeah that's a good question and too aggressive thing you were saying it's like it just marijuana is kind of creeps up on you right it's not like I'm\nYou know heroin where your job if you get addicted very fast I'm so ... you can use it for a number of years it's sort of a low level gradually increases as for me that my moment of clarity can act ironically enough\nNow that the Dodgers are back in the world series actually can't ... the world series I ... I went to Los Angeles because I'd always dreamed of going all World Series game even though I didn't really have the resources to do it and I bought a ticket off about ... third party Web site before I did that I managed to get as high as I possibly could\nUm even though you know there's no reason why you need to get high and go to the world series but I needed to get hired to do everything and that was a special occasion so I got really high\nUm smoking the huge joint that has all this crystallized th all over like\nSmoking is a huge joins it has all this crystallized th all over like smoking weed with a stranger and it was an echo park I went to the stadium\nBombed out on my mind and the ticket didn't scan it was like I said it was fraudulent 'em and rather than deal with the situation rationally or started screaming at people and I was I got arrested that got it scored it\nOut of the stadium a security guard parking lot sobbing and it took a look at myself into a side view mirror of a car and I just saw this old man with Red River the eyes\nQuite well we're a baseball game and I just I I thought to myself this isn't good I Can't go on and so they quit that day but three weeks later I I kinda sunken and I'd like to laugh off\nCan Daniel more around ... can you be around other people who were getting high or use our would you go into the other room\nYou know who've lost jobs because of some you know fairly innocent and central activity we've lost privileges who have gone to jail\nOr that is\nThat is a you know there's a lot of justice associated with that but also you know I mean the ... is on going about it but there's another their medical benefits\nTo us at ... medical marijuana is a completely separate thing and yes medical benefits can be real medical benefits a quick word from relief factor this came in from Susan\nI suffer with pain all up and down my leg for Thirty years cattle from working out I was desperate and I ... to find something that would help that pain when I heard about the quick start\nProgram uh order lays loyal and help our whole free\nOkay you can be pain free to and for most people it starts working in a hurry no drugs at all just good healthy stuff like turmeric unwelcome fish oil most people feel the difference within five or six days and after three weeks which costs you only Nineteen Ninety five it's less than a dollar a day\nFor three little package that you take every day\nAfter three weeks in work so well really factor that the great majority of people over Seventy percent get more go to release factor dot com that is released factor dot com you have nothing to lose but your pain and the whole world's again\nAnd there are folks out here who say of Nancy Pelosi is not the next speaker of the house then they have the whole world to lose what's at stake we'll get to that coming up on them at ...

campaign for the alliance defending freedom\nAnd okay it's not good I'm Glad we're continuing because this is a great organization\nBut it's a terrific time to get involved\nBecause right now the alliance defending freedom is on a winning streak and the winning streak means a less government bullying less a bureaucracy trying to crack down on your own freedom of expression on your own religious liberty\nAnd I'm more respect for freedom of conscience which is among the most fundamental freedoms\nIf you celebrated with us when chief Calvin Cochran the fire chief of Atlanta\nWon more than a million dollar settlement from the city of Atlanta which has fired him for the horrible crime of a writing a book on his own time that he was using with his Christian a men's group study I I mean it's outrageous we do have\nFreedom of religion in the United states and never came easily it's always been difficult it's always needed to be defended it was needed to be fought for and right\nNow alliance defending freedom is mounting a profound defense look these lawyers a terrific their idealistic\nAnd they win go to Michael med dot com click on a banner was as alliance defending freedom\nIf you can give a hundred dollars today it becomes two hundred dollars and it makes a real difference this is to provide free legal services for people who are trying to defend religious liberty um\n[noise] it's an amazing causing it touches almost every significant issue\nA involving your freedom to take a stand or you can\nAlso called the alliance defending freedom told them toll free eight six six nine five four three three\nEight eight a here is a um breaking news and just released NBC News headline\nRepublicans\nPacing Democrats in early voting in key states NBC News fines the data suggest enthusiasm among early GOP voters that could put a dent in democratic hopes for a blue wave and the midterms\nIs the blue wave turning purple Republican affiliated voters have out pays democratic affiliated voters in early voting and seven closely watched states according to data provided by targets smart and independently analyzed by the NBC News data analytics slant\nGOP affiliated voters have surpassed democratic affiliated ones in early voting in Arizona the Senate race floor\nIn early voting in Arizona the Senate race Florida\nKeys Senate race and governor's race Georgia key governor's race Indiana key Senate race Montana key Senate race Tennessee in Texas the data show only in Nevada have democratic affiliated voters exceeded Republican affiliated voters so far in early voting according to the data\nThis is um [noise] this is pretty dramatic now look every one of those states except for Nevada\n... is a Republican say there's a state that the Trump carried some of them he carried out by a lot however he didn't necessarily do it was early voting but when you're talking about Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee in Texas [noise] those are all states that Trump carried\nAnd uh however\nHe these candidates in those states don't do do do better than Trump they just need to do as well and uh this would be very encouraging and it also brings up the point that when you read the generic polls nationally when they say well\nThe Democrats are have this big advantage in the generic poll the reasons that doesn't matter as much as you might think it would\nIt's the same reason it didn't matter ultimately that Hillary won the popular vote by more than three well three million votes but you know what that was all in California",

context it\nThe truth of the matter is an you've heard this a lot on this radio show but it's always worth repeating\nIt is a common lie is a misconception it's not just a misconception is a total distortion that most marriages or even half of marriages don't last anyway so you could get married before a baby and well then the baby no no it's true not all marriages last\nBut the majority do and particularly for four people today today people are getting married at\nMuch older age is an average American Woman\nNow has her first child woman who's going to have a child at age twenty seven that's still pretty young that's up from twenty two and Nineteen Seventy and one of the things that they're blaming for the out of wedlock birth rate is the fact that people spend longer in school but the ... the idea that\nYou're getting married at age thirty or age thirty one or age thirty five or aged forty\nThat's that doesn't mean that it's not valuable for your future children to be in a committed long term and chances are permanent relationship\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six the traditional progression of western life has been reversed says John ...\nWho teaches at Columbia University he says cohabiting partners are having children before getting married that's a long term trend across developing nations\nOkay the idea that they get married later find good glad to see that but what about all those couples and and we know this is couples who are cohabiting\nAre much less likely to last long term than couples that are actually married\nAnd there's a wealth of data that makes that clear let's go to Bob in Cleveland, Ohio Bob you're on the Michael ...\nI think instead of trying to go back to the cash that society we should uh\nTo these new trends and um find new ways of helping these kids succeed and I just want to say this you know back in you know maybe a hundred years ago uh you know the modality rates were so high\nThat often a parent would die in the child would or maybe you have to live with her grandma parents or relatives or other relatives show I think this can be done successfully as long as we are open minded and adapt to these transfers\nWhat does that mean I Know it sounds good and adapting to trends of it sounds very open minded and terrific but what does it mean\nI wouldn't say that we need government programs horse\nThat would that would a\nSpecifically be tailored to kids living in a single parent situation\nOkay what kind of programs are you thinking of you want the government to send babysitters you want to establish government day care centers\nI think the ... would be one way I think manners where you do you pay people professionals to go in and spend time with these ... these children and help them out\nIf you let me just mention something to you Bob\nI I understand that sounds very generous and very nice\nBut you know what there are some times families who are married to each other who are raising children sometimes multiple children and their financially press is it fair that people like that who are having a tough time financially with their own kids at home should have a bigger chunk taken out of their income\nTo provide for other people who may be struggling with only one\nTo provide for other people who may be struggling with only one parent\nOr you know you're going to hate this but uh I I I'm going to say this rich cut defense spending because it's just it's just not necessary and we should also raise taxes on the rich\nOK well of course when you say I'm going to hate this shelter you down but the idea that cutting defense spending is going to be an answer right now we are spending more on interest on the national debt\nThan we are on defense and in my opinion I think the and opinion most Americans the defense spending that we spend is the best investment we could possibly make\nAnd some of the very ambitious social programs in the worst one of the things that has happened in this country and it's been shown by a wealth of books and information a\nOkay I look I I think I think that's true\nAnd the idea that Farrakhan now that he's elderly and I believe he's in his eighties I'm sure he's in his eighties and ah he does not seem to have lost an ounce of his\nPassion but it's not a passion for anything constructive and if you are going to say and I would\nThat it's unacceptable to say that one ethnic group or one religious group is responsible for all of America's problems\nAnd they are enemies by definition\nEvent doesn't classify it was an anti Semite what would it take\nA we'll get back to that a quick word from relief factor this came in from somebody that I'm most you know that's pat in Los Angeles that would be ...\nBy assure you I

that show\nBy Michael thanks for taking my call again you better go\nUm so I just want to say uh there there's a difference of the impact of statements when they're coming from different group better disparaging other groups and what I mean as it has a history of white supremacy throughout the world for a long time\nAnd so ... in particular when you're looking at white versus black or white versus views you\nHave your money you have the United states for different places where you know blacks were\nOver centuries and centuries in generations um attacked in that way that hadn't been the case of a history of black supremacy on issues or on white people or something like that so there's different impact of that\nI I agree I agree and again I I think it's obviously\nMuch more serious if somebody in public office say\nIs that same something that his negatively racist then if somebody like Louis Farrakhan is saying is however I think people were right to challenge President Trump when he was a candidate for office about support he had received from David do\nBecause even though David Duke is a joke and a loser and a creep and a former klansmen and a former leader of the Nazi Party and all of the above\nA she she still it to to allow him to be associated in any way with someone respectable\nIs a very real problem and this brings us to Farrakhan\nBecause if you look at Farrakhan history of just a cop Khamenei anti American hatred of his own country the idea that he should be on stage as he was at a recent Franklin's funeral he was just a few seats away from a former president the United states Bill Clinton\nAnd I do not believe that Bill Clinton is anti Semitic in any way I don't believe he is a racist\nBut you you simply can't all of a sudden sale because Louis Farrakhan his old at this point and because he associates\nBut at this point and because he associates himself\nWith um with with black people on as a representative of black people than anything that he says that is filled with racial hatred and its racial hatred by way against white people in general and it's still toxic instill deserves some kind of sanction go ahead like yeah I\nI understand that Michael connected one more point go okay\nSo my point is that where this is coming from where they misled or in my opinion a a black people who are you know very hatred of their have all of a wide where it's coming from ... is a kind of a revolution are fighting back about what happened\nTo them at the people over time whereas the other direction when it was the Nazis or whomever it wouldn't have packing people not because they did anything to them they made off\nAnd spirit area than made up that these people were doing stuff again that ... it really\nOkay I look I I understand but if you're talking about this goes into the for instance hatred of Turks against Armenians and the Turkish genocide against Armenian\nOne of the justifications for that genocide which was real and it happened and and also make knowledge or directly so the Armenian people work rules the Turks and they were undermining as it doesn't matter\nIf you were going to express irresponsible hatred toward any group based upon ethnicity or religious faith and there ought to be sanctioned and that doesn't mean that you ought to be shut down by the government but it means that respectable people",
