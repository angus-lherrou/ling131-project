his whole it illegal immigration debate it doesn't matter if they committed mass shootings they murdered innocent Americans so it's like the argument that people make and I was going to make this Geraldo Rivera and some of the others does\nIt and I don't even think it's true the percentage of illegals he won't admit their legal she calls them undocumented who commit crimes or even less than an American native born Americans so what\nIf they commit one crime in the here illegally one murder like Kate Steinle he would go on and on that and that's one that wouldn't have been committed if they weren't allowed to enter the country that is a crazy argument that's kind of thing President Obama would do you set up a straw dummy\nIt doesn't matter if the percentages of same they shouldn't be here ... those people would be alive like that girl can't think of her name and Iowa also named Hisham resources\nAre better than I can be here who are committing crimes rather than people who are here legally committed a crime\nYou spend the resources on anybody who commit crimes yeah Molly tip it's what's her name but with all due respect ban it's a phony arguments so maybe they didn't do it you know a mass shooting what what is your point there\nIt doesn't make any sense they shouldn't be here the first place and I said it gave me a great segue but I Want to go to Karen and no Claire

here legally as one caller pointed out\nWhich one of those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone illegal aliens so you have to term undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss place them somewhere or lost them\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here legally the argument might be quickly over if there are legal they're not allowed to be here and a story\nIf you own a home and if someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in\nThey wouldn't be able to say they belonged in your home but they just lack the proper documents similarly if someone walked into your bank and wants to take the money out of your account they would be asked to prove that it is their account if they said it was there a town but they just didn't have the documents to prove it the banks would not permit them access\nWhich is why so ludicrous for the left to use the

went to work got minimum wage\nAnd Illinois here it turns out he could have been getting instead of the eight dollars nine dollars an hour minimum wage\nHe could have been getting a point to about twenty to forty if he would have taken all the benefits for welfare [noise]\nI Would propose that why don't we know that not welfare down\nTo where it's a forty hour week minimum wage pay check you spend it on on just spend it on cars whatever that takes care of the welfare side but those people who are more fair who want more money and go get a job be picking fruit out of them out of the\nOrchards or what have you\nAnd actually have the potential of earning more than minimum wage\nMakes perfect sense that's a good idea and we think his son for a service let's go to rose in

ancestors came by to talk about it Alice island they would never carried flex from their home countries they were seeking freedom they were ... sneaking a new life\nThe whole point and it's so discouraging when they come here they bring a lot of the same culture in terms of even voting for people like try to get away from that got away from governments we try to tell them what to do with their lives and they both the same thing when they get here let's go to Paul in Littleton, Colorado Paul you're on was mark\nHey mark thanks for taking my call Sean hey I wanted to follow\nUp on your comment earlier about ah the term illegal alien a button and a different a vein or you know the advocates of amnesty and\nHigh levels of immigration of always described the illegal alien population is one made up of otherwise law abiding people who've done nothing more than cross the border illegally mhm\nWell the reality is is that they're coming here for jobs in order to find a job they gotta fill out an eye on foreign and when they do that and say they are here legally to commit perjury which is a felony\nOr the other thing is is that they routinely make up Social Security numbers ... or ... somewhat Social Security numbers a separate Immigration Studies suggest that about Seventy five percent of the illegal aliens are here\nTo work uh have been violating these laws\nBut nobody ever mentions it and they're not otherwise law abiding it's simple you know\nMy daughter was actually a victim of a I D theft by illegal alien using her Social Security number which were stolen which was a child\nMhm so uh I don't know why the conservatives Republicans don't push back on this whole illegal thing oh by by describing what's happening here in internally when people come into work [noise]\nYeah just a one one of the many problems with this whole thing it just seems obvious to me\nThere's got to be an orderly procedure that how someone gets into a country we call that legal immigration you have a plan that makes sense you give the opportunity to to the people you want to give the opportunity to\nIt seems so obvious to me and that's why you have to have when the language war because otherwise they put it in terms of ripping babies away from immigrant children and having immigrants always been a terrific a boost to the United states from er yeah legal immigrants but you changed the language let's go to Rick in the Bronx ...

a huge game at Iowa City this weekend between northwestern in Iowa go hawk or yeah [laughter]\nSo it is a fun time of year it is just been so much horrible news of course with the [noise]\nThe shooting a at the synagogue it turns out that you have to be I Believe the worst anti Semitic or\nViolent incident in this country's history a it is it is absolutely is\nAnd and um we do want to mention ray mentioned that in the headlines that tonight there is a vigil at the Jewish community center it's a candlelight vigil this would be a multi faith prayer vigil at seven o'clock at the Jaycee see\nAh the Jewish Federation of southern Arizona the Jewish Tucson Jewish community center synagogues in community Jewish agencies are hosting the vigil we just had this rat it's been a real bad couple a days for these horrible instance John ...\nWell it's been a bad period of time you know um\nWe've we've had it on both sides and uh I'm not blaming anybody but you know we had Steve ... a shot a last year on a baseball field where they uh\nThe shooter came in and tried to shoot up the entire Republican congressional caucus on the baseball field\nI'm a I don't blame anybody for that except the shooter um I don't I I\nI think we've had a lot of things a lot of things have gone unreported\nOf that is that the press has not picked up on the last couple of weeks we've had several Republican congressional offices local offices or\nA trash boulders throat thrown to their windows uh locally here no across the country to country and the press doesn't pick up on those but uh it's on both sides\nUh we've got wackos\nI'm Out there and it needs to stop\nAh people ah people need to um get real this is a free country violence has no place in the political process I just finished watching a documentary by Ken Burns and the Vietnam War\nAnd um you know there was a lot of hatred in the streets but it didn't turn into general a political violence except on the part of\nA couple of just a couple of real wackos a bomb some post offices and thing the weatherman or whether mine my underground yeah um but this needs to stop and um\nWe need to come together recognize that we have a chance for an election here people need to get on with the election\nWe'll come back it is the political face off John monitoring jak Rogers with me in Studio the face of presented by most gallery and find\nFraming for law and dodge Adriana has been waiting seven nine zero twenty forty go ahead Adriana\n[noise] thank you bail okay so I was just like to say so that incident with this person that commit a crime I thought that it is in general is just said that all of us are labeled that way to label us as criminals and someone that wind that we are Americans are okay and then the party so\nUm I don't think anyone Leming every one\nWe're just saying that there's a toxic political atmosphere that's one thing that John and I can agree on here that we have a very toxic political atmosphere I assess the blame a little differently than John does as to how we got here but uh that I think it's the atmosphere that's leading these kind of people who used to stay under their rocks to come out and uh and and and\nYou have a few are doing that but you can't so I hear your rhetoric oh we're in American I'm going to marry ... okay I follow the law I paid a lot I ... that the constitution as an all\nYou guys had no message OK but hate envy\nAlright Adriana than Louis oh okay I'm going to move along\nGreg is with us seven nine zero twenty forty hello Greg\nGood morning or good afternoon bill and John and Jeff I Jeff you mentioned so please allow me to finish and then I Do don't interrupt you said a global as does a code word for Jews a vet so ludicrous that's ridiculous and I come from a Jewish background and\nThere's been no better friend to Israel\nA says George Washington than Donald Trump if you if you want to you know just as Benjamin Netanyahu\nAnd we know about Iraq Obama's past we know about the river right when Reverend Wright was condemning America and and his association with Farrakhan\nNow here's what's interesting is well the news wants to take us over here the media wants to look over here at a there was some powder scent to all these congresspeople and supposedly a pipe bomb and the tragedy of course that happened over the weekend in in Pittsburgh but here's what we're not looking at\nSheryl Sheryl kissing\nFormer CBS News reporter was doing stories during the Obama administration\nWhich are unkind honest but they didn't like it so they were getting into her computer and that's not a conspiracy theory was their she'd get own flowers will delete it so she presently as a lawsuit against that wonderful attorney general Eric Holder who's responsible to Justice Department of for for doing that\nOkay I'm not sure go ahead All right Jeff do you want to respond to a caller Greg well what\nSeeing today is unprecedented in American history we've never had this kind of toxic political atmosphere and it needs to change and ... and and the only way it can changes is two fold one Democrats need to win big on next Tuesday a hand the president needs to get its act together\nUm and the people surrounding the president and he does need to basically rain him in and make them behave if they can if they're capable of doing that and if they have the spine to do it\nAnd I've seen a whole lot of evidence of but that has to start at the top he has to quit being so toxic and quit uh having these rallies where where he encourages violence and and the misbehavior\nOf you know I I'm Sorry once again I listen to his rallies he isn't there is nothing\nNothing Jeff and I listen to all of them there's nothing he said that encourages any violence he has been most conciliatory he is not sending out the tweets that he used to send out he's much more a presidential in the last year\nAre you guys you guys just refuse to accepting has to accept him as your president because you were expecting don't put crooked Hillary into office even though she had she was what started this whole thing\nIs that Hillary Clinton\nBroke the law repeatedly\nAnd got away with it because the swamp the insiders in in Washington refused a prosecutor because they thought she was going to be president and that outrages me and it outrageous a bunch of other people but I Will tell you\nThat until you people except Donald Trump as the duly elected president and get over your resistance\nAnd and move on you can't you can't live off of making up code words that you think is a code word and nobody else does our that's just more hey Jeff everybody agrees with no I don't I don't agree with that\nAre already agreed let's move on to the election that's coming up we have or early voting ending actually a Wednesday is the deadline Jeff how do you think the Democrats are going to do [noise]\nState wider yet they white and nationwide statewide I think we've got a chance to pick up a few statewide positions I'm not optimistic for her she is chances to take the governorship he's made some huge enforced errors or in his candidacy and uh I'm very disappointed with with the campaign that he's running the mistakes that he's made\nSo I don't think we're going to get that I think Kirsten Sinema has a good chance to win\nThe election of for the Senate position I think it'll still be close could go either way but I I'd say right now she has the edge over mix Sally Kirkpatrick when you're afternoons easily I'm sure of\n'em out Halloran wins the CD one\nCD one year and a and I think will do well in the state house and the state Senate I don't know if we're uh on the verge of capturing the majority of either one I think we have a slight chance to maybe in the Senate House probably not so much nationwide I think we probably do see a bit of a blue wave and we take the house of representatives\nOr the Senate map is is a little daunting for us I just can't see how we can overcome\nThe number of seats were defending in so many red states will be lucky to hold a the edge that we are the the margin we've got right now will be very lucky to hold on to that and probably need send them to win and uh and and the Nevada Senate race we need to pick that one up\nA probably to to even stay where we're at what do you think John well I think that Republicans do better than had been advertising\nOh absolutely or we're going to pick up one two three seats and the Senate um we're going to a uh it's going to be very tight in the house typically are the Democrats would pick up and this type of race just enough seats just an\nAverage election year in her mid term to win a majority in the house it\nWill not be a blue wave it'll be a typical uh election mid term election it's going to come down to one to three seats in the house as to who wins um\nI I think whoever wins the house is going to be almost a incapable of doing anything much\nUm if the Democrats win they will hold a a a investigations are if this if the Republicans hold the Senate which they will uh they will be doing investigations from the other side nobody I'll be able to do much I'm\nSo not much gets done in the next two years\nI don't think much gets done I think the good news is Donald Trump from my perspective Donald Trump has done so much already uh that uh we're we're fairly happy with the status quo but the blue wave is gone it won't be a blue wave it'll be a pretty average election both sides are motivated\nAt in terms of the local Arizona races I agree with Jeff that uh that the governor a doozy will win that election\nI agree that uh that the Senate race between curse in cinema and mix Sally is very tight I saw pulled a day that had those CBS or a poll that said that um [noise]\nA nine hundred and eighty to voters that said send them I was up by two percent\nSo it's within the margin of hair I have a four and a half point margin All right guys in the remaining too I think Halloran oh Halloran will lose okay there's your production there that turn for colonel Rogers are winning according to John monger alright a quick comment on what happened\nIn Brazil with the election of the populist\nA far right candidate Geoff what's going on around the world with this there is a resurgence of a populist there isn't it a kind of a nationalism and populism that we're seeing a particularly in Eastern Europe the former Soviet Bloc countries are rejecting democracy and and and pluralism\nWe're seeing that in South America as well um and ah this this guy from in Brazil is going to be dangerous I mean he is homophobic\nHe's ... years ago he is he's he's he's a he's going to be a dangerous talking about starting a straight as the way to start at ... well he he are the ad hominem attack a admit error we got a honey admits these things no he ... he admits he sanctioned ran on them\nSo you know that that's the truth is hard to take some ... and John your take on the ... of people\nAre not rejecting democracy what they are rejecting as bureaucratic control in the case of Europe from the you\nThey don't want the the bureaucrats and he you are running\nA running what's happening in Czechoslovakia or hungry check the Czech Republic or Slovak uh Slovak Republic they don't want the you running what's going on in Hungary\nAbsolutely yes and that's another thing that puts it in the suspicious category the legislature has begun something that the best way to call it is a zero tolerance campaign about these a citizen based initiatives\nWhat they said is that you can make absolutely no errors on that partition form so that person carrying that petition\nForgets to put their own ZIP Code say\nThat means the entire position as a petition every single image signature his thrown out if they even put the wrong ZIP Code the same thing can happen as for individual voters and I'm not kidding about this is if you haven't been\nSigning any petition slightly you might not know this but if\nYour name leaks out of the two lines of supposed to be between if you have a G. or why do you go below the line they can throughout that signature for that reason so the whole idea is to make it as difficult as possible and it's pretty clear why\nThe legislature and put on initiatives very easily just for by a blow to the legislature\nBut when people do it will listen to what's going on this year you can vote this year 'cause it made it on the ballot to limit\nPrivate school vouchers\nThat's not something that the legislature and the governor wants there for more private school vouchers\nYou could vote this year to increase the use of clean energy over the years that will hit a point where we have to use a certain amount of clean energy that that would be the law once again\nThe legislature and the governor or against those why did they want these things to happen was invested in head we just talked about that being thrown out and another one with the thrown out that they really hate is out ... dark money dark money though it goes to both parties to some extent those the vast majority\nTo Republicans so they would rather not have these initiatives to they can stop it with the legislation that zero tolerance legislation and then if the Supreme Court\nAdopts also is zero tolerance policy which means there can't be anything wrong with the way it's word of the way it's written the slightest bit of problem with the opposition the people who said it should be on the two people on the Supreme Court said that they said\nOf course they don't have it perfectly that's not the point of these have got to be close and then the rest of it can be argued by uh the voters and by the people who are campaigning for so it's a it's a very difficult position as a a hard time for citizen initiatives\nAnd I think either going to be less of them or they're going to have to have more money

Pima County ... the chairman is with me I I Want to outlive start on the statewide a chef for\nA and the the first one is prop one twenty five and this proposition is to fix\n'em some problems within the retirement system and to make sure\nThat we're not on some some of the more antiquated a pension plans like we've been passed it'll actually save\nTwo hundred and Seventy five million dollars as well as a a correct some problems in a in a in a prior a in a ration of for this so odd David worry Adam well\nFrom what I the information I have this returns a proposed pension reform back to the legislature ride or for a needed a amendment a\nAnd a lot of people are talking about this should be a yes I'm a the Pima County GOP committee\nA mat on all the propositions and this'll be the first one to talk about our recommendation and there was a there was a what a kind of a split decision on this one\nUh and and some discomfort over the fact that the legislature has inserted themselves are into this one in originally started out being just for the corrections officers I Believe\nUh and so um we took a no position on this not not not no a and that as the tension of a position to make that clear and enter a stain on the sidelines on this ... what do you think\nWell I'm actually for it I I think that we do need this reform to take place and ... according to to the state to the secretary of state's office or they say yes phone will allow the state to adjust certain benefits for correction officer retirees and elected official retirees in order to provide\nFreighter financial stability in the pension system that is that I I think that as a compelling reason to vote yes on this I understand that fair that there is a you know some talk uh in the other direction a but myself personally I encourage people\nDirection a but myself personally uh I encourage people to vote yes on prop one twenty five and this would be a reform and the savings I think overall to the to the pension or a sister we haven't and if you know in other states\nThe biggest problems they have are with other than Russia engine planes that are just ballooning and and they don't have the funds that\nThey don't have the funds to support them and their bankrupting some stare at ...\nAll right let's move to prop one twenty six this is a proposition that would prohibit the taxation of any service that was not taxed as of December thirty first twenty Seventeen\nSo there is a group or who is in favor of taxing they're called Democrats they're called left us\nAnd they decided that they wanted to put a tax for example on things like if you sell your home ... okay uh the real estate commission would be subject to taxation\nThere's all kinds of things that are ... services mainly that are not currently tax or that they want to tax this is a direct cost the taxpayers are aggressive tax uh and and really it is one that should be a no brainer\nA about about voting um uh yes to prohibit any new taxes are on on the citizens\nOf Arizona David where do you come into well here's where we come in on that one um there's a there's an opposite of argument to be made on this one verse that about a\nTax policy at the ballot box or as opposed to in the legislature\nUh and and uh some of the lead legislate tours in particular are are recommending a no vote on this because they they feel very strongly that tax policy should be\nA uh in the area or in the arena of the legislature and not not a direct voted visitors' centers and the ...\nUh so so that that\nYes yang and yang on yes no on this thing also caused the Pima County executive committee to abstain on this one\nHigh so the top one twenty six would amend the constitution to prohibit\nAh this state in any city town countered other political subdivision of the state from opposing new\nOr increasing existing transaction base fees assessments her tax\nIncluding a transaction privileged tax on any service service or right and and that's where I come in on the effect of a decision maker for you\nYou know that to me that was the no brainer I felt that that so so I'm baton to for to yeah and it just shows the people who who have like minded opinions on a whole bunch of different things\nYou do have different opinions on ... and I and I get that part because of pop\nOne twenty seven which we can talk about now is something that are in just a second is something that absolutely uh you know we should not be a imposing constitutional requirements to to use certain energy a you know a sources in the future and kind of locked us than\nWhat what one twenty six I I feel does\nIs it it is that keeps us from from\nThis kind of a huge tax that could be imposed upon service people around the state even in my own industry or this will be a huge impact because I'd have to charge or a ... a you know attacks on property management services all of our customers would be impacted by all of our winters as well and I guess at\nFirst to get that are quite well but there is no movement to do this right now and I think that's another argument that has been made a to vote no on this says it's if it's if preemptive is to make sure that ... something like that doesn't happen\nAnd if you fall and we certainly have seen city of Tucson was some of their tactics trying to increase taxes in trying to\nI think the role on on the state of Arizona and and again my feeling is\nA this is this is a tax that is something that we should not do here in the state of Arizona friends if you have a your opinions on it let us know Raul ears okay we're going to go on to prop one twenty seven were probably you know we're going to go to the break you're in a in a in about three minutes or so so we'll we'll discuss on both sides of the break\nUh where do you ... where do you stand on this personally David I Am down to where we go into the\nBreak on this one on the ... this one is absolutely a no brainer\nThat this is a no uh and I haven't ...\nHell no I don't know why the hell no this is a hell no\nUh you know this is a the toms dire a initiative to mandate in the constitution\nOr that we go to a uh what what he calls clean energy but that doesn't include the cleanest energy which is which is Atomic Energy which has nuclear\nUh and it's going to it's going to shut down or yeah or the you know our our verdict ... shut it down or you know this this is a hell no this is ... out of our state uh and get this crazy California idea out of our state\nOr in his imposition of of what California did they want to impose that upon us for that yeah I I suddenly it's not they is Tom style right you know he's up with the state of California centrally they passes I mean they did a concert and and that but all of them and their energy prices have risen three times so\nAnd I want to talk about that for for just half a second uh we have a house or over in California uh our bill a for electricity\nOur home there which is a fraction of the size of our home here in Tucson was Eighteen hundred dollars each month in July and August of this year\nAnd this is this is all baked into this problem that that comes as a result of prop one twenty seven Eighteen hundred dollars a month Eighteen hundred dollars and because what they do is they've also they've ratcheted around demand\nA and and you know what they charge when they charge at so you know they force people for example you know to prepare meals earlier in the day okay they don't want you know all of these all of us demand all the demand coming up one time but if you kept pal averting in fact I I Would say\nThat a candidate should uh goes through the process of qualifying for clean election funds\nAre then gets their money uh depending upon the race you know it's twenty five thousand forty five thousand what whatever it is depending upon the race and then when the races over\nIf if they've lost say they have to do something with their unused funds and instead of requiring the candidate to return the unused funds to the state there was a provision that they could give it to their their favorite political party\nSo there are political parties out there we wonder who they might have been that ah that would run a a whole slew of candidates\nQualify them for clean election funds those candidates within losing the primary uh and then they'd give their money to the Democratic party\nAnd this is happening right here in twenty Eighteen in this election and in in the prior campaigns as well and twenty sixteen and twenty fourteen right exactly so this was stopped at ... ... and it's an abusive and of course you know frankly clean elections was one of the stupid things\nThat Republicans a fought for along with you know McCain fined gold and some of the other unconstitutional things have limit\nA free speech clean elections a as a commission\nIs almost on accountable to anybody with respect to how they run it and and this is something that I think needs to be a yes vote and would you know we're an absolutely and and the ... years yes on this was All right\nSo let's let's go I Want to talk about um [noise]\nWe're talking about the city propositions first\nAh and then we'll go to county and we'll be quick about this city propositions one is to correct term it shouldn't be the election cycles so that um [noise] our city elections will be income four minutes with the with the state elections on an even years\nRight and that's for a weight that that ... and it it like you said a lines are city elections with state elections\nOr in a push them on the even year cycle and so the odd yes that's a yes right and and it also extends a they exist in terms of of current or how it was a practical matter what you have if you have to do it to get on this cycle\nAnd of course for some people say don't extend those gas terms for any reason but you got to do it but you have to do that you're going to have to do it to get it on the cycle and and that's a yes like I lost one that I write\nFor oh seven it's also a city or a proposition with respect to parks and recreation improvements\nYeah and ah parks and green ways and connections are and in our our our group the payment GOP\nUh and and our our our group the Pima GOP executive committee looked at this one pretty carefully there were some people on the committee that were quite familiar with it and we're uncomfortable uh with uh the way the city or\nCould handle money and do maybe what they wanted to do versus what people were expecting this to do so we came out with the no on this one right I think\nWell well founded to know on on a top a four oh sell seven um we got about two minutes for sixty three this is the county um bonds I'm\nI'm a now on four sixty three I'm my feeling is uh they just respect us ah and and this is not something that we want to ah to to uh give the county more power to to to do these roads and and to do all the things is that they want to do your your opinion\nWell the ... the county or took on a no position on this so and ...\nUh and this one is is one that has caused a quite a bit of a reaction from some quarters or two are taking a an uh an abstention on this one and and basically what we had done in our committee meeting was we went into the whole process\nWe went into the whole process with an agreement that if we if we couldn't agree a hundred percent on any of these propositions we would take no position\nBecause in the county committee to go out and say this is the committee's\nA position we wanted it to be unanimous or and on for sixty three uh we were not unanimous and uh I felt quite strongly and I've I'm In in the record book on this uh we've been in the ... ah I've written a position paper on it is out there in the public\nI felt very strongly that are two top\nCounty officials who deal with this who will deal with this issue\nA alley Miller and Steve crusty are on opposite ends on this for on this proposition\nA one of the yes and one reason though and this is a proposition involving the board of supervisors and the county and there are top elected officials in this county we have no higher officials in the Republican Party then are to be o s a super are two supervisors\nAnd so uh I feel very strongly that the county could not take a position\nThat would be in opposition\nTo one of our highest leaders either yes or no we were going to wind up being an opposition to one of our borders to prevent\n... she was in a very difficult position I don't fault him for for being in favor of four sixty three uh on on this particular proposition ah but I I agree with our emailer I agree with a lot of people who who wants to send a message to the county board of supervisors to the administration\nUh and and I am not going to vote yes on four sixty three I'm a no vote on it how we'll be right back with more stuff on propositions and hopefully our gas\nOutside waiting for us in a

you can call in one eighth Prager seven seven six\nTalking about the caravan\nAnd other matters\nAnd ... and the uh the end of the last hour I raised it at a uh an interesting question\nAnd now that you can call in I can pursue it I had this experience with my wife was shopping for an SUV first time I've always just driven a car\nAnd anyway\nShopping for an SUV and I am very rarely shop for cars because for much of my the last decades I've been driving cars of advertisers which\nEventually they they sold their businesses in any way whatever it is it I'm now as we're having a new experience to having had in a while ago in the car dealers and I don't want to give car dealers the business I Want to do was buy into another one I Want to do with the car dealers\nLet me give them the business but it was it was really fascinating everybody was nice I mean all the sales people were nice it's not an issue there almost all young men with whom I took test drugs I think in every instance of five I think for four or five five were young men\nBut the thing that got my wife and me was any question I mean ... any question that I asked was clear they didn't have an answer and they said with no embarrassment I'll look it up oh let me let me this look that up\nSo uh as I said at the end I think that if this is an old representative and it may not be like fully acknowledge that but if it is it all representative\nThere were two things that immediately strike me and one is that the idea that you should know as much as possible even about a product you're selling has has not registered\nBecause hey I could look it up why why do I have to know if that SUV can come in all wheel drive why would I have to know the lines of the of that SUV versus the other one it's like oh I could always look it up and the other is in general knowledge may not be valued\nWhy do you need to know anything if you could just pull out a little smartphones from your pocket and find out all you need to know\n\nThis is now if you feel that my general generalization is not valid or you do I'm very curious\nWritten I land the plane to sharing the ... we need to crack down on drug cartel well

and says he's homeless and demands to live in your living room you have a right to shut the door and use whatever forces required to stop someone for staying in your house and eating your food against

let me just make his point it\nSeems to me that they win if they get in and the wind if they don't get in\nBecause if they oh good I Hope you're right I there's no little those times I pray you're

welcome\nThanks and good to see good to have you we had this incredibly wet Sunday out in a ... to a surprise uh got a hailstorm and then another hail storm and then it just kept raining and raining and raining so\nThat all afternoon covering that it was not exactly a relaxing weekend but it was certainly I'm welcome wet because we certainly need that\nMy clients are the happiest said [laughter]\nI'm I'm happy ... as as a as a gardener I'm happy as a a real estate investor and property we hate brain but if it's been it's been nice to have a little bit of diversity of breaking up the hot weather\nIt was it was good uh we lived in uh we live in a neighborhood that slope to and so the water was rushing by and it was brown and I told my wife there there goes everybody's front yards\nA right down to to the wash and the wash behind our house running very very heavy it was a quite something and uh here we have now a print media we have kind of leveled the playing field with the TV people because we can go live on Facebook or YouTube and\nPut it out there as it's happening to people and so I was out a all afternoon doing some of that you can find that a necessity to sun Facebook\nPage and you know that's a cool thing it is I'll bet you as as things go a long that's going to be a significantly greater importance to to what you guys do particularly in small community kind of publications such as the one you have\n... and they are awesome it's very easy to do you know what you go out with your phone and you can instantly do whatever you want and actually we really use this\nEr during the a teacher walkout or because there are lots of protests and uh you know you get someone who can string a couple of sentences together put him on live that's the scary part because it's all live if you drop your camera or you you know or don't have the right way or something like I say something yeah and [laughter]\nAnd I've done all of the above but it's more it's\nMore than that which is exciting as someone who also loves print media or you've got face it puts you off with Twitter you've got other ways to immediately connect\nA ... keeps that great you still have I Believe in most print media objective reporting which is becoming unfortunately more of a rarity but it's terrific However I'm I'm thinking when I read all this stuff for you guys now having to work twenty four seven\nWell you know we like to think that we always were doing that but before when the press would roll you just kind of take a breather because you know you can't do anything again until the next time the press roles but now\nIt is it is constant and ah so this uh this this is a good thing particularly for a small community like ours in which you said something very interesting because lots of people have those cameras and they're putting video out there but they're also putting out\nInformation that hasn't been verified guy because you know you can be at one house and it's like everything's fallen down in the ... coming through the roof and\nUh you know the world's about to end in in the next house over it's a Snuggie warm and no problems but if you present that picture\nA then people start panicking so we actually even when we're doing the lives stuff we're calling people were verifying information and and getting it out so so I think in that way the news media are still relied upon to actually be the ones who have access to those who know the answers\nThis is bill Buckmaster green things has been the place for all things green for the Buckmaster

... gallery dot com and of course you can find them on Facebook and venture editor of the green valley news and so the sun sitting in for Bill and they've caught us in the middle of the uh Monday political face off with Dr Don Jorgensen and Bruce and\nBruce someone to go back and revisit a comment you made just before the break you were talking about candidates and energy and just in a I'm more of a thirty thousand view a of that topic what what do you mean by energy and do we have it in the sea due to race with Ann Kirkpatrick and illegal markets Peterson\nOne will think I don't think either of the candidates are what I recall outstanding personalities\nUm and and they're just they're there's been a certain critique we've spent so much time maybe this is where I was coming out of from the beginning to\nThere's been so much talk about US Senate and governor I think that there's kind of voter fatigue or an donor fatigue a you know all you know all through Republican ranks anyway Don might be able to speak or specifically on the Democratic side\nUh but um they just didn't seem to be a whole lot of intensity about this and you know the feeling was that Martha was a very difficult person to replace for for a Republican standpoint\n[noise] well I think from the Republican standpoint that's true and looking at energy a ... and ... and her Patrick ... we have to think about that how do we see that energy\nAh in our first that goes to TV ad so those are ads so it's about how the candidate comes across when they come across and they're not attack at some of the other side whichever side\nThe other than is what you're seeing in the community and the energy that has been demonstrated on the Democratic side really comes out of the volunteers and the waves that every day let alone weekends are knocking on doors and making calls\nThen you also see the candidate in public at many events are pretty much ... anywhere and everywhere and again there's evidence of that as we were talking earlier about the social media there's evidence of bad everywhere and I think that is where you see a difference even though\nA Bruce doesn't believe and Kirkpatrick is the most exciting person and that's fine or she is one of the most energetic in terms of being everywhere being out in the community getting to know people talking about the issues publicly uh malaria is going to have a number of volunteers or ... yes but as we are talking at the record campaign is right\nOf volunteers or ... yes but as we're talking at the record campaign is very different and that's where I think Anne's experience and in an enthusiasm shows through and for a novice like Marquez Peterson is she really has been captured that it\nWill end unfortunately layer hasn't she hasn't been able to communicate that she would be a very effective congresswoman I don't think there's anybody that questions that she would serve the community well she's kind of you know right in the middle of things she's not too far the righteous not too far in the lab\nShe has tied herself to Trump on many many issues so I don't think you can say that\nOh well you you can say that I'm I'm telling you from from the standpoint of of you know following her for Republican standpoint she really has tied herself that closely to the president\nDone you talked earlier about individual donations and ah that they are up as far as the Democrats goes that accurate\nVery much okay and can is there any way to determine whether a lot of those are first time donors to two elections are we are we dragging in or drawing in people who are kinda new to this whole game or because it's a mid term a President Trump frankly um has definitely raised interest\nOr are we seeing new blood involved in politics\nI I think it's fair to assume that just because of the numbers when you look at the campaigns and in previous years to today just the volume of donations at the lower levels twenty five dollar donation fifty dollar donations\nThere are many more of those in aggregate looking at the campaigns like a Christian sentiments campaigning Kirkpatrick says we're talking about\nAh you see those numbers from individual donations which are higher than previously or the money coming from outside is a little bit higher on the Democratic side than in previous\nElections but not significantly so so I think you can assume realistically that there is an increase in that's a the reaction to Trump or because this is in part a referendum on on the president as all midterms are\nAnd it is again the additional avenue other than casting one vote for displaying support for candidate and the policies on the left\nSo Bruce it means something when people attach money to their support are we seeing an uptick in a GOP donors or\nDo you must you must not be reading the newspaper orange the collective twenty six point two million dollars last month and gifts almost all of a small a small donor gifts or the president um excuse me and the arts here in this cycle is now over two hundred million dollars that's almost double\nThe highest amount of the ... had ever raised in a in a similar\nPresidential or a a mid term\nAnd further during all the same period of time or the president has raised over a hundred and five million dollars a tortillas twenty twenty reelection a friend of mine who says well I don't know if it comes to run for reelection trust oh he's running for reelection he'll activity he loves every second of what he's doing and and they're going to have a ton of money going into that to be\nDragged out of office kicking and screaming no matter which way it goes but uh in in partial agreement with Bruce who's point a yes the Republican numbers are up the Democrat numbers are even higher but overall this year's election has broken records for\nA fund raising in donations and and the amount spent on national elections I Believe it's the first time it's gone over one billion dollars\nSo I guess I was one thing that everybody can credit President Trump for and that is there's a heightened interest in a poll intensity absolutely sure absolutely we are going to go to the book master show live lion and we have Greg on the line from Tucson Greg you there\nAnd then I'm Glad you brought that up because it's exciting for the for the thought that was especially those of us who are fond of Donald Trump because I think it does spark interest in folks are thinking of getting into government I remember living in Minnesota at the time that ... tour around and successful in order for governor\nBecause he stood out from the the other two are sort of like lifetime\nA candidate for office and it was Jesse ... willing to do things for the people but I have a question about this current campaign\nWhere I see what I what I Would call slime are being thrown at ... or ... cinema and of course the announcement at the end of the spot is that it's not coming from Shelly but if she felt\nLike they were too many inaccuracies into which filth could she stopped those ads from running in terms of what they're alleging about cinema\nBruce let's go ahead and have you answer that and technically uh no she's not allowed to collaborate with these ah packs correct\nYeah but the simple answer is is that any reply from the candidate and this is certainly come up with plenty of times for Greg any effort to to halt those ads this is considered coordination technically a violation of if you see a regulation\nHowever to his point if she were to make it clear Don that she or mark mix Sally someone did not want this stuff to happen it would and wouldn't it absolutely all she'd have to do is come\nOut not even with a press conference so that would be great you should come out on Twitter she could make a statement from the campaign denouncing that adds she hasn't done that in fact in many cases she has participated in the smear campaigns against well neither of them has\nTo be fair here I mean there's an awful lot of mud being thrown out there and I don't see anybody coming out and saying gosh let's stop it no\nBut again you have a case here where mix valley actually accused ... of treason well Schatz outrage well she ... she actually said those things gone that's no she didn't say the things that was the ... border talking to her saying it and she said whatever and\nYou know what she had an opportunity to back office ... uh inter Arizona Republic interview and she refused to do is send in moments you can change what to say he's focusing\nOn the issues that the different ... and I want to I Want to be clear here because she actually did not accused Christmas in ... of treason she accused her of are saying that it would be okay if somebody went and I'm\nA foster that the Taliban so she's saying you know other people doing it so Murtha wasn't saying you are guilty of it but rather guilty of saying that it would be okay if someone went and did that and the ... and the key differences that one is accusing someone of committing a crime and mark MacPhail as you did not do that but it starts\nAre not to bring in my opponent but you know she has said that show kind of pick and choose which laws depending on which one she thinks are good or bad show of force I've always said\nPolicymakers make the law or people make the law via the initiative process ... offices enforces the law and so one of the problems we had with some of these voter enacted a amendments are statutes is\nIs that it creates some and ambiguity and uncertainty and so originally our officers were task we we're required to\nDo these criminal appeals ... um there was an appeal on an issue of a criminal conviction related to that to the oils and so what did when voters approved a medical marijuana law while you know what was ... when it came to you know the products and you know determining weight and potency all that kind of stuff\nThere was some there was some Vegas so we\nActually um [noise] uh the other side appealed that and we're originally filed a pleading saying that uh the case should be dismissed on procedural grounds um\nBut I actually think that's the wrong thing to do so we're actually going to withdraw that pleading and we're actually getting urge to court to hear the case because I Want the state Supreme Court to provide some clarity to us\nBecause I Do believe 'em and enforcing the law as it is so in Arizona voters passed the voter initiative\nThat um you know a wanting or allowing for medical marijuana I think they want to make sure that there are products out there that people that are sick they get their hands on and so we want the court I Want to court to ultimately hear this case and to provide some clarity to all of us\nBecause I think in law enforcement or just in general what the law requires is consistency certainty people want to know what the rules are and they want to be able to follow them and so I think that this opinion actually created some uncertainty and until the Supreme Court\nHere's the case and um you know may ultimately determinations as to how the language should be read um you know we think that no one should be prosecuted for that and we further more I think the Supreme Court needs to hear that case\nOkay so you're going to be withdrawing that request then you say to dismiss the appeal correct correct because we\nBecause we actually I Want I Want\nThe Supreme Court to provide us some more guidance because I Do think it's unfair to everyone whether you believe in\nA medical marijuana or whether you don't like medical marijuana I think the uncertainty is bad for everyone it's bad for prosecutors it's bad for the people that um you know are selling medical marijuana and so um it's important I think for the court to speak on this and so um we're going to urge the court actually to cure the case and here on the merits\nOkay you've come under a little bit of scrutiny regarding proposition one twenty seven and that would require a big increase in the use of renewable energy in Arizona in fact it would require fifty percent renewable by\nYou in Arizona in fact it would require fifty percent renewable by twenty thirty you amended the ballot description of crop one twenty seven to include\nA that this must be met quote irrespective of cost to consumers some people felt like you stepped over the line and maybe we're introducing something into that prop language that really wasn't in the prop\nAt all I'm ...\nYeah they're they're asserting thank you Dan down because I I'm ... I'm sure many of the list are now that I'm a out of state\nCalifornia billionaire Tom Steyer is literally spending millions of dollars more money than any individuals ever spent on an attorney general Sharon race trying to sell and damaged my reputation and you know if you look at what we've done\nOur officers diner mother was suing companies like ... whether it was filing a lawsuit against Purdue pharmaceutical down there in Tucson going after you know car dealers for a false are misleading advertising getting the largest judgment ever again in state court against ... and we have taken on\nUm ... you know big interests big corporations there is no sacred cows um and one of the jobs and duties of the attorney general and this is Tom sorry not telling you is that we are required by law to review\nEvery single ballot proposition approve them and the language and it's on the ballot the description is you know we we review that approve it and we provide information\nThat's accurate and fair and so I Am always going to err on the side and making sure that ballot language is something that consumers can understand and it's something that's accurate and so no one's saying that it's inaccurate and no one's saying that it doesn't help consumers because it does um and the reality is\nIs for if you look at the ballot propositions or on the ballot right now six of those seven ballot propositions um we worked with the proponents of without initiatives um or you know we work with the folks and\nUm changed some of the language and so when we did these changes we actually\nContacted you know Tom ... folks to prop one twenty seven folks and said\nWe think this is important for consumers to know here's what we think and we sent it to them\nThey could have asked you know they could have proposed proposed different language they could have sued us to stop it you know we we know this time there's been some lawsuits sometimes to stop on the ship\nBut they did nothing instead they're what they wanted to do is score cheap political points because for whatever reason\nI have I'm Tom Steyer doesn't like me\nHe's attacked me personally he's making slanderous and and the family story statements about me that are inaccurate and true and it's not fair and I ... as an Arizona and some of that grew up here that what we're seeing now with what's tires try to do with me as a tax on me is the same crap that's going on in Washington D. C.\nOr a lot of these other races our all you do is you throw a bunch of mud gimmicks unfounded accusations and then you hope everyone hates that person\nBut even if it even back in Arizona elections director Eric Spencer was surprised by your additions to the description of the ballot initiative did that did that surprise you\nWell once again we didn't have to what we turned over every single document related to this ballot proposition and once again what what what Tom Cyrus not telling you\nIs the secretary of state's office actually sent over language before that wanting to show that that was going to increase like something like three hundred and Ninety percent or start talking about actual increases and our lawyers the people that actually worked on this or working with a party said\nNow that's two specific we don't know how much it's going to\nIncrease that may or may not or may not increase that much\nAnd that's why that language irrespective as to cost\nIs accurate because we don't know costs may go up and they make it out but the whole point is is that the corporation commission will now be charged with energy mandates that are no longer tethered in parts of article Fifteen of the constitution but instead I Will be entered into these new provisions which means that there'll be mandated irrespective of cost\nAnd I guess the only thing I Would add about the secretary of state's office says that that that email was sent over the day after the shell Reagan lost an election and I think that most people here at Arizona I Know that she lost a primary election because\nUm they were not ever they were not I'm a bastion of competence there was a lot of problems and so I I guess I Would just be very suspect of anything coming out of the secretary of state's office and the fact that\nThey were all over the board on this um I think was just um you know the secretary of state's way of um you know basically giving giving the finger\nGiving the figure to me um and thinking it was funny on their way out the door\nOkay attorney general mark ... we really appreciate your time today All right thanks a lot you\nKnow a our thanks to him and our thanks to Mona Danish bakery which uh the\nUh home of the Danish gringo bonuses um northeastern corner of swan and sunrise and a big supporter of bills show and that segment when we return we're going to be joined by Tony ... she is the color of superior court in Pima County we'll be right back\nAnd\nThe regional transportation authority funds projects that help make our transportation system safe reliable and efficient improve\nRegional mobility is important for economic vitality for businesses and families\nThe R T H continues to finance construction work for six new roadway project scheduled in twenty Eighteen for more information on Archie a projects visited Archie a mobility dot com V.

both recently joined the army so we were active duty soldiers and I'm\nAri uh we were heading off to Colorado we were stationed in Colorado so I'm getting married\nYou know to Colorado we were

I miss an afternoon news paper really do I uh it's a shame I Wish our market could have supported a two newspapers but to me too [laughter]\nI'm Blake ... is a ... we have are in an incredible time for politics um I think that in the age of Trump there are no there's nothing that should be surprising\nUm did you see the debate between Christ in cinema and a curse and send them excuse me and uh uh uh Martha McSally\nA couple of times yeah I had to watch it once and then had to go back and get quotes for a column that I wrote about it so yeah I I watched it and it was funny because the first time I watch it I thought wow I'm Sally looked really strong a cinema looked kind of robotic\nBut the second time I watched it I kind of sauce cinema really being controlled discipline smoothly and taking the fight to mix Sally who was um a really you\nDescribed ... gun in the end when she went in with she went in with all\nGuns blazing and she was clearly um uh and then she was clearly frustrated with ... or um or or the ... kind of ... cinemas demeanor seemed to mug a bug mix Sally [noise] so what we ... we were just saying Jim was that\nIf you listen to it on the radio I can see people thinking you know what I think cinema one that she can kind of control the flow of the debate she was really disciplined\nBut if you saw it on television um I think ... humanity kinda came across that exasperation that just ... ... she was more ... in in some ways I think that but\nI've noted for a while and and I got to tell you I think she's ... she's very authentic that had her communication that was absolutely a whole lot back no and and I think what what you hear from her is what you get I've never seen her flip flop never seen her deviate\nFrom what she has said previously\nAnd she will explain above she will look even if it's even if it's if it's an explanation that then maybe the base doesn't like or or somebody on the other side doesn't like she will at least explained her vote\nFor instance what was the big the big issue was about health care right about Martha so called flip flop on healthcare reality two different bills one that was going to go nowhere in the Senate yeah goes back to caucus tries to recruit another bill\nAt the second time that they went back to caucus the Democrats don't even want to show up caucus so\nAnd this will be ... libre doubt let's let's be clear about what happened Republicans decided to do that in the back room without inviting Democrats in and then they were and then they said this is your built take it or leave it they did\nBill but mass to show my name is Jim Kelly filling in for Bill while he is vacation enough in the northwest of of the United states um\nTo my right is my guest Blake\nMore lock and we've been talking politics I'm Blake was my opposite number I in this political a Cold War that we've been having for a for quite a few years\nIf you want to get on the conversation phone number is five to zero seven nine zero two zero four zero five to zero seven nine zero two zero four zero\nBlake I'm we talked about the cinema a mix Sally a debate let's talk about live Marquez Peterson an anchor Patrick what did you think of that debate\n[noise] um I I had to wake up a couple of times during a it was um I don't think it was that informative um but you know I that was sort of the\nI Would have liked to it I I I thought the format we can see where you can do you think you've got a a a a good field and just for who we are as and do you have a good deal adjusts for who an is based on that debate we we did with the cinema ... yeah I didn't I not not really I mean I kind of get we're\nUm ...\nYou know ... where are they both are is I Can't think were a lot of um a lot of candidates are now especially on the Republican side or the question is\nWhat is Trump is with the Republicans wondering what Trump means to me and the question is is this is Trump helping me is the hurting me for it and I don't know the Republicans are always able to answer that question based on frankly\nIt's especially long term you on TALK about certainly just uh\nWhat's the latest tweet what's the latest outrage\nPulled out of it a second Chuck Chuck is on the line Chuck how can we help you today\n[noise] Hi this is Kelly yeah I've got a question that local politics okay I heard that the borders supervisors last night passed a resolution in support of the\nParis climate whatever they call it a word yeah every three to to vote yes okay and they made arrangements\nTo set aside some money to support this and remodeling some buildings and to get some more open space and who knows what else I think it's nuts\n[laughter] well I'll tell you\nThat that's just crazy this is crazy\nI'm going to give you I'm going to give you my thoughts on this and then place going to give you his uh from the other side my thoughts on this are are are twofold one ... Pima County really doesn't have any business you know sitting down and say no we're going to go with the Paris climate accord that the United states has already pulled out\nBut on the other side of the coin is at Pima County wants to save money use renewable energies a redesign or re develop some ah some old old buildings that uh\nSome uh some old old buildings or that a deck and use solar or wind or or whatever it renewable way I have no problem with that\nUm but like I said when it comes down to is the foundation of the vote was about the Paris climate accord that the United states government isn't even a part of Pima County government does not negotiate a treaties with other\nCountries that's my thing and so it's none of their darned business but by this but the other side of the coin is\nIf they do something good for a for a our buildings and they do something good for upgrading our our abilities to renewable energy I've got no problem with that like what do you say are you sure\nChuck Huckleberry doesn't negotiate treaties and to have\nThese [laughter] I'm not I'm not sure he's\nNot part of the ... and uh yeah I look this is nothing new they basically it sounds like they would they basically did was slap Paris climate accord and stuff that they do anyway which is a judge to shout out to the ... yeah yeah which is yeah and and the Paris climate accord\nWere were largely voluntary anyway they were just you know this is what we agree to do um to to fight climate change so it wasn't anything and reserve the right to not do it um it was\nJust kind of a ... yeah so uh they ... they've done LEED green lead silver buildings which are very environmentally um or lead gr lead gold I think it was legal lead silver um they've been doing with Jim said designing\nEnvironmentally friendly buildings had been buying open space for\nGod to ... yeah I mean and I think\nThey just rebranded as as um as Paris climate accord but people can call and tell me I'm wrong\nSo does that answer your question Chuck\n... okay I live it's a let's get back to again\nFirst off ... obviously you're on the other side so you you think that you know the values of Arizona are uh are are being reflected in a cinematic Sally a campaign and you think cinema reflects but let's get back down to CD too which is a\nPurple as you're getting yeah OK Democrats have about two thousand voter registration to our excuse me and he's like three thousand voter registration advantage and CD to the Democrats are plus why cook right ... the really definitely hearty not designated to Pima County\nCan kind of sway that so basically what we're looking for is every Democrat would have to get out and vote for hacker Patrick Bracken back to the way if every Democrat voted never Republican voted and would win but because of the party not designated\nThose are the swing vote so what we're looking at is between four and five thousand votes that ad needs from the from the independence and the forty five thousand votes the Lee is going to need from the independents\nWho do you think is again taking a look at least a debate performance an anchor patches debate performance who do you think the independents are most likely to swing\nI think this is what exactly what our president wants to be it's gonna be a referendum on Donald Trump and I don't think I think it could be you and me we could substitute our names in there tomorrow at the same result um and so it was a fair answer as well I expect um\nI expect since the cinema I expect that actually makes Sally should have the advantage in you know statewide um I think at the ... I Would be ... I\nI Would add to the bride wrote that some mackerel I went yeah but but but I I well you can ride on in Congress and the two are to be surprised that I had to do with a lot to be very very different I I wouldn't be surprised if Kirkpatrick last just because\nBut do you think the people if you have a cat and and coaches county are sitting there saying what's Trump done for me do you think that was your question right know what's Trump done for me no well\nI think I I think it's all you do I feel about ... how do you feel how do I feel\nAbout Trump and I think it's debatable about whether or not um this economic up turn his is helping a broad swath\nOf ... uh you know mark hasn't Peterson was actually here in Tucson building businesses blog before Trump ever got here or ... or drop was prejudice is not a commentary\nOn an anchor Patrick's long term viability in that seat this is this year right now um I think people are going to vote to give to just put a check on Donald Trump um would\nVirtually no assist from the Democrats saying you need to put it to check on Donald Trump they had to wonder messaging has uh\nThey they know they don't get their message hasn't been an anti Trump message it hasn't been\nYou know Trump is trucks backed us bad they're messaging has been or just wanted to check out but wait a minute whether issues a bit like health care health care which is a Medicaid for all basically what the Democrats the progressive side as I Try to know Medicaid\nMedicare and Medicaid Medicare would become then in not just senior program but it's not the Medicaid\nIs access which is paid for a property taxes which is a completely different system um administered state wide than Medicare so let's be you know I can use the you can use the quotes around Medicaid but go ahead go ahead oh All right so I'll stand corrected on this at the moment um so Medicare\nFor all I that's number one okay Planned Parenthood roe be way that's number two yeah what's number three guns right yeah ... well I've got a I've got a few things I could give to the Democratic party all of a couple of secrets I could do\nIf the Democratic party for the next four years never said a word about guns it would break the in Iraq\nBecause nobody would donate to get out right\nEvery job that never lowered about guns for his heirs and their membership to the Democrat opens their mouth about guns Republicans go buy more animal [laughter] okay I could I I have a great record for that but you gotta I gotta agree things I as a a great a little\nI'm voting you anyways yeah first time at first ... first election I have that I have any say in the city council of Tucson or anything the city of Tucson for a long long time 'cause I've always lived outside of the county\nAnd you get to say and you're saying yeah and I and I got in ... and I'm saying yes to the city on this one I let me tell you I bet if you don't if Jim is in favor of it\nThan I'm all for the last one is the city charter change we're talking about changing the charter of the city of Tucson\nTo extend our city council and mare one year and so that they're all gonna run together now instead of separately is this my understanding of it yeah um and uh\nUh you know and and um and I've got no problem with this I think it's a step forward because eventually I I Want to get rid get down to ward only elections but well let me go to jail for\nFor a bunch of people who are scared of\nThe mob I'm having everybody exposed to single passions single election I have I have some problems with but on the other hand if you want to throw the bums out at once you can throw the bums out at once said it probably be of a flip a coin to me but um but I I\nI Will say that the chances of charter change are very very limited they every time a charter change proposition comes up almost always gets voted down doesn't a note in get some of the kids what was the last charter change to city it was if you remember\nAbout I'm a long time wasn't there was the one for a yeah I guess\nI didn't really close I Can't remember but you know what I think when they've always always get voted down there is a really good voter\nInstinct which is when you don't understand something they know say no right that is a great instinct because he was the very least you're doing no harm\nUm also I'd like to see if we can do charter changes let's do some real charging yeah actions yeah let's let's let's feeble balls here than where they are now so he's been a language\n[laughter] can say that on the radio is that All right okay ... ... and ... get away with a high\nA high so let's uh let's take a look at or some other local stuff um we've got some legislative district races going on we got Chris ... running down in a in a um a legislative district to literally rush for twenty second street in Tucson all the way to know gas\nAnd it's two to one he he actually made it one time he saw his way back what do you think uh Chris soccer league take you use it was a good legislator for the for the district when he was and he was a Republican but you know do you think he was you know got got some stuff up there ... there is a school\nOf thought that says what every every district might want to think if if we're not going to change the legislature you want some ... Republicans in Tucson\nWant some ...

I'm a young guy but uh but I didn't I didn't go to the veil like you did but uh\nBut I've been here my whole life and I've enjoyed every minute of it because it's such a great community but if you're you know older than me you definitely we're listening and watching television and radio back in the old days and you were part of that\nWell it was it was really an exciting time you know it was in the he was in the fifties late fifties early sixties I graduated from Catalina high school in Nineteen fifty nine\nAnd a buddy of mine and I his name is Bruce Schneider and he's been on the PBS radio station for quite a long time now but he and I we went to high school together and\nAnd all we wanted to do is be on the radio that we wanted to be disc jockeys we wanted to be part of that scene and it was it was at a time when things were really changing and there were two things that happened to radio back in the fifties number one was television\nYou know there used to be all the old dramas on\nRadio people sit around and they watched the radio while they would\nWhile they would listen to a Jack Benny or Bob Hope or or Amos and Andy or any of those great old shows a foreign concept to young people the ... I mean yeah absolutely and so you know and and I remember we ... we we actually lived in Chicago with it at the beginning of my life\nAnd Chicago had television in Nineteen forty eight through Nineteen fifty\nAnd we could see those shows and it was really amazing but I remember a time before we had television when I was just a kid you know seven eight nine years old where we would watch we would watch the radio and listen to those things and it was a real theater of the mind where you think about\nYou know they they they would portray dramas and things like that and and you know it was your imagination that took over exactly well we came first a two sided Nineteen fifty and a\n... one thing was a real shock is the fact that when we came here we came from Chicago where they had TV but Tucson didn't have television yet wow vision didn't get here until Nineteen fifty three\nAnd so um you know there there was no television but of course radio was was a thriving industry but you know I talked about my friend burden I we went to high school together and all we wanted to do is be disc jockeys and in Nineteen\n... I was saying there were two things that affected radio in those days number one was the fact that television was around but the second thing was Elvis Presley and rock and roll yeah town and that those two things just changed radio dramatically\nBut he and I really wanted to be a radio and we finally got her first chance in Nineteen fifty eight there was one FM stations in town and in those days nobody listened to him nobody had an FM\nRadio but there was one FM stations and it was Katie Katie FM\nAnd he and I got a chance to be disc jockeys I'm Katie Katie FM\nYou know nobody had radios I said my parents had to go out and buy buy a radio to listen a special radio and we were only Fifteen Years old so our parents at a drive is to the states while that's awesome and they played all

record southern Arizona first record company that's your that's your introduction to entrepreneurship as a Fifteen year old right\nYeah as or Seventeen jobs to live in the Enron yeah okay we we were as old as the uh [laughter]\nSo you know we we made a these records and uh\nAnd Bert and I uh we decided we wanted to go on the record business and of course the record business was fairly simple thing you know you got you made a record\nYou got the record played on the radio people went into the record stores and bought it and the record stores or by the record from you and then when they sold it they would pay for it and that was a very simple thing the only thing that was difficult about it was\nHow do you make a record we didn't know how to do that yeah\nYou know selfishly is a Seventeen year old so we had to fight out so if I I went home for lunch one day in high school and I called up to Sydney Jay Wakefield custom record pressing in Phoenix\nAnd I and I told a Mr Wakefield I said Hi I'm the Seventeen year old kid in high school and and I'm In Tucson and I want to make a record could you tell me how I can do it\nAnd he told me it took about two minutes on the phone and he said here's what you do you come up you get a recording studio and finished there were none in Tucson in those days if you could imagine file recording studios there has to come to Phoenix ... get it\nGoing to go into the recording studio and he said then I Will I Will take the tape that you make\nAnd I will press it and make a record out of it tell us what you want to put on the labels are and that's it tell me how many copies that what you what it will make it for you and we'll send it back to ... it was that simple so that was the first really entrepreneur ship that I was involved in and believe me over the over the last\nForty or fifty or sixty years I've had over a hundred businesses that I've started because that's that's what an entrepreneur is I'd never let her to run the business I ... I was an entrepreneur I Love to start\nStart things in their hand them off and allow other people's\nMoney ... and you know the funny thing was when that guy told me I wasn't management material that I wasn't I wasn't he wasn't right\nI was not a guy that wanted to run the business I uh I wasn't qualified and I didn't like to do it but if I had a good idea I could always get somebody else to do it and you can sell that idea so now you have a book so I've written a book and it's called\nFearless confessions of a serial entrepreneur by ... wild rides with the man who created the infomercial industry the world's most important website and over one hundred different businesses and it's a it's a three hundred and twenty page hard bound book and I'm introducing it this coming\nTuesday over twenty third at the Arizona history museum and all of your listeners are invited to come I'd love to have him come and I will give him a free copy of this book was twenty eight dollars and Ninety five

have plenty of time to go out to suffer that night we're just going to have a lot of fun it's not a book about\nBig business or you know a Mitt Romney takeovers or or accounting or anything like that it's just a fun book with my experiences but included in there are twenty two ... laws valuable tips from start for starting from scratch because I learned the hard way so you don't have to end the first\nThe first Lindstrom law in here tell me that it is number one if you don't know how to do something you ask just exactly at every just about every business I was ever in I didn't know anything about it but I went to find out about well and that's when I asked and that's how zoom records gets done what you\nDid when you were a when you were a kid and you called up that record pressing company ... be amazed at how how um much just one little phone call or one nowadays email or message to someone how far can get you\nExactly and in those days it was really difficult because people don't understand how difficult it was without the Internet biggest today it's so easy to find out things today is got to be really easy to find out just about anything\nBut if you want to do something called you can call people talk to people are always happy to help you out and so that's the number one thing in the book is if you don't know anything about it which I I was in all kinds of different businesses you know I started a newspaper one time what do I know about starting a newspaper I asked somebody how do you start a newspaper and they said here's what you do and I did it\nSo you know like all the businesses that you started what is the one of your most proud of well\nI I think it's probably the infomercial business was the thing yeah that I was most proud of\nUh we also started a thing that you may have heard of\nAnd that was the traveling starving artist art sale which which appeared in hotel ballroom is all over the country all over the world we started that in Nineteen Seventy four and and probably did a billion dollars worth of business during that fire are still people who do that from time to surf but we started that business\nOr we started the infomercial business we started we we were very big players in the nine hundred number business not porn didn't have any of those but we had a lot of really entertaining lines and it was a fabulous business lasted for three years and then it was over with\nAnd then and then in the early Nineteen nineties I got into retail and I had the world's largest watch store in Laughlin, Nevada believe it or not wow we had over twenty thousand watches and we sold more watches now one store than anybody anywhere in the world and that\nAnd and that's got that got me featured on the NBC today show was hard was other things so they do those things were really big but ah you know and and then and then I talk about my foray into the Internet\nWhere I should move over Mark Zuckerberg I'm building the ... the world's greatest\nWere were evaluating you know sort of like what are some additional things we can do to be a better than hand said whether we were able to get some celebrities and or you know things of that
