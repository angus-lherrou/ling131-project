S. T. while they found out that no that wasn't happening so then they started opening up a everything these are good schools I'm not saying that they're not doing anything\nBut to us the should not be running them at a loss that such as what we've been we continue to lose students ...\n... if you guys will mean you're running a daycare for us the employees right mhm and to us the bona fide to you as the parents or grandparents okay and your charging just enough\nTo make it revenue neutral direct I I'm not even saying make Adele I'm just making retinue neutral well I ... I could have that discussion but now let me ask you a question when did these things start\nThey started under a a mess gr harvest tenure with bringing in a he who shall not be named\nOkay so under the apes T I can say he can't eight Steve Sanchez reign of terror okay it's Halloween week what the hell right the reign of terror of H. T. and then so that is crystal foster ... threat All right so they started the things that sounded like a nice idea right we're having trouble attracting and retaining teachers\nWell actually he was bringing it on as part of what the U. S. P. was saying about retaining are teachers and getting other teachers okay so he was utilizing the premise of the u._s. be at the time\nAnd but what's happened is classic to us the first of all misread the situation right the teachers really weren't using it that much\nSo then we decided we're just going to open it up to the world\nSo now everyone in their mother who's paying attention to go to this place with their kid through and I'm sure if there's one place that's not too tough about collecting fees that he was the because you're the the ... district with the heart\nSo I assume if I'm an eight hundred dollars behind on my daycare fees it's not like to us these you know sending Gino in Rocco to help me find my checkbook\nAlthough we charge ban students I think it was Thirteen to Fifteen hundred dollars to be in bad yeah\nRight so again I've always said the deal is the deal with the is two things write to us the is a a jobs program for buddies yes especially if they need to make six figures and work at ten ten alright and\nWhy do you eat not just the ten ten but at our schools right remember we have principals who are related to\nOh that's true individual but at the same time then it's one big social experiment and this fits in perfectly with the idea that we're going to provide free daycare for the city of Tucson direct so how much is this cost the taxpayers of the city of who's on I ...\nI Believe that was at the range of almost a half million dollars last year if I'm if I'm correct I may be off a little bit but it continues\nSo the current number was one point for is what I saw most recently\nA that could be\nAll right so but what we're saying is where they just get big ... ... if there's one place that cannot afford a one point one point four million dollar loss on a daycare for everybody that you guys\nAnd and you know I I get beat up on individuals all the time on regarding this and it's like\nLike it or not we continue to the students we need to bring more students in here not in the students because my understanding as we're not getting as many people coming from the early learning learning or an infant in early learning centers\nInto the district but\nStudents equate the funding more he's losing students we keep losing funding we can't afford\nHere's the other thing right I'd be interested in seeing that because we know that parents are just running like crazy away from the listing All right they're taking them to charters privates open rolling okay\nAt the same time what would be interesting is or how many kids are graduating in a year now are out of the system right what's the what's the amount of kids actually at the parents are going to enroll my kid on the list they\nYeah like I like to see what that number is too that's another place where you're losing for somebody ... ... a graduate you have how many replacing a kindergarten right\nThe ... a graduate you have how many replacing a kindergarten right that'd be kind of a fascinating number to know\nI don't think we'd even had the ability to do that\nSeven nine zero twenty for the phone number let's go to Dr Kevin ... Kevin what's going on buddy\nGet on and off first of all I'm not at all like to thank you uh I called in to say I do like Michael ... Michael effects on that board\nI think he he does care about your son does care about the kids to the signs say redesign job Tucson and you know the culture has to change that so\nUh I've already voted voted so Michael you got one vote we appreciate you a it's a tough position but your diet and we need more Michael ... district one because we need a strong district of it\nIt's it's ... it's not as our ship so that's really oh\nWell thank you very much served at and again you know you're you're providing a a a service that gene us these not providing and as you and I've had discussions before you know it's my it's my job to put you out of business\nAnd you you you thanked me for that but I I'm Still trying to do the best I can and I appreciate what you do for the kids and what are they a huge a new building you have out there by my house\n[laughter] wait but their choice mine [laughter] if I go to the door you know\nWe have we have a you know for each school but we wouldn't run schools if we could get that sold for itself so anyway I look back at you and you\nAnd uh you know you can be a street fighter street fighter listener so God Bless you you do your\nPriest shade everything you do also thank you sir\nThink about all the time and have a good day that's what makes up for any cause he keeps leading with his chin and getting a lot well do I\nUm [noise] so three votes this is what it takes ... votes to get actual substantial things done here trip um it'd be better\nFor five but I did I have managed to get five votes by the way\nWhat's at the end the ... uh yeah [laughter]\nI got I got I don't know a a doctor Trujillo I brought in with five votes everyone voted for him\nSo Dr Trujillo and I like I like gave a lot okay um when you see like the fight it's a war All right what are we talking about here is it did they talk about the the the amount of monitors seemed to be less and you can't stop every fight that's just life okay so I don't want to be overly\nOn your guys is case about that but you know is there to the proper amount of adults per kid and some of these schools are because of budget cuts in because the enrollments dropping so fast over the years it just tough to kind of you know match that up\nI think that we need to have more monitors there who will actually do something in step in and pull off\nA fight before it even happens ah I agree fights happen at all of our schools I mean it's it's inevitable you you mix everyone together\nGive me one more suggestion that doesn't have to do with police\n\nWell [noise] I've said before copy what successful districts do\nRight\nWe we need to investigate what other successful district were not the only district in this country that is under a de sac order\nWho is having the same issues and we need to look at others and not only other districts but also what's going on with some of our other\nUh competitors in in a Tucson Dr leeman just was on what is he doing that's attracting individuals to come to his his charter school what his base is doing we need to\nOne of the issues that I have is we're not challenging or students to the extent that we should be challenging them and a lot of them aren't that stupid that's just going to go well we're just going to continue to do this we're going to I Want in education I Want something I Want something better and they go out and they do\nSo here's one was great and also so I don't go mark\nUp yet stop promoting students from elementary schools and middle school who don't uh who are uh you know don't really have to go no go and same thing from middle school to high school\nWell I I think I I think we now have a superintendent who's not going to be allowing that happen as much as the past\nActually market exactly what's going to fly out of my out of my head next which was the idea that we're still socially promoting kids\nWho first of all dumped you ... you said it that really can't their reading skills from elementary to middle school is horrendous right All right which is of course putting the kid a horrible stuff like child abuse so it is it All right then taking the kid for middle school to with no math skills you might stem kid right\nOr my teacher mark how many kids are you seeing I just don't have\nBasic math schools coming in the Tucson\nTucson Hi\nWell I'm afraid to say but it's got to be at least a third and I'm being generous\nThat descended doesn't apps yet but I I I bet you it's more than that [noise]\nAll right mark thanks for the call is always sort of have a great day thank you mark seven nine zero twenty forty is the phone number wake up to sun and Gmail dot com I keep telling everyone I'll say it over and over and over again if you are going to fix this community\nI Need Pima County fixed anti US defects are sowing your homework assignment you say bring up more students info what does that mean\nInto oh into sorry into into to us the God I didn't finish that don't carry\nA classroom support for teachers students and parents\nRight here's what I ... meaning by that is if if you don't allow a teacher to be able to control and manage their classroom students see that I I continue to equate it as a bowl of fruit you have a bowl of fruit\nBeautiful fruit in there oh that'd be my ... my banana this morning this is compelling ready [laughter]\nYou have a ball of of a beautiful fruit in there and you take one bad piece of fruit and stick it in the middle of that what happens to the rest of the fruit maybe it's rotten that gets rotten so we need to allow teachers to be able to manage their classrooms\nAnd start holding kids accountable and then the other students are going to start to begin to learn\nSo it to me it's like there's three basic says well to basics and to us we we just talked about the social promotion one right right that is probably the real\nThing I was socially ... ... they just want to get me out getting him out getting now\nSo I remember in the early days of the show the adult lead a crew socially promoted that do it on a vote\nI don't know a couple of hundred kids from junior high to that level whatever that I guess that was yeah I don't remember exactly ... years ago to override their they thought they were being compassionate right that's what that's what they they laid their head on the pillow and thought they were being compassionate in the end you're literally you're just you're sensing kids to a lifetime of working at Burger King\nDirect direct the sad part or be followers right I'm with you I I don't have any who's not going to think but lab so that\nSee that's the ... all this compassion you're liberal that they they they keep throwing out there that they're the impassioned the ones you're literally prepping kids for failure yeah and to be followers set at basically kind of a dead end economic life for most of them and that's the thin\nAnd I are quite that as the quail you have the mama quail and all the baby's father wherever the mom with quill goes no matter what we're off the cliff they all go up the cliff\nAs we're getting bananas in Wales today [laughter] and what was your ... you have a last friday a Tucson Hi that was\nSomething like that caller yes that went by ... just last friday or bad debt to crossing guards in in front of the agents on six three day in and one resource officer how they knew it was one resource I Want to have short but well they weren't looking inside his school as I say you\nKnow they probably saw the police car out front there was a pretty smart like Robert others to crossing guards on six director Brian Ross courage and then you we have some monitors on the other you have a litter of tend to whatever over there are so you could you have like right All right\nSeven nine zero twenty forty seven forty four in the morning let's get skip on ten thirty ... voice skip what's going on\n[noise] skip hot I I thought\nOkay we're having how can we help to the doctor\nI just why aren't you a check and regarding the only resource ... right I taught at a ... or a year out\nOr any or a five year old house and the two thousand five inch Yes sir\nAnd we have all these uh starts off I'm campus and in my opinion it made a big difference uh they were very ... and then and very much involved with all that\nAnd the students and I think just having their presence on campus is a positive\nThing for two reasons one it\nHelps the students on ... and that a large are not there to protect down\nAs well as his ass and it just showing that a person there that made a big difference in my ... and um I I think\nYou know they play a vital role in the overall security and the campus just from the standpoint of you know these terrible incidents where\nPeople are lined campus armed and start shooting in all if you have a a police resource a person there you've got somebody they can uh perhaps intervene and and not prevent or they're a loss like All right\nLet's skip thanks for the good call as always thank you were going to do one more segment you hold on for a more secular absolutely teacher bobbing Sean

different doing it with everybody ... all of my experiences are really pleasant actually wrote a letter to the\nUm she's on health department just saying their staff was I worked in a lot of cities with a lot of health departments and they were both professional and kind and a lot of times health inspectors kind of treat you um\nI don't know like you they know that they have a lot of control room and they almost are dismissive and they don't act humid or not to sound out inspectors were so kind and they were excited about the project and they were almost it was a pleasant experience which are really neat so all my ...\nWith the job and I do pretty much scheduled on no no of course not [laughter] but I think\nWe were supposed to open originally in March and then in July and then we finally opened and the end of August and even that was like\nThis whole is our pool gonna cause we expanded the pool and there was this whole is it going to get approved and did we do it right and there was the last minute things where we didn't do the titles right so we had to redo those marriage is like working twenty four hours a day right before we opened smoker um\nNo I don't think any when you're remodeling our project this big that it ever opens on time so\nIt's pretty old and\nYeah ... yeah I mean and we even had just I originally wasn't supposed to be in Tucson I was I'm going to be staying California as just a creative director and come back and forth for a variety of reasons personal and business and um we had\nDecided to hire a general manager who had a bunch of experience and hotels\nAnd then he ended up not working out and so I came on as GM and I had\nA lot of anxiety about that because I have management experience and I have creative experience but I've never GM the hotel and the only time I've ever seen it was watching taught him only a hotel conference room and it looks like a really stressful job so\n[laughter] and it is\nBut it's also been a really really neat experience like I said interacting with the gas is my favorite favorite part\nWell yeah and that's the thing so would you what I've learned is that if you're dealing with the certain really because there's so much available delivery of hotel rooms and yours was going to be different and unique writes yeah but a lot of problems can go wherever they want to go right\nRight and what happens is because of the corporate invasion of hotels and the whole told dot com and Chrysler him it's becoming a commodity for sure so what you're doing what you're trying to do with the idea that the thing that keeps them coming back to you is not necessarily just a ... it's the one on one yeah I'd like to happen\nAnd also the the aspect of being an art hotel I'm an only supporting Tucson artists and I think that people really like you can go in your room and read the bio of artists to me a dark room\nSo ...\nSo that was my original my original idea years ago was an art hotel in Tucson I've been there if you are hotels and they're very like um for lack of a better word fancy and high brow and the rooms are really expensive and the art is outrageously expensive\nUh and I'd never seen anything that really took local art and made it the whole basis of the business ... and\nVaries it can do a live show we can do that would be so cool I Would love to do that inside so we'll talk okay\nWe'll have your people talk to my people or her in Iowa change business cards before this was over so the goal pleasure meeting you thanks for doing what you guys are doing I think it's a

Tucson show a markup and set the Pima County recording machine real quick now first and foremost listener Peter up on the north west side first of all said\nThank you Chris for the best thing I've ever heard I've heard in the weeks which was the William Shatner police now he died he was a big fan of the police so then we have we have a you know got a big bomb election coming up because remember there they're spending your money so wisely over at Pima County right so then he takes a picture of this big\nSexy eight and a half by eleven glossy male or I don't know if you've got this one yet or editor non it's about flood or about um\nAbout flooding and mailed it out\nOkay so you go so glad Pima County spent a fortune on a huge cloud the mail or about flooding and mailed it to us\nAfter the monsoon season\nBecause you want me to give you a bond money is this what they're going to do with the money that I already gave them\nThis is working at this by God he's right they show pictures of you know washed out roads or whatever thank you yeah who's all does that how long how long of the road when at what about your tips that you have better and there are certain things that no county or minutes of how the in the world can fix right it's just the way where we live right\nAh but you said he's in jail so he's northwest I okay I guess you have to go through of how many deaths that are what flood when ... you know when rain or the county has never built a road they just\nBlack top the debt it's like are you kidding that's that's how ... does things\nSo they just fix the roads with their quarter of a million dollars to shove this uh basically they basically saved truck Huckleberry legacy\nIs what this is about All right\nAnd some of them are road companies that are going to get money to do roads I got\nMy God I Know how that works [noise] ah so this is on\nTheir Facebook page so no one really cares about the gym and then sold in the Tucson weekly opinion no one really read that thing anymore\nBut one of the quotes\nFrom their endorsements is\nThis and that just fix our roads people\nAre using this as part of their sales pitch gym then sold basically wrote\nQuote critics of the proposal who are also the loudest constrict could critics of the conditions of the road are lying about how easy it would be the fix the roads without the money will vote hell yes on prop for sixty three they ... people okay not just yes Elia well mayor ed the hell no\nGuy uh okay so now Jim Insel is saying that quote\nThe no people are lying about how easy it is fix the roads with the current budget\nNow Jim\nI Know it's hard for you you have been suffocating in your in your in your bubble and this was an obvious suffocating inside your bubble now I Know it's ...\nI Know that your bubble goes out to about I ten maybe out to the Macondo goes out to about Campbell right\nEnds at about twenty seconds and maybe speedway which I Know that's your bubble that you'd suffocate in that's the only this is what happens when all you do is talk to people who think exactly like you\nKnow we took gymnastics all\nAnd we'll get an independent arbiter will get built Buckmaster to be the moderate\nAnd I had Jim mental on one side I I look let's make this better Jim Insel Wendell long yes army David Gold seeking the co chairs of yes Michael Rossi the county lobbyist\nAnd Chuck Huckleberry put\nThem on one side against me Gary Davidson an alley Miller and we'll give them ten minutes for every five minutes we got\nWe left the floor with them\nSo when the just fix arose guys are re printing gym then sold frying that the folks who have already proven that Chuck waste money out of the current budget that world wires either you're looking at your polling that's so great\nOn this thing\nBecause if you go to our YouTube page and listen to four sixty three by the numbers\nGary has proven to you guys with his HBO calculator that if you take the sweets from the county from the state\nThey call it the sweeps we like to call diversion her sweet right when you said they keep saying you see friends for years on these were you saying the state took all of our money it's one of the biggest allies in this town the state took all of our money grow up All right\nIt's a third of one percent of the budget one third of one percent of the budget so when we say to her sleep so

proposition on the parks and recreation\nOut we had not as an editorial board but my colleague release cut asked how is the editorial writer and get a column kind of going through that that proposition in way Dan himself\nThe over you've had pretty much a a brand overwhelmingly positive response you were telling me\nYou spoke I guess you're pretty much on the speaking circuit everyday or nearly fifty groups or explaining what this is all about and you said a hands go up in the room when you ask well would you like to see our parks improve pretty much every hand goes up yeah\nThat's right it's been very encouraging the ah yeah you're right I think last week I spoke to the Peter how neighborhood association and\nIt was a very well attended neighborhood meeting and are actually council member ... introduced me and he poses the question to them and like\nI think I'm speaking to the choir and most of them it already voted also but it was still a great opportunity to embrace myself and get some feedback in terms of what they were hoping you know if the voters that approved the initiative but they could hope to see ... in terms of park improvements in their neighborhood and community park and it is\nProposition for seven and if you live in the city of Tucson and registered voter and I hope you are you will be eligible to vote on this many people I think that early ballots have been out now almost two weeks lots of people have already\nVoted yes in fact ... and this is a overall big picture two hundred and twenty five million dollars in general obligation bonds generated over nine years what's the footprint of this brand\nSure that's a good question bill so the propositions actually title parks and connections so the two hundred twenty five million over nine years we'll be I'm invested in a hundred of our parks or car I'm\nCurrently we have a hundred and twenty eight parks the proposition does develop three smaller neighborhood parks we have three new parks\nOr and then there's um so a hundred and thirty three million of the two hundred and twenty five goes to reinvestment in parks and then about sixty seven million will be devoted to what we call connections and that's a whole array of\nMobility oriented improvements sidewalks in areas that are absent a safe pedestrian court orders a bike ways multi purpose trails the completion of segments of\nOf green way so it's really to build I think a healthier infrastructure so people aren't always relying on hopping in a car to get to a park to school at really connects our parks wanted another

excited about but I was already bringing lots of ideas and maybe that's why the city manager hired me about things that would harness the interests of volunteer energy community partnerships\nYou know having to you may hear is a huge advantage um because of some of their their programs and encourage studies ah but yeah we were we were prepared to keep advancing with the resources that we have\nA being very aggressive instill good stewards of the\nThe funding that we were interested but we've initiated a for example power paint is a a neighborhood volunteer based\nInitiative that realizes just a fresh coat of paint on her a moderate picnic tables or a pool a bath house\nMakes the world is different so uh that and planting trees and uh just having a you know our adopt apart program and park watch expanded so we were already you know kind of developing our approach to to improve the parks but um I Can't be any more excited than\nYou know doing a cart will and bill studio here that I think proposition for seven should voters approve it it's going to be a huge huge benefit to the community\nWe talk about oversight or our caller Richard brought that up and what about maintenance of the parks okay people or or if they approve this uh what about yearly or one will the parks is their maintenance money built you\nKnow so that's a very good point also so the the general obligation bonds are restricted\nTo only capital improvements that doesn't go towards staffing pension retirement any type of a maintenance budget but we do have a a maintenance plan to place we've projected that\nOnce a lot of these improvements are in place\nOr we're going to need a from one point eight to two million dollars additional funding in our parks budget and the mayor counsel when this was given the green light to go on the ballot they directed the city manager to start\nPlanning future budgets to restore a a lot of the park maintenance dollars that were cut the other things which I think are actually\nMore important to emphasize is that a lot of the improvements that we bring are going to have huge cost savings on her current budget so\nTransforming existing park lighting a to Eli de saves a huge amount on our electric bill and also the smart irrigation improvements with computerized\nUh incense or control the irrigation out so you can actually give us healthier turf areas in the parks are at about a forty percent reduction in our water bill so things like that and also brand new items uh most of them come with ... that are you know eight ten Fifteen Years in length\nThose would be guaranteed for performance and a lot of our current and maintenance of dollars that we I kinda humorous they say we buy duct tape and band aids to keep saying limping along\nTo their useful life and we can redirect those as new things that are put in place to help take better care of others so I think we have a pretty solid plan to address of how we're going to cover maintenance\nSo right now you have a huge cavern black electrical up for your car fixed they care thing I've only got about a minute and a half left and Sarah or did you have anything else well I'm just wondering\nAt what will be what would part if it passes will park users be incorporated in the construction will they stay open or of all the parks have to close\nNow that's that's one of our more complicated challenges and that's that action plan that will be a discussing with the city manager and all the ward offices in that um\nBecause voters in the community in general will have been so excited that this passes but yet there's about a year and a half\nWait until they see ... hey what's going on with the part right so we're going to be front loading what we call the low hanging fruit there high impact high visibility lower cost improvements\nAh those up in the state of Maricopa have been pushing for wanting to son to have a elections in even number of years but I think that the city's kind of looking to see to get some backing from the community and hoping that people will say no to this\nYeah I think that we're going to have a piece um before the election from from the mayor weighing in on that it's something that\nUm they kind of gets into the weeds and uh uh the practicalities of Halloween action's worked in Tucson is different than other places\nBut it's a something that that is important even though it's kind of hard to explain in a thirty second today and it's something that that voters may not really give them much thought to\nAnd Jim you say in your uh your saying vote no on this near recommendation ah you concluded by saying fair warning if this doesn't pass it sets up a court battle with the state\nRight because of the state has a you know as you mentioned been trying to push the city's a across the state really into doing these I even elections at the same time it's all the other elections are held and uh and that's been successful in most cases and their their latest effort a basically with\nThe cut to the chase would would take state shared revenues away from the city unless they moved the election even years\nWhich is a big financial hit\nA our charter which is approved by the voters a says that the elections shall be held and the odd numbered years and and you can't just change that without a vote of the people\nSo that's why they're putting it up a this year I think that ... the argument against it is that basically you know we have a lot to look at in a midterm election presidential election you as the the uh\nThe legislative races you at the congressional races you have US Senate races sometimes a gubernatorial presidential elections propositions\nAnd all the rest a county elections I'm so by ... by having a city elections and the other years you sort of a allow the media to focus solely on on those city issues and\nAnd bring some light to those specifically rather than getting lost in the shuffle of everything else that said obviously turn out in the city elections is far lower than it is in a general election so there's certainly an argument in terms of voter participation and voter engagement\nOn on that side of things so uh you know I I just don't like getting pushed around by those guys at the state so we're we're saying vote no ah and then we'll see what happens after\nThe third a local proposition ah that folks will be considering a has to do with the Pima County road bonds this is proper for sixty three Sarah\nAnd uh we had Ramon valid as on the program yesterday and the supervisors admit if this thing goes down there is NO PLAN B.\nRight yeah it's a one of those things that that needs to be done the roads we all know need to be fixed and that has to be paid for somehow\nAnd Jim you had a very enthusiastic yes on this one on your recommendation\n[noise] yeah you know everyone complains all the time about the condition of our roads and and I think many of them have gotten better in recent years at least within the city of Tucson because of voters have approved a a a first of a a a a\nBond package and then a sales tax temporary sales tax in order to get to fixing the roads and a lot of the roads I drive our on our end and much better shape these days as a result of that and I I think we should move forward and start fixing these roads the rest of the ones that are out there\nBecause uh you know the longer you wait the more expensive it is to actually get around to fixing them a and they've tried any number of options until they've come to these bombs or the deal is pretty good it's a short term bond it's about three and a half years to pay them off which means there's not a lot of an interest hit on that\nUh you get the money you get the roads fixed again the\nThe uh the Pima County is retiring bombs they don't have to increase the tax rate in order to pass these and I I just I find it fascinating that the people who are most against this are the same ones who complain relentlessly about the condition of the road it's almost as if they don't want to give up having something to compare\nAnd and I I just\nYou know we've we've third I think according to your show complained that there wasn't enough money for district one in there so he wasn't going to vote for it and and I find that just strange because roads are uh you know I I don't I don't only\nRoads are uh you know I I don't I don't only drive the roads in my neighborhood if I drive part of town I'm using the ... it's not a very provincial thing for me and other people may not tried that much outside of their own neighborhood I don't know but\nI I think there's also an economic development argument to be made in terms of of ah\nBeing a more attractive place for people to set up a business and and I honestly think it's just a quality of life issue and it should be resolved it seems like the last best chance to get it\nSarah this is the time of year that editors like yourself story page editors really do hear from the readers and of course\nUh the Arizona Daily Star has been making a endorsements uh can you kind of give us just who makes those endorsements can you give us a brief overall picture\nI Would be happy to um so\nI'm the editorial page editor and in the newsroom and newspapers generally speaking\nUm the news side of the\nNews room the reporters for news uh sports features a metro\nThey are separate from the editorial page we're editorial journalists we're opinion journalists um and so we are it's Luis Cosco myself or the editorial a department\nAnd um we as are part of what's called the editorial board which also includes our president and publisher John ... do in our newsroom top editor Jill Jordan spent so what we do is\nFirst fits is not some people think fits is said part of the board\nYeah fifties as David said some and used to be part of the board um there were a lot more people in the editorial department as well but um he is not a a on the editorial board so he does not weigh in on our endorsements\nSo we invite other candidates and the races that we've decided we're going to use our resources to a weigh in on and ah\nSometimes usually they accept sometimes they don't we like to have them in um all the candidates running in the same race at the same time 'cause it's kind of I mean you want to compare and contrast uh we do a lot of research on on the different candidates ah\nAnd then when it comes time to decide who to endorse we have lengthy conversations\nUm and that but it's a John Deere land or president publisher Joe ... editor movies Cosco the editorial writer and myself um we have we talked about things we\nAh go through you know what do we think about their position on education or the environment or economic development things like that\nAnd we go back and forth and I know a lot of people think that we\nOnly endorsed Democrats that's totally not true and some people think that we endorse Republicans only to throw a bone to conservative readers and that's not true either\nWe look at that can ah candidates and the given race and evaluate them I'm On the merits and sometimes people agree with that sometimes they don't but we're not saying you have to vote this way we're just saying we've looked at all of this this is our evaluate\nYour recommendation yeah OK gym or do you want to weigh in on that or can I Move on to some of your uh other state props\nLet's move on okay um the marquee prop would be the uh the energy one would you say prop one twenty seven clean energy\nI'd certainly say the most money is being spent on it and and a whole lot by ATF\nWho has been winning and a lot more politically in recent years a lot more aggressively uh and and definitely not and supported solar energy I we're we're saying yes on this one we think that\nAh that direction atheist wants to go in with a natural gas is is ah we you'd be better off going and literature solar given the amount of sunshine we have in our state and that's where the investments go\nUh basically there are are ah people who disagree with that assessment\nAnd vouchers that one you guys said no one\nVote no no no no no I was raised more money out of the public school system and and there's a whole bunch of flaws with this including the fact that there's no set aside for the very kids were being benefitted by this program at the man who are benefiting from this program at the moment the the disabled kids or the military kids are they\nNative American kids there's no set asides and this one is probably going to end up just helping people who can already afford to send their kids to a private schools to get a little bit of a tax break we think that's that's not what the program ought to be set up to be if you're going to send your kid to a private school you should foot the bill yourself\nSarah is they're going to be a place that someone who go to see all of your endorsements\nOn the other side of the glass engineering and producing the program the ladies up front or do such a great job as does Jerry Krause or five production\nManager ray Allen\nOur operations

praise or with a a Republican congressman who body slammed her record she thinks the left wing media would be any less intense attacking him and if we voted for him we'd be accused you want to set up a theocracy you want to take over the ... the country with Christianity\nShe'll be attacks are going to be justice extreme and we can't play that game like you said we've got a call balls and strikes\nOr leach is to to God and moral principles of what's right and wrong and then we elect officials shooting best carry out those things ... it's a simple distinction we after repeated over and over it's true\nThat the same people who were shame character matters in the days Bill Clinton say well we're electing a president not a pastor there there is hypocrisy but we ... everything the Trump does what we look the other way when he goes wrong you know she ... she didn't but if we call things as they are and explain why we voted and we don't have to bow down to the media narrative\nIs that that's why when he says the enemy of the people as the media I disagree with him and I suggest you stop that when he attacks makeup resent ski for a facelift dumping cruel I write that in the

in the public square holding up the banner of the gospel I asked then is pregnant my comment bet on Monday Night in Pittsburgh\nOr something I just I Can't remember I had been the the collapse of public Christianity is pretty complete and Michael noted the passing of\nOf Dr Graham as the last non partisan religious figure who could command the respect of everyone do you see any perspective for revival of public Christianity\nYes yes I Do but it has to start in a grassroots way to a certain extent ... have been looked at as an appendage of the Republican Party and its mistake we made before she with moral majority and things like that\nWe have to have a certain independence we may vote a certain way that we have to be a sure have a certain independence almost is God's independent party and if we can on the ground\nGame he respected people just like a lot of people didn't like Trump but they're voting for him because the economy's better when people in a neighborhood she Christians doing good and helping the poor when Christians shack good moral examples well we're not beleaguered by every kind of scandal I Believe that there can\nBeleaguered by every kind of scandal\nI Believe that there can be an amazing awakening when you look back in American history\nAnd the Seventeen hundreds or religious leader shame Christianity was expiring was breathing its last red Eighteen hundred it's reported that chief justice John Marshall said that the church is falling to find ever recovered April Nineteen sixty six time magazine headline is God dead\nFive years later headline DeJesus revolution so we've had dark spiritual times before we've had spiritual option doubt I Believe that can be an awakening that it has to start on the grass roots and then we need more prominent leaders who are not so associated\nWith the party with the candidate liked Dr grant\nAnd in that sense we need to be a prophetic voice to the president as well as just society I absolutely believe it's going to happen but we've we've got to sort our way through this political minefield eight and then he has a grassroots revival on the ground where we live get respect of our community that will change the nation\nMy last question for you Dr brown author of Trump is not my savior in bookstores everywhere do you pray for the media even the liberal left wing media\nOf course of course he's not my enemies like when I was Fifteen Years old I was a heroin shooting LSD and crazy grab all caught up in the sixties rebellion if I could have mercy on someone like me and changed me or or you think of the people like Chuck cautious\nWe lost a pastor\nThere there's no reason not to pray change can come to any one therefore I pray for it and worked for\nA great to talk with you Michael Brown he is

I think so I have a clip of that's going to pull up it's about a minute and a half two minutes long it's by an author her name is Arlene hostile the book is called deep stories of our time and\nUm basically what she did she's at Berkeley professor right and she goes to Louisiana and lives for five years and beds herself in Republican land in red land to find out what's going on as a sociologist trying to get to the root cause of why this tension what is the rise of Trump and it's going to go to a lot of these conversations were\nAdam or a friend of ours I forget who it was was the right before the election was driving through Baton Rouge I mean I hadn't thing and I remember they said they passed wherever Trump was doing his each right and they just couldn't believe it was six o'clock in the morning for four o'clock speech you know and they were lined up outside right and she and she's a Democrat and she's like\nI think this guy's going to win right so that Alexander ...\nAnd the metaphor for the right wing deep story\nThat I described in strangers is that you're waiting in line\nFor the American dream that you feel very much to surf it's like a rating in a pilgrimage into my mind movie\nThen has or fear tired feel your properly deserving of this real bored that's a hat and the idea is you know the crunch any one right right okay this in this\nRight deep story don't begrudge anyone or not a hateful person but you see them a second moment of the right wing deep story somebody cutting had a few big why are they getting special treat and then in another moment\nOr the president of the country Brock Obama who should be tending fairly all\nWaiters in line seems to be waving to the line cutters and he in fact\nIs he a line cutter\nThe idea then okay how did his mother she was a single mother not a rich woman for Harvard education long the education something fishy map and that was the thought there\nAnd so in the final moments someone\nFrom the coast has someone\nHighly educated someone for that so called elite turns around and\nAnd uh if you're really close to the prize or they have the price but they turn around and look at the other two are waiting in line\nAnd said oh you backward southern new educated\nRace is max access to a homophobic ... and then that is that a strange thing to that insult\nAnd that sounds like strangers in real money and they would say one man told me I live\nYour metaphor another one said you read my mind uh another one said no you have it wrong that the people are waiting lender pay for the line concerts and that's why we're in range and others oh look we leave that line we succeed in getting another leader yeah\nThen there's a lot of truth to that and that's why that Tea Party thing that we all son at the beginning of this\nMhm that's what those people they were looking for a voice because they felt like strangers in their own land right this is in the country I was a part of what's going on I'm seeing on the wrong path and we and we were all we all went to these things run Joe you and I spoke to at two of them\nAnd the idea that they're trying to compare those folks who felt like strangers in their own land to the mob of people walking around with the China hats on their head and scraping the doors of the Supreme Court is a huge insult to those ... ... back to insulting that people on the line\nWhen when does the Democratic party realized that dog don't hunt and we're on the wrong\nPath I bring on it and I'm like any other than that they're ever going to get it but is it not working but I Would you keep it out there so committed to the left there so committed to socialist policy as as being eventually the answer that I don't think you'll ever see them come around that's my personal view\nI mean you look at look at the Kennedy Democrat which is more conservative Democrat or the business demographic of Clinton even ran on this he moved to the middle and started talking about economic development and economics row for reform we're going to have to lose ... [laughter] All right well here's the thing they blew it I don't think I'm going to want to you on an American\nNightmare yeah an American nightmare is that all of these tactics right work the American nightmare is all of this stuff Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd the way they went after him and all of these little mini things that go on right and all the drama and bull crap rent right at all the fear\nOkay if they win using those tactics American Nightmare mhm yeah\nAll right 'cause now you're you're rewarding horrible behavior right right and you have a press that hates Trump's so bad that they'll they won't say a dying a word about the horrible behavior right right right so whenever\nWe not done that's where I keep going back to that stupid joke I just saw a survey okay and then I remember my analogy used to get those facts ads all the time and then all of a sudden you could get them because they didn't work then usually get emails man really are and that is you kind of get\nDesensitized to the stupid stuff are we at that point is like really really we're not\nWe're not getting paid you don't know this Joe grew up on a he grew up with cow's cattle graze cattle dogs right up in Wisconsin you something to use a a a little milk fact\nFor you on the American they give them and I thank you so I just saw survey yes somewhere between eight and ten percent of American survey a thousand Americans surveyed\nThink that chocolate milk comes from brown cows [laughter]\nThat only comes from round pals we're not adding the chocolate later at a factory or something like that brown cows produce\nHalf of all how to read I Believe in the education and the ... and then in the brain power of I'm actually on my way over being sucked in for a minute no I'm not that is it\nThat that is well it's a it's it's through they were right was it like ... percent or something like that one thing I Know every eight to ten per se eight to ten percent eighty allow even into the eight to ten percent of the people surveyed enough\nThings say that a chocolate milk only comes from ... [laughter]\nOkay you don't sound [laughter] I Know what I now I Know what's going on in this country\nBut we're a center right nation and we kind of happened for a while right when when Nancy Pelosi

you're seeing this was ... and they're not running out goofy lefty they're running to the center of the middle so we're center middle country so what point do we date is the Democratic party realized

I look at the people who have run in the last couple of years\nReally good people Margaret Burke holder Kelly law and these are good people running for this thing rather how many times we look to change the voting process and they're going to have but that's why I'm Single I still I've given up right that's what I read in the Republican Party should just say no we're not run and I'm Renee who started legislator count the paint member all that stuff so so that's where you're\nTaking with as sales sees as healthy as a nonpartisan organization but the reason that we know that we need to work with all the policy makers that are in the seats and so that's why I Will continue to be a nonpartisan organization because having that access to having the discussions and sitting down and change\nIn this direction you mentioned it the cameras on the brake are on the air it's going to be slow\nIncremental if at all you know sometimes I can see already started oh well I got to let the fact of the matter is gonna be alive is this is very much in our society now we've got too many people that are willing to throw their hands up in the air sure and just say forget it I mean and you're seeing that both on the the D's and the ours right now about talking about not coming out and voting\nBecause they don't like who the party picked in the primary\n... head I'd like to I mean if you get the ah you're adding machine out real quick I write\nSo I Want I Want to do I get my calculator you know it's I always knew something rather started out the ...

going into the tax alright here let's go back to the perfect point\nLet's get real quick we are going to talk about citizens initiatives and one of the things when when we're talking about what Joe affair you set a very interesting comment which is there's one way we should make them harder\nBut then also make them easier what did you mean\nBy that well it's you know the citizens initiatives just to me and I you know\nAnd like one of the earlier callers I've only been in Tucson since the Nineteen Ninety nine a but it seems like in the last several years we've had just an influx of legislation through initiatives right or some of it's being sent down to us you know by by the legislature 'cause it's it's some of the tough calls that's on the things they can't do but\nThere's so many things that have made the citizens' initiative inside Arizona the way that we are going to legislate and what I mean by there are a lot of people in the ... in the state that feel it should be harder to put him on the ballot that way only be really truly important things but my argument against that is that means only the people with a lot of money including outside interests will get them on the ballot\nBut we also need to make them easier and that is for true Arizona and in citizens to have a say citizens' initiative was something\nIn two thousand or a Nineteen eleven and we tried to become a state and were denied by the federal government it was for two reasons one we had this thing called citizens' initiative aunts that initiatives in our constitution and the other one was because we had the ability to recall judges\nWriter and they didn't like that well\nTook a year to smooth some of the rough spots that in our constitution but citizens' initiative state and if you look at the map of what states have citizens' initiative they're almost all western ride ... it is truly something that occurred in the Eighteen sixties to to throw in the early Nineteen hundreds saying we\nA little bit of we don't trust our government we want to make sure the citizens of the of the state have seen it\nBut over the time it's it's it's more if we had a hundred and Ninety nine citizens' initiative since Nineteen twelve a lot of them have affected everything from mandating spending to how we can vote\nTo who how ... can run for public office and matter of fact fifty percent of our state legislator spending down to the budget is voter mandated through citizens initiatives so\nThere's no good answer if you make it real harder it's going to be big money interest ... probably big money interest from outside the state that come in you know we know we're probably face another uh initiative on legalization of recreational marijuana soon because there's a lot of money behind that movement\nThroughout the U.S and they can do that we've had another version or read for it's going to come around ... absolutely and and so it is one of those things where\nIt's a fine line I don't think is a state we want to eliminate them hard of our history part of what we want to do but at the same time um\nYou know maybe maybe it's a combination of reducing the number of signatures that really enforcing the strict compliance\nSo what's the negatives right now than you think uh in the the citizens process well all the negatives how can we counter them in the future\nThere's two things that I see it being a big problem one is the fact that it there's no difference in the state of other than the number of signatures you have to get\nThis is the fact that it there's no difference in the state of other than the number of signatures you have to get there's really no difference in the state between a constitutional initiative which you can change the constitution embed something that which makes it very very difficult\nProposition of sorts with the number one is that exactly\nAnd we're put so therefore when somebody comes into the state particularly with outside money which means there's gonna be a lot of money to gather the signatures 'cause you know paying paying for signatures is something that occurs just does a\nThat's problematic to me because\nYou see stuff being put forward to the constitution that doesn't belong there such as tax policy right and\nOn prop one to seven which that sale season adamant no against we're putting energy requirements this energy the way we can get our energy is changing dynamically year to year yet we're going to bed it in our constitution that saves says what type of energy we have to use for ever\nSo what's the pushback on 'cause if it's a citizen initiative right if you're going to pay a company so many ah dollars per signature does that take away the idea\nOf a citizens' initiative ... what it does it doesn't take away that ideas says initiative what it does is incentivize is the person gathering signatures\nTo I'm not tell the full story about what you sign it I mean you know where we get hit there's there's this a\nSlide that we we had one of our presentations on is an issue that said you know basically I can I talk to you for a second are you a Democrat and the answer from the uh other character in the slide was it depends what one would get me out of having to talk to you and signed what you're asking me right so so it's really in that way\nIt's taking away from the idea that the citizens are the ones behind this\nIt's really not about whoever can gather the signatures grassroots efforts were you know the ... the people that we know in our friends with that they're heading out signatures in each gather may only collect twenty five a hundred signatures that's different than something when you're just inserting paid circulated providers and gathering you're required two hundred and fifty\nThousand is an unbelievable amount of out of state money that comes in to pay for the prepaid and shove the some of the stuff down your throat\nThat's exactly what we're talking about here because if you look at both one twenty six\nWhere uh the national association of realtors invested in gathering signatures then you look at one twenty seven where an outside California billionaire came in I mean one twenty seven forty million dollars are going to be spent his life is spent is being spent on prop one twenty seven forty million is now leads among repeal it is now the largest\nThe largest financed\nVote for and against initiative in the state of Arizona in ... and it's been and forty million in six months how much do you think they're going to get back\nIn the next ten years yeah and there there's a lot of things that have been that way so it it's\nI Wish we had an answer Chris but\nSo here's a question for you um if I was going to look at if there were good changes made in trying to make a citizens' initiative more pure okay what was it a more pure um campaign finance report look like who would be the the the ... it would have just be citizens stroking checks\nTowards that and local groups would have been at that point what happens is the ... the national groups can feed it through the\nLocal group so what does that how does that how was how would you make that\nThat's the challenge of of your money drives everything in politics it it it it just doesn't so that's the challenge is is there a way that you can put that outside funding can't come into the state the answer is probably no 'cause like you said they'll funneled through local grocer\nYou can do is making all these goalie individual contributions and that's the only that's the only I think that's the only way you can really minimize agree\nAnd if it's a citizens' initiative that may be a valid\nPoint unless you are a citizen it's coming from individuals you cannot fund the the the the camp but maybe not even the campaign but at least the process up to getting the initiative on on there because the fact of the matter is these outside interests have had no qualms saying who's funding\nI write one twenty seven it's very clear where the money's coming from\n'em and they're not afraid of doing it because in their their mind I heard I heard one of the cause was\nTheir belief is while they they've got all the money to do it they're really got that national level perspective of each day well remember we are a United States of America were republic right at and we we've given up some of our control in our state despite trying to keep it through things like substance initiatives in our constitution\nThis one twenty six what's so interesting of all the calls that I've gotten about the ballot propositions right with the questions but the charter school one people are still trying to figure that one out okay the citizens of clean elections one they're still trying to figure that one that uh they're beautifully written I fit sarcastically right ah but one twenty six\n[noise] this is what I get cars on my recommendations I'm a no one one twenty six I don't where are you going to sale season on one twenty six as well so what happens is they go to the whip open their guide right and they see one of the other arguments against it is state senator Steve Farley even my mother called me up and said\nAll right I Love you but you got to call me up and please tell me why you in the Farley or agreeing on this proposition ... and the number one call I've got\nOne on one twenty six though I mean a state our ... our state representative and potentially our state senator or Vince leach very small government very no tax person he's opposed is when you're ... college both\nOpposed to the to the same initiative something's wrong with the guy ... come out against it it is putting one it's a solution\nLooking for a problem the problem doesn't exist right now it doesn't there's no move in our state legislature we have two thirds protection\nTwo thirds vote required to increase any tax so that's protected and you have to get through a governor's signature right but what you were doing is you're saying tax policy should be part of the constitution instead of tax policy being determined by our legislatures in our elected representatives if it gets\nWhen I was talking with as you said David Oppenheimer [laughter] as when I when I had discussed one twenty six with him at one of the uh one of the public forums\nIt gave him an aha moment 'cause he said so\nThis release forces us to a direct democracy\nVersus a representative republic and we'll represent a republic we elect our elected we've used the line before with you the government we've got the government we want because the government we vote for and if we get away from that and try to take everything to an individual boat we've we've lost what the core of our country\nAs we come back I wanted to ask you talk to you a little bit about the the ... the legislatures ability to kick things to the proposition I don't know if that's really good thing either I\nHold on a whole lot Ted Mack hotter than our leadership council or you're listening to the ten thirty ... at Alexander spending the soon\nWe're kicking off Monday we've we've got a chock a block of today for Monday

need to be\nReally um computer savvy and technologically savvy and you need help spaces for people to\nGet down and dirty and talk on the phone without being interrupted so design is tiny involving like always an office space to killer and I'm kind of going morphine in terms of like usually are typically think that the topic\nIs why is this ... been ...\nWhat is why is this he'd been I'll also a longtime member of this group that is correct what ... what what what why is this group important to you and your business what do you like about this group\nThe camaraderie a we have a lot of people in this group for a long time and so when during this group I was a very young businesswoman and this group was\nNot filled with women in fact it was a pretty much in a men's only grip so when I joined it was just starting to become more women were members\nAnd I think having the ability to engage with a lot of different businesses and particularly\nOlder men who you know may not have had\nThe experience of working with women and ownership roles being young you know they took me under their wing and stuff like that like this was a good group to get to know\nHow to work with different ages and understand different business type and since I'm a commercial interior designer that's what I needed needed to understand how different businesses work\nWith a business lesson you learned from this group that's helped you and your business\nListening is probably a big thing and interior design is kind of a weird topic um most people they look in HDTV and they think decorator and they\nThey won the pillows but it was really different type of business model problem solvers really listeners we want to be able to fix something that's keeping you from being productive and so when they get a hold of that\nAnd they see that we actually provide value for their business\nThan it makes a big difference so you know talking to a bunch of guys about interior design sometimes is a little challenging but once they figure out what what I'm capable of doing they're very happy Tammy how\nIf someone's listening right now who want to talk to you about what you do and maybe they'd like to hire you how would they get a hold\nOf you to my Web site at um U.

first started up here my thought was to network find some people that I can network with for the good of my business and what I found is that\nThe networking it really isn't all that critical to me it's the relationships that I find that are most critical and most are really fulfilling and out of that desire for the relationships the business leaders happen sure they just happened and it's it's way better than actually force\nThat is good and great for my business\nVery cool so that is a southern Arizona rain gutters incorporated his name's ... how do they get a hold of you Brian if they

other is the business association of zoos that\nI've been a bat members since two thousand one so and and I give an enormous amount of credit to this organization for\nEighteen years as a financial adviser and successful here in Tucson so why do you love this group so much because he loved the script I loved the script yes when I Need somebody to do something somebody knows um has a referral for me but this group is how I learn news\nWhat's coming into town but it's at business networking you know if you show up it works and it for fifty years in the making I've always said that this is a huge accomplishment for Tucson to have that survived for ... years in the ebb and flow and all the people everybody knows\nThat script you can't you just are amazed by their role at access kind of something\nThat I'm very true about some of the things that's part of the guys were sharing what are some of these upcoming commercial projects or business\nGoing on that don't show up at the newspaper or might show up two months later right and that really kind of gives you that pulse of what's going on in Tucson right between bad and wake up to some just recovered on a lot of the oh\nAbsolutely and anytime belly market shows up at a meeting I always learn something it's like how did you do this you know he is so on his fingers on all these people I Know I Know they're just really having a good time so it's just if you don't need a chair to read the newspaper when you go to a networking business group\nAnd learn things before I even had said the press sounds unit vantage yeah so yeah\nSo um but thank you so much Chris an ad you guys are doing a great job this really came out beyond my expectation today so we're not feel your folks around me too shy but they have they come through with that while I'm really glad\nBut I just I hate to think what they think of me after the right values I didn't have a ton on Tracy Jordan who's going to be in charge and she'd be lovingly Muslim yes she can she she's awesome and I'm here you go\nThank you thank you badly Tracy Jordan Tony loving insurance good\nMorning how are you doing fantastic\nLet's embarrass Betsy tell me

a commercial insurance agent so I Am sure businesses I focus on personal property John ...\nA great time and have a lot of fun and how long you been able to sixteen years so congratulations thank you very much how long you been hanging out with these guys oh my gosh since two thousand and four oh wow we're really pioneer was Betsy ... wouldn't give it up to the world former president of the former president yup\nWe moved over to a local business a local restaurant we were at a more of a new franchise right and then we came over a puck on mom's during my term it was really important to me a good more local businesses\nSo every Wednesday morning seven o'clock\nYou're doing amazing breakfast with the folks here a ... a month and the and I think a very nice of you know and so for you growing your business other than in on top of the referrals and leaves in that network cause your network determines your net worth what else have you learned to make you a better commercial insurance agent\nYou know I learned something from every individual here every business owner every person they they have such\nWonderful gifts and if you listen to them they have such great ideas and it's about forming were more of a family than we are just a networking girls we do things together we rely on each other\nWe call each other for help for assistance [noise] more than I Would have ever expected front and that was\nWhat is your ah when you do when you go visit with a company what is the number one uh most glaring absence of their insurance coverage that usually is the one you kinda go more often go and kind of need to bump that up where would you what would you say\nI Would say employment practices liability\nThat sounds exactly right yeah yeah ... become it's become a nightmare and um I Would encourage all of your listeners who are business owners\nTo talk to their agents about ... coverage\nI Would like to add to that because you're totally correct is how many how many employers when they are have\nA issue with an employee\nNever put anything in a file about that employee like eighty percent of you know then what happens is when you do have to let them go and there's some sort of conflict\nYou like oh let's look at the file whom food to write down everything and put it in a file folks\nAbsolutely absolutely and a lot of these policies and the carriers well actually have HR departments that you can rely on correct\nSo it's really kind of a no brainer you're getting you're getting the help from the H R department and you're having the coverage help you in those instances and hopefully avoid those instances\nSo I have a few friends of my life that owned companies to transfer to different companies that own different kinds of companies that have no employees because of this is such a way\nYeah I mean that's that's possible but it's certain companies are growing so quickly right ...\nThey can't find enough people that's also problematic because you don't have control earlier right\nAnd then you have in turn over and then you're so busy that you're not you know you can't take that extra ten seconds to fill out a employee or a reprimand piece of paper and throw it in manila folder\nYeah so it it's critical\nHow do people get older you Tracy Jordan\nUh you can call me at code eleven and five seven one one nine zero zero or go on to our website W. W. W. Cody K O T Y heights I Love it and a key dot com\nGood spelling or like that Tracy Jordan code eleven insurance amazing to see you again young lady and her light wave technical consulting what's up there\nHey Scott thank you so much for uh actually putting this on and then being here with us and given us an opportunity to one or talk about uh the business association a Tucson but also promoter on businesses\nThat is what we do we advocate for small business and we are shameless wonders on her show\nWith a bat that robot we Shane Mosley plug it doesn't matter whether you're in the grocery line or a family member or wherever we're where we're at\nI mean the great thing about this group for fifty years has been that steady peace where they have a the members have\nSought out to care for other Tucson ends by giving them solid referrals to people within this group\nSo Erik Larson first segment says number one the first thing you learned being in this group is always have your business cards right in Iraq you're pregnant I Walk out of the door and forget your ... it's I think I don't even say lugging\nYeah it's like having your sort in your pocket or you know a weapon in your pocket always writing like a weapon isn't actually hurt anybody it's really about serving other people whether it's your own business um or you know we carry around a a a bad book\nWhich has a multiple copies of everybody's business card and we're always ready to pull out and flight out and say hey well call my friend Bill Nelson or\nCall my friend Dick Tracy Jordan you know you have you know we open conversations have you talked about employee employer insurance what's that have you talked about cyber policy I'm an IT person right you know it's easy to just open that conversation do you have a cyber policy I don't even know what that is\nYes I Am over fifty so yes I I Am ... thank you that was not an old\nJoke you made it an old joke I'm just saying you're vast experience\nYes I have lots of experience with in this industry and many other job\nIf you were sitting with are doing a seminar for small business owners and what is the top two mistakes that they make when it comes to printing and promote stuff\nThey want to spend too much on big item orders and they don't want a handout watts of things that are less expensive to get more of the word out there is the biggest thing parents are very inexpensive get lots of them passed milk is people do not throw them away they use more time\nIn business cards they're inexpensive these days full color get them done past not wherever you go to the Asian keeping your pocket all the time and your name always gets out there and I saw nice thick business cards with nice feeling to them nice texture and people don't put them down there don't throw them away\nThat or the end it's about name recognition direction and connecting to what you do\nExactly and also your logo do not allow anyone to change your logo smart shutdown changed the aspect of it changed the cause of it your logo is your identity keep your identity out there all the time so people recognized you whether you're walking down the street driving your vehicle or you're in a restaurant and you see that pan or that that logo you always are recognized\nIt's like political science right the people who put a zillion things on there that you don't understand\nExactly but fortunately those go away after the election right\nSo it was talking to our friend congressman Schweikert recalls up when you go to Scottsdale where he's a he has this big giant six foot signs that just say his last name right he's like I'm not trying to get my history I just want when you get to the polls you go see Schweikert fighters writer for oh\nYou have brand recognition cause outweigh the bigger the better and one of my pet peeves is too small you can't read it to the honesty of a type people throw it away 'cause they cannot see or read what you're trying to say\nAnd how does someone set up a cup of coffee with you to find out more about what you do and how you can help their business\nCalled me at five to zero seven nine to one one to two or email me David ... print the letter and AS Nancy promos with an S. dot because\nThis is the kind of guy who won on your corner as you're building your business so billion more to go I haven't seen ... and

dad yes ...\nYou gotta you started a company and Seventy five and I took it over in two thousand twelve and still don't strong same office or the same office since Ninety One before then we were at Columbus and speedway\nSo my brother and I used to having insurance brokerage right above your does yep\nThere was a travel place of Harvey ...\nYou got it we're still there the travel people have long on come into the prince of Bel and you gotta thank you\nVery right before he gets to the country club it's on your website and uh tell me about the world of a real thing for you right now our\nReal estate is great right now we are the biggest thing right now in Tucson actually feel like it to get traction because we along with the home sales were getting a new job announcements\nSo feels a little bit more real than the past or early to thousands\nSo that's great and I you know finally people are starting to have a little bit more money in their savings account so they can invest in their homes they can move up they can invest in their businesses find a little bit better location so things are good right now with the hot spots from town right now I mean uh everyone wants to be downtown we'll see what happens ah\nThat's where everyone wants to be but then when you actually do that the ... a mandatory out of the Internet or it's really hard so I mean you're going to have the popular ones Sam use a central to sounds really popular right now because a lot of the people want a little bit bigger backyard that wants to more space\nSo a lot of ... you know rejuvenation around the world valley still strong oh yeah I mean when you're coming from out of state you're going to pull up and you know that's where you're going to go first is like okay where they get schools\nOh I see a veil zero I see that you know ... or amphitheater and so people kinda migrate towards their and then once they get their feet wet and they you know maybe they want something a little different than they change that eventually\nYou'd been pretty involved with this group tell me why are these guys are important to him\nSo I was invited by a lake Munro and two thousand eight and a you know when the economy tanks you got to change your business a style so that's when I joined elite group and these guys are great because um I help them with all sorts of needs are and they reciprocate a ...

go to for\nThe number there your number one abilities that take umbrage with something now um\nYes [noise] and and and and look ... our ... ... ... ... it's a well it is what it\nIs the last night I was watching a little bit of this debate with your fellow congressmen\nMr ... looks like he was going to fall asleep on the podium but he is the first thing out of his mouth and why he needs to be returned to be reelected back to the house is the evil tax cuts OK and now all of a sudden he's a big deficit hawk and he cannot believe\nThat there's the seven hundred million dollar deficit can you explain to play folks even with economic growth the way it's going why is there a deficit because this is one of the big you want fake news that's the one that the Albert hall the thing that\nIt's that thing and ... and also um bunch of the Democrats now are pro free trade\nBecause the president as you know is adopted slightly more the Democrats yuan trait right and give the trade skeptical so um yeah if it's black it must be white yeah it's All right\nThe number and I will get this for next week because I I've tried to get\nBack in D.C okay I'm In the vast majority of the yeah\n... ... excuse me up the deficit this year the other shortfall this year is actually in is to program Social Security and Medicare\nAnd that's really uncomfortable for folks to talk about that and it was the tax reform but once again the tax reform was going to cost one point or cruel you know over ten years right\nThe gross from it has been dramatically higher than we expect it so it turns out things like like it you know your Social Security or payroll Medicare taxes have come in from medical higher than we expected salt and said now we have a positive those accounts\nRight like if you actually in ... where's the shortfalls come from a big chunk of it is was to step up making up the ... military\nBut the Democrats so yes ... wants to play what was structural on the tax reform it's actually finally growing the economy\nSo we have the chance of having a much bigger ... because we're ... ... if it continues over the next few years we can have a much larger economy\nBut also because of the sixty votes of wrestled them Senate we had to put a bunch of stuff in there also correct to that's why there's a lot more spending also\nNow a lot of that that the spending team I'm an avid ... objects and what not and the tax reform\nI mean I'm just on the budget I mean on the budget said\nOh yeah yeah in the budget because there's you know there's a lot of members and the president said we need to pick up I'm a maintenance issues and those in the military well because the sixty vote rule in the Senate for every dollar you want to put in the military you got to put a dollar and to\nTalk about real quick and we keep I always we for years we keep hearing infrastructure infrastructure we see you know inner states that are falling apart you know I remember the John Oliver thing about how many bridges or blow you know are basically\nNot so great in this country so tell me where where where everyone says infrastructure is there any chance of any infrastructure deals bill ... yeah what what were we out with a\nTrip I say it's all about financing right um gas tax\nOnly raises a faction of what people actually think at that\nAnd now the cars and trucks have gotten so efficient now that you start to see the electrification of so many vehicles\nUm gas taxes are functionally flat some areas reaches the country they're actually going down so you're going to have to think about how do you find new infrastructure particularly world weight infrastructure\nUm and then you have to deal with every other group think what you want to watch your damn well we want you to do this flood control project we want to re we want you to do so you you you now have to fight through all the special interests\nBut I Know Trump piled ... proposed the idea of matching funds for what a local community comes up with is that a good way to do this\nYeah they may be that it may be also a combination of bats mail to have you with lots of different silos of revenue um something that maybe you take energy leases and bond that money\nAnd then use the energy at least the the suffering from that um energy production to pay off the bond there's we actually have a whole plethora of mechanism 'cause you can't do it like we did fifty years ago twenty five years ago of well\nWhat kind of finance it through some general fund revenue\nAnd the gas tax it's just not enough money gotcha okay\nAh I had a couple of quick questions for you then I got to actually end our conversation because I Am and bumping you for the\nPresident I Know I Know I\nBeen from so [laughter]\nUh one of the uh state propositions in Arizona this year do you find particularly offensive real quick\nBut this year do you find particularly offensive real quick\nYeah\nThank you [laughter] oh I mean\nLook I think actually in some ways are all the understandable um what's striking is like on on on something like ... um I you see some of the rhetoric around it and going oh come on\nIf you get a little nervous that some of the folks that took the ... the state passed legislation referred it to the ballot\nWhat's the ultimate motivation ... to ...\nYou were nervous of having certain people show up in your school district because they know those parents are so choice\nUm you're you're you're hoping that the motives are truly all altruistic and not sort of targeted on 'em ... potentially poor people who might want to take advantage of parental choice right okay\nSo you're you're you're you're you're ... you're in now on that or are you at all you know I guess you're yes on three oh six yeah I I\n... I support what we know that still fought\nThree or five I Apologize tell me about once before we go one twenty six the thing that's no tax on a service ever again what do you have\nIt's not uncommon do on a\nPersonal this one I struggle with a little bit because I'm not comfortable really doing tax policy through the ballot box in the actual you plug it into the constitution and look this partially comes 'cause I used to be the church or to because they all in the\nCounty treasurer for Maricopa um what happens is Twenty years from now the economic base here is much more technology and services\nRight what it means is even higher sales tax base which is the majority of their revenue get shifted in ... it was small portion of the economy um it would be very hard to sort of balanced access correct\nWell sir I'm I'm going to a thank you for everything that you do good luck and all your reelection stuff we love when you call every Thursday\nOh it is at least I bake if if you're out their mail your ballot in um you know folks that it it ended up sitting on the ballot kill it because I don't think they realize how much money goes into chased\nThe again that we keep saying that there have been our mind for for the last week since last Thursday is you got a pop it and I got I got candidate saying what can they do I like go figure out and get these people to vote these Republicans because of the\nLook if you go to the New York times whole you know called white poll go Google that and take a look at what's happening in the U.S Senate race with Sally cinema\nAnd ... they have a one point right now over some gun but if you look down into it you notice that we have a more normal turnout\nUm ... wouldn't buy a lot right it's just they're all modeling that a bunch of Republicans aren't going to mail the ballots second\nAnd Alexander play an annoying song that's been a David Schweikert on the road\nMaybe break your heart\nHave a good day buddy seven twenty seven morning Eric Trump coming up next seven nine zero twenty forty wake up you know\nWho's been master joined is during the noon hour for the Buckmaster show I'm am ten thirty veal why Tucson where you\nAre my team\nFor terms and sixteen years on ... to ... watch\nAnd what is the U.S do you have to show for twenty closed schools the loss of over Fifteen thousand students overcrowded classrooms

... leather furniture ... furnishings from old Mexico finally granted in ...\nI think the dynamic of the Republican Party has changed I mean I think\nI think the Republican Party under my father had tremendous backbone um they're willing to fight and and I think he's been a great leader in that way Lindsey Graham was incredible I mean what he did there was nothing short of extraordinary um it was passionate smart um you know um it was it was quite emotional\nUm but but Lindsey Graham was was was amazing because look at that just a shame that the whole hearing was I forget about that the second half of it was for it but if the first half\nAnd you know cabinet goes he sits down on the first day of of testimony he said it's been nine thirty in the morning the Democrats you know they're they're all running for you know for president on that stage you know your Spartacus up they're giving you know these you know long winded speech is\nKevin I didn't get to speak his first words until three thirty in the afternoon I mean\nI don't care what side of this thing you're on I don't care for you know a a Supreme Court justice that comes in as a Republican or Democrat that's not what Americans want to hear I mean Americans want to hear the actual confirmation or you know the maybe the largest job interview when the world that they want to hear from from the nominee\nYou know so so this grandstanding and that was taking place on the bench that lasted what seven hours before the guy got to speak for ... the whole thing was a circus and\nUm everybody should condemn it and uh and I'm really glad the Republicans had the backbone to stand up to uh to the nonsense\nAnd my last question is do you think the Republican Party is doing a good enough job could telling America that all of this economic\nUh all the economic benefits that's going on right now is in Milwaukee about a month ago and their unemployment rates off the wall the housing markets rocking and this is a state that flip for your dad off of two years of Obama\nAre we are we doing are we doing a good enough job selling that to the people that that's my dear\nChris what I tell you that you know I people come up with all the time and say hey I'm you know I I've been a lifelong Democrat I open my four one K. the other day and and and I am voting for your father and perfect ... he I mean it's incredible it's allowed me to you know\nTo retire a few years earlier and I like I I I hear stories like this all the time would I Would I sincerely hope and people ... and people see it and people credit him with in America to us you know the coastal media might not but America absolutely does\nWhat I said surely hope is that there is there's no complacency where hey is the world's great we're doing well the economy's rock and ask it continue I don't need to go out and vote because it doesn't matter that couldn't be further from the truth I mean\nThe Democratic party will do everything they possibly can

... so I put it on Facebook Tuesday and we got like forty five responses with people saying here's some songs you could use the torture criminals\nSo that's what we're doing um I Know there's there's three things we want to cover today in relation to the future of what's going on with the surgery to green chamber green valley chamber of commerce so let's first in a let's talk about strategic plans stuff first\nEarlier this year we have some really wonderful I mentioned we have Eighteen corporate partners one of those is Freeport background and they constantly are investing in a dump programs that\nHe'll make sense I have longevity and uh and and and matter and one of those is we just felt like it was time to make sure that we were aligned and had a you know the right mission statement the right uh uh things that we needed to focus on is\nIt mission statement the right ah ah things that we needed to focus on his chamber uh the days of the chamber doing a you know simply parades and mixers and uh and you know networking opportune hold on I think I Wish we had ... yeah\nWe need more parades I'll disagree I Need for a while there's ... there's and and those are fine but today a small business people are faced with so many major challenges that are never used to before and\nAnd we we know what all the national research says we know that we can go on the website and find that out or you know all the law but we want to know what our business people really need and\nUh one of the things that are reporting ... did in addition to to aligning us by the way our new mission statement is championing opportunities for business and and our community to prosper and prosper means different things for not for profit is how many people we we serve\nOffer the small businesses are making sure that you're paying your employees in your products and and yourself and and you know paying for the insurance and all the things you need all your number one challenge that you hear from your your uh it's one of those three things you and I will talk about which is health insurance affordable health insurance that's the number one thing nationwide\nOh hello we have something called the Affordable healthcare act or ... no nap that said uh so you're saying that um basically two months ago the president a kind of the executive order yes that uh associations could have a little more freedom and doing a group plans yeah there's a the the\nOne thing that a ... among the things that are challenged ah for small businesses affordable healthcare and for them and their employees and they don't get the same advantages larger companies do to be able to invest in these\nPrimo products of you know of a dental medical and\nAnd a vision insurance and and they can't offer their employees that same thing well a President Trump made this a possibility so associations can now and chambers of commerce offer health care to a a a Ford will healthcare on ... on a group basis\nTo their members and so we've gotten together with eight other chambers of commerce in southern Arizona and we'll be rolling out on next ... next month\nThe opportunity for small business people to\nUh have a affordable health care that's free from some of the mandates or that the ADA has and ah and up in Nevada Clark County for example you can go to this and get more information they\nThey actually in Clark County have fought three of their chambers of commerce have gotten together again down here we are going to have an eight or nine a and they're providing a savings of roughly Fifteen Percent off of health insurance for other people and small business in over two hundred businesses have already signed up in less than three months\nSo uh we're excited about that that's one of the first things that were excited about we're going to be doing I'm as part of the agreement of with a ton of sorry to a business retention and expansion survey and that's something else at the the free poor ... people have funded\nAnd we're going to go out and conduct a minimum of twenty five businesses and salary than twenty five in green valley a upfront and personal you know one on one survey not the survey monkey stuff those are good but we're going to get get down in the weeds and find out from our small business partners\nYou know what do you need to do your business better and then we're going to customize what we do as a chamber again the praise are great and that kind of stuff but we want to really deliver a value uh and and help and expertise to our small business partners\nTell me about the and the old days um fire firebrand Randy Graf was very active in the public policy committee yes is that oh you guys still doing that kind of stuff\nWell a ... yes and I'll say a kind of a guarded yes you know we\nYou know we do some government relations in a you know things that are of what we're hearing strongly like for example this one twenty seven\nA prop one twenty seven is something that a universally we're hearing is just going to be bad for just about everybody imaginable fry and ah we're having some serious conversations at the chamber about whether we want to uh uh come out against that in a number of chambers across Arizona a I'm a ... a vast majority of chambers have come out strongly against that\nI Would say the only chamber they should come out against come out for it would be the green chamber possibly ah other than that yeah maybe even arrogance that I didn't even know I'm just I'm stereotyping the green chamber of people\nBut we're we're careful because we have you know we're representing a very as I had set a very broad expanse of of all kinds of businesses and and kinds of people that were serving and uh so we're careful about what we come out swinging the bad on um I I've course Randy would ah would\nAsk all either new board chair we're excited about that but right now he as he wants us to to to come out and take strong stands and uh again we we want to do so but we want to be careful and making sure that we understand all aspects of every issue before we do that\nI Would now let's get back to parades because you are my thing that ... to green valley needs to work on okay is really special events that are a little more attractive and more publicized to folks outside of the area\nYeah you know our biggest event of the year as a country fair white elephant a parade and one of the largest parades in the country\nAnd that's going to be happening on the Saturday a next Saturday a and and that's that's really a blast to watch but we have we're having more cutting edge things for example ... the doctor George Hammond from the University of Arizona has come down and talked about what's going on with the economy in southern Arizona\nIn our region a there is another guy by the name of ... who is one of the founders of constant contact\nHe's going to be speaking on November sixteenth about digital marketing and social media\nAre so we're trying to bring a more things of of great value to the business community and the community at large but you know larger events are we also have branded the region between\nAh know gallons and uh the crossing and I tend to nine Nineteen eighty nine teen and we call it the other southern Arizona\nAnd ah we're a partnering with the southern Arizona\nA arts and culture alliance to do events or next year\nAh we also hope to get more involved with al ... Tucson and know that there's talk about uh the possibility of veiled who are wanting to expand a one or two of their races down south and we'd like to play host and one of those in the future so we're actively are going to be involved in the race this year was a hope to attract\nThat Victoria steals true comprehension of issues in relation to the government\nWould be about the size of a tomato let's go tomato okay Randy fleenor in relation to his comprehension and intelligence on the issues is about a very he's about twelve he's about twelve pounds ...\nThat's the difference so the Arizona Daily Star one that they don't even mention on a Henderson exists is hilarious okay and shows how much of a bunch of Democrat ... they are number two to say that\nI'm Randy fleenor a bill number one such cherry tomato okay in relation to knowledge of issues and things like that\nFleenor\nAgain twelve pounds pumpkin to some variety of tomato for Victoria Steele now I'm going to tell you something if you put them in a real debate together Randy fleenor would destroy her on the issues now I Know they had this other one that went through but fleenor way better candidate\nThan um than Vicki steel and then I'm just telling you ah\nYou know on a ... a member of for her you on a single shot heard\nYou're a don't vote for it they'll say up to to just vote for one but here's here's the crowning achievement of the endorsements today\nFirst of all we have David they talking about David Bradley okay and he's running against Marilyn Wiles now David Bradley is one of those guys who when he was on this show two years ago and I asked him the most\nPressing issue in the state of Arizona\nHe said more dental care for children that was his number one pressing issue\nHe's laser focused that David Bradley laser focused on dental care so I don't know what kind of fluoride spending his water now\nNow we have um so he chose her him over I'm Marilyn Wiles\nShe's a smart lady she is really good\nI like their lines about David Bradley he believes in the long term approach the legislation which is mean wait ten more years to the Democrats take over the legislature and he might do something to keep re electing me keep re electing mean keep re electing me that's what it means\nMarilyn a his opponent Marilyn Wiles is a former federal government worker who runs her own consulting she has a conservative who says it's time for St ... but here the her she's quote fell short on her ideas refreshed but fell short on specifics\n\nBradley has fresh ideas any ideas players you know maybe it might be a nice guy but I'm not saying these bad guy I remember him sitting near as as a lump in okay\n\nDavid Bradley has fresh ideas any ideas plus you\nHave it might be a nice guy but I'm not saying these bad guy\nI remember him sitting near as as a lump in went okay you know maybe maybe you got something upstairs but you don't have any gr is my new that but anyway but now we have the representatives\nSide which is Claude filters race and there's two days right you've got this Christian angles are already there and then the amazing you guys know this guy Domingo the garage or you\nKnow Domingo right\nAd sounds familiar I'm just getting ... other than he has the same name as Ted right so a neat and attorney working in foster care and the department of child safety shares many of the same concerns including gun safety and judicial reform that's frightening okay\nNow here's the best part is the one that I Love about the the main go well 'cause I like to call them dum dum da garage sale okay\nNow this is the Arizona Daily Star endorsing dum de ... over caught filter okay on public safety issues the ... a Democrat\nSaid law enforcement should be properly funded not only to be well trained and well equipped quipped but also as part of support from the community that will help keep them in Arizona instead of joining departments elsewhere now\nThis is the fun part right this is just like me talking about a buck foster in the first hour saying that he's a big journalists that asks questions\nHere's the Arizona Daily Star in door seeing this Democrat because he says law enforcement on the state level should be properly funded\nAnd Alexander\nOne was the last time you saw the Arizona Daily Star\nSarah fit see ... or any of these folks are of course the little Timmy stellar right all of that folks Joey Joey Joey ... reported report supposedly some sort of a reporter now\nWhat are the any of them mentioned that the city of Tucson is has a under funded understaffed police department and this is a problem\nNot that I never never again guys I Know which I Know how you think you're not changing but stop sounding like a bunch of hacks\nSo you just said you're endorsing this the garage the guy 'cause he's really end up properly funding and staffing the police that the state level but you guys do they ever say anything\nI mean all these endorsements that you gave in the paper for all these dams running for city council have any of you ever put in your endorsement you know God\nGod staffing sucks up the city so Arizona Republic guys\nI Know ... hours on day was Arizona or they'll start tricked me a little bit but we're a little harder I mean this is your one of your most I Would say you know\nIn sip it slash uh what sort of ironic slash hypocritical winds you ever did is the Democrat really wants to fund cops that's why you should go to the state legislature\nReally over the entire state legislature you're going to worry what percentage is deeply ass out of the entire state legislature six percent\nFour percent I mean come on\nSomeone that I'm looking at some you possibly could be lower so\nThis is again Arizona Daily Star go hub yourself that's all and so I just have yourself 'cause\nYou guys are broken over there just broken\nEight forty six in the morning Christie ... at Alexander some Morrow mhm coached Tony a model
