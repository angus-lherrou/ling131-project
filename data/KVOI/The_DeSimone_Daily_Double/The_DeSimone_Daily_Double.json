I say that when it comes to religion and God I'll leave that morning Dennis but I Do know politics and government and I do know that we keep jumping over our guard rails which what the left and the Democrats and the media do when you find someone guilty without corroborating witnesses\nOr you go back to high school to examine teenage behavior or you don't allow people you disagree with their free speech or when our press leaves their objectivity behind and adopts the agenda of one of the parties they agree with\nSo I Want to follow up with what I began with when I filled in on the Larry Elder show on friday\nWe started with comments about the would be bomber's arrest I don't want to use his name to give them any publicity but how the media have used that to pile on President Trump how they along with the Democrats and the left all all the same thing these days\nTo claim that President Trump has created the atmosphere if not worse to encourage acts like it would be bomber\nNone of them like to see what Michael Moore suggested this last weekend as a quote\nThe threat of right wing violence against figures on the American left is not new is not an aberration is not a violation of norms it is the norm watch us reverting Murdoch's Fox News channel and right wing radio there we are have preyed upon those who've seen their American Dream go up in smoke\nAnd they have helped to create a generation of angry that's what you guys are angry and violent conspiracy theorists who believe any live is perpetuated on those airwaves\nThese angry right wing Maine oh it's really focusing [laughter] have been openly hopefully encouraged to act on those lies I guess he met openly encourage people to act on those lives even as late as this very morning when Trump was tweeting his doubts that the bombs were real [noise]\nSo that's just one example that the president tweeted the bombs may not be real since no one was killed I gotta admit before cross my mind too that maybe you know the bomber didn't want it to anybody who knows the bombs may have been threatened but it's not an outrageous says he wants to make it\nAnd why what's he done that while conspiracies on the right\nName some real ones of course not they never name and how about left wing conspiracy it dawned on me perpetuated by left wing channels what about that nine eleven never happened and that George Bush created it\nOr this this is when you may be familiar with that President Trump colluded with the Russians you've spent two years in that one and as far as I Know it's ...\nAnd President Trump was guilty of inciting the pipe bomber right that's the reason on or yeah as we said I Believe it or not in the ... attack on the Jewish temple\nAnd their unchallenged even on right wing Fox here he's picking on Fox out that I Want to defend them was former Obama official claim yeah that's what I ... to the President Trump's rhetorical helped lead to an environment in which the temple murder operate I think it was an assistant sector state I wasn't anybody famous\nOf course the president created an anti Semite or encourage them to create a tax or violence even though his grandchildren are Orthodox Jews and the murder made it clear he was anti Trump\nThe media will never give up on their agenda to blame him for everything bad that occurs and that the president's attacks on the media would not only fostering such a climate but we're unjustified see at Fox News hosts like Shepard Smith well you know which side he's on an even Chris Wallace in some ways joining that course\nAnd what some of them site is proof\nThe chance of lock her up\nThe phrase fake media Oregon worse for them the enemy of the people so let me address these issues by by the way tell me in the crowd that crowd first because it's a legitimate conversation to decide whether or not Hillary Clinton is above the law and should be charged and tried for the crimes she committed\nIn fact when I suggested on another national show where I was filling in for the week that I'd be willing to give her a path I felt this way I'll give her a pass on jail if she ... bill would agree to go away and leave us alone\nWhich obviously they would never [laughter] I was being facetious I Would be willing so to speak to let sleeping dogs live so one called challenge me and said I I Can't believe you mark I agree with everything you're saying as usually you often get that but you're suggesting that Hillary's above the law and she should get away with her crimes\nAnd I had to admit his challenge was more than fair and I couldn't really answer me except for what I'm kind of thought of afterwards it might be good\nFor the sake of the country not to put everyone through such a trial\nCan you imagine the outcry and the further divisiveness if that's even possible future that might bring to the country but that doesn't change the fact that the ... legitimate discussion to have about whether she should be tried for crimes especially since you got a free pass\nAnd we've now found out through the corruption at the highest levels of the state department and the FBI\nSo she really was never held accountable for actions and across to lock her up represent the average that people feel that she was given a pass and appears to be above the law\nNot unlike her husband who didn't go to jail for lying under oath of course the press doesn't do that they made it into you know he had this affair with an intern so because of sex that's why people wanted him to go to you know he lied under oath you don't have a system in in court if you can get away with lying under oath\nAnd the idea that this one set of rules for the Clintons and another set for the rest of us so corrupt he's not by any means and incitement to violence\nYeah the charge that President Trump calls the media the fake media and they get especially in order to what the charge that they are the enemy that people there'd be on the media is beyond outrage they really get on their high horse for that one and they're beyond offended\nBut it's also legitimate\nThe press not infrequently comes out with stories that are not true the latest example that you hear this one NBC was hiding ... story evidence in reference to the charges by Julie sweat Nick and her sleazy porn lawyer\nThat's Tucker Carlson is named for him and it's ... it's a good one [noise]\nIt seems NBC knew that she didn't even support her lawyers characterization of his claims that you saw Kavanaugh spike drinks or engage in gang rape you didn't hear that John I think I got something on Sean even hear that bit of news yeah\nThis so called serious offense is not outraged if you examine it from President Trump's respective or many of us\nThe media is huge power to influence the course of events and the public's perception of events so they're no longer object to reporters and a part of some sort of left which they have become\nThey will influence the people in a way that profoundly affect public policy\nDoes to the detriment of the truth so for example our talk about on the next our legal immigration debate with the media showing heart wrenching stories of children being ripped away from their mother\nNever mentioned the fact that none of this would happen if the mothers didn't bring them here in the first place you never hear that or the more salient fact perhaps that whenever someone who's guilty of a crime catch this their children are also so called ripped away from them when their parents go to jail\nThe children as far as I Know never go to jail along with their mother or father\nHow come that hardly ever Porter by the mainstream media so it can be put in perspective by the viewer or listener so the media shape the debate even in their use of the term undocumented well she lives on Fox News even though he more picked on them\nOr at least people on your side say let's go I like this Alan in California Allan you're on with mark\nBut you know my guy with the following that because I've been tracking up and even though he was not my birth you know earth than that I Would have voted for\nI can tell you that I Am

definitely a Republican pick up\nI think it is tied in Missouri I think that Indiana could be competitive or I Believe Montana will end up in the Democratic column\nI I didn't I didn't mention Montana that's going to take a lot more yeah\nAnd and the issue with Florida for your listeners is that the place that was destroyed\nWas the place that was the strongest Republican votes that there'll be fifty thousand or less Republicans voting because there are no places to vote to Arnold schools there is no electricity we are twelve days away for Thirteen Days away from\nThe election they don't even have only place\nAnd they've got no place to go\nI read I was in Tampa last week and I read the governor's executive order on this and the one who wants to vote they will come and find you and let you vote by a mobile machine you got to look in this call the\nVoter registration let me talk to you about\nUm Martha Maxwell in Arizona or because I think Christian cinema\nThat is not fitness serves a based on what she said and Martha McSally first woman attacked pilot in combat history in America I Can't believe that's going to because I just can't\nI Can't see that being any more than two points in either direction and I think that that one is\nIs done yet I think that that by the way Martha McSally clearly has the momentum\nAnd this caravan that's making its way to the border believe me in the research I've done in Arizona immigration is the number one issue and they are set up with people coming across the border with out efficient effective border security that has said democratic challenger is very tough\nWell known in Arizona that one is still too close to call\nYou know what's good news there is a doozy is robbing and the governor's race I'm back to big pharma one more word on the caravan I ah it's up to according to some reports eleven thousand other reports fourteen thousand and it's getting amazing press conference how does that play in the elections Frank\nThe public looks that goes from says why do we have no control over borders why is this still happening to us and they ... and here's what's interesting uh the vast majority of Americans want to compromise they're willing to accept a path\nTo legal status or citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants what's so the so called DREAM Act in return for some sort of a barrier and genuine border security with the American people are saying is first fix the border\nThen why should we punish those who came here to no fault of their oh I Know a lot of your listeners don't like that second part but the majority of Americans support\nBoth actually my audience is very much beyond that my audience is profound some pro regular as they shouldn't be on DACA my audiences reasonable it's Ninety percent of Ninety percent agree people that were in the country already or not lawbreakers can stay but we want to double sided strong tall fence with a road between it\nAnd I know my I I've been talking about this for Fifteen Years of my audience there you'll find other audiences that are harder line but my audience is very\nVery smart very apple and very educated very a Christian very they failed people who do not want to punish anyone\nNow Frank what should a Republican candidate B. saying about drug prices what should they be saying about big farm and and you also it's also the other no my brother worked for almost seven years as a research toxicologist for big pharma\nI Know the good that they do the drugs we developed everybody gets that but this pricing it's crazy what should a Republican say on the stump about big pharma\nThat they should get it if the pharmaceutical companies refused to do it voluntarily the\nPublic does not want to invade the free market system but they don't want Americans pay more than Canadian that if they will not let what drug prices here as they've done it in other countries that Americans should be allowed to purchase drugs\nUnder FDA supervision says nobody wants the hype might be poisoned\nBy the Americans should be able to purchase drugs across the border and that won't change about\nThe pharmaceutical companies will bring down their prices that you cannot have a situation where people are literally literally dying\nBecause of the pursuit of profitability reminds you of conservatives who believe in the free market system but they also believe that monopoly should be broken up and then when you have cartels they should be challenged\nThat's what you've got in this situation\nNo secretaries are of age age as has been a guest on my show what he's talking about transparency and pricing that's really what the uh new regulations coming out of the department of health and Human Services are about will that feel the need or does more than that need to be done frankly\nMore than that needs to be done at least two in public perspective because knowing that you're paying the highest prices on the face ... does it help\nIt's actually finding a way that they will still eat profitable but that people will be able to afford the medications they want competition in the marketplace they want the ability to buy cheaper medications if they are available and\nThe tired of all this money going into things other than research and development when they claim that all the money that they're spending is going into research and development they want in February noticed them and they don't feel like they have it now\nOkay I Would like a very quick response to the bombs I Believe that the FBI when they have seven

my\nGuest he has written just now when it's come out to ship fools am it's about how the elites are hurting the United states and and that goes just across the board\n... let me let me give you a headline from today and I would like you to tell me if if that is related to your thesis okay a ... year it is okay so here it is half of us births\nAre out of wedlock mental Fort ... what's up over forty percent up from ten percent of Nineteen Seventy does this have anything to do with the elites\nWith at the core of it I mean by the way that's a disaster not simply on a moral level though I think it is but on a practical one their range of social science that make the indisputable point children particularly boys raised\nIn single parent homes by their mothers are much more likely to fail in school and to fail in life\nTo develop addictions to wind up in prison they make less than we're likely to be ... or ... or have out of wedlock Jill themselves I mean there's there's no upside to this at all\nAnd so if you're running the country and you have an actual interest that long term success for very concerned about this and you're going to do whatever you can to make it better\nArlene the Republican Party so focused on marginal tax rate they don't feel that sort of the province of ... they can't get involved you know you don't want to sound like Jerry Falwell so don't say anything about it\nAnd on the Democratic side single mothers are the core of their base single mothers are much more dependent on government of course they tend to be overwhelmingly Democrat and so the last thing you want to do in the last thing they do do is is suggested single motherhood is\nLess preferable hum than\nUh raising children two parent biological household so I'm both sides are kind of allied unintentionally in downplaying we're going this problem dean while the country how did you say one other thing\nThere is no single Parenthood in my neighborhood I live in an affluent neighborhood maybe you do to maybe some of your listeners do and you know that it's like Nineteen fifty five and our neighborhood nobody can divorced there no single moms on my street of course not because the ruling class understands that marriage\nIs the key to prosperity and happiness\nAnd said they don't practice\nDeath themselves their children don't practice it to really like divorce rates among rich people are very low the middle of the country it's the former middle class\nThat is in in social disarray and this is a huge problem not attacking anybody I'm saying if you really cared about the middle class and you would be doing whatever you could to make it easier for people to stay married and raise children\nIntact\nSo okay there was a vice president Dan Quayle you may recall and he spoke out about Murphy Brown the TV character who had a child out of wedlock and he was buried by the national media by academia et cetera\nSo I think that Republicans and incorrectly but I think Republicans got burned and they realize hey we talk about social issues we're doomed\nBut ... but then you wake up one morning you're exactly right that is what happened I was ... feet from that moment in Seoul now so I can from what you just said that that includes and they grew but then you wake up one morning and you realize you know tax rates are actually I'm a lower tax and other people are taxes but\nThey're relatively easy to change you just need a majority vote in the Congress and the president willing to sign it was very hard to change the culture and the structure of the family and if that's destroyed you know it takes\nYou know generations to fix it if it can be fixed up your civilization will collapse\nSo Republicans\nKind of missed the actual story which is social issues are the issues you're in the army and you're a civil society grow out of the kind of\nLife you weren't living that's what they should have been focused on and because they're dumb and cowardly and they listen to the advice of a couple of overpaid and unwise consultants they didn't do that and I think the smart ones regret it now\nThe smart ones were what they regret it now\nOh really know what what leads you did what leads you to think that\nWell because I mean you look around Washington and you know most conservatives in DC work at nonprofit think tanks and there are a lot of really great people and people who work at the same tax but they've consumed billions of dollars in contributions over the past four years in America has not become more conservative\nAnd the smart ones are asking well where do we go wrong and it's not that they're not smart or they didn't try hard or they didn't have the best intentions they did it the best intentions but they were focused on the wrong thing\nOnce you care about is the way people with the family is the very center it's the Adams in matters the court building block of every and when that collapses there's no hope of doing anything positive so and they ignored that and I think they know that now\nWhere I ... I feel funny asking you this but it's it's truly meant a lot of curiosity 'cause social respect you where do you stand on President Trump\n\nI think that\nUm well I mean just as an overview I agree with you know the the majority the strong with the overwhelming majority of what Trump said\nUm I think Tom's genius I think you need to understand from crisis at Trump's genius is not in affecting policy change I don't think he\nHas control over the executive branch his portion of government I don't think he understands how it works I don't think he's going to learn I don't think he's good at getting his program through Congress I don't think Congress wants to get his program in a lot so on that level Trump is a frustrating president to watch\nI think that Trump's value ingenious is in raising the question that no one else was willing to raise about ... kind of clarity\nVery simple clear he so he will say things like well wait a second you know we had NATO which was this great force for forty years but it existed in order to keep the Soviets were invading Western Europe Soviet style longer exists so why do we still have NATO\nWell I don't know what the answer is that's a totally fair question and one that we all should have been asking the Nineteen Ninety One when the Soviet Union collapsed or why we start Afghanistan Seventeen years later or why are we allowing the south Koreans cheat in this trade\nThat er or why are we allowing the south Koreans cheat in this trade deal or why don't we build the wall it what's the answer speak slowly so I can understand\nThat the genius being brave enough and clear enough to raise or questions that we ought to be debated long after I'm gone those questions will hang in the air and my hope is that someone will answer them and solve those problems but first unit you you need to define what the problems are and I think the Trump has been really good at\nAll right a final question because I Know I Know your time is limited so you have on guests who I find a intellectually morally intolerable which is which\nIs fine [laughter] okay\nSo I just want to know what you see their name as listed on your program notes this is who will have on do you think oh my God I Can't believe this or I dread this or you know what this is what I Do for a living and what the hell\nWant to know why read my first volume of five volumes that will eventually come out called the rational Bible\nRight through you're an atheist the best values in the world or in that book and I explained why\nWhen God chooses Abraham as the first gotta where human being\nFather of ultimately the Israel lights the Hebrew the Jews and then taken out of course by the New Testament he said through you all the families of the earth\nWill be blessed not all the individuals have deer all the families backs the basic unit\nMelvin chair that I Want to bring to your attention is the ex chair one of my favorite products because I sit on it every day\nAt work when I Am in the studio in LA that is the chair I sit on we have like twenty chairs I could choose that's the one I sit on the X three is the new one it's mind blowing\nPhenomenal chair if you have an office this is the greatest office chair I Know of\nYour employees well thank you which is nice in it of itself you could simply try it out go to ... chair dentist dot com\nThere is a thirty day guaranteed so you see Z to send back you do show no questions asked X chair Dennis use the code Dennis a hundred dollars off and a three foot rest ...
