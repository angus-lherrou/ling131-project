content being covered we're going to move very quickly said I Want to read a comment a first time we start with this kind of as I opened up the previous our case you missed it I'll start with this I did a\nNational radio program in Great Britain today it's it's not an I Do a lot of those on the BBC and and the international interviews after something like this happens that kind of reach out to me and I've been very friendly to them over the number of years so and I certainly don't mind doing I Love talking to the British people most of them feel exactly the way you do\nIt's just they're elite smuggling is at the top that doesn't they just simply don't understand Americans freedoms and you're not going to convince them otherwise but it's fun to go round and round with especially when you know you're going to get ambushed\nParticularly because you've been on with this particular host before in the past but uh the article after my appearance on the show is titled it made I guess precedent on the LDC leading a leaving Britain's conversation\nKevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporter or see them in light of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting Kevin McGuire spoke with mark Walters passionate supporter of gun rights and host of armed American radio to get a view and good luck on your mark seemed adamant that stricter background checks\nWouldn't help the situation\nAs quoting me a background check looks at the background it doesn't look forward mark pointed out that he could named thirty mass shooters in America who had our past background checks quoting the again if a madman wants to get a hold of a gun you can in America it's unfortunate but it's true it's a very complex issue mark and mark went on to claim\nThat a ban on assault weapons is not realistic and even claimed that he bought his first day our during the Clinton assault weapons ban which is true\nIt's easy to knee jerk reaction and say my God we have to ban this in reality that's not going to work because they can't be banned they are already here millions upon millions of Americans are not going to turn in their firearms who have done nothing wrong and that's the vast majority of Americans I said as an American gun owner we hate to see this were the ones that one\nThe joy of Americans I said as an American gun owner we hate to see those were the ones that want this

Hawkins\n[noise] I I got to go back to Chris Murphy for just a second okay [noise]\nBecause here's what Trump said and you pointed in there you pointed out in your piece if they had protection inside the result would have been far better this was a dispute there will always exist I suspect\nBut if they had protection inside the synagogue maybe it could have been a very different situation okay what's what's wrong with that what it Chris Murphy take exception to win that statement come again keeping in mind listener that he is a man that is protected by guns everywhere he goes in DC what's up by that\nBut what he said is he goes Trump's position is you know uh to counter dangerous people with on the East that are opposites she used to just ... days of stapled ever get done well that's state\nSale because that's a fairy tale\nHe goes on to say Trump's position works in the movie opposite she works in real life that's all I\nSee it in real life wouldn't it\nIs in real life it wouldn't work Sunday right because this guy has numerous background checks passed on his you know just to get sick from it ah and so you know we get a guy who's ... who's been vetted\nAnd it's to your point that you were actually making when you start your show a background check back where if there's no criminal history than a person who plans to most evil dated a world to log into a gun store smile by God no problem\nBecause there's no criminal history can be found in the background check and uh so Murphy doesn't understand his background checks don't work in real life they work in the movies gun free zones don't work in real life\nThey work in the movies having a large congregation of elderly congregants who are defenseless setting together on a Saturday morning that doesn't work in real life that works in the movies you got to have someone there with a gun who can take out a bad guy comes in Chris Murphy is a lunatic\nChris move Chris Murphy is also a liar he knows better he's also a hypocrite\nBecause he is protected by guns at the Capitol he understands that he knows that he's just intellectually dishonest as the rest of the socialist party is in today's day and age who speaks particularly on this topic\nFor they know not what they say now interestingly and I don't I'm not trying to catch off guard hairs has nothing to do with what you wrote a over the past week or today by any stretch but I heard the nine one one calls coming in or I heard the police chatter\nRadio chatter when one of the officers were those responding saying there's automatic weapons fire\nAnd that went out on recall you know to the rest of the officers ten thirty eight automatic weapons fire\nA was their automatic weapons fire there am I missing something\nNow unless you're telling me that uh yeah they are Fifteen and\nThen what I understand they are Fifteen a couple of blocks that even at three o'clock so I'm not sure but yeah you're dealing with small might have found out about this happens all the time ... and ... and what that officer\nProbably wasn't on purpose but with the gun control the Louis you know Hillary Clinton what you are\nYou'll remember Hillary Clinton used to say that one of the reasons you need a vote her will stop people from coming to school with automatic weapons you know right by\nMy mind out of my mind I don't want to make your relatives that had\nNever happened so you know but see they want to use just just like Murphy talking about semi automatic rifles they want to use the phrase olive tree to sound ominous scared of the few people who they can scare with their language\nAnd uh you know again I Am not trying to say that police officer did that but uh that's just where we are in society you know people use the wrong terminology\nYeah and I guess we're all guilty of it from time to time I you know I had the interview with the dopey McGuire over there and I can't get home and do you guys you know he's entitled to his opinion and we have fought on the radio we go back and forth and we don't like each other and that's what makes it fun so\nBut you know I I catch myself to you know it's impossible not going to sit here and try to correct the guy on the phrase out of your the terminology when I've got four minutes on a radio interview because then it turns into a Piers Morgan type deal\nAnd it just disintegration I Want people to hear what we're trying to say and but you know I Know somebody out there right now is screaming at me W. R. if it's not an assault rifle make sure you call it that and we do we attempt to do that all the time sometimes there are even bigger points that we have to get out without turning argument away which is what sometimes that would do\nAll right you know what let's move on from Chris Murphy he's just as out in the lunatic\nAnd he's a hypocrite and he's also very he's a very dishonest man is what he is\nBut we already talked about you have another piece law enforcement synagogue attacker legally owned his guns I think this is important for one reason\nBecause doesn't that go that headline alone says it all AWOL that's what goes to the heart of why we have a right to defend ourselves because we understand the evil exist evil chooses the time and place to become evil\nNot us but and we have a right to defend ourselves from it because we are powerless to even identify it aren't we\n[laughter] true true you know there's there's something I'm trying to cause harm to turn it on as I think what I write\nI I Know what I Do I write news but also on in my heart to educate people\nAnd I and there's a corner I'm coming to terms where I can somehow get people to think about the fact that there is no substitute for freedom I'm not trying to be profound uh it's very simple gun control a lot of apple substitute for freedom and if you think it is\nBut the trouble is not a viable substitute for freedom and if you think it is that he didn't pay attention Saturday or you didn't pay attention to Parkland or you didn't pay attention to Santa Fe high school a cake twenty Eighteen or you didn't pay attention at the church in Texas November fifth twenty Seventeen that keep going but a gun control is not\nA valid substitute freedom because gun control priest poses that if we limit everybody's freedom\nCertain crimes will go away does not work that way what happens is we limit my ability to exercise my God given rights you put me in an unnatural position\nHad I've been a member of the congregation on Saturday I would've come under fire and the senseless and somehow we have to realize that lesson that we can't every time we embrace gun control where we need to or not we're saying this is a good substitute for freedom folks there is no\nDid not use illegal guns now for it I Want you to pick careful attention you're listening throughout the state of Florida that I\nWent to one Panama love you guys\nAre the ... am eight sixty six sixty and a number of others throughout the state\nRight now on my monitor in this cross re holster studio Capitol Hill one American news network I posit Senator Bill\nNelson on gun control calls for universal background checks on gun sales Bill Nelson is in\nIndia now you take that right to the bank why can I make that statement because the individual in Pittsburgh if we have pointed out to you for the last half hour now heading into forty minutes\nPast his background checks so ask yourself this question ward off what the hell is building a house in talking about and if you get a chance to ask him yourself and ask him what to ask him to\nTell you what gun control will work he can't you'll do what Kevin McGuire did in Great Britain he will pack up his toys and leave the sand box because he can't play with the adult a W are sorry\nI had to go off on that one I saw that and I passed it on my monitor it let me get that off my monitor so I don't go into a remark\nAbout All right we also now this doesn't surprise me either California Democrats will use and New York Democrats will use anything they can a W. R. Hawkins won't pay to push more gun control in their States isn't that true\nRight that's true how many California Democrats running for office right now are using the Pittsburgh shooting push more gun control\nAnd it's I mean California listening to the show here's what you got to think about these people are running for office they're not in office\nSale campaign like this for gun control what do you think they're going to do once they're you know you don't need that you're that California is already in the time it's already over the edge on gun control it's ridiculous and if if there's somebody who thinks one more gun laws gonna matter I mean\nThere hey they're not bright or be there in ... which means they're immune to facts and they just have the gender and I think by and large that's ... that's the case for gun control over\nWhat you know you you asked if you actually you pointed out in a statement\nAnd I ask a question and that is in your piece about Democrat Bill Nelson on this very topic I felt that was interesting when I saw that headline and I saw him on the television I just decided to snap on it for a moment but here's what you point out in your opening statement your your piece is titled Democrat Bill Nelson wants to implement gun controls already in place\nCalifornia as a W are just pointed out you can't do any more\nCali you just can't you just simply can't\nBill Nelson wants to implement gun control already in place that's the key and here's what I W are set to open up the open up the column\nBill Nelson Democrat of course ... in Florida wants to implement gun controls that are all ready in place and are almost always the means by which mass public attackers get their guns what do you mean by that\n[noise] now I mean if you go back to go back ... ruled that say go back to Columbine a or a if you want to stay in the twenty first century just stay in the twenty first century I Can't think\nOf a high profile public attack where the attacker acquires guns in some way other than background checks literally\nThe the two exceptions the two exceptions or the a ... a mall sheet mall shooting\nIn Washington state and Newtown and their sets us because we both those cases the individual Stoller guns\nAnd murder I wanted to take a take a hold of them to I Want to make that very clear that out but out of that [noise] people\nPeople who shoot up places they go past background checks to get their guns and so these these these checks the worst is the only thing they accomplished is what the Democrats really\nAnd that is they make the process of ... just a little more ... than it does cause some law abiding citizens just not to bother because they don't want to go through the house that's what the Democrats really want they want to slow down to\nBuy a firearms they don't want them in anyone's hands when they say they're just gets criminals owning them they're not telling the truth they don't want anyone to have a gun\nYou better than you better believe that you better believe that they also point a lot of anger at hunters\nAnd hunters who face death threats are shooting animals legally on hunch won't go there to cover it all back right after that when they do if you are on the margins\nCheese\n...\nHi I'm going to work in radio listeners if you were looking for a less sleep with them to check out the taser poll compact easy to use and doesn't require lightened\nMost using technology trusted by law enforcement or coal can be deployed from an it's an interesting field and delivers a thirty second cycle giving users the time they need to mine safety and then you would if I see lots of teen teachers they just keep program or place it free\nOf charge ... or self defense how confident and protection to live\nHere [noise] and maintenance I got my came on I ...

they are uh prefer being\nWitchcraft and astrology witchcraft and astrology now what what's interesting is uh this this Pew Research study found that\nInterest in spirituality has been booming\nIn America in recent years especially in a among millennials interest in spirituality or the majority of Americans though but not religion the majority of Americans now believe\nIt is not necessary to believe in God to have good morals\nPer a proof of the Pew Research center\nFor the first time it's interesting a majority of Americans now believe it's not necessary\nTo believe in God to have good morals the percentage of people between the ages of Eighteen and twenty nine millennials who never doubt the existence of God's fell\nFrom eighty one percent in oh seven sixty percent in two thousand and twelve so more and more millennials doubting the very existence of God and meanwhile the same study shows that half of young adults in the U.S believe in\nBelieve astrology is the science\nOf compared to less than eight percent of the Chinese public\nUm uh the whole psychic services industry like astrology and or reading\nA medium ship Terrell card reading all that stuff\nI'm is growing by leaps and bounds in America\nI'm now it's it's a two billion dollar annual business\nUm but formal religion you know all the stuff astrology and and uh\n\nAnd and and belief in a reading your palms or Terrell cards and all of this\nGrowing but belief in formal religion nose diving among young Americans\n\nThe study shows that younger Americans again Eighteen to twenty nine Eighteen to thirty four\nLook upon religious organizations religions as\nAnd religious organizations religions as they look upon government\nA big business uh most institutions\nA young Americans millennials look upon these institutions religion as well\nA with a high negatives they don't trust these institutions they don't believe in these institutions and so they look elsewhere\n\nThey look to astrology\nEven though astrology has been debunked by numerous academics are studies\n\nBut in the the lack of structure young Americans are drawn\nTo the lack of basic structure and that's why they don't like religion and that's why they prefer things like astrology witchcraft\n\nMystic mystic a boxes and the right key infused bath salts and all of these crazy things are just jumping crazy I shouldn't say some crazy a A R jumping among millennials but formal religion\n\nThe belief in a belief in formal religion\nPractice according to a formal religion\nPer the Pew Research center this latest study in this latest study\nConfirms other studies that we've been aware of for a long time that\nAmericans in general though still a very religious people\nStill a very moral people still a very spiritual people\nI'm no longer practice seem uh in in\nIn religions no longer formally believing in religions\nThis country that is eighty something percent Christian\nAnd juicy this\nDevelopment most

now I I Believe\nObviously like many of you do or that there is a guy in I Believe God created all of this and I believe\nThat when people begin\nTo turn away from God and the people begin to turn away from religion I eat\nIn a very imperfect Schumann way of\nUm giving\nPraise to God and trying to live out our godly faith\nIn as imperfect as all religions are and I'm raising my hand right now I'm a born and raised Catholic still a practicing Catholic and the Catholic Church right now again is going through real problems right now and by the way these real problems that the Catholic Church is going through\nA A R problems that help\nUm convince especially young Americans that religions are bogus but I Believe that when they people turn away from my God and turn away from\nA religious life I Believe eventual aid that people are turns away from morals and does in fact turn away from goodness\nI Believe that you are connected I Believe that you can be a moral person without believing in God you can be\nA good person without\nSeen a particular faith\nUh but as a people lose their connection to God and religion\nIt ain't going to happen unless the American people wake up by do know

he has a history about him this isn't the first time his name and explosive device of ever been used in fact it's part of his history\nHe also has a drug charges as well born in New York a resident of Florida which means I I have a feeling we'll be talking more about Caesar when it comes to Florida Man will try to find some funny dumb people but there's nothing funny about this guy at all\nAnd during the FBI press coverage during the department of justice press coverage people want to blame the rhetoric for pushing this guy over the edge when it sounds like he was crazy to begin with\nSo why is this my fault why is the president's fault why is this the media's fault this isn't even your fault folks\nThis guy if he did it this guy\nNeeds to be held responsible we need to read this and

no Michael I'm going to tell you when you if they were just agree with Trump people wouldn't be crazy like this guy which\nI'm not saying that I'm just saying if they get on the same that's actually what you just said\nYeah well I mean with with everything that's going on I mean I Know everybody's going to be going to the point of you know not everybody's going to agree on everything but I mean that's why I left and the right should be should be getting along for everybody else out there that they're representing\nNo no no my am I going to disagree with you I respectfully brother I Love you disagree with you and here's why I'll tell you I appreciate the call or you don't get along just to pacify the masses\n\nBecause then you're hypersensitive ... every stupid threat that's out there and we don't bow to every stupid threat that's out there\nWell as if we don't do this that people are going to be angry and we don't want the people angry so I guess we should provide everything to everyone because they might get angry we don't want them to be angry that's how government got to the size of God\nBecause they keep providing to everybody because they don't want to make them angry they want to make them feel good\n\nThat's how we got to where we are\nDon't get along argue debates\n\nAnd they'll say well what did you know the wife would just agreement jumped they wouldn't have a guy out there that have left wing people and wants to send them ...\nNo no\nWe shouldn't change the Democrats in Congress\nIf they want to call people to harass somebody ah I I guess if I have to compare the two I'd rather that I'd rather than Maxine Waters of the world do that because I don't hear anybody saying you know we ought to do\nWe ought to send people explosive things in the mail and just in them and damage than physically no\nWell absolutely nobody is saying that\n\nAid for for three four four Dana aid for for three four four thirty to sixty two Jeff Indiana you're on the Danish

if you called NPR with that amazing baritone voice you probably scare everybody at and ... this guy who oh it was good there's got to be by business\nThe water's deep Jeff go ahead [laughter]\nAnyway to get to the discussion of today member law I don't remember the media outraged when Republicans were receiving rice and all of that actually put people in the hospital\nAnd you know we did have a guy that's\nYou know what your outrage no fear yes there was an outrage but there was fear I remember\nWhy you remember everybody blaming uh whoever was president at the time\nYou know what was going on or okay see and that's the whole thing with the the main stream media they're such a joke I mean it's just ridiculous and the thing is this guy has to be the worst bomb maker in the world I mean I don't agree with what he did fail glad they didn't go all\nIt is that what it says David given them more and the nation but still\nIt's gotten out of hand on both sides it really have because I just told me about Maxine Waters yeah OK rather have them do that but people have been physically attacked in the street\nNot just run out of a restaurant but somebody some pro life on the other day was actually attacked physically attacked salt\nSo it's just it's getting outrageous on both sides and I agree it's got a difference with somebody you need to provide an argument that's going to win the case about start getting violet or encourage violence or encourage anybody to be told that they they're not want it if they don't fall\nAs as we get back to the substance but be be passionate passionate Jeff do not lose your passion at all I'm all about you know what an already and here's the thing\nIs is housing define us this is even the majority isn't even the only one percent of the population you know this is this is the smallest version of who we are as a country because most most everybody else\nThey they're they're asking each other hey who you're picking Red Sox are Dodgers hey wow well yeah well you know they're they're they're watching the watching football there there is there is is ah is the price of gas going down what's that that's it that's where most everybody is yeah you're here\nThat\nAnyway on here so but my point of view that that this was just ridiculous the media is played it is I haven't seen anything else all of it is for days they're acting like nothing else install\nLike you're saying like they have no other life but the thing that gets the most if they were in this on the president\nSo it's like really\nI mean there are ... they want to act like this was something ... old decided to do\nAnd you know he's he's got his rhetoric upon you know he's a little extreme about it but he says what he thinks he's passionate about it\nAnd people aren't used to that are used the politicians\nIt's just so they want everybody happy and he's done with that they're just saying that what you're always thought they were charm limits for already\nMaxine Waters\nAs far as I Know that she lives in history that she\nRepresents a California was multi million dollar man\nOur these people get mystery it's all a hundred and Seventy a hundred and eighty thousand dollar salary\nYeah but am I going to blame or am I going to blame but people like you voting Rebecca ... and ... and the thing is as much as ... as much as I Would love to control what everybody else does I I Am a very good argument against or moments\nOkay the thing is is we want to tell everybody else who they can and can't away right because\nWe don't want to go you know there are people you know no no no ... well I I I'll I'll I'll I'll I'll go I'll go I'll go just a ... bar here and I I have other things I Want to\nDo in my Dave until somebody else who they should

then is off Nevada you might know him from the HBO thing he's dead you might actually win the election\nSo\nI'd love to tell people who they can to get the thing is is I don't want to be a king man I

Hawkins and I'm an atheist and I say\nYou haven't really sat down and thought about these things and I\nYou know they geared if nobody's doing it\nA in a way that I'd like where I'm going to do it in a way that are right now you where did you grow up I grew up in Chicago did grow up in Chicago um\nAnd you you were raised what as as a nominal do ah was was was was your Jewish faith or central to your life in any way was just something that you had privately going on\n\nRead\n\nThe books are you ready hey we're talking to the author\nOf a brand new book called in the mood and say did you have questions about these things and I hope you do I hope you are not stumbling along not asking the important questions about who you are where you came from where you're going uh does life have meaning what about your life does your life have meaning the asking those questions\nAre you come to the right place I'm sitting here in the studio at their conduct show talking Scott Shane his book is in good faith\nQuestioning religion and\nAtheism okay so Scott you um at some point you decided All right I Want to write a book about this this is a big book and you really get into this this is for people I think you really want to know I've written books\nThat deal with a lot of this kind of stuff I wrote a book on miracles I wrote books called everything always wanted to know about God but were afraid to ask that's more than a popular level this really gets into it and this is not to say that this book is difficult to read it's not but it's it's in depth you've been very rigorous ... answering\nA these questions and when did you decide to do this because this is a real work you've got here\nYes well first of all thank you the the the the the reason I decided to write a\nA book that was comprehensive yeah was because the new atheist claim that they're you know\nThat they're being scientific right that if you believe in God you're a dummy right or you're still clinging to your parents superstitions or you're gullible or you haven't yet been educated enough rice\nSo I started out and actually writing a little bit simpler book but as I got into it I said to me I I basically bought I'd better write a book that can stand up to academic in criticism right 'cause\nI ... I have friends who have sent their kids to college who took classes and we took classes in religion came out atheist yeah because they're reading all of these\nUm atheist new atheist screech friend there was nothing that took them on one by one so I read them yeah and there are six sections in the book I distilled what their question I was in some cases I actually think I made the atheist questions sharper that's way westerners both\nWell listen I have to say I have not read uh in in in their entirety any of those books you reference I started to read Christopher Hitchens is God is not good I founded on reasonable I found it so unpleasant\nAnd the arguments so spurious an ad hominem and sloppy that I could not believe people were taking this book seriously I mean this is a guy Christopher Hitchens\nWas so brilliant and so funny when you want it to be an entertaining then he kinda carries you along with the sound of his voice or with the way that he writes but the content was garbage was stunning to me that people were taking him seriously I thought he he doesn't have any actual arguments here it's all just kind of potshots\nBasically absolutely I mean are they spend a lot of time mocking religion but one thing that I realized which is a core part of my book is that what the new atheist really conflate is they don't understand the difference between ... and I ... and I try to shut up and you've done it in your books to actually try to shut up\nWhat ideology is according to the Bible which is\nA set of lies about power it's describing super authority or super force supernatural powers to remind people write beings or ideologies so we thought we a lot of people think we ... dollar tree thirty eight hundred years ago with the guy came Farah but\nHow did Mao order thirty ish million people to march to their death because they believed he had the authority to do so how did Stalin sent tens of millions to the gulag starve a quarter of Ukraine and no one question it I\nMean that's I dollar tree that's not that's that's describing the ... definition in the Bible to a person of course Hitler and but ... pot and we see it in modern ways very similarly where people ascribe to themselves\nIn a small way to make themselves idle right\nWell it's interesting you you mentioned a Hitler Pol Pot or Stalin and Mao and those are all totalitarian atheist regimes now some people might quibble with that but I have the facts to say that they're and they're quite wrong I mean Hitler was\nAs far from a Christian as you can be in fact if you were any kind of a serious Christian\nAh he would sent you to a concentration camp or have you killed him and his he was at war with the serious Christians within the third Reich and we're making the movie of the story burn off and that becomes a central issue is that\nIf you were just going along and saying well I'm not a Jew so I guess I'm a Christian you were not a Christian you were a gentile who might go to church but the actual Christians were at war with him and he with them\nAnd so you have this line running through these ... ... regimes that we're all\nMurderous at their core murderous on a level that we can\nEducation and ironically a religion was not the problem atheism was the problem that was the ideology\nLike ... which is the problem I mean religion if you consider a dollar tree of former religion which I don't write I'd our tree was the problem is a problem it's a problem today it's a problem everywhere and\nWe ignored at our peril and we continue to ignore the apparel I can let me give you one we're talking about murderous regimes let me talk to you just mentioned one we're sitting here in New York in a studio there we used to be a former there was a former attorney general Eric Schneiderman\nWho was um\nYou know at least went by the moniker of Jewish but she um set himself up as the law I mean literally as some of your listeners may know he was deposed because of a whole bunch of a sexual abuse allegations in confirmations\nAnd what he did is he said to his victims I'm the top law enforcement official in New York\nYou can't complain to anybody you have to do what I Want you to do he abused his authority right and it goes back in a small way ... he made himself the gods and when people do that they abuse other people and you know that's not it they don't necessarily murder or other people but they can cause them\nImmense harm and so we have to cleanse I think cleansing is a the cleansing relationships that I\nDollar tree I think is a microwave just to be clear on what I dollars for years I mean I'm\nI Would say worshipping or anything other than the loving creator God of the Bible ends up being I dollar tree because\nUh only he is worthy of being worship now there was only he created the universe only he\nUh uh loves us and lives for us and what you don't know there was anything else that you worship whether it's the state or yourself a lot of atheists\nAre worshipping themselves even though they might not say it but they are so up put off by worshipping God because that impinges on their uh ability to do whatever they like so they have to say there is no God so they end up worshipping themselves anytime you worship anything other than the actual God of the Bible\nUm ... it becomes I dollar tree doesn't it\nYeah well every person is corrupt double\nAnd um we I think a ... not enough attention is given to the real meaning of the way we choose count it the third commandment most Christians kind of second commandment which is not to take God's name thing than to take a shot in Hebrew\nAnd it's the only of the ten commandments by the way for which there is no redemption of repentance it says that writing the commandment\nAnd what does that mean to me it means when people set themselves up ... sold spokespeople for God\nAnd we've seen that in history we see it currently whenever anybody says look believe you don't ... don't believe in me because I mean believe me because I'm the soul\nI I can give you the sole answer to what God wants you can get in the same short of trouble which is how ... the stick religions get in trouble right people say look just listen to me you don't have to go behind the or don't bother reading the scriptures don't bother reasoning for it right all\nRight that's that fast and then of course that was the ... the Luther issue I wrote a biography of Martin Luther and it's so fascinating because you realize that at the heart that\nHe wasn't really a ... ... all he was doing really was challenging the authority of the church and the pope and saying look you have to bow\nTo a higher authority just as I Do and if you don't do that you have no legitimate authority and they said oh no no you're wrong where we say goes right we are the ultimate authority where the ultimate arbiter of what God says or didn't say you have no right even the question it and at that moment you realized\nTheir goose is cooked when you when you have that when you aggregate yourself that kind of power and authority you take the place of God\nWhich is really creepy yes and you Hadley\nYou've got and that but Luther tried to do when you do an excellent job of showing of of of demonstrating that is to reclaim the Bible would learn the scriptures on your own see what it says you don't have to take the local priests opinion and it's ... that's\nI mean it's a tricky thing right because you don't want to or you don't want to say that everything is subjective that whenever your point of view is is valid no no no when I mean we're not saying that and Luther didn't say that right at the same time\nI mean again it depends what the laws of nature are exactly right when he talked about the partying the red sea\nUh [laughter] it's kind of ... I guess we have to uh we have we have to define our terms we're going to go to another a break here folks the title of the book is in good faith it's an extraordinary book or in good faith questioning religion and atheism the other is Scott Shay we'll be right back [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThey Alvin here or can I tell you about really factor who have uh no actually I mean can I tell you about it okay you may I may you may well what I'm trying to say I've got somebody even better Oh yes I've got a guy named Alan who's been using relief factor I'd like to hear what he has to save our only factor here it is\nA bit and I have since my early twenties now I'm fifty one in my early twenties I work for say ...

good faith questioning religion an atheism a big book with all kinds of interesting stuff in it\nOr we are talking about miracles so the miracles of the accidents supporting the red sea you say Scott than it has a naturalistic explanation you don't say it's not a miracle but you're saying it's a certain kind of miracles so what do you say happened\nSo I I again I think that's an important distinction that God can act through nature or God can act outside of nature if he's so wishes but in the Bible and the Hebrew scriptures\nThe so called the red sea is called yum soup the regency which sort of changed to read see when it got to the ... and this is why I Love studying in Hebrew because now the ... of\nCourse is the Latin version correct twelve the is is that when St Jerome translated sort of like a three hundred eighty\nA hundred percent correct so the ... was before it right on that or Greek and that actually in many ways is we will would even be a um a cooperative what am about to say OK okay\nOf the translations so they were when I Do on page there three thirty five of my book because I think we have to delve into this where you have to take the criticism seriously well the red she couldn't apart as well it's actually not the red sea\nIt's there's two lakes that were around at that time right the bottle of lakes and the bitter lakes and if you closely follow\nThe the and I have it on this charge if you closely followed the tracks of the Israel lights including when remember they turn around yeah remember they go for three days and then they turn around and then they end up against some yes some a body of water well it seems like that is um the bottle of lakes and\nAs late as Napoleon\nThere are discussions up armies go in one direction marching the other way and saying whoa we can't go back this way there's water why because they're these lakes do have there are facts from tidal forces there are reads they're essentially very marsh she would never very deep these ...\nLayers mark Napoleon's marching around Egypt a general ...\nAnd uh and they encountered this and so you're saying um okay so you're saying this cooperation so so what are you what are you holding that the that the um as we've heard that that that a wind blew all night and that it was possible a two part it but it's not as dramatic as it was in for example Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston there was nothing like\nThat no I mean unfortunately the ten commandments is not actual video footage of the beer and I know we take it to buy on\nIt's yeah it can be but I'm sure everybody pressed up against that water rising away to walk maybe it was a little ... maybe it was a little ... but I'm sure they viewed it as a miracle that wrote down that\nWay right well see that's what's so interesting is that you know when you talk about what is a miracle a if God's hand was involved in it I mean if you're standing there and there are six million of you and you're about to be killed or whatever by the Egyptian army and suddenly\nHey there's a place to walk where there wasn't a place to walk twenty minutes ago something happened and let's go this way and he was scape and then pharaoh is army has drowned in the very place where you to\nMost people would say that as a miracle are now the details of the details and you're you're giving us some more naturalistic explanation I Know a lot of people would disagree with you on all kinds of ah things some would say that the whole thing never happen but it's fascinating I Love this is why I wanted to have you on because\nTalking about this rationally and saying look we first of all we don't have a dog in the fight whatever happened happened we just want to know what is right and a\n... some of the stuff we can know some of the stuff we can speculate on and if we're wrong well it is what it is you know it's not like it has to be this otherwise my faith crumbles but what you're talking about is fascinating I I mean I've heard of this before but you you're a you write about an in depth and this book\nAnd I think by taking the tech seriously to and really looking at the words yeah I think there are some things that we take for granted that\nA mini believers think that we have to question I think the numbers six hundred thousand is relate males to analyze what the word is it's it's ...\nIt's six hundred thousand in in ... is how it's in is how it's written but when I went back and spent some time and read a number of a philosopher just review aloof\nAs you may know the Bible or

the ground and then that candidate for Congress jumped on top of the reporter and started punching him\nIt doesn't matter I guess that at first the congressmen to be a denied that this happened until he was caught on tape the entire incident was caught on tape\nBut that now congressmen uh was arrested or he pled guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge a instead of going to jail or he had to you know do community service anger management had to pay money to the reporter\nWho suffered injuries so that happened a year ago\nAnd the president found himself in Montana last night at a rally and he got to talking about that incident last year the bodies slamming and he had the guy Greg gene forte he was in the audience right there and the president proceeded to praise\nWhat gene forte did he

thinks it's okay for a congressman to physically assault a reporter who asked him a question\n'cause if you don't\nIf you don't think it's okay for a congressman to physically\nAssaulted a reporter and by the way I think that's really important distinction you can laugh at people in the media you cannot come you can say hell I ain't answering your question you can walk away you can do whatever you want but to physically assaulted reporter who asked the question\nIs if it if you don't believe that's okay\nWell then I don't know how you can approve of what the president of the United states

with me don't leave don't hang up stand with me you asked me a question let me give you an answer and then I'll ask you a question in my turning democratic God no I I've never been a Democrat in my

over Trump Dan Dan\nIt's all wrong isn't it physical violence correct\nWell sometimes it lead it and that will wait wait wait\nWait wait wait but if if if a reporter asked you a question and you pick

identity politics and it's an issue of race but to you know Cherokee Nation that has been speaking out on this and to people like twyla Barnes\nA day and and I and I love how twilight explained that these people are not understanding the sexual argument is viewed as an attack on sovereignty\nThis is not it's not a political or or racial thing it is an attack on sovereignty and she's going to join us to explain a coming up in the meantime it's time for like five\nSix months for datas could five [noise]\nIt is a job seekers market even as companies are embracing AI\nA Reuters reports that employees are looking to hire the next generation of tech employees\nAnd they've been meeting with a lot of college students actually ah but they they said that at the extending applications for AI it's created a shortage of qualified workers and machine learning a at a digital digital industry\nAnd they say that there are too few potential employees with training or experience in a ice\nAnd they say that has huge consequences they say that it's going it's been a slow hiring and it'll impede growth at some point with companies and recruiters and would be employer so that's actually something you know there's a emerging field there by the way of air of an emerging field\nA Lindsey Graham says that the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has to go to the NBC or the sassy senator from South Carolina\nWho has been a vocal the finger of Saudi Arabia though says that's a powerful crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has to go and vowed never to return to the country as long as the young leader remains in power he says quote Saudi Arabia of you're listening or a lot of good people you can choose send ground but in the s a has tainted your country and tainted yourself\nAnd this is after global outcry over ... who was a writer for the Washington Post hasn't been seen since you into that Saturday consulate in ... uh and uh still they're they're still investigating that and there's the report that's coming out et cetera\nA Harvard says race can only health applicants chances says Associated Press this after they're under a lot of fire for restricting rejecting Asian American applicants in favor of students from other racial background\nOr the Associated Press says Harvard University intentionally uses what they call invade quote personal rating to reject Asian applicants in favor of students from other ethnicities this is according to lawyers on one side of a trial that began yesterday\nAnd it carries a lot of implications for a dozen other us colleges now Harvard for its part denies any discrimination\nOr they said that race is just one factor that is considered and it can only help students chances of getting admitted which I don't think that that's a really good defense for Harvard to make particularly when they're under so much higher rates\nA really good defense for Harvard to make particularly when they're under so much fire right now I really school and then there's also I've been following this to\nA hyper alarming study shows massive insect lost\nNot just with the insects around the world are in crisis according to a number of long term studies showing dramatic declines in vertebrate population is more widespread than scientists realized huge amounts of bugs not just enforce in Puerto Rico but elsewhere\nWe have a lot more to get into coming out Cherokee genealogist ... response to Elizabeth Warren's claim stay with us [noise]\nThe Purple Heart foundation has been one of the longest running supporting sponsors of this program the dedicated men and women of the Purple Heart foundation worked tirelessly to provide for veterans and their families nationwide and I'm proud to partner with them because of your general support the Purple Heart foundation has been able to provide one on one support our honored soldiers after\nShe her family is always found in the United states records\nAs free white citizen of the United states they are absolutely never found in Cherokee Nation records ever\nLogic tells us her ancestors were not Cherokee we have citizens who actually have less Indian blood\nFor their CD I'd be than Elizabeth Warren DNA tests suggest she might have ... different to those people can prove that they have the right to be citizens of our Cherokee Nation\nThrough documentation their ancestors were always there\nSo right you know we eat we have some citizens would have no Indian blood we look back at the Friedman\nTheir citizens of the Cherokee Nation\nBecause we adopted them as citizens just like the United states adopted its foreigners places citizens\nWe would never you know they well they don't have American DNA they're in high measure for American DNA it's this thing or for Cherokee citizenship and\nWar and um I think this is probably the most damaging thing she could have done for Indian sovereignty\nAnd and it seems as there was a a a really awesome opportunity that could've prevented presented itself to learn more about it that was lost when she doubled down and you even made mention of this before I don't know why in the world\nShe just didn't say you know I had heard stories growing up they turned out not to be true I Apologize for that\nAnd and then ... and you know apologize and moved on instead of doubling down and tripling down and then coming out you know with this big grandiose announcement with his DNA tests for doing the video and everything that help nothing that just as you said that just made it so much worse\nAnd it is I'm Still somewhat in shock over everything that transpired in the last twenty four hours because\nIn my mind I understand what Indian identity is where it derives from\nIt doesn't necessarily derived from anything that I get as an individual it comes\nFrom my being as soon as I Love the Cherokee Nation who had treaties with the United states and that's where my right as an Indian comes from it is not individual worn doesn't seem to understand that she and she won't give it up it [noise]\nYeah I don't know I and then a huge distinction and I'm so glad that that you because I I I really enjoy writing and I think that you have a a a very good way of taking anything that seems complicated and making it very easy for people to understand because that's really where the focus is\nAnd in in in you laid it out so incredibly well because it's I mean this is about tribal sovereignty this isn't about race and it's not about identity politics as you just explain\nWhich I I I don't know why that you know aside from uh the secretary of state Mr ... junior there when when he was explaining out on on television last night that was the first I think that that's ever really been put out there\nBesides what you have written in this whole conversation and I I don't think that it's the peer ... peer ... the the the bubble so to speak\nUm because there seem to be I mean I see some of the Warren supporters thinking well you know the DNA tests prove that but as you said that\nThis is it's about tribal sovereignty and ... and it's not about what what you are pushing here which is\nWhich is true what harm does this do 'em for those who don't understand who aren't who you know are just looking at this thirty thousand a foot view what harm does this do in terms of a discussion and recognition of tribal sovereignty and awareness of it in this country\nI I [noise]\nFrom my view or seen some things happen right now that\nAre considering it under the issue of Indian identity there is a tried and Massachusetts who was denied it land in trust status because it did not fit the definition of Indian\nIn Texas a federal judge recently struck down the Indian child welfare act saying that it was based in race\nAnd um it's you know it's not it's based on status I don't care what race you cry it you're not a title citizen it does not apply\nSo we've seen those two things happen and it's alarmed Indian country say you know they're trying to redefine who we are and then immediately right behind those two things Warren comes out with the DNA test as\nIdentity Indian identity and that is concerning\nVery concerning uh especially given I mean there's a reason why and I always say this to to people especially as it is with respect to laws I mean there's a reason why you have certain terminology there's a reason why you have certain recognitions whether it's this or whether it's this or or any other issue as it pertains to law because\nWords words matter especially when you you're talking about you know a sovereign nations and you're talking about recognition of laws and trees et cetera et cetera words matter because the the law regulates it based on what words are used\n... exactly and I I was relieved when I saw the chair casing come out with a statement over this because at this point like you said they have not\nSaid anything against war it in fact there have been times they kind of gave her a pack\nThis time they came out made a statement and it was a pretty strong statement\nBut the key to me\nOn this whole thing is that our leadership and the Cherokee Nation is democratic and I don't mean they vote democratic I mean they're highly involved with the Democratic party so for them to come out and make a statement like that\nIt's stronger than many people realize\nYes very significant very significant and I think that kinda highlights how bad all of this has been um ... and as you said it does it does a real\nDisservice and putting it mildly 'em and can create a lot of complications and as you said you know Senator Warren Zinn attorney does it worry you that that someone who\nI'm for it you know has tried to because I think that there's a difference between saying well you you came from somewhere and then claiming that you are or something and the way that she had presented herself and you've even written and we're talking to twyla Barnes a Cherokee genealogist you've even written ... granddaughter dot com\nHow you know ... whether it's the the rest of the people that she came out with her the story that she was telling about her mom and dad and how they had a low because of her grandparents then you know cetera\nUm I mean it really I mean it it she was trying to claim that she was something which is very different than saying well I came from something\nAnd does it concern you that ... because she's a lawyer as you noted and because she's a senator and she seems to be setting herself up for a bigger race shouldn't she know more about that\nWe would hope she would um\nIt is it's troubling because she she's one theory I don't maybe she does know more about it and she doesn't care at this point what she did yesterday served no purpose other than to try to get a jab at this\nDale purpose other than to try to get a jab at the president of the United states there was no other purpose for that it serves no good purpose she could've ignored\nI mean we've all been insulted all being called ... which we ignore it not most of us ignore it right and she just could not do that\nRight\nYeah and then and then we have and then she I think ... created in even worse controversy\nFor herself a twilight for I appreciate what you do and I appreciate how hard he worked to educate people on on these issues and um and also educate people on recognition of using the proper terminology which is highly important folks you can find twilight ... granddaughter\nDot com twyla Barnes a such a pleasure to have you on the show thank you so much for your voice and for what you do\nThank you\nMhm take care and folks are and you can go up by the way I can tell his granddaughter dot com she's got a great a super really some good information out there that I Love a it is it's not it's not a racing that's not identity politics it is about tribal sovereignty\nAnd then there's a reason because you're you're you're a part of that sovereign entity and that's why so that's incredibly important we a have a a lot more in store we have Florida Man on the way as we get moving you heard me discuss a little bit earlier how there is

I can you say like a good time and a half because I worked overtime really you know\nI'm OK Now by the way I could buy more book if you listen to the program yesterday you heard me interview the comedian he's he's brilliant Michael junior\nAnd ah and we're going to have part two with him in a couple of minutes and as I said he's so good I Want to just keep talking so we're gonna play that a couple of minutes Michael junior our to the great David Limbaugh maybe the brother of Russ\nLimbaugh who yeah um yeah you've heard of Rush Limbaugh oh yeah um okay so\n[laughter] but I got I got a Michael junior to laugh he got you'd assign a book for miracles book and he said I'm going to sell us on ... and he laughed and said you know one oddly enough you can get more money on on ... if it's not signed\nYet here so people have said that made him kind of a longer laugh at that although technically it's funny I'm\nHey somebody tweeted the other day on Twitter you know copied me and said that get her when Texas has miracles book signed copy of miracles but kind of ... and I clicked on it takes you the ... and he was selling a signed copy of my miracles book he was and I said this guy's like marketing on Twitter you know to\nHe really is not Larry us yeah ... whatever you want to get more without assigned to pay a guy okay well I got a lot to talk about the fact that my book is launching today\nOr is it really is important to me so I'm very excited about it and I want to remind folks\nOr if you're thinking of getting a coffee or copies for Christmas or whatever if you buy them\nThe week that it comes out which is to say today or tomorrow or it goes to the first week of the ... when they when they put together the best seller lists so\nI I always say to friends do me a favor if you're going to buy the book by it now because it it goes the first week is is the most is the best option for a for us to get\nA on the bestseller list so I just want to say that it's important to me if you're thinking of buying it that you would buy it this week and of course you get the first edition and the first printing 'em I actually think this is going to be a thing I think people are gonna I think next Halloween\nActing with me absolutely as it has happened at times when I'm Talking\nLike pretty serious ... and I'm not getting anything back like I don't know what's going on and you feel like ... because I'm not getting the laughs\nI feel like the audience is now with meat laughter is the only way you can guarantee you're into that they're tracking absolutely the end or there but but you're absolutely right if anything else you really have no way of knowing I mean you could brilliant play and if it's not a comedy you like did they love it do they hate it I don't know\nYou don't know and then you just got some critics have been writing about it like if the people that's\nWhy I like comedy so much you know immediately and you know immediately if you should probably get another job so I get some comedians who asks me questions especially new communities they'll say stuff like how can really make it in comedy and this is my wife said this yesterday on a radio show that was way more fun than this one yeah I'm a ... uh\nI said there's no such thing as a pure stand up comedian there just isn't I mean there's some really really really funny guys but they're but to only to say to yourself I'm going to be a standup comedian only actually a ticket to misery\nWhat I mean by that is is comedy is a vehicle it's not a destination\nBut now now why is that because I'm thinking of people who did comedy grow you know and that was their only thanks so what do you mean by that vehicle to what\nWill a vehicle to something greater than just making people laugh because if you think about some of the great some of the great thing comedy think about the end\nLike what it it looked like at the end I don't worry about that or did they certainly tried to attach themselves to something bigger like one or to want to like a ... of one of the great to know people don't like been sick all in one of the greats anymore was Bill Cosby\nIs no doubt in the world of comedy you one of the greats right Warner grace but towards the end of his career before all that other stuff jumped off\nHe actually started going through communities are mainly black communities and talking to people about how important it is to make sure you're doing the right things he's Seventy something years old as point where you realize like water I Do I just made it most people laugh\nLike like people at at a certain point you start to say wait what even graduate actors you say to yourself what what ... what am I what did I really do I'm sure bankers everybody else is like what did I Do because they have all of this set up and they haven't deliver the ... yeah I\nI like this idea now I got to ask you do you uh who who your influences growing up when you were a kid you not that much younger than me so when you were a kid who are the people that you said I Want to do that I find that that that guy's funny or did you did you get you want to be a comedian what were you thinking as a kid\nWhen I was three years old uh I used to watch you are listening to you on that just in general yeah that's very funny and the ... and um no my role ... it was hard on your throat which is so I thank God I'm younger now ... ... is that your Walker\nLooks that way a second could more practically the same age as you shave your hair off nobody can tell if it's gray yeah yeah that's an that's an Indian trick on or ... years and who were your come on your influence is growing up who were they let me\nJust finish this little comment was in fact in all good you just put your hair on your why do\nI Know I'm very open with my audience this is a this is a a a wealth fitted horse hair wig had commissioned from a weak master I said\nI said money's no object I don't want the finest wig money can buy and he said well that's going to be horse here because course hair holds its value fish from the derby too and I got to meet the ... and it was a very intelligent horse and I said\nI Want that on my head so they kill the horse and if there's a lot of behind it but they said that uh Eric they said this is going to expensive but it's going to hold its value if you want to resell that wing someday probably get most of the money that you pay for it so that's what you're looking at right now we're\nProbably nine seconds passed by joke was a ... you should have jumped in and say hey let's start in ... so what do you what do you know bad jokes and this was going to try to ask you who were your influences so here's what gets really weird about this question in an intimate go ahead and answer so is this is this is where people don't understand so when I first\nStarted doing comedy it was the strangest thing I'm doing comedy and I completely lost my taste for watching comedy\nLike it's a no it was so weird like I Would be on TV trying to watch or I Would be um\nThis one I don't think it's funny it's comedy but then there's these three amazing stories in the middle of the jokes are through the comedy special that has never known it has never been done like this before it ever anywhere\nAnd will never be done again because it's going to fail yeah why you need to go to the theaters or\nAnother way to save ... it's going to Eric is going to Eric ... especially if you could\nTell us that was so cold to say like I thought we used to be friends oh well retiree folks or I or unfortunately I gotta do no segment with this guy so please be come with me folks don't go don't go come back\nAlbum I Want to tell you about real effect over yeah yeah I take it all the time I Know a lot of people take it half the the the media are talking about it but on this program instead of me talking about it how about if we can get somebody else to talk about somebody for example named ...\nOh over the years I got older I dealt with pain in my head and it got worse and worse trying to walk up stairs it was felt miserable that morning I heard of that really factor I ordered it right then within three weeks I was free of pain\nThat's what everybody says you you try it within three if you if it's not healthy within three weeks I wouldn't use it but most people are

I had him on this program also but I mean his his impressions are just amazing calm maize and right\nAnd uh and of course Don Rickles foster books and Charlie callous are you familiar with foster books and Charlie callous no breeze that true\nThat is true I actually think that foster broke and Charlie callous or to the funniest human beings ever in the history of comedy and the only place I encountered them they will be on the Tonight Show with is that rarely the foster books\nAnd Charlie cows on the on the on the dean Martin roast it ... ... I mean those are the only to clean as I can think of that you cannot not laugh like there's no way you're not going to laugh\nIs or where is your brings meal is talking about for every ... ... yes it is a very ... very weird does your wife will do you bring up ex girlfriends ... it was amazing no but you know I mean\nYou know he was just you know serious as though you but I mean I just started passing that a comedian that you don't say like when I was growing up there was this one now is a cause I those I Know it was a handful of people that I just think there's to me the gold standard I always think of them\nYou know even in ... in for me even in school like I wasn't a funny guy in school\nWhen I was in the class clown I grew up in a house or you have to wear were grown folks are talking you just listen to um have you ever see me at a party yeah first of all it's not me somebody looked like me grill like gross people right but if it is me I'm In a corner very quiet now if anything just looking at maybe taking notes\nBecause of my comedy Montgomery actually comes from a when I was a kid I used to struggle more reading\nLike I ... off when I was just really bad start to look at words differently like I'm Talking about even in middle school\nHave I'd have to look at the ... and the color to positioning what's in front of what's behind it how people responded to it actually came up with seven different ways to look at a word to determine what the where it was no joke for real but I got really good at it to the point in high school people didn't know it wasn't really reading I was just working out really really fast now as an adult or we just fine\nBut I still got disability look at words and people in situations seven different ways almost immediately and that's the primary play supplement company\nYou know where you are right you're genius you I'm not kidding you're genius you have a you have an ability to see if I remember when I heard you to a comedy at one point you went into this in depth he told a story\nAnd I realized that that's just a freaky gift like well yeah it is but I mean it could be a curse but it's a gift in your case from using it for me right like to sometimes people they don't ask to see things the way they see that we're just to kind of a gift but you're able to turn it into ... first person to call me a genius really kind of touched me a little for real promise you I'll be the last\nBecause people need to be geniuses themselves to recognize trouble in the ...

I didn't watch it the ... debuted last night\nWithout Roseanne and like seven minutes into it there and he said oh well she died she died of an opioid overdose and the ratings sink the ratings were not\nGood um they ... they were nothing like what it was on when she was there it went from ten million people to it well it was eight over almost Nineteen million and it was here than ten million that watch last night and here's the thing\nAnd I just go back to what norm McDonald has said well she had treated where it was a regards to Valerie Jarrett was was awful and people I thought this was the first time she's ever treated anything awful you know when she was\nTalking about putting cookies and she dressed up as Hitler and put little gingerbread cookies in the oven that was okay when she said the things that she said about conservatives that was okay and we find yeah but then people got mad when it was Valerie Jarrett\nAnd I'm not saying it and like I said it was bad but it but people I think she's never did anything horrible before she's not a conservative Roseanne is not a conservative that being said I think\nHer show was very different from what she was on line and how she was privately because it was a very real show and it was about very real issues and I think she was able to compartmentalize how over the top she was privately to how she refined her comedy on television\nAnd\nNow I Would as her career done forever\nThe people who worship Roman Polanski\nAnd Woody Allen her career is done forever\nThat's why I don't take Hollywood there blacklist her her seriously because the reason that they they are pretending to be so agree though for what she tweeted his because they think she's a conservative and she's not but there are holding the fact that she won't slam Trump against her as a way to say well no you're really horrible person but yet\nPolanski and Woody Allen and Harvey Weinstein all of that stuff Harvey Weinstein was a reluctant casualty of me to do yeah\nThey didn't they only did it after everybody after I got some steam still\nFighting tooth and nail for them um but\nWith the revamping the only thing you can look at it as far as conservative as concerned as she was she was a supporter of Israel\nYeah she's Jewish and she is she's pro business and so really those things kind of a line with Trump and which is really why she even aligned with Trump at all but the left loves to paint her as an entire right wing crazy\nWell they need an avatar they need to justify what they actually believe in our and the thing is is that she apologized and\nThat wasn't good enough why is it that when someone there is no have you noticed that now in society America used to be about the comeback story and it's not anymore America used to love a good comeback story in America doesn't anymore that's a cultural change that's quite significant\nAnd it there's no room for redemption there's too much joy and destruction right now mhm there's no room for redemption\nNo room for and it was just so fake because nothing plays better on the screen and redemptive stories anti heroes et cetera\n\nNo room for redemption at all anymore it's not enough to say you're sorry it's not enough to have a change of heart it's not enough to modify what you think you ... you must be destroyed by people who are the two of them graces foreign you must be destroyed\nAnd grace is foreign you must be destroyed and as a result of that and this is why norm or Donald was right when he talked about this in an interview as a result of that people realize well there's no coming back from ... from an apology\nThere's no coming back from an apology so why apologize\nWhy rectify why even begin to be read them to to be redeemed why it's pointless society is teaching at redemption as non existent and forgiveness is non existent and grace is a joke\nAnd as a result\nIt's making people more polarized\nBecause it takes people think that forgiveness and they think that allowing someone to be redeemed is is is surrender on their part which is show myopic they think that they are surrendering by allowing for someone else to be redeemed\nBut that's not at all you are surrendering but not in a way you think\nIt's making society worse that's just so horrible\nI mean that's\nJust it's it's just awful\nAnd so I I see all of this and and I I it's I don't think and that's why I think that the all the outrage and the agreement\nIs fake because if you're outraged your outrage job or something that is really truly awful and you want it to be made right but people don't care they want to rent they want to stay outraged\nThey've been taught that there is power and being outraged you ... your outrage must be catered to which is why time in the cabin I'll think that was so significant\n\nIt was so incredibly significant because it was as simple no this is what I've always said never been to needed a rage mob you will never satisfy the rage mob the rage mob will move on and find another thing over which to be outraged and it will continue\nOn and on and on the only reason\nThat the outrage mob exist is because the indulgent of a stupid society it's the indulgence of a society that thinks somehow it has to cater to outrage\nStop catering to the mob\nIt isn't a serious entity they're not serious they had no ... there are concerns are specious\nThey commit sometimes worse offenses than the individuals who name often falsely accused and the thing is over which they should be outraged about like the ... the

is that all thing yeah yeah I picked up at a flea market no I it's kind of funny because I'm Talking to you you and I of\nCourse he talked before we done radio before act on your show I I've written these big books but my new book is called Donald drain the swamp it's a it's a humor book really kind of for kids about a figure named Donald to drain the swamp so I Know that's not what's on your coffee table book but we have to get your address so I can send you you know fresh material so that that ...\nThing\nAnd you know I had I was taught that five yeah congratulations by the way now you\nYou uh I just want people to know when they come your house that not only am I incredibly deep I'm also incredibly shallow I Want them to know that\nJust by looking just by looking at your coffee table to know that I'm an shall look okay well ... you know you're ... you're\nSo kind of a gene that but but the book you've written um what was your idea behind writing it because I'm I guess you're you're seeing that the the insanity and people are a lot of people don't know what to make of it\nUntil a couple of things but that's what I wanted to start doing that they're not the crazy ones and they ask those people you watched across the ocean every day are actually crazy and you are an on and so I Want to choose short people then she'll come to know um [noise]\nYou know I Know in in cars natural habitat here and try\nTo walk and I know in the White House and I know and you know in champagne and and so and I know it's ... and and I feel I Want to comment on his to get an e you think's mind that makes sense in human or anything she'll developments and\nYou know as I look at people in the context of the nation than a contract that human element in the context of their education their birth order and and and\nHe is president as perfectly suited for this I Need a search on your show by it can be quite the person should ever occupied oval\nOffice that no no no go ahead go ahead yeah\nWell I have an actual reality that people are interested in it can stop worrying about whether he's crazy he ... he is just very well suited for such a China's going it's\nFunny you say that honestly because ... the reason I think he resonates with so many people no matter what you think of all the details and whatever and he's not perfect let's face it he does things that I don't like but he has a really\nRemarkable a virtuoso level of common\nSense it's it's really something\nThat is remarkable I mean when I saw him on Leslie stall talking sixty minutes the other day I thought to myself what is so funny is that somebody that I Love like Ronald Reagan I Would never imagine him going toe to toe with hostile journalists like Lesley Stahl he just wouldn't put himself in that position Trump weighed in there\nAnd he goes toe to toe and most of what he says I mean they try to get a B soundbites and things but\nI I listened and I talked to myself this may\nBe soundbites and things but I I listen to talk to myself this man\nHas been given a gift of very deep common sense of the kind of rare\nIn life and when you see somebody has it they usually are really good businessman entrepreneurs or something and of course he is that but to see 'em functioning in the way that he is right now it's it's it's it's come to my mind fascinating because there are plenty people you know this pundits are in the media world\nBut one thing they do not have\nIs common sense they may be brilliant they may have a lot of degrees but they don't have common sense and so it's kind of funny to see this guy with his commonsense on full display\nA constantly but it's just interesting to me that the comments on it because you're in a position with a PHD in psychology to talk about that into to assess it right\nTo marry you make\nPersonality type um actually my back the\nPersonality type that if you're just saying what am I correct type indicator in my opinion it gets quite hear not ever got to watch out for him although I'm going to ask him for that I'm an extra damn but I Am I but I just in an talk once you've done a lot of that sort of a testament\nTo attract people you know on the on the outside and that is the okay with my book am I now is it because the truth about it but you know if you look in your family birth order this is where it gets really interesting and I won't\nGo choo choo deep fried rice wheat but it is fascinating and interesting quirk daughter um called\nFirst and last in the double birth order and and he happened to have enough faith\n... like if you have the right heart is birth order to have both character trait first born invading the baby we all know children we all know the baby of family here it's a fight but he has five children like I I mean it really easy for them and try to take a look at that\nMaybe they need nearly that confident thinks everyone wants them can't understand why anyone wouldn't want them to carry a lot of times with that personality types you also maybe a little bit in the ... the rest of my ability that a lot of siblings do everything for them is\nThat if there's a large space between them and their older siblings that older sibling and younger so that the younger sibling as well that that gets by because they said\nThat while\nOrder so they become a natural leader which is great and Gary is closed today and energy and and total optimism that they'd shots they can pretty much do anything and usually they can't because they were born with us leadership qualities because they had a younger sibling it at all but it's possible for so\nIt's an amazing preparation personality type on top of that and it isn't it that you know I think the rating don't make you very uniquely qualified for such a tiny and you know with the niche you you mentioned Ronald Reagan in of course he was always my favorite president prior to this but I don't think we need to compare president\nNow but you live in the last ... conservative movement wars going in for I\nJust watched her to come in to wake up it's hard to come our party that was way too much for consultants and way too much deference chew immediately and all the rest of it right and this president you\nNeed to do this I don't know that as you mentioned that Ronald Reagan could have done what does\nIt at doing right now and the need is president right now\nOh there's no doubt about that I find it for some reason I find the whole thing hilarious when I say all areas when I really mean\nSo delightful that I have to break out in laughter there's something comedic and entertaining about him because he will say what everyone is thinking and that's what you're not supposed to do Reagan did it they didn't do it on the level that Trump does but Reagan when Reagan said\nMr Gorbachev tear down this wall by\nEverybody told him I think there were seven draft and they cut it out of every draft they basically said\nLook you don't understand you're not that break the way we do things around here you do not to say this and he said well I Am going to say it why am I going to say it's\nBecause deep in my heart I Know this is true and this is right and I understand where you're coming from but I think you're wrong and I'm the president and um the leader I'm not getting paid to listen to you I'm getting paid ultimately\nHe may be one of the most sound like people to ever occupied the oval office and it may take a little crazy when I got an air Michael came out the same week as well we're ... we're right we're doesn't know the president has zero psychological and behavioral training as far as I Know that in other presidents family I guess Lara Trump straight up when I was on her show um\nYou know if she ever met him dancers sales because it doesn't tell him um and yet his book so\nTens of millions of copies of bully he said the president was insane I said just saying I have the training to say so and and you know and it's just it's it's just it's just it's such an integral\nTo hang on one second folk so we're going to be right back with Dr gene allowed him stick around\nPay Alvin did I tell you about really factor lilies uh no actually I mean can I tell you about it okay you may I may you may but what I'm trying to say I've got somebody even better Oh yes I've got a guy named Alan who's been using relief factor I'd like to hear what he has to favor Lee factor here it is\nA bit in my I have some slow early twenties now I'm fifty one in my early twenties I worked for the ... I got injured I was off work for your\nMental train engineer basically to my wife and making me take relief rocker literally changed the reward them twenty again goes\nWell see this is why I Want to ... you know I could talk about it all day long but I'm telling you so many people have been blessed by if you go to release factor dot com relief that did not come it's all botanical there's nothing dangerous about it you can take it all day long and you know within three weeks if it works for you and if it works for you it will probably change your life really factor that commonly factor\nDot com hey there it's Eric my taxes for policy genius here's an on fun fact over half of bankruptcy the mortgage foreclosures are caused by medical issues that's because if you get sick or injured over the course of your career your employer sick leave off and only covers you for up to three months\nAnd my health insurance helped with medical bills he doesn't replace lost income that is we're disability insurance comes in it's essentially income insurance to protect your paycheck if you're sidelined by an illness or injury\nPolicy genius us all the shopping for you they compare quotes from the top disability insurance companies to find the best price then they're licensed experts\nManaged the application process to save you time and hassle policy genius has helped over four million people shop for insurance and placed over twenty billion dollars in coverage so if you rely on your income and get by compared disability insurance quotes with policy genius dot com will help you protect your paycheck\nAt a price it makes sense you can get started on line right now the policy genius the easy way to compare and by disability insurance\nI'm so fearful I feel like my world is about to come crashing down around me I Can't even get to sleep at night this constant dread is wearing me down I Can't put my finger on it nothing actually wrong I'm just so unsettled [noise] I don't know what to do [noise]\n\nI just wanted to stop I Want to see them normal\n[noise]\nPaid some counseling is here to help our team of license Christian counselor she went to help you get to read this we can begin a conversation when you're ready to extra phone or even video conferencing from the comfort of your own home I'd like to give you your first week free\nWho to try to counseling dot com much talk do right now to try faithful counseling dot com we really want to help you\nIt's so easy to get started and your first week is free now to try to counseling dot com and let us\nStocks and options trading involves financial risk and it's not suitable for all investors to guys with\nScott ...

I think I could see them as a second chance there is no area and research or anything else and I believe that most people\nIn the show that most people I think we need and\nTalk radio right they do get television shows like I Do every day a new t._v. um I think most people\nWho are out in the public can put themselves out there believe their ideas or we're hearing how your you know this isn't right I think that they're selfish maniac they're going to go kill somebody but I'm saying if you run for public office\nEspecially that state level or higher certainly for president at the United states I think you would have a difficult case proving that he wants to sit\nOut some some level or effects are right and I and I put myself in that category as well\nBut that doesn't make you in shape and it doesn't make you eat all ... and ... now are all evil people are\nProbably but that's a different place on the spectrum of very very different kind of access to a local maniacal kind of not just isn't that a is dangerous right and I kept other mental efficiencies as well but people get really confused about\nPsychology being a science and it's really not Eric it's really at Erie there's nothing you know it's not a scientific is global\nWarming and I don't think that either and so you're right after the ... yeah so\nI think one of the weather was really important things to do here when they need to make with you on this before we go any further and that is\nThey started with the Trump Russia thing to try to destroy him because they don't like his ideas they went to the women thing they tried to destroy and look back now starting to end up paying his legal fees who knew that could happen here there's going to continue that I Believe their final\nEffort is going to be to try to declare the president mentally incompetent insane or or perhaps with some sort of the generic mental condition that we have to be ready to fight back\nFor our values and the things that we've accomplished with the ministry alone that set the working for for decades\nWell you're you're right and I also think that when we haven't mentioned speaking as a creative I think creativity or
