Kristin offer\nEric Ericson editor of the research is\nAmy Walter national editor for the cook Political Report and Joshua jobs and host of warning on NPR welcome to Sunday it's meet the press [noise]\nThe Sunday Morning as our colleague journalist ... wrote on Twitter late yesterday the worst anti Semitic attack in us history took place today just days after the largest attempted assassination of political leaders in us history but that thinking\nIt's a deeply unsettling assessment that has the disturbing advantage of being accurate this after a week of ethnic violence and political tear on friday a Florida Man ... was arrested and charged with sending as many as fourteen mail bombs to Democrats and other critics of President Trump\nAnd justice of the country tried to exhale as the male bombing danger seem to have passed we learned yesterday the horror in Pittsburgh where a lot of\nPeople were shot and killed a ... a synagogue and the city's heavily Jewish world film they last night there were numerous\nVigils around the city in the country including this one in Pittsburg near the synagogue and remember victims and our hyper partisan atmosphere\nWhere we will inevitably today was the male bomber inspired in catalyzed by President Trump\nWho kept his political opponents enemies of the people or was he just alone are filled with anger and political resent that was the synagogue shooter\nA product of a toxic environment on the right that treats refugees and Americans who don't look and worship as they do with other or with this type of hate filled mass murder we've seen too many times in this country before\nWe got both of these stories covered plus we're going to look at the amped up political rhetoric that serves as the backdrop to this year's midterm elections just nine days away but let's begin with my colleague in the senior justice correspondent Pete Williams will hopefully have updates force on both of these stories peak warning\nGood morning Chuck will uh Bowers is now going to phase Robert Bauer is the uh the convince the alleged shooter in in Pittsburgh is going to face Seventy two counts now he's been charged both by the federal government and by the state\nThat has no place over correct well they they both filed charges so I I think it's not clear who where he's going to go on trial first but the federal government was very eager to step in and say this was a hate crime\nAnd justice the Pennsylvania authorities have said and there seems to be very little doubt of that for three reasons basically one is that social media postings I'm months and months of of a vial anti Semitic comments secondly the fact that he singled out a synagogue and speaks for itself and thirdly the police in Pittsburgh say\nAs he was being transported to the hospital as he was being treated for his wounds he said all Jews must must die because they are committing genocide against my people\nDid he ... who who does he referred to as as his people and not taste who knows I mean that's that's what he told the police as they were treating him on the way to the hospital\nThere was other than his whereabouts over the last year there's not much known about Mr ... ... or that is that what what what profile are they able to drop so far\nNo you're right and if you contrast the to hear Caesar say oc are accused of the bombings uh the sending out the package bombs he had had many run ins with police over the years he even made a bomb threat against Florida\nPower light over one of his power bills at one point on the other hand power seems to have absolutely no contact with law enforcement they said he was never on their radar before he was a loner neighbor say he never got out much you seem to have his life seems to have been led on line and I think one question is\nHow did he ever visited that synagogue before did he know the lay out of it because you know ultimately it ends on the third floor that's worth a shootout with police as if he's trying to hide from them\nAnd did a is there any indication that he purchased any of his guns illegally when they purchased legally\nNo there's no indication that he bought anything illegally and I think one question about his weapons is this ... many of the witnesses said they thought there was automatic weapons fire well you have to assume that these are people who don't spend a lot of time listening to gunfire but the police say it sounded like automatic weapons fire so I think the question is\nDid he modify that semi automatic rifle it's possible to do it it's illegal but then he modified in a way that would shoot automatically or was it using a bump stock like was used in Las Vegas shooting I let's move to\nA Caesar say are as a a friday he was not talking a is a is there any update on whether he has yet to cooperate with with officials\nNo and in their ability to question him now or is is reduced he's going to have his first court appearance on Monday they they initially question him under an exception for the Miranda rule you know normally you have to buy some of their rights before you\nCan question them if you want to use that evidence in the trial against them but there is a public safety exception and that's what they used here basically saying are there any more bombs well he refused to say a whether he had anything to do with the ones that were already out there or be whether there were any other still waiting to be discovered it's been what thirty six hours now since they found it\nWas just going to say at this point I Can't say I noticed that the postal service won't say definitively yet at what point will they feel comfortable assuming that it's out of the system\nWeek maybe a you know they had been finding these closer and closer to the mail system or the last ones were discovered inside the mail system so\nCarefully looking for them and I think you have to assume that there aren't any more because this is the longest gap that we've had since they were to anywhere discovered and all the ... late once discovered where west coast so it's sort of make sense that that might be so the assumption has got to be that right the last two two Senate sent to senator Kamala Harris and attempts dire\nAlright tense a top tier Tom sorry Pete Williams a than an awfully tough and busy week for you for all of us thanks very much for the day yesterday and had a vigil last night members of the community in Pittsburgh\nWere shocked and heartbroken\nIt is and think of it and then combining that community whether you're

city\nYou know many synagogue have protection sadly constantly on because threats are constant or in the Jewish community sometimes are low level sometimes they're very serious\nI'm so sadly this isn't this isn't a shock and yet it is unexpected [noise]\nCan you just share with how the community is sort of reacting to particularly in a particularly in the Jewish community there\nAs well\nIn

won't shift you whites don't shoot lights painless here Joshua Johnson host of on a on NPR any Walter national editor the cook Political Report\nNBC News the White House correspondent crystal Walker and Erick Erickson editor the conservative website the research and the president last night\nI played for you the one soundbite he said about anti Semitism\nAnd he said that at the top of his remarks and then he went right back in to rally mode Amy Walter take a listen\nHow about the Democrats [noise]\nLadies and gentleman speaker Nancy Pelosi for that\nAnd they continue to have these foolish and very stupid people\nI can go above God says that any more but I think I Will anyway you might\n[noise] this moment with President Trump he seems to be struggling with it\nAssist the motives that he's been in since he was a candidate\nPolitics has never about nuance zero sum game when you are campaigning it's us or them find airing but when you become an elected official suddenly become depressed the United states campaigning is supposed to stop for a while and you go into the mode of unifying\nThis is the president has never been interested in unifying here it's been interested in keeping his base engaged and enraged and he's done an amazing job of that but\nHe believes that it's still in the middle of the campaign\nThe other thing I Want to bring up just with all of this writ large is you know what their country's long history of division losing American who's not seems to me the time that we're in right now what I feel like is no one is taking any responsibility for any of this\nOh it's not the gun law it's not our fault with guns don't kill people killed right it's not our fault who posts on social media don't blame us in social media like he'll do that I blame someone else\nIt's not us our political leaders ... you know people are doing these things with out that they just have a history of mental instability it's not about what we're saying to them no one at all is raising their hand to say you know\nWe played some role in this and we have to be able to fix it so it's always somebody else's fault when that's the world we live in is never going to get better and walk or\nI I Know everybody everybody when you go to the president says what about this what about what what about this and I would say there's only one president that's right there's a day in fact that\nThey don't the response within the White House and I spoke to a number of officials is look everyone bears responsibility\nAnd when you put that question to them squarely look he is the president he has the loudest microphones doesn't he bear the largest responsibility they say well he has changed some of his rhetoric he has struck unify no but remember on friday check he was asked if he's going to tone down the rhetoric he\nSaid no he thinks he can actually turn it up now that was prior to\nYesterday's tragic shooting but I think Amy really hits the nail on the head which is that White House officials say this yes he feels like he needs to have a unifying notes at the same time\nWe are ten days out from the mid terms and so he knows what he needs to say to fire up his base and a lot of that rhetoric is divisive that's the bottom line\nTurks and David French wrote this and said you know what they'll call this person crazy referring to say he's an anger angry obsessive and that there is it\nThe language did matter and he writes that not all listening here's a sober minded are entirely rational and when they hear a public figure they admire fund or against his political opponents of extreme language sometimes they they'll take extreme action in response to says David French putting some of the burden on the part\nI think so um I mean the problem I have with putting the burden on the president is how much do you put on him and I think a lot of people want to put a lot of the burden on him where it really does belong on the American people as a whole\nI'm the president is the American comments section of the White House\nAnd he is the president who does this we're not going to change this president what can we knew the changes that people if we're not going to change the president\nI think aims right no one wants to change but the fact of the matter is this was larger than the president society is crumbling around us politics has amplified at the president's amplified it but there's something going on in society as a whole ah that is translating into politics and the president is not the cause he's a symptom\nHe's the president Joshua he is only one true that the president bears part of the responsibility a significant part of the authority for the tone of the country\nIf I Will say I do have a fair amount of hope\nComing out of this and I know it seems very bleak but I find a lot of hope and younger people that montage she played in the first segment a program that got girl with the cool future hair and she was one of the organizers of that gathering data on squirrel hill she got on Facebook\nAnd helped bring people together to just come talk I got a tweet from a guy who I think is in Wisconsin who says I combat the heat of the world by coaching high school debate\nThey learn to see both sides of an issue and how current events relate to real life there was a poll that came out from Cuba recently that found that the younger you are the better you are able on line to discern factual\nStatements from opinion statements if the older people like generation thrown up the baby boomers claim them but I'm not saying ... frankly I Know it I think it's it's the generations and I'm just a generation removed who have grown up with the advent\nOf social media who haven't been able to navigate at our kids having watched our example now the question is whether we will be the queen thing to them a nation that yet remains connected whether this is the beginning of another\nCultural civil war but I come out of this worried but also hopeful that there are people who are taking responsibility for this look what happened after Parkland look what's happening now off the scroll hill there is a generation ready to leave but the question is what will they be leading what\nI'll tell you somebody who's not hopeful Charlie Sykes former talk radio host\nHe wrote this in the Weekly Standard the result of course is familiar in across the board refusal to engage in any meaningful self examination refusal to acknowledge the failures in your own tribe while insisting we let let's say on the malignancy of the other tribes its hatred violence that apparently bottomless capacity for deception of trickery so this will get worse sorry Joshua we\nWell Chuck first off that that simply not true but look with the concerns that that a woman hat and in Pittsburgh look another census active haters strict in yet another community and a place of worship in the United states of America\nThe Congress has a responsibility to act\nTo keep people safe and it's not too much to expect leaders to bring us together to unite our country or to find a way to reach out to us toward greater good and make sure that we rise above all of the accusations and the hate and the finger pointing\nCheck so I Am certainly hopeful that we'll see that out of uh the leader of the free world and that will see that out of each and every one of us individually as well as our colleagues\nI and I would like to say I'm proud of the way then responded when Steve skull east was shot I mean we didn't blame Bernie Sanders when Steve ... was shot we all came together I think we can all come together now or it may take us about nine days for that to happen but I think we can all come together now\nWell I Want to read to yourself and Dan Balz start today though Steve is an added layered because today\nWell I Hope that I Hope that the finger pointing will stop and we can come together I I Believe we need to come together and then\nI have to tell you I actually think Dan Balz or is the perfect person to insert into this because he writes the following this was a time of the politics of the apocalypse\nAnd all or nothing and knew the difference between winning and losing an election and holding power or not holding it politicians say that it's time for the country to come together as you to just did but on who's terms I think that is the issue comes on\nWhat this coming together mean to the Democrats\nAnd then I'm going to ask the same question to Congress and diverse I'll start with the cops and the law\nWell look it's making sure that we're able to reach across the aisle and we can work in a bipartisan basis for Democrats have been clear about is if we're fortunate to win back the house which I Believe we will that we work immediately on lowering prescription drug prices for the American people\nThat we work on a bipartisan infrastructure package to make investments across the country and that we work together to clean up Washington DC\nTo find ways to overturn Citizens United to address gerrymandering or to improve or an increased transparency and disclosure across the government to restore faith in our political process those are all areas where we can work together and reach across the aisle and find some common ground\n... what does it mean to you why do I think I Do think\nWe need to come together or not on anyone's terms but on America's terms we're Americans first\nI agree with them that infrastructure is something that we all need and we need to come together on lowering prescription drug costs I'm not sure why didn't talk about lowering healthcare costs we need to come together on lowering healthcare costs are and I think we can do that we need to listen to each other\nOr no matter who takes the majority are and I think we're going to hold the majority but no matter who takes the majority it will be a ... a razor thin majority and hopefully that will mean people will come together Republicans and Democrats to get things done\nBut I Do worry about the you know making sure that we do it in a way that we're focused on getting things done not on just abolishing ice\nOr doing the things that are on the extreme\n... Congress insiders I Want to ask you about an ad that you're running um last week one of the people targeted by the pipe bomb or a a assailant was a George Soros here as a part of an ad that you're running in Minnesota against the Democratic candidate there named Dan thin I'm paid for by the interests I enter cc take a listen\nBillionaire George Soros bank loans the resistance than than seeing the un's employed by just sort of one of the liberal outfit in DC his campaign from them by other states superPACs back by ...\nLook at who finance is Dan ... employer radical George Soros most of the biggest banks are crooked lobbyist tied to pollution they pay the ... fund his campaign\nWhy do you talk retro ...\n... you know there are independent expenditure arm is independent um but uh you know that ad is the actual uh and uh you know it also um it has nothing to do with a a calling for violence in that ad is is a factual and\nCongressman Lou on uh do you believe that they're they're attacking folks of big money you guys do it too I guess with the Koch brothers and things like that are are we inadvertently putting\nPutting people private citizens in the in the crosshairs of politics that don't need to be\nWell look you see but I think on all sides we need to evaluate how people are being targeted um even this morning Kevin McCarthy pull down a tweet\nWhere he was targeting a George Soros as well as Tom's tired and a few other leaders like Mr Bloomberg across the country um I think that both committee should begin to look at how they operate into the future and what's going on even during the rest of this election cycle\nBut look we built a strategy at the D triple C surrounding our candidates talking about their personal stories and records of service men and women who have served the United states in the military or CIA officers FBI agents\nPeople who have committed them their cells to keeping our country safe and we're going to continue to run ads that are telling their positive stories where our candidates are connecting with the American people\nLet me ask you both been your ads in in Colorado and in Washington had been called sleazy and personal attacks I mean I bet it happens on both sides we've probably both need out how to clean things up but it's it's that's affecting them that we're not off that the media call him that let me see by running\nWere running were well hold on check on that go ahead Steve you've you've also been running racist ads\nIn New York in ... in Cincinnati, Ohio and out in California you can do something to pull those down and I just think on all sides that everyone should monitored their tone here again no more finger pointing Steve I'm sure that we look within ourselves and we find the greater good there ...\nI I agree with you Ben but let's let's both look within ourselves\nSteve directly men right out on a a Congress in ... very right it may be nine days before everybody is willing to to sort of calm things down but let's hope there's a little more calm before the next night I have a check we are today you should then\nAll right I Will let you by the way they're Steve we should I Hope I Hope everybody is safe and the campaign trail over the next time tonight on them and thank you both for coming on when we come back we'll check\nA lot more people are voting early this

Lott\nCrime research dot org and very quickly ... gives you some of his books that you're what you're going to want to read the war on guns army yourself against gun control but I think I've told John on the program before I one of the best books he's ever written as far as I'm concerned I've got to mark up like a like a kids' school book\nI Love it a more guns less crime course third edition of biased against guns and on and on you can find all of their crime research dot org let me go back over to John's Twitter page and want to play the ... today Dr John box thoughts\nOn the mass public shooting at the Pittsburgh synagogue entertain you hear what John spots on this for a minute thirty second cyclists\nAnother mass shooting our hearts go out to those who lost loved ones in France today at the Pittsburgh setting guarded chair\nThank God we have a president who understands what can be done to stop these attacks that these killers purposely seek out those places were victims aren't allowed to defend themselves big gun free zones service maintenance for these attacks\nThat virtually all of these mass shootings key by taking place in areas where victims aren't allowed to defend themselves\nWhen he signed up in front of schools churches and synagogues worn killers the victims might defend themselves we need to have them have permanent concealed handgun so that the killers don't know who it is it might be able to go and stop\nThe guy today said that they could not afford year round security that it was just too expensive they that they can only\nHave it at high holiday\nWell oh I Want people to carry permit concealed handgun is one way an inexpensive way to go and solve that people need to understand the dangers of these gun free zone that these countries don't make it a trap for people to be killers to attack\nAnd it makes it easier for them to go and kill people\nJohn straight up common sense to me and I've known you a long time and I can hear the frustration in your voice when you were taping that am I right where you you sounded frustrated and you sounded kind of angry am I right\nI mean I Want to try to do something to stop these attacks and I don't\nKnow how anybody can look at how these killings keep on time after time picky targets were victims aren't able to defend themselves\nYou know just a couple of days ago last week it was a mass public shooting or what could have been at last public shooting at a Kroger grocery store\nYou can touch and everybody from meet the press that Jake Tapper on CNN brought that up today\nJake Tapper on CNN brought that up today a but what they failed to know in any of those discussions is that it ended because a concealed carry permit holders stop the attack are there\nAnd so you know these guys are they ... they use the quote on the shows about you know don't shoot me I'm a white guy white guys don't shoot white guys but they don't put that don't shoot me part there they they don't\nPut obviously the killer who is out there killing Black Sea was stopped by a white concealed carry permit holder\nOr when he saw the permanent holder was pointing his gun Adam and ordering them to stop he ah he made those comments but his first comments were you know don't shoot me and and you know I I guess you it is amazing bias\nThat these guys could bring up this case today multiple times and no one wouldn't mention that it ended because there was a permanent older you know at the same time they're attacking Trump on these shows\nFor somehow believing that letting somebody have a concealed handgun if the Senate guy could have save lives\nAnd you know I Know they realize that they brought it up and contacts there would be hard for them to go and criticized Trump at the same time during the show\nAnd just getting on another example I was just reading the New York times or from today a earlier and are they talk about Trump's discussion about gun control laws as an assertion\nOkay they use the word search and they don't do that for the Democrats were talking about the need for gun control laws in the same article\nAnd you know these guys have such blinders are with regards to the you know as you say it's common sense to me but I was chief columnist for the United states sentencing commission\nI must have read through a thousand trial transcript and I have to tell you no one can read through all those criminal cases and not come away with the view that these criminal\nFly pick easy targets\nYou know they maybe kooky or dumb or whatever but they're not so stupid\nThat they don't try to take easier targets in the same thing is true with these mass public shoot it they may be crazy in some sense but they're not stupid they want to try to kill us like people as possible\nSo they want to go to a a a venue where they know victims are going to be able to defend themselves because they know the longer it takes\nTo somebody at the same to a ride with a gun and the more people they're going to be able to kill\nSo yeah I guess I Am frustrated but I'm frustrated because on one side they seem to think that they have all the moral authority that they are they called for laws that either had no beneficial effect or actually cause harm\nYou know these gun free zones that one is that all of that and yet when a when these attacks occur they want to posture as all people who are willing to do something well my response says yeah you're willing to do something but let's do something that actually works let's do something\nThat actually matters it wouldn't make people safe you know\nThere's so much meat in what you just said I could take the rest of the hour with ... quickly I'll go to a point out the media when you were talking about the media\nThey won't because it doesn't fit their narrative that's why they leave out that portion of course you know this was from talking to you what you heard John Say about the Kroger shooting we're going to be talking about that on our directing radios daily defense tomorrow in fact and probably on Tuesday as well but as John Locke pointed out on his Twitter page you can follow him\nAt John are locked junior on Twitter by the way to get all this information real time as he puts out it's a great great Twitter page\nBut he points out Stephanopoulos doing the same thing at ABC and they just eliminating the fact that a white concealed carry permit holder and the attack and he goes on to tell you in a tweet in comedy which do with it that he wrote about how the headline could be totally different\nHow it could be white concealed carry permit holders saves blacks from shoot I mean it's just that the media narrative your listener\nYeah I'm I'm with you on that one I just simply I Wish I had the answer to that and I'm trying to if you're absolutely correct It's very difficult to get into somebody's head or somebody's heart but I I just sit there sometimes and I think I Am I the only person that\nSees this guy telling me the guns aren't the answer is surrounded by armed guards I you know I\nI I don't know I I put it right up there with Leonardo DiCaprio flying on a jet telling me that I got a problem with my carbon footprint I mean the whole thing to me is is just absolutely laughable and sickening or let's go back to if we could some of the homicide numbers and statistics I find this fascinating\nBecause we see lots of different numbers people spin about all the time oh the u._s. ranks number one you\nGuys have the worst mass shooting right in the world the homicide rate in America's if more people die by gun violence in America than anywhere else in the world you lead the world and it's disgusting you just need to repeal the second amendment and get over that was Vermont skits\nBut that's not true and I've seen everywhere from us ranks anywhere from first to Ninety second when it comes to this where do the numbers actually fall\nRight well I mean I have a very long discussion about the some of my book the war on guns are basically give you a rough idea about this stuff\nLook um when you look at the data for all countries around the world or the United states in terms of homicides ranks below the average and it ranks below what we'd say is the media which is kind of the halfway point half the country has or above and below\nIt we like rank even low or if we knew the truth data some of the worst countries don't and report a homicide rate data\nAnd even some many of the ones that do report it lie you know it's not just Chicago and Philadelphia which have had histories of of tampering with a murder data you know there are many countries around the world Venezuela others that we could name a which\nHave you know taking it to even much greater extremes\nAnd I'm a and the other thing is uh most people think that homicides and murders of the same or not a most countries don't attack almost no other countries outside the United states a couple of the places report murder rate or\nIf there's a big difference between a murder or homicide is that homicides include justifiable homicides the United states has relatively more justifiable homicides than most countries\nBut it seems to me you shouldn't be including though there is a big difference between\nSomebody killing a victim and let's say a civilian who is trying to stop this up from being raped or police officer who is trying to stop the cry\nFrom occurring uh uses their gun to go and kill a criminal those are two different cases and I'm not sure I really want to like the two together but putting that aside\nMost of the comparisons that people may around the world involve firearm homicides and appeal that firearm homicides will way higher or much were well above the media were pretty close to the average um but there's a reason for that and that is not is that in that is\nAbout half the countries in the world don't report firearm homicide data they report total homicide did\nSo the reason why we look so bad when it comes to firearm homicides has just you've removed all the top countries from the rains there is one reason why gun control advocates like to always put the discussion in terms of firearm homicide rate across country and uh [noise]\nUm so are you know it's\nYou know there are other issues I can go into but ah you\nKnow ... that's a good that's a good place to stop because the clock is ticking down on us on this break here we've got one more segment but I it's interesting to me too because I Want to ask you about something else when we come back and then we always hear the term out of developed nations\n... of all the developed nations in the world and I get to thinking well what about his Brazil developed nation is Mexico developed mission wire that act seems almost raises to me\nWhat about all those that don't their lives matter why don't those statistics count a country as a country as a country and those numbers are numbers are numbers don't want to ask you about that when we come back to and then I just I don't want to give some predictions from you if we can in the last remaining segment last few minutes that we have back with John Locke right after this don't go away\n\n\nAnd\n\nThe magic you're walking through a parking lot at dusk your with your children as you approach your car you see a large manned

they can't even tell the truth about what they do less people find out and decide hey I don't want that asked that poll Mr ... leave just told us about reveals Allen\nShould we be concerned about these numbers\nYeah we'd definitely needs to be concerned about these numbers numbers mean number of dollars that the uh opponents of gun rights are spending because it's going to impact ballot measures candidates for public office\nAnd you know overall it it has impact public opinion as well and we now have more anti commercials running on TV or in a in ads or then you'd have program was running for the first time in history over time that there is taken advertising toll\nUh so the bottom line is is that you know we need to worry about that and it's really hard I got to wait for us to compete with it is they're getting money from several billionaires a year where they write hundred thousand dollar two hundred thousand dollars a million dollar checks\nAnd I just don't have anybody like that and neither does the n._r._a. really I mean this is a problem when you get you out and figure out soon\nYou're right and I have and I will say it again publicly I volunteer to be the billionaire that helps I'm working on that I'll let you know how I may go take a listen this this statement from the n._r._a. spokesperson Jennifer Baker concerns me a little bit\nWhile the gun lobby control is funded by a blank check from uh New York city anti gun billionaire the n._r._a. relies on millions of small donations from working men and women his money is no match for our grassroots organization and the\n... the lead up to that wasn't NRA spokeswoman said Bloomberg's money would not overturned public support for the second amendment of the U.S constitution which protects the right to keep and bear arms Alan I'm I'm not so sure about that statement because when you have people you just said coming up behind me\nYounger generation seen nothing but anti gun crap all day long it begins in the media knows is why they do it is by Bloomberg's knowing it begins to drive that narrative that guns are bad doesn't it\nYeah and I don't really agree with that statement at all that's why we're seeing here like in Washington state on the sixteenth thirty nine and I get an issue on the ballot here\nAre grassroots you know ... you know working with the n._r._a. and set of speakers right keep and bear arms as pretty cold for a while when we pulled up and all of us can even with polling data\nOn his anti get an initiative only to find this week three billionaires one being Michael Bloomberg dumped in six hundred thousand dollars for last minute media by ... to help critical for them to them over the top\nAnd I don't have to expend thousand dollars but in the immediate by I compete with it\nSo all we do have the grass roots and we definitely have more grassroots side does those advertising dollars they're Seventy sixty seconds TV and radio spots\nHave an impact as particularly on the uh\nMore uninformed voter or the casual voter out here and that's ... that's our concern so this does have an impact I Can't agree with you on that\nI Wish we had the money to compete and I feel a whole lot safer but winning I I'm hoping I graduated is can be strong enough to win on that particular ballot measure but if we don't win is approved is putting its dollars and bought the election\nYou what concerns me about that I agree with you on that statement I'm not real I wasn't it that statement concerned me somewhat as I mentioned but here's really why because I didn't I don't want it to create complacency I think the statement like that can create some apathy on our side with what we've got the grassroots look with the interests that they're not really worried about it my five boxes enough\nOr well I I just I'll just renew my membership next year and not worry about that what concerns me about that and I know the honorary wants to keep that happy face on we all do but there comes a time when you got to say look guys\nOkay these people are out spend enough now three to one and we need to get off our duff we've got to get active yes we have grass roots but we need assistance here let's go now to sixteen thirty nine you covered enough of it but I just want to ask you one question as we're coming up to this ballot initiative\nThat six hundred thousand I'm just going to say this from what I just heard you say you felt better last week and you did this week is that a fair statement\nOh yeah I had the money to compete with that certainly thousand dollars I I I feel as good as they did last week\nI don't feel that I did with that last minute money coming in from three big donors Bloomberg being one of those and you know one of the problems we have is we want to put a good spin on everything but you sometimes can't believe your own rhetoric a and sometimes it's better to let people know who they are in the battle\nYou know I always say that are actually won election away from extinction and it's really true\nThat it absolutely is true and it's true every single election cycle it every single election cycle All right let me move to another topic with your quick we've got just a couple of minutes\nS a F joins California group suing riverside county sheriff overseas cw policies this is not the first rodeo with the second amendment foundation supporting the rights of a legal American rented it tell us about this one real quick\nListen to the sheriff's office decide because California genesis may issue says chairs get discretion and what they want to do you say that if you're a legal you know resident who holds a gun you know in in Sacramento a lo and behold you you you can't you know in reverse I can actually say you you can't get a permit to carry it for self protection\nOr we once it's like this all across the country will win this suit as well and the sheriff or he pretends to be a pro gun but he he hardly get permits out in ... in his county and he's he's in a tough re election battle right now\nLet's go probably ... ... a good chance to lose the election and the new chef coming in will move to suit for us and we'll win or start issuing these permits or we'll go to ... to finish the court battle and loves the court overturned it\nSheriff Stanley Smith a sniff is actually pro gun he's

your cat\nBut I I was the lead plant of an example is the city of Chicago we took on the city of Chicago for the right to build gun ranges or the city of Chicago\nDoes not have gone right is available for law abiding citizen and um I got involved with this case post McDonald\nI'm always meant Donald along with David calling it often took on the city of Chicago for the right\nTo own a firearm inside of the home which was a landmark case that went to the United States Supreme court and came out get Tori and that case was brought about right after the D.C versus Heller decision so\nYou know as we speak of these cases right now we are celebrating the ten year anniversary of DC versus Heller that ten year anniversary of McDonald versus Chicago as well as the seven year anniversary of ... Chicago so these cases are\nUm his story so if I was complying with that McDonald's case and I was going to\nCertify for the training their weapon a a ... and I find myself coming outside of the sea to do so plus I completed my I'm training\nI called my state organization which is the Illinois state Rifle Association to let them know that they that I had to go through all of the red tape to comply with this new ordinance and so we we came to the conclusion that my wife had been violated so along with um\nThe second amendment foundation Illinois state Rifle Association and there were several more plaintiffs we took the city of Chicago to court for the right\nTo build gun ranges in the city\nAnd city limits because we don't have any range available\nAnd you know I think it's important that we point out that the city of Chicago intentionally did that intentionally Internet record the war the McDonnell decision that McDonnell victory that you were just talking about finally allowing guns in the home you know I a couple of things come to my mind\nFinally allowing guns in the homes you know I a couple of things come to my mind you know we talk about the ten year anniversary of power and then we talk about the ten year anniversary of McDonalds and the seventh anniversary of is that I've been on the radio longtime apparently because we were talking about all these cases when they were happening\nAnd I cannot believe it's been that long in particular I cannot believe the case your cash has actually seven years now while it blows my mind\nThe race in ... the reason being is the ... he got the first victory of course the city of Chicago will continue with shenanigans and um there was a salesperson Chicago too so we continue to fight 'em and we won all those on that for five because as we\nYou know that the first three they came back with more restrictions and things of that nature so you know the city of Chicago\nWas hell bent on gun ownership here in Chicago for very long time so we had to continue that fight and we did we beat them at their own gang\nAnd all you and boy did you ever and I got to tell you I have been in Bellevue, Washington and our office and I have seen the checks\nAnd signed by Rami manual let me tell you something they're great look at and I know nobody's prouder than Alan Gottlieb is coming to your defense and moving your case forward because he loves to win in Chicago\nAnd of course uh the gun rights policy conference in Chicago where we met I mean it's just so much to talk about what you were getting ready to take a break when we come back\nI Want to stay with your town I Want to give you some numbers and I want to hear what it sounds like from someone who lives in Chicago\nWho looks at this and live this every day it must be just awful to see these numbers in your own home town will be back with Rhonda is out right after this what a great show don't go away\n[noise]\nOkay gun lover your time is almost up how would you like to hit the race tomorrow with a brand new gun\nBecause the U.

campaign committee Tom killings of North Carolina but in the Republican post candidate on surge real or we're just seeing that natural closing of the mid term we have a brand new NBC News Wall Street journal poll out this morning with some unusual result that you make a little nervous\nGoing to work\nFor insight and analysis on NBC News correspondent\nWashington Post columnist Eugene Robinson Peggy Noonan a columnist for the wall Street Journal and David rosy cheeked political analyst for CBS News welcome to Sunday meet the press [noise]\nGood Sunday morning and welcome to the choose your own adventure mid term elections\nIs there a democratic wave coming we've got data support that as a surge of post tapping on Tuesday has them for Republicans turn back the Democrats momentum\nThere's data to support that or could this be a typical midterm with Democrats making just bought a state\nThere's data to support that too and we have plenty of new data this morning here's what our brand new NBC News Wall Street journal poll shows with just over two weeks to go until the mid term among registered voters\nDemocrats hold a seven point lead in the generic ballot forty forty one that's down significantly from the ... point lead Democrats held just a month ago pre Kavanaugh when it was fifty two forty but wait there's more\nAmong likely voters the Democratic lean gross not shrinks gross to nine fifty to forty one here's why that's interesting\nIs the first time ever in our polling that are likely voter model shows a better number for the Democrats than the registered voter number normally\nIn midterms Republicans have the likely voter advantage so what's different this year it's the heightened enthusiasm for Democrats among millennials Latinos and younger women groups that historically have had low turnout rates that are making it into a likely voter model the sheer\nAsked for President Trump he has his best numbers yet in our poll among registered voters forty seven percent approve of his performance in office or forty nine percent disapprove\nThat substantially better than his numbers last month in our poll forty or fifty to prove to support but again among those likely voters his numbers did get worse forty five percent of proof fifty two percent disapprove\nThere are a lot of questions leading up to this year's midterms but here's what we do know there's a higher interest in this election than any my term we ever measured turnout is going to be through the roof and the divide between men and women is growing with the Democratic strength the result of unprecedented support among women\nThat will be enough to stop the Republicans post Kavanaugh about that is going to be the story of the next sixteen days\nFor a Republican strategist Geoff\nPresident Trump's closing argument is all about the\nTo throw your borders wide open to deadly drugs and ruthless gang\nAnd Republican candidates are sounding more and more like Mr Trump repeating dire warnings on immigration\nRemember it's going to be an election of the caravan\nThe caravan is coming from Central America this migrant caravan pretty here at times using violent language\nYour body [noise]\nAnd I'm going to stop all over your face with golf spikes candidates or even recycling Mr Trump's insult\nThese are low energy person\nYou tell them what\nThe fight for control of the Senate playing out largely in states the president won this race first strategy banks on Mr Trump's ability to bring up voters in more rural areas where he is popular but the president's rhetoric is unlikely to help Republicans in the suburban house districts\nWhere they are already at a demographic disadvantage and for the first time ever\nIn two straight and be seen as Wall Street journal poll women favored democratic control of Congress by a whopping twenty five points\nMy thing now we're going to hell in a hand basket I I Can't believe some of the antics\nSeventy Seventy five house seats the cook Political Report racist competitive\nAre held by Republicans including twenty five that Hillary Clinton won in twenty sixteen Democrats need to flip just twenty three of those Seventy five to win back the house but the Democratic enthusiasm advantage\nHas narrowed after the capital fight and the question is whether those fundamentals will be enough to produce not just to take over by the way we existing conditions and meanwhile Democrats are avoiding abroad national message remaining laser focused on a single issue\nProtections for pre existing conditions protections for pre existing conditions for preexisting conditions preexisting conditions existing health conditions\nAnd with President Obama largely absent from the campaign trail and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi unpopular with independents Democrats running in states Trump won are running away from the national party\nAre you a Democrat I Am proud Democrat gosh it's hard to say proud I don't know that way I'm not sure that people are even prouder parties anymore\nAnd even running away from the Democratic leaders changing players make some sense I think we ought to change the players joining me now from Chicago is the Senate Democratic whip Dick Durbin Senator Durbin welcome back to meet the press her good to be with a jerk\nI Know you couldn't see that package but you could hear it that last voice in there was the former Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen who is running for the U.S Senate seat in Tennessee are calling for a quote change of players when it comes to the Democratic leadership\nOr you're a member of his Democratic leadership when you hear that um is there going to be a change of players fingers south Senator Schumer Nancy Pelosi or make your case for why\nIt isn't necessary a truck that's tomorrow's newspaper today's newspapers I bought an election on November six and let me tell you what we're doing we're focusing on the east\nThat's tomorrow's newspaper today's newspaper election on November six\nAnd let me tell you what we're doing we're focusing on the issues that make a difference I Know that you probably had the preexisting condition phrasing or dozen times in that leader and\nThat's because the American people put that has the highest priority they want protection for their families they know the Republicans voted consistently to take away the protection and file lawsuits to end it\nThat's why it's such an important issue over and over in a local basis\nBut let me go back to this leadership issue you heard that the other voice and there was fierce didn't send them out of the Democratic nominee in Arizona saying and people don't like parties anymore and obviously that both parties are on pop in our poll right now um is that a problem for you that there are voters out there that you need it went over who don't like the Democratic party\nBut you're having to basically make the case may you may not like us but don't you like the other side we're a last\nWell it gets down to this truck there more and more independent voters and I think ... correct in making that assertion but the bottom line is we are doing well with those independent voters take a look at what Mitch McConnell gave us this last week an insight into where the Republicans are going if they continue to control Congress\nIn order to deal with the deficits they've created with a tax bill for the wealthy people and special interest they are going to cut Social Security Medicare and Medicaid\nThose are fighting words for a lot of people not just Democrats but independents as well pre existing conditions making sure the Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid are strong for years to come\nThat's a good basis to get a lot of people elected to Congress\nOn a plane the er an ad that a Jacky Rosen she's the Democratic nominee running in Nevada and it's interesting and the message she's trying to send in Nevada voters which may surprise some viewers take a listen\nJackie rose and rose legislation to improve veterans' health care and President Trump signed into law Jackie stood up to Nancy Pelosi to reform the VA\nWhy aren't we hearing that this time around we don't really hear Republicans talking about repeal and replace is it because of the popularity of the pre existing condition collapse\nNow what for one thing it's a false narrative to say that we want to remove preexisting conditions I follow the bill got several co sponsors to try and and and the vet that a lawsuit throws out the Affordable CARE Act we have to have a place for people with preexisting conditions to land we also have to allow\nA young adults under the age of twenty six to be on their parents' health care plan it is a false narrative to say that Republicans want to kill that it's simply not\nTrue but if you had to do but in fairness you've had for years and the majority in the Senate to come up with an alternative in two years with full Republican control of Washington\nYeah and I know you know how do you say work probably better than I Do you got to get sixty votes to make that happen we did to reconciliation get rid of the individual mandate and take some of the underpinnings of the Affordable CARE Act out\nWe've got to replace it and the same way that we've got to make sure that shows for Social Security and Medicare can be paid for and Medicaid over time\nWhat what the Democrats are not mentioning are widely publicized reports that say if we stay on the current trajectory we're going to have a crisis in funding and those programs\nNo one wants to take away Medicare Social security or Medicaid from people who need it but we have to have a sustainable solution and we need sixty votes to get that done\nMath is a funny thing here in Washington nobody seems to want to ever site it but we have a record breaking deficit\nA record breaking dead every day when you watch the debt clock but a record breaking deficit this year that may surpass a trillion dollars you now annually never mind obviously the multi ... multiples of that in the debt the president yesterday talking about a new tax cut you're talking about reforming Social Security and Medicare ...\nWhere are you how you got to pay for this tax cut that the president is apparently proposed\nWell we've got to make sure that it's at least a supportive by facts round dynamic growth that has to pay for itself we can't go further in debt I voted against the spending bill I'm the most recent one because it was just too much money being spent a\nAnd and so we've got to we've got to get the American people to recognize that we had a powder keg of dynamite and the debt that continuing to grow we're reaching a point where the service to our debt service could exceed\nOur contribution in our investment in the military we've got to make sure that the American people understand we've got to balance our our book we got to be on a budget just like the American people\nYou just said you wanted that any new tax cut to pay for itself up this current cat tax cuts clearly not paying for itself the depth increasing not decreasing and there's no sign that it's going to decrease\nWell if you take a look at the scoring for economic growth every time we can I I think that there is a a way to\nRationalize that this tax cut will pay for itself through sustained economic growth we don't make the numbers at wall but if we do and we're already seeing it early into this cycle that I Do believe that we create the net incremental revenue is not going to be enough to come anywhere close to retiring are Twenty one trillion dollars in debt that's where we're going to have to look at\nTough choices so that we can balance our books\nCenter time tell us Republican from North Carolina I'm going to leave it there thanks for coming on sharing too much for thank you when we come back\nMore on those mid term elections which is stronger the Republicans was\nWas it the same democratic anger as President Trump panel is that as we go to bring some of what I heard this week from voters\nFrom Arizona\n\nAnd the

little bit of historical context here presidential job approval\nConnected to seats lost in the first midterm we go back here's President Trump sitting at forty seven percent that seems to be an improvement for him what would forty seven percent job rating mean in the past when it comes to the term result what President Obama had exactly that forty seven percent job approval rating and twenty ten\nHis party lost sixty three seats Bill Clinton in Nineteen Ninety four in the same period of time in October headache forty eight percent\nApproval rating and lost fifty four seats so Peggy Noonan should Republicans feel better or worse this morning when they look at the end be seen as\nWell I think they should feel as confused as everybody else the good news for Republicans is only six months ago I think we were all talking about a blue wave that we knew was coming and who's going to be very significant\nWe're not quite talking that way anymore it looks kind of more interesting and complicated didn't state by state\nUm the continuing mystery that is not a mystery is how a president and ended minister ration can have\nWhat is essentially peace and prosperity for economic growth and no new wars and still be struggling to get to fifty percent which isn't the approval polls\nWhich if you can't use a drag on as well let's hear people it just is a central fact I think of the coming election set\nStandard political gravity and I don't think you can do that with Donald Trump and I and I do think that there is an argument to be made\nFor people telling pollsters one thing that believing another thing and I think that people should be wary of this going forward I mean it just feels a lot and I hate to be Debbie Downer for for Democrats or for any for Republicans for anyone more for the standard messaging I should say\nWith complete transparency Mitt the mistakes that you made that might even be the first step to kind of bring that reconciliation\nAnd I tell you what there's still a long and in that child\nFor father's blessing for fathers\nAnd you step up and begin to do that now and I believe it can change that circumstance and bring healing\nBring home this year more for mark at family minute dot org\nWelcome back the Trump Administration has broken records for turnover among staffers on the west wing just this week White House counsel Don McGahn left his job after months of speculation that after successfully shepherding Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the U.S Supreme Court already to White House is on a second cheapest at\nIts third national security advisor and its ... communications director\nThe person with me or most no worthy and short stint in the west wing is one of those five Anthony Scaramucci let the White House media shop protest eleven days with a new book about his time though in President Trump's orbit particularly before he became President Trump the blue collar president\nAnd he joins me now is just what you're working with the press had to Sunday so the timing of your book coming out problems as we got reports of a screaming match between a a former boss of yours John Kelly current chief of staff the national security adviser John Bolton was over\nThe issue of immigration was clear it was it according to our sources it was over\nSome comments the national security adviser made to the secretary of homeland security a former deputy to the chief of staff John Kelly apparently walked out furious there were rumors of a\nPotential resignation out how to live here with at St half a million was that thing to you\nWas there any profanity I mean that could have been right also possibly some profanity ... that seems really not that familiar to me and you have to remember my incident with a phone line with a reporter who I shouldn't have trusted in so that's my fault and I totally on that but I think that the more relevant thing is\nYou know people are playing the NFL and verbal contacts and so people playing very hard for the president um I don't know what happened in that specific incident and um but you know I I Know that the west wing and the way the president set up the west wing it it's it's tough in there for ...\nYou were pretty tough though in General Kelly in your book I'm going to put up an extra pair the general style would be in direct conflict with the way Mr Trump had always conducted business President Trump doesn't work in a precise way right never has never will it's been over a year since John Kelly became White House chief of staff but my scouting report early on proved to be quite accurate\nHis personal in security has proven to be a poor match\nWith the self confident gregarious president look I think that's pretty self\nEvident I mean just even this past week you know I applaud the general service of the country I'm obviously forty years in the U.S Marine Corps but this is a very different job this is a civilian base job and I think he's tried to apply\nMilitary like management style to a group of civilians and so that doesn't necessarily work and and\nAnd by the way you know the the president as a free wheeling style is very different from a\nJohn Kelly's you feel personally mistreated by John Kelly he seemed pretty new seem pretty upset at him and his book well listen not you know he didn't need to fire me the way fire me and I had this conversation with the president you get it done in a different manner totally I mean come on I gave a tremendous amount of money to campaign raised a tremendous amount of money\nOr did countless hours of media advocacy during the campaign and the transition and even after president was inaugurated a there was a better way to fire me but he was trying to make a spectacle out of it and so he got the spectacle that he wanted and it\nSaid was it was upsetting at the time or I write about in the book um what I thought was an honest assessment of him and I'm I stand by the words in the book should the president even have a chief of staff given the way he likes to work\nI think he needs the cheapest stab but he needs the cheapest David really likes him in and gets his personality you don't think John Kelly likes the president do you\nI mean I I I was living and I don't want to I don't want to crawl let let me say I travel around the country and I asked people that rhetorical question does it doesn't come across lady ... he does and and by the way the the Bob Woodward book I don't know he seems like a pretty accurate journalists to me so\nUh I don't like John Kelly calling the president thinks that he's called them I think it's I think it's wrong and and so for me I have no problem standing up for myself or or telling you what I think about John Kelly or the situation with the president\nHaving said that I applaud the guy service but it's not just Egypt you know he he hurt the morale inside the place and he ... he started to president and so and he has his effect you know he he left last week after the\nUh the report that he had with a basket or Bolton that's personality and ... you know the good news is I'm being vindicated by that because he's demonstrating his personality now the way millions from\nCares you've you've interacted with with President Trump as candidate Trump you weren't quite on board at first with the idea of him president you had other candidates who were interested in first I think you were more Scott Walker that the current governor Wisconsin toyed with going with Jeb Bush what finally convinced you that Donald Trump had what it took Scott Walker didn't\nSo I actually really just in the book I met with the president the day after The Apprentice finale or we sat in his office and we were joking about him running for president I didn't believe him at the time and I was already hooked into Scott Walker\nBut what I liked about the president and he's a very loyal guy when I explained to end up my loyalties were to Scott Walker and and Jeb Bush he then said okay well after I clean their clocks a when you come work for me and I should absolutely and so a after the south Carolina primary I went to the president's office with Senator Scott brown\nWho was a friend of mine from tops now we went up there together and uh we had a great conversation and we begin building blocks for the financing operation and then when he brought in Stephen us diminution a things really started kicking you know watching\nA bunch of Democrats thinking about trying to run against President Trump and twenty twenty and we've seen different potential candidates try to go after him in different ways\nLike eleven ... someone who I think people have been trying to put the two of you together for some sort of talk show and he's been he's tried to go out um directly Elizabeth Warren responded to some of the criticisms of crazy nickname stuff uh more formally\nUh what is the best way to go after President Trump what advice would you give a Democrat and how do you go after his idol look I\nYou know as you know I really care for the president and I'm a big supporter so I don't like giving them advice but I think the big mistake that they're all making is they go right into the Trump insect Twitter light and so the minute he shoots at them they cannot help themselves\nTwitter light and so the minute he shoots them they cannot help themselves and they drive themselves right into that light and then they get vaporized by him and so the incident with a Senator Warren she should really read my books or she can understand\nHow the president you have to think about the miracle what he did\nHe hijacked the Republican Party to get the nomination and then he hijacked the base of the other party and moved over to the Republican Party or and I try to write about that in the book because I haven't experienced as a kid to grow up in a blue collar neighborhood with the blue collar family and I think I've seen the whole band whether there's sort of stuff but my recommendation to people\nIs a don't engage them in that area because you're going to lose more than just way more talented than you in that area\nFor let you go you said your team you and your team from sky bridge capital citizen Twitter this week you were still going to go to the Saudi Arabia a finance conference yeah are you still is that still your final answer\nWhat a well you know listen sky bridge is not a political organization I um I get any American Idol and then I'm right now a while not really trying to give them credibility remember I have a ton of business and Saudi Arabia unrelated to the government\nHave a Kuwaiti a resident that services sky bridge out of the region and I'm a pretty big delegate er and I let those guys make a decision on whether or not to go or not he's visiting with people are not related to the government those meetings were already scheduled\nA he suggested to me is the managing partner sky bridge will allow him to go I'm a big delegate er and believing accountability comfortable that's still\nI'm I'm comfortable with him going I'm not comfortable with what happened or what the Saudi Government did to the journals I'm not comfortable that all Anthony Scaramucci had to leave it there the book like blue collar president congratulations George good luck on the ... like when we come back\nTo you hold

I have a lot of friends from LA but around these parts of lower Alabama's lower al about you know you know that routine from where you come from Johnny ... you know my my intro to you was spot on but very kind of very short only just mentioned is again you are no stranger\nTo radio let's go through some of these things you've been on thousands of radio programs you've been in the public eye doing this stuff for a lot of\nAnd I'm thousands of radio programs you've been in the public eye doing this stuff for a lotta lotta lotta years and I used to love watching on TV and we'll go there and just admitted man oh man give me some background how'd you get started in radio and all this stuff\nWell I appreciate market appreciate being home with your day because ah these are important time for us as gun owners they're dangerous times for our country they're dangerous time for us who care about freedom care about\nBeing able to take care of our families and I I think it is absolutely essential the job you're doing a certainly this was really really an\n... program and sort of I Want so we're going to promote your program at every opportunity um I you know I'm from the country\nAre there in North west Louisiana grew up a shooting guns are riding horses or ride motorcycles you know what I'm saying I have a couple of hot rods loan way and actually\nI began an entertainment career in music and we we continue to do that and and and thank you for mentioning we did have top ten record by two thousand Thirteen and I've had several things but back in the early Nineteen nineties Nineteen Ninety nine to not want\nA we decided\nTo uh put guns on TV because there weren't any\nAnd we I in some other people that that were enthusiastic about projects that way but you know we needed to show people how to shoot guns how to how to properly handled guns how to do the place of the gun in our society our culture\nAnd that was the original shooting show and it shows used at six and we we were up on satellite we were free to cable companies everywhere it wound up helping to build a\nA couple of TV networks alone way of radio network too as well\nAnd and it's just been a real privilege you know a couple of days ago I was at a veterans are gathering them jail\nA down into solved and vets people used to watch the shows you know so we we are so thankful for over the years the people that are really hung in there because we need more media\nPro gun media on TV ... comment\nWell you brought your show was really the precursor to it when we talk let's talk about a mutual friend or somebody that you haven't talked to in a while but it's a very very close friend of mine we spoke about off air over the last few days and that's for Mr Rashid thanked as you remember watching rock show\nOn uh from ... out there in Colorado a number of years ago su I\nYou know you gave birth to this stuff into that genre of television a long time ago and I want people to understand who we are talking to hear because it was you who who who are a lot of people look at as the the godfather of that genre of television on outdoor channel and everything else correct\nWhere it where it was due due humility I'm a ... year problem that you are at the end yeah you've\nGot you got to be careful if you take all the credit you might get all the blame you know what I'll\nTell you know what I Believe with that because when you look at quality of programming that you put out in the quality of programming that followed you\nI'd be more than happy to say that I take credit for that if it were me and also to take some of that blame because you were very instrumental\nIn creating that type of television programming it of course it splintered off and we now have a number of other different TV shows from that but now now things are changing we're going to get well we've got about another three minutes in in this segment maybe two and a half so let's say that your movie you did I mean how many how many radio shows you know thousands thousands\nThousands radio show where you are done trust your radio digital radio that's true of a new music goes motor sports we have good old time at it you know as you and I discussed it is so important what we're doing and and we will talk about this with combat\nShould have something really exciting that you're going to be all and all it is going to just add to the mix you know you talked about the other us photo shows came after us because it's so critical\nThat we have pro gun images because a lot just deposed said hey you know we're surrounded we can find them in a way we go we got it right where we want and they can't write the family\nYou know that's that's true that's very true statement we're surrounded we've got it right where we wanted we know right\nWhere they are ... you know and and that's and that's pretty much how I think a lot of people feel\nAbout where we are right now at least if you watch the mainstream lame stream lying propaganda media\nYou know they're they're they hate us they've surrounded us and all that stuff but we're fighting our way out of this no doubt about it we are going to win because I Know you feel like I Do Johnny freedom will always prevail it might be one hell of a battle\nOr a number of battles and it always is a number of battle but nonetheless uh you know I I think freedom always prevail right so some of the things I Want to cover with you when we come back we got a lot of ground to cover fortunately my next two segments are are fairly good size segments so we'll be able to spend some time there\nBut you know a real I Want to I Want to cover some of your your shows with you what we're talking about doing down the road want to talk about what tombstones doing down the road very important coming out of tune with the freedom day's coming up in June again I guess that'll be the fish but before I go there arguing busy today are you in tombstone\nOh actually I'm looking over in the Mexico as we speak ... down on the order\nThem that we were well but we're actually based out of tombstone and it is like\nYou said one of the most unique places in the world so a historically significant in the development of the Old West it in fact are the the Old West image around the world to stone is actually bigger than life and it's\nAll did a lot of uh you know a\nMuch to talk about there and and so really it was just such a pleasure to meet you to see you and Allen there oh this past week\nYou know that was a lot of fun and to row into town with Alan Gottlieb was you know\nUh it there's that just added a whole new sense of fun you know as you know actually going to do so for you know a quarter of a century because of that has drawn to it and to roll into town with Mr Gottlieb responding to know that he sat over there in the wider room at the Larry a motel pen that I read an op ed that was a running\nI'm a student of their hypocrisy in lives for well over a decade now we call it out at every twist and turn we got but yeah I think it's great to see you there\nTo be able to be bringing some of what you're going to be bringing\nFrom that area that as you mentioned is so rich in history and its captivated me for a number of years\nYou know you mentioned the movie's really fun stuff you know the original the tombstone movie in Nineteen Ninety three I Believe in Ninety four with Val Kilmer Kurt Russell a little bit more than ... than the others that you know Val Kilmer played a a version of ... and then you go over to the wire DARPA Dennis Quaid\nPlayed a little bit more I I think the wider movie it was a little bit more historically accurate because it covers him earlier aspects of his life and how they tap their versus just show up there but really colorful history in that area that comes alive when you get there and as you know\nYou came to the very end when we were the right before we were ready to go to the airwaves on Monday This bomb\nAnd uh I don't know if the mayor was there when you got there and not the\nPoint that segment with him was just off the hook who I could have kept him for an hour and talked about oh definitely hit on you know\nHe's he saw Dustin Dustin ... he's got a friend of mine\nA dusty and go on and off for that matter and and you're exactly right of a and you know what I was so proud this past year and now I'm looking forward you folks get out here for the next freedom days but a dusty stood up for\nFor Arizona and ... to ... stood up for the second amendment or in the mark\nUp but look where for climbing the second amendment say yes or\nNo no ... that he he absolutely did when he read that and we read the proclamation on the show I Believe you're going to hear you I think we're going to hear\nGordon read it in the third our as I as I replay that amazing find our from Tucson but you know that made global news that wasn't he did make news in Tucson that made news all over the world\nWhen when ah when Dustin stood up for the second amendment and to ... because to stone people come there you got this little town of about two thousand people out in the middle of Arizona\nIn what most people say how they even find this place and people from all over the world make the pilgrimage there because of its rich history people go and show up and that's very very cool now let's talk about the freedom day's coming up in June I'll be there you'll be there Allen\nWill hopefully be there are dependent on his schedule we never know but I'm the freedom days is what\nA ... in the first ... first of July\nAnd the end of June July and it is celebrating what we have\nHere in our country this so you make and and you know what you're talking about freedom days and that's because that's the name of muscle my name is freedom one that's the best for us but but the the point is the American gun will\nActually stands and the way we the American gun stand in the way of the global as police state is\nIs that is literally the armed American\nBut that is literally the armed American citizen you know our country is supposed to be governed from the bottom up from the people to top rather than from the top down and we the\nPeople that are armed we are absolutely the the line of defense for the cause of liberty him a war and that's what we're celebrating here and\nI'm hopeful that there'll be some other cities got a quick story\nSo we're not a million a year just to let you know we've got about a minute I think coming up in the segment so go ahead\nOh hurt or you know we've had some some folks from up for the country people come from all over and there was a lady from North of the U.S border I won't do that without mentioning those specific but some of these folks come down so stole may not be as pro gun on his way are you on to say though\nIs laid out of their lives that were there and and talking to some people in this lady comes in and she's also would call if I was an anti she looked at me you know I'm a I'm kind of the economists are saying well you know I got my my a revolver one of my goes on on my hip Baron she looks at me up and down kind of really not you know she says\nWell what are you\nDoing it and I looked at it I thought it was a male absolutely nothing\nWe're gonna we're going out of a perfect place to take a break [laughter] they're out there man there even if they're even in tombstone Arizona the other hand the myth legend\nJohnny I'm going to ask you when we come back from the break if you might stay over with me we understand AWOL

ranch on this one my thought is that the papal ...\nAnd we bought the house well\nI'm not not so much of it I wouldn't bet the ranch on this one my thought is that the people who have it's going to Peter out\nOr that the Republicans will now likely ... what was going well narrowly hold the house will make gains and the older than bend is you know great hope that the Democrats would topple the Republicans ended up with a lot of opportunity I think that ...\nI think didn't ask if that happens or twenty sixteen or I don't think anything could could could match the devastation and uh as far as less concerned about the election of Donald Trump's but this will be close if the Democrats don't get the house it's going to be close to election night back in twenty sixteen\nYup it is and it's only will raise the stakes support for twenty twenty but it may very well made that jump all safely get at least one more Supreme Court quite meant I mean that would bring caught in the back you gotta

are now in big trouble\nUh well I think that this is actually looking pretty good for Republicans the movies and to be over but in the court and the main thing is what what we're going through your life your ...\nI think if the public in store now it's going to be a very good November\nMy guess is diminished as soon as a death of a nation available right now and digital HD didn't ask this may sound like a bizarre question or Donald Trump has called people all sorts of name she's called Robert De Niro low IQ Maxine Waters low IQ\nLion Ted or Pocahontas and on and on and on why hasn't the left come up with a name for him\nI think well they have and I think part of the problem with calling him name is that the farmers are book and I mean I think what the left came up with Stormy Daniels they thought they had a they thought they had it because they thought years he's a Republican\nThe Republican base is never going to put up with anything like this the Republicans are thought out and you're drawing out the last night the lightning their own and they were very confident that what happened to drop but the more the more they threw out strong ... like what else\nUh some of this madness and the mud or word in the face of the kind of attack\nThat would normally that Republican guarding recover them in a category of his own\nBut diminished I Would have thought that Democrats would have gotten a bunch of consultants together and figured out a label a word a name a moniker they could put on Trump and because he does it for everybody else I'm just shocked they haven't done

goes if people wanted that contributed to me want to contribute to another campaign they should do that oh man that's not how it works data and how we're worse though I feel like there's going to be a fight because you know he's gonna he's gonna lose the feds collect records income taxes and twenty Eighteen taxation is that federal government collected ... million dollars of your money [noise]\nUh

simple sensor can cost thousands when you're protected by car shield you can have your favorite mechanic or the dealership fix your car it's your choice\nBut she tries to hide it from voters and she is struggling because Missouri's the state that went by Trump double digits and Missouri is the state where you have so many moderate Democrats blue collar Democrats voted for Trump\nAnd they're really disillusioned with ... with the Democrat Party and with people like McCaskill says she was very quiet if you notice she was very quiet on Kavanaugh\nShe's been very quiet on gun issues she said very quiet\nOn a lot of stuff well at least publicly but she did talk to project very tossed\nUnknowingly because they were embedded within her campaign and it was very interesting I think the first time by is of Senator McCaskill that this was part of the the the Q and a that this undercover reporter had with her listen\n\nI mean\nYeah and when she has but the thing that she's always kind of triangulate on is where she stands on quote unquote assault weapons\nBecause she said before I supported assault weapons ban will remember that the go that's the word that they all use is a catch all phrase for semi automatic firearms semi automatic rifle specifically but they would like all ... should be banned um and so her staff are actually spoke to this odd in another video listen I can show them\nBecause you store it is for [noise]\nGrowing mushrooms I think some of them is like a little bit\nMore soldiers worse which is insane to me because when you look it up yeah uniformed crime reports from twenty to twenty sixteen it shows at hand feet and says her more people three times over then some at a medic rifles but here we are James O'Keefe with project very fast action dot com where you can go and watch\nThis ah undercover this expos eight in full joins me now on the phone James always good to have your thanks for joining us\nGay data thanks for having me back again\nOf course oh this is ... ... people know Claire McCaskill Senator McCaskill in Missouri very tough race\nOr she's actually being challenged and this was the closest that anyone has ever come from from from basically you know taking her out politically getting her seat and she's been successful at it previously because she always presented herself as this moderate and she never on the big issues the hot issues that every other senator speaks on\nShe seemingly incredibly quiet and ... and and your experts say I'm actually kind of discovered why tell us about it\nWell Missouri Dana ... I Know that you're you're from Missouri Missouri is a special state because Democrats are more conservative more pro life they're more pro God of theirs are shrinking base that a clear as to appeal to so this video tape and side of her office shows her own staffers\nAre saying they're for field coordinators talking about how she has to mislead voters she says of course when we asked her about gun\nShe says of course when we asked her about gun bans we got clarification from her staff you've heard the soundbite they're semi automatic rifle ban another staffer Nick stole roast says that she has the same policies as President Obama but she has to\nMislead cheat and she says that people just can't know that she had the McCaskill above quote essentially have the same views on everything so there's this\nPattern in these red states Missouri being probably the strongest example or the Democrats half the why they have to mislead the voters because of the nature of the political dynamics in the state and that's what this video tape shows it shows over staffers saying\nWell she's got this incremental approach she can't speak publicly about it this is what they're all saying behind closed doors one of the staffers actually says she has to essentially lie about everything\nWow yeah she said that they ah what the video shows is that\nUh she still close with Obama that he can't come to Missouri to campaign for her otherwise it will\nAh make her look as though she's not a moderate it came out that she gets to take money from Planned Parenthood although they they don't publicize that they take money from a mom demand and apparently ... demand that Bloomberg astro turf gun control group comprise a lot of her staff\n[noise] hit us got Rob Mills who's one of the higher ups in our office says that she doesn't open ... support moms demand action because in this was a direct quote because quote it gets hurt her ability to get elected Missouri and see that and they're like well I don't want to support or even though they stand for the same policies so you're talking about his incremental approach where she'll\nShe'll do it a little bit at a time and he says ... coach he's really good about strategy and making sure that goal it can get their uh she's worked out stuff with moms demand to make sure that she can support their goals without supporting organization openly and there's this pattern in in Missouri where\nThe Democrats are there still are I guess a very tiny pro life Democrat community it's shrinking because most of those folks have have chosen to become Republicans but they're they're still she's still trying to\nLike she has to lie to half of the people and be honest with the other half and that's what this reporter so damning about because it just blows it all open there's a Greek chorus of people in our office all saying the same thing on all the issues Obama guns and Planned Parenthood\nThere's even a thing about impeachment where we ask this this staffer Glenn Winfrey is the staffers and it was just so tell us about ... plans to impeach truck\nAnd she goes we the staffer says we're going to tell the moderates to quote get over it\nOnce we pull a bait and switch on them you know so it's just all across the board inside of her office\nWow yeah and that and that was pretty I thought that was fascinating as well like get over it and that's what moderate\nDefinitely should pay attention to she's focusing on all of the things ultimately\nThat a cost Hillary Clinton the election and it's you know it's difficult for her because it is very much it's a Trump state\nUm a lot of Democrats voted for Trump and they're pretty pleased when you look at approval ratings and his approval ratings are in Missouri they're pretty pleased with what he's been doing and what it means for you know the manufacturing in that state um that I I I had she responded as to the\nUh because I I guess is she can tend to allow her staff to talk for her are all in all of a moderate to\nThat is the question I I was in Columbia yesterday Columbia, Missouri and I did talk to this next arose to walk down the street to his office and I do or stop them with a with a camera on my shoulder and a microphone and I said look you know what why aren't you honest with people and he said I Can't another authorized to speak to the press\nAnd I kind of felt proud because I kind of felt like say well neck they don't consider me a journalist so maybe you can talk to me but\nHe did not talk to me are we did get a comment from Josh Hawley the Republican Senate candidate he tweeted the video out twice and they usually what happens data has happened in Tennessee is that that first they'll they'll try not to talk about it and then there'll be this bubbling critical mass groundswell in from the grassroots\nIt'll go on local TV ONE of the local reporters last clear and she'll have to fumble and bumble that's typically how this stuff goes because there's nothing to say all of her staff are calling her a lot or what is she going to do fire all of her staff will\nThere be honest with you the staffer are being honest there they're on unbeknownst to them they're whistle blowers and they're being very honest and forthcoming about what she stands for so it'll be interesting to see the local TV stations in Missouri ask the questions\nYeah I Would I think that Missouri voters would like to I think everybody would like to know where she stands on it because she it's weird she'll be very vocal about where things and then she goes and hides when it gets really tough\nSo uh we'll see we'll reach out to her too although I don't think she will ever come on but uh well if we can yeah we've reached that were repeatedly she hates me so\nI got you got more from her than any other than any others during the ... project varied has ... dot com and I've tuned it out the video as Well James O'Keefe we're going to follow this closely because we'd love some clarification from Senator McCaskill as always thanks for joining us\nThank you so much take care\nYeah I Would love to the I'm just very curious and and did you hear and then the video too if you watch it the Sacramento yeah we got a lot of moms demand people that work here they're trying to import into that state just like they're trying to do in Nevada just like they're trying to do in ah Texas and everywhere else they're trying to Bloomberg is trying to import\nUh or export from New York end of the state New York style gun control meaning in New York state fact they are going to the state's going to make sure you store things the way the state wants it to et cetera et cetera uh but uh and and she's not vocal about it because it will cost her with voters\nSo voters in the state especially the more moderate ones\nYou know the only to figure out sort of where you you guys are going to be going with this ah because she looks like she and being on the up and up with you\nI Will reach out for clarification as well we have more to come including coming up Broadway star Patti LuPone says the Christian right is no different from al ...\nOh I Know I see\nYeah the president rips a Stormy Daniels right ... calling her horse face she says game on tiny and accuses him of ... this is where we are\nUh also it's only twenty two days until mid terms we have that twyla Barnes Cherokee

New Jersey Joseph you're on the Larry on the show thank you so much for calling I appreciate it\nYeah how are you Larry I'm doing well\nI Would have a nice thirty minutes but it's worth it you know let's say okay um I\nI Want to play with a Jewish point I'm Jewish myself the point is to be clear the half of the century between reform conservative Jews\nThat are not proud of being Jewish and trying to either that any between Orthodox Jews that all love Donna Shaw is a big difference when you said Jews\nYou don't really mean Jews you mean just don't want to be Jewish but the real Jews the orthodox once all full support on shop all their average support him and they're even synagogue is just no there's some synagogues on the weekends they have a special blessing for President Trump should just note that's how much the Orthodox Jews\nJews\nI Know many people don't realize it but there's a big difference between conservative reform Jews that don't like Israel and don't like really being Jewish between Orthodox Jews that love Israel and of course the old on some\nAny personal commonsense knows that Obama is the biggest uh is all eight or enjoy it and say you're going to be a fool not to believe that and went down some there is no president ever ever did in Israel which is why this already two bridges and is on the enough about Trump even a train station but you know that\nI I Do know that but but just to the point is Seventy five percent of American Jews don't like him I absolutely get your point about the uh twenty five percent that do I know a lot of them to do I'm just talking about collectively Seventy five percent can't stand them I don't plan on voting for for him again ... when he runs again in twenty twenty\nThat's because the Jews tend to say what do you think Jews don't you don't really want to be with us from trying to tell you they're going to vote for people that would not want to support Israel that's what I'm trying to say starts surprise on why they're like that actually makes sense to fit everything right\nJust as my here's my question is if they do does not support Donald Trump do you believe that person or that Jewish person is a shame to being Jewish that's my question to you\nYes with no doubt yes with no ... no that really\nYes I mean you got to be a fool I mean if you really Jewish as solid Jewish I mean you've got to be I'm not to vote\nNo I I look look you're preaching to the choir about about the Jewish vote the black vote the Hispanic vote they all these people that overwhelming vote for the Democratic party I think the wrong to do so but I think it's another leap to say are you are so self loathing Jew if you if you don't support the Republican Party and that seemed to be to be what what you're saying Joe so that's what I'm asking you\nYes yes ... dollar summer that's common sense right now you brought up to the world with common sense between two and false\nAll right so so all the Jews who voted for Obama for example in your opinion are self loathing Jew I'm asking\nOh disgusting that you're raising them all the time no question\nSell clothing of course there seemed to be no question that yes there is no doubt about it\nOn down now you're aware Joseph that that's the same slam it's used against black people like me I'm I'm call self loathing because I'm a Republican\n[laughter]\nOkay for the two people who will work out right now after what's going on either you're dumb which is unfortunately the truth that we all know that oh you're a person just evil I mean the people to know what's going on is full support Hillary and all these people are just pure evil which is why I think Trump is so important that these days in office because he represents the truth it's\nBeing Jewish Christian Muslim if you fight for the truth you have to go for something otherwise\nI don't know what okay so Joseph how you feel about people that call people like Kanye West Larry Elder Candace Owens self loathing black people\nOkay so the black people that make fun of black people\nAre two ways also there's there's many many most of them you know I I have a lot of black friends just on the

because I think everything's just just the way it is people are afraid to do what they want and if you don't like it mind your own business\nI just don't understand why freedom is so hard to get for people like the government\nDoes not have to socially beyond your lives and you don't have to be people don't understand freedom of people\nI think there are people out there who are willing Surf's here they they don't understand freedom they think that freedom means that the government guarantees your right to happiness not your pursuit of happiness government doesn't even guarantee that you can pursue something that you all you want to but there's no guarantee that you're going to be happy\nYou just have the freedom to pursue it\nPeople think freedom means comfortable and this and they think freedom means everything is perfect and nothing's wrong in my life and I think that some ... some of these people I just don't think that they have an idea of what reality or freedom\nIs freedom is you do what you want to do someone else is going to do what they want to do but died the idea that a freedom that some of these individuals have is if\nSomeone else is doing something that I don't like the neck not freedom because they're not doing what I Want because they don't believe how I think they should believe because they don't talk how I Want them to talk they don't use the pronouns that I Want them to use they don't recognize the things that I recognize\nThat not freedom that's that's that oppression that tear any fascism and I just so I really don't give a flying rats behind\nWhat the world economic wondering about our social issues is good on two fronts this is good not only because as a competitor in the world the United states is number one number two for all those global as they want this global economy and want to be this this all the support this was the world Economic Forum why don't\nI just think that they I really don't care who they are but they just they just measure the data that's out\nAnd they're the only organization on that level but does it so my point is that even if he was so nice I'm like screw them even if you're a global is this is something good to look at so you really have to hate Trump's\nThis is something good to look good so you really have to Trump if you've been something negative of this thing\nOh yeah I mean I don't I don't get why people would would do that but\nThat's that's the thing that they say they talked\nTo they warned about a ... a brewing trade war between the United states and China they say they're still room for improvement we're number one if you went first year last\nShaking bake so that goes on the best movies ever\nWe wanted to see if we named market Dr Quinn and medicine woman\nThat double Mountain Dew I can quote\nLiterally like watch that movie and say the law everybody's lines more entertaining than the news cycle ...\nAnyway so the uh\nAside from the little cab yet that they had or wherever and they think well we need to you know aside from your social issues ... first off we are doing great economically I think we're pretty good on social issues as well\nTheir idea of how being free with social issues is government regulation of people's behavior beyond don't murder people\nThat's that's that's what they believe it's freedom which is completely the opposite\nSometimes I feel like the world is just one giant black mirror episode you know what I mean\n[noise]\nYou know I don't know ah anyway\nI'm waiting to see if what I said on social media triggered anybody I'm sure it yes there's the triggering this the trigger and has commenced\nI really I'm just I'm really read form an issue today I'm going to talk about this more coming up but I I watched the um\nThe Texas Senate debate last night and I just had a ... a couple of observing says and I've noticed being that you know we live in Dallas I notice that whenever you say anything on line about a Robert or Rourke beta O'Rourke\nThe Irishman who is Elizabeth Warren soft that his people lose their ever loving mind oh my gosh these people are on hinged then all of them 'cause I got a neighbor that has a beta sign and I have a cruising\nHe put a ... I put a crew sign up to put a beta sign up I put seven crew signs out\nJust how I Do and I don't I'm not and I don't I don't do that kind of stuff I don't put like the signs of my you know all of that because I'm actually told not to because people are nuts and they hate me and they threaten to kill me so I got to be careful about stuff because people are more on and I give them a one finger salute\nCome and take it I heavily armed\nBut I shouldn't be I'm just I'm really don't care today but I've noticed and was accepted and I never\nCause I'm pretty sure you know my neighbors pretty cool they're you know for the most part um but I've noticed that\nLike a lot of cruise signs of getting stolen around Dallas yeah and they get destroyed people put pictures up of them doing it um and I also\nKnow there were a bunch of businesses that have been complaining around the area in which I live because people were putting beta signs up on commercial property without getting permission\nFrom the business owners and it was a big thing like I'm On a Facebook page and you know and all the business owners were complaining about it and they said you know it was they actually had to have a couple of words with the ... campaign because they wouldn't stop doing it like one of them put a huge sign on this guy's commercial property like in front of his business\nAnd he's like no you can't do this stuff I'm not going to say this but um yeah I mean that's just you know but I watched the debate last night and I I Know we're going to get going but I got to share this and we're going to come back to more of this\nThere was at one point first off he used his right hand so much to talk and I'm a hands talker but I think that you need to use both of your hands equally because I've watched you and then it affects me because it's a symmetrical\nAnd that bothers me when you only use one half of your body to a moat I Can't stand that I watched it and I felt and even\nYou know anyway that's number one number two he was asked about how he was going to improve border security he didn't say damn thing about border security what he did say was that he thinks that we should spend more money on infrastructure like bridges to Mexico\nI'm not even ... I'm not kidding you dude why did you look at me like yes he said that his idea of border security is building a stronger bridge to Mexico\nAnd you know believe me go and look at the whole debate I'm not even kidding we're gonna come back talk about this more so it was the other thing\nThe third thing is I don't know what the hell he stands for and I watched genuinely now most of the time I Am a horrible smart alec and I am just about as sarcastic as anybody\nMore than anybody but for once I I mean being honest with you I genuinely wanted to see how far left he was and I wanted to see where it came out on certain issues I have no clue where this dude stance\nHe he didn't say anything\nI'm not kidding you guys he's a Bernie Sanders has been able to articulate more clearly what he believes in beta did last night and I watch this thinking who want to help prop this guy for his debate\nWho did this he liked the generic version of Wendy Davis who did this anyway we have a lot more to talk about and\nHow people are mad over Heather Nauert a Instagram page because people get mad over everything in the meantime I should probably chug more more super beach you know really I should I really think I should because I think I Need to be more of a smarter than I Am I'm really busy I'm that's why I don't read half of my emails or look at\nMost of my messages not because I don't want to talk to anybody but because I have things to do you know what I mean like I got laundry I got kids\nI don't have a staff I don't have like you know an assistant it's me\nAnd I work many many hours during the day or even if I'm not on TV I'm Still working and this is one of the busiest times of the year because we also host everybody for all the holidays which I enjoy but it's a lot to do you know what I mean and so I basically I'm just going to be rarely do\nI Need to be hyper powered\nAnd\nLegally [laughter] to repeat this way to do that\nMaybe that's not the best way to put it but I'd be straight with you because it's what you want to hear\nYou don't like drugs you don't want to drink a bunch of sugary energy drinks you need to check out to sea for beach it's natural and it's legal and you know what here's the thing it's good for you\nIt it's based on Nobel Prize winning research from Nineteen Ninety eight I can sit here and get into that but I don't care because you're just one of the people that when you flip the light switch delight comes on and it's only you care about that to me\nSo all I Know is it the night tracing the beach kick start nitric oxide production in your body it makes your arteries wider and more flexible increases your circulation helps maintain healthy blood pressure\nAnd you get I take it as a pre work out for crying out loud so there you go do you need anything else because that's it and there's no awful dirt horrible awfulness taste because beach taste like something you would expect Satan to design", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "year":
