good to be back of your program\nIt's great to have you back give us a rundown how the race fans eight days from the vote\nWell you we have a lot of momentum going into the final stretch early voting just started on October twenty four and we're seeing a lot of it on our side as people come out to the old\nI said people across West Virginia were absolutely second by what they saw on full display in Washington this fall\nAnd they're coming out and we're dealing network growing in the polls we have some polls show that I suppose showed us up but the most important thing is that we're trying to get our message out and get a vote out in the final eight days\nThe president is coming back to West Virginia on friday just another big sites for us and there's you know President Trump is very popular in West Virginia you warm with forty two\nPercent of the vote this is talk on coming back started these car we've got a big boost to the polls are I think we're right there for the stretch Ron we know that we're just or another massive amount of or a year\nAnd we just have to fight and keep our vantage over the next eight day\nPatrick Morrisey in his mind you that the desperation on the left the attempt to claim the president and it's all over everywhere this morning the president and I submitted Kevin McCarthy then I submitted the Republicans are responsible for violence that there's not a bomb or a semi representative Trump people\nI think that blows up in their hands and I don't mean the bomb I mean that rhetoric because the idea that\nThis crazed killer would be killer is somehow representative of Trump supporters or West Virginians is to me going to drive people to the pet more see a vote check what do you think\nWell look I think that's right and whenever people are seeing the mob I think they're beginning to associate with the with the crazy what happened because people literally going not on the other side of the aisle and I think more and more people know if Joe mansion or to get elected again\nHis first voters for Chuck Schumer that whole Schumer Pelosi Clinton obstruct\nResist impeach mop that's what it's all about and people can connect the dots now and there's more and more activity occurs where people see crazy behavior on the part of the liberal leadership and the people that are trying to gain control of the house that I think that's a very motivating factor\nMore and more I think folks are understanding but these are not West Virginia conservative values they don't my record\nOn the conservative fighter jets on the Obama administration repeatedly it'll warn protecting coal fighting substance abuse at standing up for conservative values are Second Amendment and coal lifestyle you\nJoe matches the opposite and even more importantly when he votes for Schumer is a vote for the mob mentality\nNow now to finish on that point pat ... does the average voter connect Joe mansion with Chuck Schumer because we all know what matters most is the majority in the Senate when it comes to judges\nAnd while Joe mansion may have voted for Brett Kavanaugh his party didn't they did everything they could to destroy him and he tried to stand aside from that wreckage but\nDo voters know that if you vote for mansion you're voting for more of the cabinet or attempt to take out\nWell we've just started a couple of commercials on that I think they are or are they do that and voters are smart\nThey know that the craziness they saw that didn't come from the Republican side of the aisle they know that it's not only Schumer and Pelosi it's Hillary Clinton I mean Hillary Clinton said that they can't be civil I mean that's a quote from Hillary Clinton\nI think people can connect that obviously Joe mansion doubled our supported Hillary Clinton even after she said\nShe was going to put a lot of coal miners coal company works I think they are you there bring it together because they know that this side represents a complete hundred eighty to return to go back to the Obama era Hillary Clinton era which they really hate it so I feel that the energy on our side we're seeing it all the surveys\nIt's growing and growing and Joe mansion as a problem as voters out it's just going to be a big issue\nHere it is an along eight days but it will fly by good luck\nPath Morris use your brain sprint towards the end I Believe West

uh last night on the Steve felt in show he was in Pittsburgh last night calling into the show televised and saying hey\nYou can't really have a better friend than Donald Trump for the Jewish cause autism and Israel so they can say that but they really can't back it up and so it's unfortunate that we're in a situation like this now we're just gonna bustling at each other\nNow let me talk about that I'm Talking with Anthony Scaramucci his new book Trump the blue collar president bookstores everywhere also a lower third tier on on MSNBC today again this is in\nThe people who do the kind of runs aren't that people were talking so I Can't blame this on me courage oh it's just on their show Trump's role in stoking violence among Americans\nI have a Washington Post column today Anthony Scaramucci you cannot blame violence on anyone except the perpetrators of violence it is a ridiculous than I don't blame Bernie Sanders for the Alexandria softball shooting I don't blame Maxine Waters for people chasing I'm I'm Mitch McConnell or or secretary Nielsen out of restaurants\nPeople who commit the crimes are responsible but why do you make of that lower third Trump's role in stoking violence among America\nWell listen I I again I'm In New York camp I totally disagree with that you have to figure the individual but I have said just the president I said as recently as yesterday we had a conversation yesterday if some of my TV urine says\nWhy not try toned down approach because\nYou know you you're at forty seven forty eight percent or you could get yourself it in the mid fifties she's doing steady while\nOn so many different fronts 'em and why why why have a headwind on you you can use these people on me and he's on the opinion that there's no if you think of the people that they're just going to continue to come out and guns blazing no matter what he does endorsed says and reference yesterday me on the phone\nThe speech on anti Semitism that he gave on Saturday and he said it is just pick up all of that\nIn the mainstream media or and so and then I went and checked it went on to it and look around at shore the criticism was while he was the prompt or he didn't really need it so it's just you know he he is right in a lot of ways you knock and it gets a fair shake that I feel perhaps you may feel that he deserves a as it used\nTo be whether or not done yet I play three clips of the I I played three extent equipped to his Indianapolis speech denounced the anti Semitism I think it's probably the first that anyone driving to work this morning as heard them because I mean this is where I wanted to get to the ... inside and you\nA let's get our Harvard law school brains on here you know that the media has monitor\nThe law school brains on here you know that the media has monetize hating Donald Trump you know that and that's a problem that's what's going on is that a couple of cable channels have monetize hating him one is monetize loving him that Anthony is bad for America it's just a group\nThat well I told I told you that I think that you see that objective standard and the business model of these companies now fragment ain't you\nGo to people that have come from biases I think it's just going to be the issue you know when I go on time a obviously a pro Trump supporter over three hundred and four page book about what I thought the campaign short stint in the White House but how he was able to steal the base\nOf the Democratic party and I go on you know what I Would say an adversarial programming um and I just get lit up and destroyed on Twitter out and and people why the politics of personal destruction and the politics of the union station and you're you're mentioning my Harvard law school degree\nBut you know set fires was calling me like fat Tony in the\nWhite House you know and that's just what I don't understand you're you're one of the guys who came into the Trump Administration and nobody knows that\nI was I was walking pinky rang according Seth Meyers I was dead Jim and laundry Jersey Shore cash member\nAnd so I mean it's just funny I mean you're allowed to do that to a talent or not really that you get the other racial groups you know work ethic but that's fine I mean the point the point I think the more important point you\nIs that a stop this nonsense um it's just bad for our kids because if kids are going to out of the discourse and that they're going to\nPut us in a position where they're no longer are involved and I think the opposition ...\nActually what do you like fishing\n... last question Anthony before we run out on the cars you buy the present you talk to them\nI think he needs to do more television with more adversarial people like it used to go on with Anderson Cooper and that's not my network I think you had to go on with Scarborough why they got to go home with Matt I got to go everywhere because he never loses one on ones and they cannot not televised um but he stopped doing that\nDuring the campaign he was ubiquitous on every channel it every moment totally interviews on radio what do you think\nWell you go back to my calms plan I wrote a seven page ... plan that literally said exactly what you just said I was about to implement that plan on the thirty first of July and I got fired at nine thirty seven in the morning\nAnd I had been able to implement that plan would have put a big dog out here in all of those situations and I think he would definitely be gravitating way more independents as a result that's hundred percent agree

Israel as I Am and mourning those who died in Pittsburgh uh Larry iron though it never takes long for opportunity to seize on any tragedy and last night\nI'm Kevin McCarthy our friend house GOP leader was attacked by people on the left because he had weeded out before the Pittsburgh massacre\nThat George Soros Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer we're trying to buy the election which in fact they're trying to do and that's fine that's their constitutional rights but he was accused of anti Semitism for noting that I guess because those three men are Jewish and you know Kevin McCarthy I Know Kevin McCarthy\nOur ambassador to Germany with Cornell came on earlier he knows Kevin McCarthy what do you make of the charge of anti Semitism with regards to our friend Kevin McCarthy\nWell so both of us know Kevin McCarthy for many decades but what I didn't know and I bet Kevin McCarthy didn't know that those guys are all Jews\n[laughter] I bet you didn't [laughter] I didn't\nYou know really 'cause I I think in particular those three guys you know like I I didn't know George Soros was a Jew\nBut ... and everybody everybody knows about him right he's this big liberal guy gives all this money read that the truth is if you were going to insult them because they were Jews you would need to be explicit about it 'cause most people wouldn't get the joke\nThat that's it and I but of course they don't want you to get that they don't want you to understand Kevin McCarthy they want to smear Kevin McCarthy and the sphere of anti Semitism is a deep one I mean it it's along with being anti black and

... my wife's great grandfather started the synagogue in Indianapolis I I Can't abide it\nBut it is used as a cudgel does it work Larry aren't\nWell uh you know the ... I Want to say something about the depth of it is they think about the Jews that ... when you said that Walker ... which I had not heard before and that wonderful yeah\nThey get the Jews are unique in history and their unique because there is the first ancient people whose God did not disappear when the polity was defeated\nAnd they kept their God you're there X. files and this got claims to be the one God and the creator of all and then this odd claims to have a concern for everybody on earth and the the covenant with Abraham\nIs a covenant and this should be a blessing to all the people on the face of the year\nNow you won't find anything like that in the ancient religions have which Judaism as one right three thousand NBC or before\nAnd so that's the first thing but the second thing is\nBecause they uh it didn't it didn't this band when their country was overcome the promised land was overcome overcome then what they had been is an exile people for a long long time incredibly stubborn\nAnd keeping their identity\nAnd so that that places them and lots of other countries and that means the oldest opportunity for resentment of of of strangers in our midst of that you and you

and belief\nStem from that and it's got nothing to do with color\nNow I think that's what Donald Trump has to say to the world and says that a lot and has been saying that I looked it up before the election back for decades\nAnd so if you say that your enemies are acting bad in the end and you know he says that hard right one of the reasons the political ... the political debate is so intense\nIs it now it's a real fight\nAnd Trump does fight like with like\nIn the sense that he denounces people you know really clear but I don't think you know racist way\nAnd he does not call for violence ... for his victory that he really wants to win the Senate he really wanted to win Brett Kavanaugh he really wanted the tax cuts he really wants to win like you said you'll get sick of winning\nBut he doesn't call for violence in the intimation that he does the idea that chance or somehow car chases are hurling insults are like hurling rocks\nThat is a vanity of the left and the

addressing and it just made the point that there'd been some lynchings\nAnd they weren't all black and uh although there were so\nAnd so he he makes the point that if you stream out into the street

rolled it out sold off basically all of the units a bitcoin\nThey receive the cash for that that was there basically how they made their money\nTo to put the the coins out there and that that you know to nobody ... I mean I own some point I own a little bit um and and everybody who is he basically has put money in and bought bitcoin has it you know it's all recorded on the public block chain\nA ledger so it's

nonetheless\nYou know the policies are going to be put in jeopardy what do you think about that\n[noise] well I think what's been lost in the debate you know we heard early on their Scooby giant blue wave and now I'm Democrats are licking their wounds because they don't think that that's going to happen they may take over the house and they lose seats in the Senate but\nTraditionally this happens every mid term election where you have a new president coming\nI'm traditionally two years into that president's term for president loses\nA number of seats a reasonably large number I Believe it's it depends on how you measure but it's about twenty seats in the house in one seat in the Senate lose the president's party that's the way it's been in that the historical trends so I think that's what people should expect so I'm\nAbout twenty CPR that they were still Republicans would have the house that was the outcome\nYeah and then it might be a maybe it's going to be a little bit more than that maybe it's not but I think that we do you're absolutely right saved up the economy is doing great and I think the American people should\nReward the party in power for\nHistoric tax cuts for the fact that\nYou know the economy is doing a lot better people have jobs with historically low unemployment rates because of the government policies that reduce regulations allowed small businesses access to capital there's so many different means\nAnd cutting taxes and and you know the promise you know people are giving Trump the hard times as on him to do another tax cuts\nAnd maybe he's not as a

be wrong and the time you're ... going to be introduced it's a great thing and I think the American people look at that and say I'm One more tax cuts I Want less government I Love the fact that

leading edge back in the sixties when he goes into the world of computers are so far ahead of the curve and pat I'm sure many many people knows the name international data group but\nFor our first time listeners are those who are not quite familiar with everything you do um give us a snapshot again of of ID gee I'm as it exists today and then we'll go back and check it out\nYeah well we're a

around the world the type of computer world series hero Mac world et cetera and we have a point to the Web sites that are made in support those magazine brands and ah about twelve hundred different expeditions and conferences\nThat pat is one of the greatest examples of settings first when people told them it could be done and we've heard from other guest on legends of success how many nations to work when someone had a new idea and ... just referenced if you have a new id and people telling you can't be done\nYou're probably on the right trail to success because no one's done right now\nAre you exactly right there on you know\nGoing going back one of the first year we told you couldn't go to MIT you you you want a full scholarship there while you were there a you became the editor of computers and all of the nation magazine correct that's correct yes\nAnd that really gave me a chance to uh uh get around during the summers and meet the heads of the computer companies and meet their top engineers and their product fighters how\nI learned a tremendous amount about the companies and then when I came to start my own business um you know that was a big help or because they knew my name and teen my writings and analysis and therefore they were willing to pay attention to\nA proposal that I made up of two that are paid a sense of where the computers were and what the customers\nWho are using them wanted for future products and services\nAbsolutely ... and that was a job you've got while you're at MIT but you stayed with it when you graduated correct\nUh that's right yeah the when as an editor I was out now talking to the heads of the computer companies or you know told me that they had a need for this or um and when I have a problem with the price he said that was\nToo low I should charge more thought that'd be taken seriously I Love that business idea and uh so I put put out the proposal and wound up having a nine companies send me checks for about twenty five thousand dollars each for half payment so that is actually all the capital that are used to get started so\nTo or anyone asked me about how to start a business I just talked to people who can be customers find out through unfulfilled needs and proposed to fill those needs and in many cases they'll you know go sponsor you they'll buy a subscription to your proposed service and otherwise advance money to help you get it going so you don't need to raise a lot of money\nIf you are in close touch with your customers they'll they'll be happy to support you well\nAbsolutely an ... you know there's there's a real important in the lesson here while you're working for that magazine and folks again it was it was called computers none of the nation back you know many years number of years ago or sixties\nYeah it was a ... there and that's about\nUh sixty three sixty three ... and ... was his job is to go all over the country as you said and gather information a world of computers were number this was back in the sixties you build up a tremendous knowledge\nAnd a resource of where they were all located now so the lesson I wanted to go back to that that they would love to hear from you pat you brought this idea back for a plan new publication you brought it back to the publisher what did they tell you\nWell they said oh that's a market research project that's not something we're interested in and you you know you can do it on your own uh\nSo I said fine I'll Try it and then that with with started the business and\nNow that we've had a number of cases like that um after doing the talking to 'em a lot of the managers of computer centers they said they needed a weekly newspaper to help them get real information about what other people like them were experiencing with computers\nWell with their problem and difficulties and we launched\nThe weekly newspaper and everyone told us it couldn't be done we are only putting fifty thousand dollars into the project all the money we had available and they told us how it's going to cost you a million dollars to a friend a weekly newspaper\nAnd you'll be out of business in two months and you know we'll be either you did well will pick up the pieces and carried on ourselves or if you went all the one that was a bad market and we saved some money by showing us that you had a dead end project\nAnd fortunately we got through advertising because we were new but we've got about Seventy thousand people who gave us a check for twelve dollars to subscribe to our publication so that was in fact a million dollars came out of the subscription\nAdvances we're getting from readers enthusiastic about our content\nThat's that's pretty amazing in ... when you go back to the original original um when when that publisher told you originally pat nah you could do that we're not interested or telescopes um how much money was raised in how you raise it to launch that new magazine and that new venture\nAdventure well uh I'm I've I've I put in like sold my car and put in the five thousand dollars that was all my proceeds available and\nThen I went to my sister and I went to the first person either employed do ... general manager and said would you be willing to invest in support me and this project and they said well you know we know you and like you and everything but um we know these things they risky they don't always succeed so\nWe're going to give you ten dollars while secret to you're a cat here ... adventure your capital availability\nSo so your seed capital was five thousand and twenty dollars by selling your car and getting a ten dollar bills from your wife and a manager you my sister and a manager\nYou I'm Sorry your yeah your sister manager right so so that was in Nineteen sixty three basic under sixty four ... ... and and those to investors I got to recapture says to investors gave you the ten dollars what what's the ten dollars worth today\nAbout three and a half million dollars a seat that eight\nOr ... unbelievable\nAbsolutely amazed and they told you couldn't be done\nA ride which always encouraged me because uh uh you know if it was that easily able to be done a lot of people would have already done it so\nAnd they say can be done that means\nI'm going to have very much reduced competition and that just by energetically you know keeping in touch with um they had written prospects you often find ways that they would like to see the service provider that no one else is they do that and then you can charge in and you know put a give them something they really want and you know into the ethical you support it\nIs that is ... I was going to ask is either to success but when ... when you're growing business no matter what stages pass isn't that one of the uh the one of the critical elements that you use and success is always staying customer focused and listening to them and and listening to what they need some simple but so many people don't do it\nYou're right that when people ask me oh what does it take to be an entrepreneur I say when you have to find something you want to do you're passionate about do you have to give a lot of physical energy cuts that you have to put Seventeen Eighteen hour days and in the early days you know you have to keep your optimism high so you feel you're good positive spirit\nBut don't spend too much time sitting now making a paper plans because\nUh [noise] uh but you said that there was work your plan but you should do with working market going out and finding out what people want their changing needs and keeping you know right up to date with their changing needs and you'll be winning all the time if you try to\nYou know go ahead and roll out a plan that you made up sometime you're almost sure to be way off the market within a year or two\nThat that's incredible I'm Glad you said then is very very intriguing because I find that a lot of the greatest entrepreneurs in America the wealthiest most successful never really had any formal written business plan and if they did they usually pulled out\nA I've found that to be very helpful because you listen better if you don't have a lot of preconceived ideas and your mind\n... I Love it I Love it now now when you're glowing from a from a regional business you know start up you mentioned some of the critical element what about growing from regional to national what it is next critical steps to grow a business even further\nBut of course you have to make sure that your communication network has spread throughout the country as a people in all parts of the country are aware of your projects and then of course the next step is to begin to move into other countries and are there they they keep that has to go over and you know and and actually make discussions with the proposed customers to make sure they\nSee the same needs and then go out and find someone in that country who uh shares your passion for the for the moment of those needs\nAnd you know has the enthusiasm that charisma to be able to hire and motivate good people and then you know give them the resources they want a give them an encouragement and support get out of their way let them you know just to their local market and to provide them help and assistance but don't try to tell them how to do it because\nYou're never going to fully understand foreign market where the local person who lives in the culture every day is\nGoing to be much more able to move quickly adjusted changes within that market\nOn another point you came up with an you shared with me in the past is that on the decentralization was important to you and and you you you'd um hone in on the numbers are around a hundred and fifty was very key to the globe your business on your business units can you share with the number one this is so important okay\nYeah that's our average business ties and how I found early on that I Would go I was like a typical entrepreneur I wanted to control everything make sure everything was happening in a way I expected and um then I realized that my attempt to control with actually slowing the growth of the business and that's why I really have the epiphany to say\nYou know I'm a what is really necessary is not a my control\nYou know I'm a what is really necessary is not a my control but finding fertile markets then good at getting an enthusiastic leader and then I found that morale eyes I visited uh companies and even observing our own companies that\nAre the morale was her pick at about a hundred and fifty people are the people at that stage they knew knew each other they knew each other families they had a clear vision of why they're role with how important in the company and they were all you know work together as a unified team\nI ... and it's interesting because that sort of\nA you know we have people grow up in the uh families and usually like twelve family has made a tribe who migrated from place to place\nA typically like twelve people in the family and to tell you a hundred and forty four hundred and fifty people in this group of a human beings who would move around a and conduct all their activities and I think the mind is really sort\nBut there is a um you know I'm not usually increases that I think maybe it's it's partially that there's something in the pollution and the environment that is causing this to increase by partially that the\nAbility to recognize an early stage or to take a you know situation artistic development allows from our cases to be reported\nBy the autism is actually is at fault in the early neurological development of a a childhood\nAh causes a ... a part of the brain to a accelerated development that often you know has\nA quantitative factual types of skills but um diminishes the social sensitivity and social interaction capability so that you wind up having you know people who can be um a brilliant mathematician and you know can multiply to twenty digit numbers together or can\nHear a piano concerto wants to repeat it exactly do amazing things\nIn the specialized part of the brain that are related to math and music yet um you know they have very little sensitivity to other people they can't read another person's mood or style you know they they look away from people there really isolated a socially\nSo uh what we hope our research will do is to identify what biochemical\nOr other action and they are developing brain and often this is much more frequent and and males and females that causes the development of this artistic uh situation so that can be prevented or hopefully even reversed in cases where it's\nYou know the child is now five or six to seven years old\n[laughter] it's amazing and I understand that the the ... statistics these days are one in one hundred and sixty six children one out of one sixty six has autism\nAh that that's really tragic if ... if it's such a hardship for the parents involved\nAnd and also not required lifetime often very

to be possible a true and then it turns out that uh you know they they can actually accomplish it that they want it to important now to keep very closely communicate it to them when they realize that there are now the national thought is not achievable they'll let you know I remember\nWe started at the idea of doing a weekly TV program about how computers were going to be useful in society back in Nineteen eighty and we went around to the various companies that were in the in the computer field and they were all advertising with our magazines and newspapers and we said the we're going to do a weekly TV program\nAnd it's a terrific and we're going to buy a thirty second spot on your show and no time at all we had all the\nUh all the TV availability is filled out so we went ahead and hired the production team at nova the science program at the PBS and reproduce thirty nine weeks of shows and then we uh you know called the companies that they send us your ads and the hitter called our agency and they said\nOh you want to be on TV you know that's new for you\nOr it will cost or you know do a first class commercial across to Seventy or eighty thousand dollars for thirty seconds by\nThey said we just can't possibly afford those types of right so we can put you know give you the ads we thought we were so we went out in the air anyway but we had more public service and then I think any other program on TV\nSo it sounds like pat did the underwriting that's that we did so are you\nIn Port and that's why it's important to keep very close to the customer and you find that they have a problem with that type you can make and an adjustment\nUh yeah and then you run into a other unexpected problems we when we watch their first publication and the Soviet Union we than all the

ring usa offers his take on this week's American radio journal commentary\nMy mom and Henry and welcome to American radio journal the White House\nOffice of management and budget has announced the Trump administration's efforts at regulatory relief that resulted in twenty three billion dollars in cost savings\nHere to talk about the lessening regulatory burden on business is Ken Cuccinelli ten is a former Virginia attorney general now serves as director of the regulatory action center at the freedomworks foundation and welcome back to American radio journal\nCan we know that the Trump Administration has made regulatory relief a top priority can you give us an update on the progress that the administration is making in this area\nThey just put out a semi annual report and a lot of these things have been very boring in the past and frankly very burdensome that\nVery proud of their work and they have every right to be the most recent period of time they've they've saved annual savings of over a billion dollars\nWith a lifetime savings of twenty three billion dollars and\nWhen you compare that to the same period for the Obama administration during the same period they imposed two hundred and thirty five billion dollars worth of regulatory costs and that produces nowhere else it makes no one richer it makes our economy poor by that amount of money because these are just transaction closet\nBusinesses have to bear gesture exist so to reduce them as the Trump Administration has done and has made clear it's going to continue to do has really helped boost economic growth and opportunity for every American\nWhen you talked Ken about regulatory costs on business most Americans of course don't run a business although everybody has dependent upon them were income so tell me a little bit it a little bit more depth what you mean by the term regulatory cost of the business what burden does this place on businesses and how does that affect the ordinary worker\nSo she's a simple example when I left the attorney general's office of Virginia I've been doing a number of things and send one of them you might not expect with three other people that I Know we started an oyster business in the Chesapeake Bay\nNow and it's still going four years later it's going well candor island oyster company in the tenure islands in the middle of that well\nAs you know the food has certain safety risks with it and we have to when we totally oysters out of the day\nWe have to do it before ten am during the summer so there's not much sun and heat we have to have them on ice and in certain temperature ranges and their reasons for that those are health and safety regulations somebody like me very minimalist the person when it comes to government regulation\nThinks those makes sense that we had to take classes and learn them and so forth but if your business like\nA barber say you wanted to start a hair cut I'll call it a salon you have to go get it cosmetology license from your state and typically you have to\nTyler gee license from your state and typically you have to take hundreds of hours of classes and this is just to cut hair let's set aside using chemicals on coloring hair and things like that just to cut hair\nWell why on earth should you have to do any of that and what does it do what it does is it doesn't allow poor people to just boom start up their hair cut business and I'll tell you what if I go to your hair cut business and you don't cut my hair well guess what I'm not coming back\nThe market will take care of it when there aren't a health and safety burdens and issue government shouldn't be regulated it shouldn't be regulating and the federal government regulates building codes and other things that should be left the states and local governments the closer the government is to us the more response of it is to us\nAnd that that's a principle the founders talked about this isn't new\nAnd the Trump Administration is peeling away layers of federal regulation that give us more opportunities to start out small businesses\nOne of the things we saw in the Obama administration is a nosedive in entrepreneurial spirit that people America has distinguished itself in our history by our do it yourself attitude up by your bootstraps willingness to take risks and part of that is starting businesses well\nThe effort to start new businesses came to not a screeching halt under the Obama administration\nBut it drops to record lows and that has all turned around a a very common response of the business person five years ago to the burdens that government was placing on them was if I had to start my business today I wouldn't do it or I couldn't do it well\nThe attitude is changing and you see it reflected in the optimism of small business owners and their organizations that measure that optimism is the highest it's been in decades\nAnd a lot of that is not because of the just the tax bill which is what a lot of people focus on his lower taxes it's because the government is making an effort and affirmative effort to get out of the way to expand freedom and opportunity\nAnd what's at stake here is something called the separate solvers loophole in the Fifth Amendment now that sounds very complicated or legal easy\nBut it's actually pretty straight forward most people are probably pretty familiar with\nThe idea of double jeopardy the idea that you cannot be tried and convicted twice for the same crime but there is this the strange loophole that effectively allows you to be both tried and convicted at the state level and the federal level\nFor the same crime and parents Marquez gamble\nFell right into that loophole a few years ago he was convicted in two thousand eight of second degree robbery and as a condition of that conviction I he was prohibited from owning a firearm under both state and federal law\nNow in twenty Fifteen gamble was pulled over by the cops for having me busted tail light they searched his car and they found a hand gun in the car so he ended up being convicted of unlawfully possessing a firearm and he was convicted both by the state of Alabama and by the federal government\nHe won't be released from prison until February of twenty twenty that is\nThree years later than if he had only been convicted at\nThe state level now gamble has appealed his federal conviction on the grounds that he was being punished twice for the same crime which of course the Fifth Amendment explicitly forbids\nUnfortunately for gamble the Supreme Court has ruled that the same behavior actually can be punished under both federal and state law without violating the ban of double jeopardy because the state and the federal government are two distinct\nSovereign but this doctrine of separate sovereign really has a bit of dubious legal history to it at first arose in an Eighteen fifty two case that had to do with fugitive slaves\nAnd then it was upheld by the court in a prohibition era K. C. U. S. V. lands and both of those rulings are kind of looked down on nowadays as having been poorly reason\nSo this case matters because there's been a push to federalize so many crimes in recent decades and that means there's now really significant overlap between state and federal offense isn't that creates more opportunities for multiple convictions based on the same actions\nThat redundancy seems to conflict with the intent behind the double jeopardy clause in the Fifth Amendment and it also makes it harder for states and the federal government to set appropriate penalties since neither really knows what the other will do or if the other will even seek out an additional conviction for the same crime\nSo a victory for gamble in this case could mean tossing out a long standing but poorly conceived\nSupreme Court precedent or at least potentially limiting its use and that would protect defendants from facing cereal prosecutions for the same crime and ultimately increase liberty and and be a significant reform to America's criminal justice system\nSo that's one case to keep your eye on I think the other important criminal justice case in front of the court this session comes out of Indiana the cases Kim's the Indiana so what's at stake here is the eighth amendment's prohibition against excessive fines and the question of whether that\nProhibition applies to the states as well as the federal government the Supreme Court will hear the case here oral arguments in the case on November twenty eighth the back story here is that titan Tamms was arrested in twenty Fifteen after selling heroin to undercover police officers\nHe's a criminal and he doesn't dispute that he pleaded guilty to one count of dealing a controlled substance in one town of conspiracy to commit theft\nAnd he was sentenced to one year of house arrest followed by five years of probation but\nHe was also required to pay investigatory fees and court costs and then on top of that the state of Indiana sees his landrover which he had purchased with money received from his late father's insurance pay out not from the proceeds of drug sales\nBut the state's took the car on the grounds that it had been used in the process of committing a crime basically but he had carry drugs in the car and so they had a right to forfeit now Tim has appealed the forfeiture of his vehicle he's not appealing his conviction he's not appealing other parts of his sentence\nHe's only appealing the forfeiture of his vehicle arguing that he was already being punished for the crime ended at seizing the truck valued at forty thousand dollars violated the eighth amendment ban on excessive fines and appeals court found that the forfeiture of the Land Rover was grossly disproportional\nBecause it amounted to a penalty that was about four times the maximum monetary fine for the crimes that teams had actually\nCommitted in was already being punished for\nThe Indiana Supreme Court however overturned that decision on the ground that the ban on excessive fines only applies at the federal level and not to the states to the legal background here is really interesting and important the Supreme Court has long track record of ruling on on multiple occasions\nThat the various limitations on government power included in the bill of rights apply to the states as well as the federal government and that happens\nBecause of the fourteenth amendment due process clause so in Nineteen sixty two for example the Supreme Court ruled that the eighth amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment applies to the states and in twenty Fifteen it reached the exact same conclusion about the eighth amendment ban on excessive bail\nBut the court has never explicitly said that the amendment's prohibition on excessive fines and fees also applies to the state and so the Supreme Court seems to have taken this case\nBecause it gives them an opportunity to do exactly that to clear up the yes indeed the Constitution's ban on excessive fines does apply to the states and this would have important ramifications for civil asset forfeiture proceedings\nA decision applying the excessive fines close to the state level would make it far easier to challenge unreasonable fines and fees including noxious forfeiture but also cases were local governments have hit homeowners with massive civil penalties for offenses like unapproved paint jobs or having Halloween decorations up for too long\nThe fact that some local governments use those fines and fees as a means to raise revenue was created a perverse incentive to target residents unfairly or to go after people who are just minding their own business so a victory for teams in this case would be an important step\nTowards curbing that sort of local and state government abuse and it would also be a significant blow to other problems created by civil asset forfeiture\nSo these are two big cases gambling Tim's they're not cases they're necessarily going to capture\nThe news media attention they're not going to be all over the front page of the New York times the oral arguments here that take place November twenty eighth and December fitter worth paying attention to and the ruling when they come out early next year\nCould have important ramifications for the criminal justice system and I think more importantly for the rights of Americans the rights that are already and try and in the constitution but are not necessarily always present in the the actual practice of the criminal justice system\nOperates a magazine I married name will be right back to your next week on another edition of American radio journal\nThe sprint T Mobile merger is now before the Federal Communications commission triggering a debate over competitiveness calling Hannah of freedom or in usa has an American radio journal commentary as a conservative\nI'm a fervent believer in the free market and the economic value of competition and that's usually oppose mergers because they tend to reduce competition competition fixed prices low and us benefits consumers there was a proposed merger that is now seeking government approval that is different however it's the proposed\nMerger between wireless carriers sprint and T Mobile has a long time sprint mobile customer I have more than just a passing or theoretical interest in this one and I've concluded that it's one of those rare mergers that is likely to preserve rather than reduce competition here's why\nThe mobile or wireless industry is complex but there are essentially two types of players one is what they call mobile network operators or MSN those those are the companies that own and operate cell phone towers had their networks there are four of them were rising AT and T. sprint\nThere were four of them were rising AT and T. sprint and T Mobile the other players like consumer cellular cricket metro PCS than US Cellular or what's called mobile virtual network operators are M. V. in those\nThere are dozens of them and they did an owner operate their own cellular networks they basically piggy back on the for him and those buying access at wholesale rates the envy and those are fierce competitors and they're innovative rape plans and discounts hold down rates for every one\nOf the big for him and those were rising and AT and T. or roughly the same size and each has roughly twice the size of sprint and T Mobile\nMobile industry is on the cusp of the next big technology and mobile communications called five gee\nThe five gee mobile technology will carry more than twenty times the data loaded the card for G. technology this means faster download times for bandwidth hungry applications like HD video and it's even more than twenty times faster for a certain other types of data\nFive ... technology will be very expensive to implement however\nIt will cost literally billions upon billions of dollars and that's where this merger make sense\nOf arise in an ATM T both have capital and access to capital in the order of magnitude required to roll out five gee sprint and T Mobile or capital constrained by comparison because of this it will take them longer to update their networks and in the meantime they will be operating at a competitive disadvantage\nIn a marketplace that values the latest technology and we're customer loyalty is at best a secondary consideration the result in likelihood is that for rising and they TNT\nWould pick off millions of technology obsessed customers from sprinting T Mobile further enlarging the too big players and tricking the two smaller embryos\nIt wouldn't be long before they're easy pickings for mergers with the big two\nLeading to only to long term him into survivors but if the two smaller him in those proposed merger is approved there would be three surviving him into sort of comparable size so the question before the FCC and the department of justice is not whether it is in the public interest to go from for him in those two or three\nBut whether it is better in the long run to have three ... than two\nThree and Mentos will also compete more vigorously for the business of dozens of them via knows if there are only two and Mentos and there's a good chance that they'll ease into a kind of ... of two players\nWho don't really compete head to head but rather decided to carve up the envy in a marketplace between them probably geographically that would further reduce competition in the mobile communications space\nAlmost went to India the first audience she really wanted to reach wasn't a ... and several numbers the priest came to know Christ under Thomas's teaching and that's when he was executed their Americans in Canada and in the southern city of Sendai to commemorate promises

Mike I'm In my meetings and the only part of September but the turn a full time now will be with the Bollywood film stars highly successful icons\nAnd they do it in a closed door setting and asked me to speak and asked that question\nThe last time I spoke at one of the film settings there my colleague was back when I was with me and my wife and a few others there were big names in Indian films out there and I have to speak on life beyond the box office\nAnd one of the biggest names in Indian film industry took me aside and those surrounded by students and others and he said to me to be honest with you on disappointed with you on TALK\nI said you were you said yes I said tell me you said you know what I struggle with a struggle with what goes on inside me and I cannot explain and\nYou did not address that at all I should mash and I pointed to the head of the institution I said I was his guest he gave me a steam\nI'm very careful when I come to India to make sure I don't start out with your team and end up with mine I tried on the team that has given but I'll tell you what if you want me to address once you just don't\nGet bumped about bring me back and talk about it\nAnd he looked at the man that had an issue do you spend less get you back for a week should because this is the kind of issue we are wrestling and\nSo here they are orthodox Hindus Muslims ... skeptics and all we're looking for answers to Jesus Christ then we've got our own icons are chair well going into all kinds of modes of spirituality most of the terms of which they really don't\nEven understand Jesus have been lost in all of this and I wanted to set a set up as quickly as I can be don't have much time and uh the book will give you a full detail\nBut I was on the streets in my own journey and is on the lawlessness of God in the midst of it there were three passages that came to mind you don't need to make a note of it you're probably familiar with it and they could stop taking notes ... lose your way in the sequence of thinking here\nBut in a\nSecond kings twenty two you know got a story of a young boy who's eight years old it becomes skiing is damaged just shy of when he was a teenager he began to seek off to God\nI Want to stop right there and talk to those of you and your team's this man as a teenager began to seek octagon\nIt was only eight when the drone fell upon him and as a teenager began to hunger off ... think about it\nIn his mid twenties she calls the priest together and said chemical is messed completely messed up I Want you boys to clean it up and in his mid twenties they discovered something\nIn the temple of God they had lost the book of the law\nAnd the high priest found this and called the secretary and told them I just wanted to look at the low they didn't know where the last ... tend to temper [laughter] you know in the book of the law had been lost in some other arena some museum somebody you could understand that when this last year the very hostile God you know realize something radically had gone wrong\nThe easiest idea do mess up in your life your spirituality it lends itself to read the perversion\n\nThe greater score versions that have taken place in history have been in religious arenas nobody is fan no religious view is Spain\nAnd I remember in the Nineteen eighties when I was driving at six in the morning I was going to play racket ball\nAnd turned the news on and find out what had happened amongst the leadership of the famed BPL network\nI remember them pulling up on the side of the road and said something awful is going to happen in this country as a result of this\nWhere leaders who've been watched by millions and messed up monetarily hadn't messed up morally and all of this that had gone on\nAnd began the debacle in the Nineteen eighties and we have not checked recovered religion lends itself to perversion because people are hungry to be met\nAnd those who are the power brokers of religion can easily abuse the ordinary individual in manipulating them within that scares\nMost of eastern spirituality is controlled by superstition here most of eastern spirituality controlled by superstition you\nShould think

moderated by Jake Tapper he played a little bit of this cut number two\nI Want to bring up an issue that is that it's been a flagging each one of you I'll start with you on air going the FBI spent investigating potential corruption in Tallahassee now for three years the probe appears to include lobbyists\nAnd former a campaign treasurer for you Adam Corey you've been trying to distance yourself from Corey you've been friends with him for more than a decade and two trips he took together are part of the investigation how plant can Floridians trust your judgment when someone under FBI investigation was part of your inner circle\nYeah well you know we all have friends that sometimes let us down and uh the truth is is let me be very clear about what the record is I I Am not under FBI investigation and neither neither is my city government\nAre and what we have done is we welcome that man if there is someone who has done something wrong they ought to be held fully accountable for their actions we made every public record available on a publicly searchable website and our city a contrast how I dealt with the FBI by comparison to how Methodist dance deals with the FBI\nOr he has gone out of his way before he quit his job in Congress to protect a Donald Trump or to curb a B inquiry by Mr Mahler\nOr he is not even so far ... jets at some deep state is that worked to undermine the president say I mean the conspiracy theory if you will so if you take the way we dealt with their investigation as opposed to how Mr dissenters has dealt with it I'll take our example every single day of the\nWeek the difference between a anger and me that when I get with the FBI is a prosecutor I was working hand in hand with them to bring people in the justice\nWhen Andrew deals with um he's

lobbyists and guess what happened\nThe lobbyists that wine and dine Andrew they got a two million dollar grant from the city government so to me corruption is when you're in a position of power you're getting something you shouldn't have had he shouldn't have gotten the Broadway tickets he shouldn't have gotten a trip to Costa Rica and then you give something to someone in return he gave two million dollars today a mafia\nBam bam bam I don't know how Andrew Gillum wins this thing around the census is eight straight shooting prosecutor Harvard law school graduate navy veteran and Florida

are to be perpetually solemn we must play but I'm Miriam it must be a bad time and it is in fact the memories kind\nWhich exist between people who are from the outset\nTaken each other's seriously no flipping see no superiority no presumption\nWhen the United states and of course centers that's when the United states was a church going place with if not a denominational agreement at least a general agreement on the dignity of the individual I think it was a safer place\nYeah I agree and what a ... a hearty amen to that Louis ck was first of all it so much of what we're doing in life is consuming in shorter and shorter hot takes right now and that means we have less and less was\nI mean there is actually lots of data showing Americans reading significantly less than Thirty years ago if everybody were reading Lewis like that or even lion the witch and the wardrobe or or the weight of glory and other s as\nThere is so much weight there that starts from that assumption\nOf a modern day sort of the Judeo Christian tradition the assumptions that people are created in the image of God and they have dignity so human cells are immortal and so if you treat people like that it means that even if I if it was somebody on policy and there's lots of legislative\nPriorities and policies that you're going to differ with your neighbors about\nThat doesn't change the fact that they're human worthy of dignity created in God's image and ... at the center of a line before them that baby the parents to align that's coming after them and if my neighbor Fort doors down and I for completely on this in my view the stupidity of a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and all the economic destruction that will cause\nThat doesn't change the fact that we're going to root for the Oscars together and I'm going to sweep the kid up in my driveway if she skins are neat falling off the bike\nLike that not go ahead that is the that is the rediscovery of community but NO PLAN for me senator Sasse to a problem which I've been talking about all morning\nThere were seven thousand human beings marching towards our border they are human beings they are embargo day they they deserve dignity but at the same time our laws cannot be kept him to the mob you\nCan't march into America and it's seven thousand people can next time it'll be fourteen thousand then I'll be fifty thousand how do you want to frame what we ought to do about this for the public\nYeah so let's go back and and this is not a you know just trying to blame the prior administration because I Want to be clear our immigration problem started decades and the comment\n... part of this problem is in twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen when we didn't send the clearer signal and Central America that the assumptions that people and especially bad people I mean they don't have the image of God that we can distinguish it we have more time between the electrical right just as a civil rights but human traffickers\nAre in Central America told people they told moms and dads when they were trying to take big payments added that\nTo say we can get your kids into the U.S\nThey told them that the US's catch and release policy\nIn twenty Thirteen fourteen meant that if you got to the border you were basically guaranteed admission and passage into the U.S the U.S has to have borders every nation has to have orders and if you're going to secure your border that\nMeans you run it stopped the upstream hurt in this case downstream the goals\nThat are telling people our policies are so dumb that if you can get to the border and turn yourself into a border patrol agent we can't pet process the backlog and sold immediately just released these migrants straight into the U.S and they'll have a six month asked until their trial date and some super majority of them I don't know the current statistics\nBut I asked the percentage of them don't ever show up for their trials that are for their deportation trial that was stupid and now we have a big problem because these assumptions have been set for so long we need to send a signal\nThat the U.S has border is hard and getting harder and beats your heart and more\nAnd that you won't get in under that dumped catch and release policy and at the same time we need to make sure that the ways that we communicate that continued articulate the US's grander vision of seven and a half billion people could being created with dignity that doesn't mean the free passage in the United states where\nThe fence must be the outward expression of an invisible resolved to both control your border but be a welcoming country let me play for you and says we talked a lot senator during the confirmation of justice cabin up\nChuck Todd on meet the press on friday has been all over the country doing what I'm doing doing meet and greets with voters whose conclusion number four\nIn my travels this week\nNo Democrat would sit on the record amazing how consistent some of them were people running ... some of them are people voting although we're going\nWashington to some of them went by naming names [laughter] neither Democrats out the campaign trail frustrated to cap it off\nTo stop so Ben Sasse why the Rick oil I think Chuck is right I've heard the same thing it's in the polling there's a window if the Republicans back what is it about those proceedings the caused America to shutter\n[noise] well I I Want to be delicate about this because I think the backdrop is the gender gap in America now thirty five no I'm no I'm you know are trying to think ooh\nMy ... my favorite ... at the moment as ... bowling expert but when you have a gender gap a plus thirty five a historically Republican usually trial you know for to ten point\nA witch when a when you have plus twenty five with women and now for Democrats and now a plus for teenage or for Republicans with Ben sometimes just fundamentally broken in the country so there's a lot to say that isn't just about the Kavanaugh hearings um but I think in the Kavanaugh hearings\nYou saw an attempt to politicize and hijack the me too movement and bake it something that is owned by partisans in Washington DC\nI'm I think the me too movement is incredibly important because I Do think we have a culture of a lot of sexual violence in this country and I think the V. chip and is on that a very good thing\nBut I think you saw it in the cabin not hearing an assumption that politicians can just grab any cultural movement and do what they want with it\nAnd the reality is we have a long\nTradition and the British and American legal tradition\nOf rights not just of the accuser but of the accused\nAnd there were people talking rhetorically around the Kavanaugh hearings like there's no such thing as a right of the accused and I think um you know moms and dads don't want that for their sons they don't sexual violence for their daughters of that they want a world where there's a lot more cautious deliberation that was that was happening in that media circus\nA very quick edited a senator in my case it says to justice ... with your God that's kind of internalizing every Christian in America and Jews as well I don't think kindness was on board and justice was certainly not present in that Senate proceed\nNo you're right I mean ... ... the big gap there where politics and politics for instance TV um happens like that for so many people who are the politically addicted class of washing\nThat is because I think and again why I wrote the book them of of upstream things that are happening where a digital revolution is undermining ... community the nuclear family is in statistical collapse that America\nDeep friendship has been cut in half in the last twenty seven years in America job to ration is getting shorter local worshipping communities are declining or becoming so large that their suburban commuter campuses all of that undermining of place and the ... relationship inevitably undermines our ability to think about our neighbor as hope people\nNot just partisans on the other side of the political while politics are important but if it's the center of your life something is fundamentally broken\nWe won't come back and talk more about them next week the new book by Senator Ben Sasse when I'm back in my voice is whole senator says thank you really factor dot com coming up America is a huge huge show\n\nOf hands you're saying and I'm running for state representative because I care about the education and I can't wrap creation and health and safety of our community fixing our problems will only happen when\nIn the state representative because I care about the education and I can't really kept creation and health and safety of our community fixing our problems will only happen when I was actually listen to the people they work for not to political parties ... ... that's why I always listen to you and remember that I work for you not protect our rights\nAnd make you she's waiting for him on hand you're saying and I'm working to earn your traffic and you're not paid more and I can understand\nTennis player in twenty

fifty billion dollars again this ... this year how long can keep that up\nWell and again right so we always read that so when you see the Democrats\nAre all worried you've seen it on your Facebook right right every Democrat thing about the level of the uh the deficit right now why did we have Republicans are going to have this deficit right in and of course the reason is that\nThe bulk up and it's not because they say it's because the tax cuts that go to the tax cuts because revenues are pretty high right four percent growth rate right it's the idea that we passed that spending you know the budget had lots of military stuff and then we had to put a bunch of crap and for Democrats because of the sixty votes rule yup\nYup yup yup yup you know but you're right\nSo how does this work I've said this before how does this work out you're putting an almost three quarters of a trillion on the credit card every year record tax collections right to your point correct ever in which the

Eighteen but if you're going to take the engine out of a plane why wouldn't you fly to right path to do maintenance if you're ever going to look at ... impossible to move\nAnd you're in a hurricane area why would you not move them first to write that\nI think it's a fair question you know the question that we have to ask a of the military or the only response I could I could muster right now is that that in itself is an expensive proposition right and you know it's always hard to predict\nUh how ... how heavy storms are going to be no one certainly thought it was going to hit\nAnd do the way it did a Michael was initially supposed to be a tropical storm for that area before the end all took a direct hit and so I think that's a fair question hopefully from this week and\nIdentify some key lessons learned um we can avoid making the same mistake in the future but again we need the appropriate you know the officials to testify before the house armed services committee to figure out exactly what's happening here because of course the air force is putting their spin on it it's hard to get an accurate picture of exactly what happened and who made the decision\nYou know I read that it would require ten million dollars to reopen the line\nAnd I thought to myself that is next to nothing compared to the strategic advantage this particular playing gives us over our near tear are near peer China I mean not it really is almost nothing if it had to go back and start producing these planes do you think we should\nWell by the ethical I've seen is that it would take two billion in five years to restart the line but it just a question of what timeframe or would have\nSome since you're making get the clients that have production um I think I I tend to disagree although more planes will be better and obviously he did he go back and look at that you'd have nine decision with\nA lot of regret but we really need to do is we look through the prism of this long journey great our competition with China and the capabilities China is developing its windows salary to be Twenty one production in order to get range back into the air force\nAnd therefore reallocate some of the balance from fighters to bombers that's really the challenge that it was ended by China and rising great powers and so we need to get that range ... ideally you could do a bit of both but you know resource constrained environment you have to make very difficult decisions like that\nRight now let's talk about what you wrote for real clear defense this week about but maybe it would you summarize what your article is and people can find it by Googling Mike Gallagher and real clear defense\nWell he was you know I'm Irish Catholic so I'm always walking around with guilt over things they did or didn't do and I felt guilty after our discussion and last week I did it feel like an answer your\nYou do and I felt guilty after our discussion last week I did it feel like an answer your question about where's the plan for three and a fifty five ships and so I went and I started writing my thoughts on paper and talking to a a bunch of people because as you pointed out a three hundred and fifty five shit ... was that they can get your defense\nCampaign promise that then candidate Trump and basically the vice president talk with you that state you know there's more to follow\nA well I don't think that ... right now the question is if the navy backtrack\nWe had a shoot out in force structure assessment that endorsed that three hundred and fifty five ship number now since then we've had a change in administration and the new defense strategy and in light of these changes it makes sense but maybe wants to review the composition of its future flee the problem however\nIs the way in which this happening back in March the navy told us that they were planning on conducting a new force structures that then\nThen they re announced a forthcoming new is that just last month do sometime and twenty Nineteen what we don't really know is what they've been doing in the in between his announcement or why the new study won't be out more than one year after the end yes so I guess you if I could summarize\nWhy are we commissioning a whole host of new studies when we have the three hundred and fifty five shit number that's been endorsed by the navy itself\nBy numerous out that if that meant and by the president himself as we know from the experience of the Reagan Administration\nThe windows to make change it ran thought they really in the first two years of it and then a straight shot and tasks that the bureaucracy starts doing anything it restores the status quo and so I see here we are missing a key windows here and I want the navy to tell us\nWhat's going to come from these new assessment because if he is definitely comes back that\nJust kidding we only need three hundred and thirty ships for whatever reason that it's on it\nDo you think the president and Israel where that he's being slow roll by the navy bureaucracy 'cause that's what I think is happening and I had Richard Spencer I'm On the head and MSNBC show show no nowhere to get your plan and honestly I I think the president thinks there's a plant up there for two hundred and fifty five ships and nobody tells them no it's not there\nI Know where the president is that is a busy man I got out to worry about he needs to expect\nThat when he gives a clear direction to its service secretary of you is is is checked I ... and the service sector is that that ... executed with laxity and so I don't think the President's Day you're having this discussion I think your interview with\nHopefully will serve as a wake up call for the White House but it's going to take that presidential level involvement pushing the navy pushing the department of defense to go as fast as possible because if you're actually will always invent ... and you can ... cubic rationale as an excuse for not building worship\nWell I Hope you are right I've just re tweeted out everybody ought to go and read my Gallagher's calm but maybe the nation needs now in real clear defense and congressman\nGood luck to you by this week this time tomorrow if we got to be talking about the browns and I honestly I don't know if they're in Rogers can make it to the halfway point of the season so we'll see about that but thank you congressman

that they should you should be trying to fire up\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics and look at the horrible things prompted said that's not the strategy if Democrats their strategy is almost entirely thing\nA lot of radicalizing single white college educated women that is the entire strategy for turnout if you're a Democrat and when he Eighteen and I think it reinforces everything David Brooks

have just taken the wind out of Democrats you do you think I'm On or something here\nWell yeah no I think the Kavanaugh effect is very\nUm that's a big deal to write um so how do you fire people up

really have Donald Trump the people who really despise and those Donald Trump and have the energy for some reason tend to be college educated single white women and so I think it's no surprise that that was the attack\nOr that sort of ended up being pushed that was the angle from the Kavanaugh going forward I really think I'm sure we can find congressional districts out there where that's not the case I'm sure we can find you know local races where\nYou know the idea will be to turn out African Americans against the Republican but for some reason when it comes to Donald Trump I eat\nThat

what is it that they're reacting against\nI actually don't understand the phenomena to be quite Frank with\nYou I mean why that's why I said I don't understand\nWhy the pushback because first of

when they pound on the doors at the Supreme Court um\nI call that a mob and I I actually they somehow use that as like almost like an existential threat I don't really understand it I don't think that's an indictment on it ... it isn't even on Bob on the streets with pitch for\nI I have one theory as to why which is when you mobs are interesting and if you've identified a mob and it hasn't been covered it uncovers an underlying biased in favor of covering only mobs that hurt Republicans not mobs that hurt Democrats what do you think of my theory\n[noise] yeah I mean I guess there is a ... and it's certainly some people say have an interest in\nA framing this perception that the right wing or violent and ... and the left are low test or civil yes civil rights act and I'm like I don't understand why to for some reason I don't think that's going to determine the election\nOr really which side is white but clearly some people are pushing that it and\nYeah and what it is it's

I feel like a sad thing that's going on is a lot of them really amazing mechanics that I Know are somewhere between fifty five and Seventy years old\nSo my my mechanic that I've used for years is sixty three years old\nAnd I'm so worried that there's not that next generation of mechanics that are getting trained to fill in those as it moves through our mind is that an accurate statement the fish should be worried about the next generation coming in\nYou're worried about an hour [laughter]\nI got to have some employees to do the stuff we do and and there's very very few are young people that are interested\nIn a you know I grew up in the euro in Europe on cars we're uh\nWe're we're just part of the scene you know everybody went down to Kevin do Pontiac in September and looked at the new Pontiac and you know that kind of things right and uh [noise] now of course Pontiac isn't even there anymore so [noise] but uh cars were a bigger part of our lives back then and now they're just a convenient\nYou know they just get you from point a to point B and nobody really cares about him and the young people don't don't want to know about him other than ...\nAnd again it it it pays a great a great hourly wage to be a mechanic you have pretty much job security yeah we need to get me to get better\nIn getting young folks and ...\nYou know I I was very sad to see a lot of the high schools close up their automotive programs and it just I don't know but it's starting to swing around the other way again and and hopefully er I don't know what probably won't catch up in my lifetime but\nBefore I get to remain here one last question for you what is the one maintenance thing that most people are not doing that you say if you did this we would save you a lot of grief later what is it\nJust there's there's two reasons to change or oil the first reason to change your oil filter a second reason is to have somebody\nThat knows what the cars supposed to be a about get a look at it because nobody ever looked underneath them and nobody ever looks under the hood anymore and there's things that go on in there that where\nThey have to be inspected and and ... before they cause catastrophic problem\nSo that's\nIn a nutshell that's the one thing\nYou change your oil people that's built telling your Bill Nelson automotive over on ... correct It's dry\nYour morning to edge remain a protest gotta G ... voice how're you doing sir not too bad how are you doing today not too bad so what is deeply voice do\nShe'd be voice is a medication company based out of Scottsdale, Arizona jak we've been in business for about twenty five years or providing a id voice in data solutions we have about what over twenty thousand plus ... customers around the country today\nAnd how did you get involved with this company ... this group of a business owner\nOr through other a member from light weights okay\nSo tell me about tell me about the with the age of cell phones and all this stuff how is voice communications and businesses changing right now\nWell actually it's changed quite a bit we're evolving more dependent on communications ah tell everything from cell phones to a\nTo a office a business systems what makes us unique is or anybody can provide dial to into a business but what separates us from the rest is we we do a collaboration of integrating the either an existing system or a new a new white system to current business and uh\nEverybody as I mentioned that does dial tone but the collaboration is the applications that's now available or ten years ago and you know avoid started everybody was yeah I Need a white phones use over the Internet\nNow it's getting more involved where they need those applications will be imbedded to their business to make it more successful\nMadden now one of the biggest problems that I find and telephone you set of business is companies who don't pick up their phone can you help with that yeah [laughter]\n\nYes ... and part of that service is typically a any provide they mentioned the and I and I stress is so much any but he can provide a dialogue so\nBut we're making unique is the the applications us now involves allows your mobile workforce to be to move to be more involved so if I call your desk one today it could all it's an awesome near your cell phone as well but the client that's calling your desk and doesn't know that they're calling your cell phone\nSo so as a guy who's been doing this for a while when you call up anybody maybe you're saving the client you just call up somebody who has a voice system mhm what is the number one sim that you see in people when they do and they set up their voice mail\nAnd their voice system what do you see as a ... kind of a mistake that you kinda go oh said they're doing that what do you what what does that moment not picking up the phone rang [laughter]\n\nReally it's you know it's his do invest all this money in the system but yet\nHalf of the half of the features and aren't being used because they're not being properly trained right and that's what makes us unique is we're able to really they dive into the the services of the business before we even talk about what are what are called system can do to\nIs the one that I Would say the second thing is people who have too long of a ... message on my gosh yes so I had a client that I work with because I Do consulting right and we're listening to the thing and if the owner of the business thing if you want this you want this if you want this you want and it goes on for like a minute right\nThen I said can we just so we changed it I said\nCan you just say that a human being will talk to you and the next few seconds\nThe key to say that a human being will talk to you and the next few seconds yet so [laughter] you know typically what you call those\nId our trees and more a more everyday business are getting more in tune to that but you know when you deliver voice system you either having empower the decline W permit you control that are the are or you give the the caller that unique phone number that just to do with this system that might that that idea\nHow do people get a hold of you if they want to review what they're doing with their voices\nOn my gosh it's great a very simple my email address is really a GPS Judy boys\nDot com also was great media today sir and this is again what you do something that's kind of a common part of the businesses that I think is under used and abused a little bit and if they use their wives or they might be able to put a few more dollars in their book\nNot just that but just cause it out we're able so far at least fifty percent off the top easily wow All right GPA a gp voice yes All right Jeremy nice meeting you and I think right when\nWe come back we're going to push on we're going to introduce you to more great small businesses that are members of the business association of\nShe's on that Alexander\nTo them

very good person I Know we're and she's a wonderful anchor but she's screwed up last week and she went on the Late Show with Stephen Kobe or last night to talk about it cut number two\nYou gotten a little trouble with the Twitter people recently because you use and wonder if your guests are called democratic protesters mob mob and you said we're not going to use the N word around here that you got a lot of\nFlak for that what ... what happened so uh we had not really time hill I Love having on either from the Daily Beast and he brought out the word mom and and at the time the mob mob had banned the talking points from the public and from all\nOf it on Capitol Hill in the wake of what had happened with with Dr Ford in ...\nWord again I I call and I call them out in less than like I don't want to be the word police and that was not my intention but I also believe in calling out talking points and to hear him bring that up I had just had to say something\nAnd honestly at the end of my day like I'm sure you're checking Twitter too and if I ever left and the right then I got my job\nNow Eric ... the alpha talking point is if I ever the left in the right I've done my\nJob that is like the architect I can say about how many times\nHave I said that how many times have others said that and you know what that's why\nYou know what cliches are usually true and talking points are often true and the mob talking point what is more true\nThan the fact is that the left has descended into mobs threatening violence that is so pathetic and so on American if we don't call that out shame on us that is not the American way in fact it is the antithesis of everything we've always stood for\nAnd you know what they're going to Stephen Colbert later\nThis book I'm not kidding my book Donald drain the swamp I Want it to topple his nasty sour anti Trump fake children's book who's voted this vote or whatever the reason I wrote this book Hugh ... is that the last\n... is always putting out things into the culture right here's here's a children's book that he wrote which is not a children's book it's nasty no kid would would look at it it is for adults to make fun of the president and to feel morally superior\nI wrote my book because I thought we don't have things like that\nOn the right for conservatives who want to celebrate what America is who believe Ronald Reagan was a great man I think that we need stuff like that and I I get\nVery upset because you just got a tweet from Jamie ... who is a you know kind of a never Trump or he was just on the show earlier and I thought you were coming up to talk about your book Donald brings Islam and Jamie kind of start down well that seems like a very special children's book for your three year old who is fed up with the permanent political class\nI just said the Jamie you and I am on your podcast Jamie because I think you would mix up because you know that other children's books have been used this way\nOh look this is always the case and might you know that I'm even though I'm political I'm not as political as as you and some others I'm mostly a cultural guy I'm In the culture like Steven cold there but conservatives\nDon't we don't really have a voice in the culture right\nStephen Colbert has a talk show tons of people like that have talk shows we don't have anybody effectively speaking who have talk shows like that I wrote this children's book because I think our side needs something that says this is our narrative this is what we think is happening we think he's a folk hero you want to call him a caveman\nGo ahead what he's our caveman and we're actually proud of some of this stuff he's getting done and why don't we why don't we talk about it I mean even though there's not going to have me on the show to talk about it\nBut I got to tell you this is the kind of thing this is the reason I wrote the book Donald brings the swamp is meant to be a cultural\nObject we have to get our side of the story out there and this is one of the ways we do it as much as I Love talk radio you and I have to own radio shows but there are other ways to get things out there and the fact that down at

Harry is former Pima County employee former imagine greater Tucson director\nMike homes and we talked about Mike in the past because as he was running for office in this\nSure and working for the county he basically on county time doing social media stuff to promote his election but nobody cared over there 'cause he's a Democrat running to get rid of evil Republicans good\nThen I guess Harry rams bottom I mean Mike homes goes over to work for you he was in charge a project manager on trying because they wanted to kind of get colossal cave back on its feet and they put an R. S. V. uh alright\nAn R. E. F. U. R. P. out their request for proposal for a company to manage it and then I think he went over to work for those guys after so he left the county I think to go work for those guys I don't know if he works there anymore but for some reason Mike Holmes former Pima County employee maybe they're going to have bring them back\nA imagine greater Tucson guy changes is online name to Harry rams bottom possibly because his private employer probably wouldn't appreciate you spend so much more time\nOn Facebook but who knows so when you see Harry rams bottom on those that to Harry for some reason he changed his his social media ... which I thought was bizarre now cute but foster\nBud foster former anchor with the great a guy actually and\nUm\nHe comes on because someone so uh he gets chided by someone else named Vicky about him getting on the case and this is the best one\n... ... this is his response to this lady Vicki Doug is allowed to say whatever he wants to send his right to do that it's my right no actually my duty\nAs a journalism journalists to question him on it by the way I thought it was a bit humorous\nSo now button foster has told you he is now declaring that the world that his duty as a journalist is the only question Doug Martin\n\nNow but by the widest as funny as it is a guy who basically seemingly regurgitate Pima County a ministry of defense of propaganda crap\nThe idea that now you're going to make a stand on a Doug Martin Facebook post that you're now quote a journalist\nIt's pretty funny and pathetic but do you need to retire buddy you're not doing your you are not doing this community any service anymore\nThe ... 'cause what's happening is there's there's there there there there is the idea that Doug I haven't seen anything from a very little let's say from but foster that he questions anything other than possibly alley Miller because he can't stand there Mr journalist\nA good amount of do to do this surgery that had that horrible case of the pit bull that came and attack the lady with the dog and then they just returned it to these people know warning no not then\nAnd then this young lady and her buddy or collecting money for her buddy with cancer or something she decided to bring her little dog
