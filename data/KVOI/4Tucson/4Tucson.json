look an awful lot of light there's similarities and that they have dark hair and they both have bluegrass that's where it stops\nWindow I Am so glad that we talked about ... plays an ambassador because\nI had heard on several occasions\nAnd and yeah there were some people it is interesting that no one is saying the noon mass it was an angel obviously she was an outlaw however was driven to be coming out and she\nDefinitely be married Ernest marks shared with roses that they would definitely be married but he never could make that leap and\nWouldn't grows dice the only thing he could promise just that she wouldn't be arrogant outcasts cemetery but he wasn't able to look up to that promise either she was indeed buried and outcasts in theory but I mean and that's where you found a lot of the soil deaths\nThey were not to be even buried with polite society they had a whole another area that they could be put in along with the people that um or Haines for various crimes or um you know just homeless people come here that no one knew their names okay that's where they were placed\nUm so you know what is it profession that was deemed necessary in a lot of ways fly on\nThe city because they needed their funds but you had other places where it just was acceptable at all no one was going to give me a break with that\nOne of the ladies that I write about in the book is Josephine Washburne was it for a while and in Nebraska and really saw how poorly these ready to retreat and they cause in Nebraska and if you were caught\nAs I say playing or trade some place other than the house that you had a license for you not only were assigned to a huge fee for that but you also were paraded on the back of a wagon with other ladies were found out\nAnd just so people could throw things that you and call you name and\nJudge he saw how these ladies were just treated so poorly and she was on a crusade to get homes um made for sporting women wanted to turn their lives around\nAnd had asked um politicians in Nebraska to please contribute to this home and she spent a lot of time trying to I'm a call attention to the societal problem\nAnd was unable to raise the funds in the end and ends up um I Believe are going to Colorado and going back into the trade going back into a profession but you had ladies like Josie Washburn is that this is tragic these ladies some of these don't want ... I don't want to be doing this for what they\nThey want to have a happy life they want to get married but they have had no opportunity in fact\nHe says I'm the men come here because they must have entertainment we're here because we must have bred wow they can get their entertainment anywhere we cannot get bread anywhere\nWe're hungry we're poor and we must have help interesting I appreciate it that there was somebody at that time period of the late Eighteen hundreds who was looking out for late in that profession\nEarlier you said that the houses the bill reviewed were tolerated because they collected taxes from them and they help pay for the police force and I'm sure the schools and everything else\nOne of the things that comes up quite a bit when you're talking to people about why other urban now why it was a woman and everything they indicate that while he was arrested at one time for operating a house you'll refute\nEnd it was true that he operated it it was because the operated however it was really because he did not get the license\nTo run this house and there were other houses in the town but then you need a license and for whatever reason why it would not get the license so it's sort of illustrate so yes how it's it's bad but at the same time we tolerated because it makes his money\nYeah isn't that an ... year you're bringing up the thing about wider being a I'm a pimp as it were right on boy talk about sexism women could get a license to do that here or purpose a man in the trade he couldn't get a license\nI thought that that was very interesting when you think about lighter that's not one of the first things that leads to your mind that he was a head of a brothel at one time\nYou much to break right here Chris and when we come back I Want to talk to you about one of the women there was not necessarily involved with why on earth but one of the women involved wonder why herbs rooms not holiday you got it um\n\n\nBy this was to go to I Would like to talk to you about something special when was the last time you show your ... to that special relatable dear friends because you don't know what to give them well was total to the rescue a subscription to chronicle ... newspaper\nIs the perfect gift everyone is wanting to be a cowboy or town girl with Romney cooler the Old West comprise the reprint articles from\nDee Dee numbers newspapers they all have the experience of the old one year's subscription to chronicle you'll ... like giving gifts and we even include a gift card the best part is it's only\nThirty dollars for you you can order your gift subscription by visiting our website\nChronicle ... mark calling us in the eighties dog Jay\nThings and why don't you give yourself a gift to\nGentler excellent urine treat with the history of the American west better known as the Old West and I'm sure you want to learn more about this time of America's history well we have the perfect place for you to do that\nIt's our own line blog gold cowboy cowboy dot com when you visited cowboy cowboy dot com you'll be able to your audio stories viewed videos and read the latest news about the Old West today that's cowboy cowboy dot com\nIt'll knock your boot salt\nIn\nWill come back to chronicle of the Old West weekly edition mom you're hosting the do the lives\nWe've been talking to Chris Coons about her new book wicked women move towards ... and ... from the Old West\nAnd we touched on point of view but there is one that just intrigues me that we have not touched on and that is dark holidays girl friend big nose to eat now the first question I have to ask\nI've seen pictures of her she doesn't have a big nose\nWell I guess that that you think she does not a big nose gallery I um do you do okay\nI Do think that she has a big nose but I I Believe that part of that um you know they always had a name if you were in that particular ... trade you always had a name that would\nAttract fires let's say um before I talk a little bit about big nose Kate let me just give me an example of that you had a squirrel tooth Alan ... who worked out of dodge city\nIn her claim to fame was not only the fact that she was a prostitute but you had to have something to bring people in the work she has a lot of prairie dog people people called them squirrels but they were really prairie dogs she had a pet\nAnd really put up quite a fuss if anybody teased her prairie dogs or made the mad and um she was prone to taking out a gun and shooting people for doing while but I mean you have people that you have ladies who were in that profession had a\nSpecific um thing that would bring people in that with school to Dallas and she had the prairie dog\nEleanor ...

fire to the airwaves it's don't Larry Elder show\nThe Mark I'm feeling if Larry Elder of the pain free released factors dot coms studios and as I said with your calls at eight eighty nine seven one saying what you're calling about\nYour reaction to everybody in the media seems that way to meet somebody on the left trying to blame President Trump for what this is crazy guy did as if this guy did it because of what President Trump says because of course everything that goes wrong is President Trump's falls and everything goes right like our economy\nIs because of President Obama and if you didn't know that just that President Obama he he mentions it all the time off credit calling me that's because of what I started okay which by the way explains why they were so against now justice Kevin Oh you wouldn't have mattered if the president had nominated the left is like the pope\nWhatever the president is for their against remember they were against whoever the nominee was they didn't even know the name it didn't matter they have their signs ready\nThat is their basic platform this November and it doesn't matter if the president has done a great job none of it matters the hazing and they hate him with a passion you know I thought we reached the uh the top with George W. Bush in their hatred duck this one is being surpass\nThis bumbling fool could never had beaten their candidate and they will never acknowledged the great things that he has done\nSo these acts will not long be about this evil did you notice just like it wasn't long about basically for that didn't last it wasn't about her it was about the Democrats regaining power so she she's like an actress now that's what she's going to probably be in history\nSo it'll just be always about punishing President Trump and all Republicans because we're evil and they are not you get it which is even more reason why you have to vote tell me what you think as I said it eight eight eight one eight eight eight nine seven ones sage\nIt has also been amazing to see the Democrats in the meeting in action you know the Democrats they're going to use these acts to their parties in a vantage\nBut for the media to be so blatant in their advocacy is all new in the age of Trump they haven't been on partial to their views for many years now a lot of us know that that's not a secret but they used to pretend here's the difference that they were non biased no more\nDoes out in the open with their advocacy and you can even see it in their questions what's his name Jim Acosta from CNN hardly hiding his disdain for the president I'm telling you you could see that in his questions\nThey're out to get the president and make no mistake about it and the media has an enormous power to influence the debate in our elections and the president's right to call them out on this so the president has rightly call that the press for who they are and the press cannot deal with it in their righteous indignation\nAnd just today I was watching getting ready for the show they always Shepard Smith on Fox saying that Trump's phrase lock her up and the chance to encourage in that vein and CNN sucks are the kinds of things that ... that people like the suspect on so Mary was Trump is responsible for it\nBut those of us on the right blame people with ... bad values were bad acts not those who share their political views\nBut of course that we're on the right blamed Bernie Sanders for his supporter remembered that who shot a seriously injured Congressman Steve ... and the other cars and he would have wiped the matter if he could but\nPresident Trump is responsible no matter what he says even when he tries to unify us he's no good\nCNN is hopeless by the way I I Try to watch what's the other one MSNBC it's it's not easy watching each ... I I live in another planet and there's a real argument to be made for not letting Hillary Clinton be above the law yeah CNN is hopeless that's my point and President Trump's right\nAnd a lot of supporters are people who are here with me when I've done other shows\nThey said how could you say you know because here's my position if Hillary and bill will agree never don't bother us again and leave the scene which is I Know it was impossible it's not gonna happen then I might agree not to indict or if I had any power to say about oh you could imagine the calls I got mark how could she be above the law and they had a great point\nThat's not inciting people to write or to physically harm someone that is a legitimate political ask a see\nWhat it's actually like to see on the right and for the Democrats and the left and now the media that is unacceptable\nSo they're almost all on the left and we're fortunate to have someone like President Trump call them out we've had so many we presidents in the past and it's absolutely refreshing\nTo see someone taking back to them\nEven if the media the left the Democrats can't take President Trump is not responsible for the craziness in our country tell me what you think as I said eight eight nine seven one ... and let's try to get a call or two in Houston, Texas let's go to Mark Mark\nYou're on with mark high margin\nHigh marks a the mark what your upbringing up about a media is absolutely true they don't want to record the fact that the a psycho any prior to the threatened to blow up Florida like oh I don't know the other two\nSo what Trump responsible for though no\nHe happens to be just you know the the course of the ... now and another distinction is the fact that you know Trump literally to not say let's go blow them up right to work you said a few times during his um or\nNot is candidacy while he was trying for a couple of times he said oh yeah go ahead on the face or something like that that was that but he hasn't said anything like that where\nThe law whether the actual political people or the news\nUh they've all actually said going out and confront them and and and and and run them out of the stores all this other stuff so again that's the part of the contrast in different\nYeah like Maxine Waters right get in their face were you ever see them you know don't let them leave especially if you know during the cabinet ... this is what they do when they do it's OK mark don't you get that\nOf course it's the the the ultimate double standard that everyone recognizes that accept them well do they recognize it but they're not going to say it and even most of the hard core I Would say you know intelligent Democrats because that's the other thing too\nBut they're not going to say than even most of the hard core\nI Would say you know intelligent Democrats because that's the other thing to what they're doing and the people that are acting out these acts of violence most of these are actually borderline psychotic that react that way if the Trump arrangements so now they could argue that that's what causes it not to that makes them psychotic\nYeah it does you know that's what they would say no question about it\nBreaking ATF news just recently the U.S department of education announced that\nActing on a complaint filed by alliance defending freedom against the Decatur, Georgia city

or guns on around up through the or the cow camps\nI think it was a jolly good night who would fire a man for swearing\nInteresting yeah well he said and he didn't allow cards and guns and he said that you guys are here to work you're not here to fight and he said I'm eliminating anything that can start a fight\nWell I Would imagine that with a bunch of guys together again as you talked about earlier the job is a very tense job has a lot of dangerous to the job in my gun fights of the Old West CD\nI said the gunfight throw the result of one of three things women booze and gambling at the house you don't have the women on the trail drive but if you've got cards and if you've got liquor you got\nTwo out of three and that next year through guns into the formula you really got an issue out again quite often in town the guy setting there does not have a gun on him up in his room and so he will get mad jump up go up to his room come back down and yeah\nThat's right you know the Old West was nothing more than a bunch of guys trying to make a living\nNo more than today and things that went on on the job or a whole lot like things are going on the job today\nPeople just haven't

W. W. dot who do we're ... we're dot com or cold sunny a dog Drake\nWon't\nCome back to ... weekly EDITION on your own decoder lives were in the midst of a phone conversation with John boy you're about books in spring actually\nHe eventually took off with a a singer dancer at the birdcage theater\nShe was known as blonde Molly but she was also known as Molly Williams Molly Edwards and Mali Bradshaw we have documents with these different names on them so we really don't know what for correct name is\nLike Mali was as I said a peroxide blonde singer at the birdcage\nShe had her rights and to start with a man by the name of Mike Bradshaw which is where she acquired one of those names we don't know if they were married or not though\nIn those days when a man like Bradshaw showed up in town a with a lovely lady on his arm he was called a map and they see a a man who found customers for his lady oh people would also say men like Bradshaw work quote blacksmith thing for their ladies\nInteresting [laughter] shortly after Frank Leslie set\nHis eyes upon blonde Molly\nMike Bradshaw was found in one of the back alleys of tombstone with his head bashed in there was nothing to point fingers at Leslie for this but of course his name came up quite often\nBut there was never anyone um arrested or tried for the murder of Mike Bradshaw a Leslie and blonde Molly then set off into the Swiss tell them that\nLuxury had acquired partial ownership of a a ranch in the town's called the magnolia branch and so he and blonde Molly headed off to supposedly live a life of bliss in the mountains\nAnd they stayed on the ranch they probably would have done quite well but they\nOften visited town frequenting the drinking establishment from one end of tombstone to the other\nAnd Mali could hold her own with Leslie when it came to liquor and they often argue well well into the night as they go so they're copious amounts of liquor\nNow in July or early July of Eighteen eighty nine Leslie and Mali were in town and they were celebrating independence day\nUh their level refer to the celebration continued for about a week before they finally should stop their horses and hit it out of town and they were drunk and they left\nAnd they were still pretty started by the time they got back to the ranch which was about July chance they were still arguing from the time they left him some 'til the time they arrived at the ranch\nBy the next day Lesley who is still quite ... went to his neighbors ranch and threatened to kill him told him to go get a God I'm going to kill you will appear in the ranchers name was William rent rentals\nHad seen Leslie in this condition before just told him to go away\nSo laissez Les laughed and staggered home in the meantime Molly who also still was quite an eighth grade it was under the tender care of Iran chant by the name of change Neal\nNeal really which had seen as Boston this condition before and he usually kind of stayed out of the way when Leslie got struck\nBuddies felt sorry for for Mali and so we kind of sat with her it's allegedly showed up again\nWell Leslie immediately thought there was some hanky panky going on between James Neal and his lovely blonde Molly\nAnd with out much recourse at all he turned around and shot in Mali and she died almost instantly whoa you didn't turned us down on his ranch and James Neal and shot him in the leg\nAnd he was able to escape and ran out into the desert and lovely thought he was just going to die in the desert\nBut let's see did go the next day back to the rental branch to see if his ranch and it ended up there\nHe had ended up there but Reynolds refused to tell Leslie that the lesson England Away assuming no one was a lie that knew what had happened at the ranch and he eventually started back in tombstone he was found on the road\nHe told his story see as being the heart and a husband who have lost his lovely blonde Molly because his ranch chance that shot his wife and then he had shot James Neal in self defense\nAs he's telling a story to the sheriff James nailed who is still quite injured walks into the room or down the entire story\nSo this time once again Leslie was put on trial at this time on unfortunately or fortunately depending on how you regard Leslie he was convicted up the murder of blonde Molly\nHe was forty eight years old when he answered you know for instance it's an interesting story of his arrival it you know he was with ten other prisoners and they were let out of coaches county jail by um sheriff down slaughter by the time all of the prisoners arrived in Yuma\nThey were drunk a sky box\n[laughter] there you could make any assumption you want but it's it's my opinion that probably someone and they could have very well have been Frank Leslie convinced John slaughtered to make a nice one last stop for sending them into the depths of humor for instance\nYou know ... ... what's the use of the human junior seven ... seven\nYears that was a life sentence and he served seven years\nWhich number one was not unusual for the sentences back them to be cut down considerably I mean it was a regular thing but at the same time\nI've talked to people who sued the free once we got some special privileges during the prison I've also talk to other people should know he was just a regular prisoner but\nHe did serve in the pharmacy departments therefore you got special privileges as far as that was concerned he was able to keep ... large mush dish which most people had to shave their heads\nAs well as the seasons and what is your opinion do drink once we get special privileges\nI think he got special privileges because he was one of the few educated prisoners over there which is why he was serving in the I think one of the reasons he got that job in in the pharmacy he was able to read and write very few of the prisoners could at that time\nSo he was probably a value prisoner to them because of his of his education so yes I think he got so special privileges because of his background more than anything else\nNo one for English we go to other human too to prison what happened to him and\nUh well let's go back to walk and he is still interests he gave one of his infamous interviews this\nWell interest on the Cape wind up the infamous interviews this time to a reporter for the San Francisco chronicle [noise] this is where he claimed he was born in Virginia's one and only time he said he was he the Virginia before\nBut this article appeared in the article at that time when it appeared a woman living in San Francisco a divorced by the name of bell stole read this story and became quite enamored with our Frank Leslie what's in his eye for the ladies\nHelped him out so they'll stole began sending him food thing while he was still in prison\nAnd of course their friendship blossom doubts washing the waiting for when he was really\nWhen he was released it is released in November of Eighteen Ninety six and on the Kemper first at that same year he stole ordinary in Stockton we don't know what happened about ... just kind of walked out of his life at some point we had no record of whatever happened to her\nWe do know that Leslie was probably in Mexico in early Eighteen Ninety seven so she didn't last long at all eat supposedly went down to Mexico with geologists and there is a story that while he was down there he killed three now and\nAgain there's a lot of groups the story is even one story that says what do they lack of oldfield but", "year": "2018", "show_name": "4Tucson", "city": "Cortaro", "day":

[noise]\nIt's my pleasure Dan Dan what can we look for in health care in the event that these guys by they started talking about Democrats take control of the house in November\nOh my God well they're trying to put in Medicare and that's scary because they have a hundred and sixty three progressive Democrats said that's what they want to do and that would be a disaster it may sound good but it'd be a total disaster\nI understand I think it was a Bloomberg estimated the cost of this is something like thirty two trillion dollars over the course of the decade\nAnd so you could make it clear that was trillions now right but thirty trillion national debt in into oblivion a national that would be so big it'll bankrupt I say the horrible horrible\nBut Dan Obamacare solve all our problems remember when Joe Biden said yeah it's a big deal I I thought it solve all our problems\nWell I'll tell you what Obama said you can keep your dog if you want to and that was ally this one here\nYou can't keep Medicare plan replaces Medicare itself with Medicare for all the different kind of policy\nNot only that is twenty two million Americans people who have Medicare Advantage plans which are run by private companies and he would eliminate all of them that would be an increase for seniors this would hurt seniors especially and that's why a Mac is against Medicare for all\nWhen when you want to get a left wing persons John tightened Dan Weber ask him or her who's going to pay for it who's going to pay for it who's going to pay for thirty two trillion dollars over ten years yeah\nThat's right and in addition to that you're gonna have rationing\nPeople say they have great players everyone should this number and my twenty two week that's how long it takes for a major surgery in Canada after they've examined you may take months been examined\nAnd now they say this major surgery twenty two weeks average weight\nYou need this major surgery twenty two weeks average wait a lot of those people over the border and they get their operations in America\nDan Weber is my guest founder and CEO of a Mac ... association of mature American citizens\nNow Dana probably mangled this guy's name but I Know the father of the Canadian health care system in Canada is named Claude Gaston way or something like that and he won that sounded it or in Quebec and all the other provinces ultimately adopted it he still alive start as far as I Know in his nineties and he's come out and recently said\nThat I was wrong we should have had more competition I should not have outlawed private care and he pronounce the healthcare system or Internet in Canada pretty much a failure\nYeah and well we just got to look at all socialize looking at a cute but they don't even have\nA aspirin available and the local drugstores looking Venezuela they socialized medical care thinking doctors running too much and now the poor people literally are dying and it's a shame socialism doesn't work because the socialism the individual means nothing\nYeah I'm often asked people this question whenever I have a discussion about this Canada Great Britain they have a socialized medicine Canada has the what I think Obama wants to have which a single payer are in Great Britain has something very similar but when you take polls the majority of citizens in both Canada and Great Britain seem to like their system why is that\nBecause if they get a snapple they can go into a local clinic than they were in a long time but that go to a local clinic gotta get taken care of and it won't be any money out of their pocket",

chief name Kelvin Cochran I've been telling you about him for the last few days because he was represented by alliance defending freedom to read you some\nOf this article by David French National Review quote in a groundbreaking when for religious liberty former fire chief Calvin Cochran has reached at one point two million dollar settlement with the city of Atlanta\nYesterday my friend and former colleagues at the alliance defending freedom announced that former Atlanta fire chief Cochran had received a one point two million dollar settlement in a case he brought effort to city fired him for writing and distributing to a few select city employees a self published book\nThat articulated in entirely orthodox Christian view of section marriage\nIs Cochrane was a pioneer born in Confederate Memorial Hospital in Shreveport, Louisiana happened to be black grew up to be coming out of the first black firefighters in his hometown fire department ultimately became the first black fire chief of tree port\nObama appointed him to run the fireman is racial division at the federal the division of FEMA after he left the Atlanta fire department which he went to after report the fire department struggle the Atlanta mayor asking to come back eternity department around\nNow on his own time\nHe sought received permission from the city's ethics officer to self publish a Christian book the book is called who told you that you are naked\nIt argues in part that sets outside of marriage between a man and a woman country too will of God and of course takes a position that opposite sex marriage also contrary to the will of God\nKids to read the book to a few select colleagues mainly people who already discussed the Christian faith with him he also shared it with the mayor three members of the city council no fire department employee ever complain to him about the book one employee did show a few pages of the book that dealt with sexuality to an openly gay Atlanta city council member\nThat led to Cochran being suspended without pay that led to the mayor and city firing him without providing them due process\nShe was represented by alliance defending freedom the organization that I've been raising money for for the past two and a half weeks I'm asking you one more time to please\nHelp out chief Cochran prevailed if his firing could happen in the Bible belt of south that could happen anywhere isn't to alliance defending freedom counsel David Cortland\nI Do I see more challenges in the future and I think the reason for that is and it's quite ironic it happened in the chiefs case and then all of these other cases\nYou know we hear so much today about tolerance and inclusive be a it was the exact reason that the city of Atlanta gave for firing the chief and it's quite ironic just say that we're being inclusive intolerant by firing someone\nWho disagrees with artificial views that that's what actually happened\nNow alliance defending freedom represented a chief Cochran\nFor free to him but the cost of litigating something like this especially cases like jak Philips the owner of the map to peace caked truck whereas his case when all we have to the Supreme Court\nIt can be very expensive so please help this consortium of lawyers who were defending people whose religious rights are under attack\nPlease call eight six six four three five two to five to that age six six four three five two to five to or go to Larry Elder dot com and click on the ATF banner again whatever you can match right now will be doubled\nEight six six four three five two to five to go to Larry Elder dot com and you can go to my website also Larry Elder dot com or and you'll see the article called a Christian man receives justice to read all about Calvin
