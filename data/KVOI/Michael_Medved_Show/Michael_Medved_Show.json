resources into any more news intelligent talk [noise]\nMichael mad vigil was this is Michael ...\nA Twenty one minutes after the hour on Michael ... show and with the entire country reeling still over the events in Pittsburgh on Saturday\nA one person who had a very direct connection to those events in a person his daughter\nAnd a was Paul ... who is a good friend who's been on the show many times before he is a professor of history and to the growth City College where I'm privileged to participate every year and they're wonderful vision and values\nA conference and poll is the author of many many books he's the author of a great new book that I could recommend more strongly called the pope and a president about the amazing friendship between Ronald Reagan and John Paul the second\nAnd a whole writes in that book from the perspective his perspective as a devout Catholic and a very active lake Catholic so how is it that a Catholic Boy like you get simply hated in this terrible shooting at the heart of Pittsburgh Jewish community pool\n[laughter] that's a good question Michael and actually that does have something to do with it my my daughter who's who's safe\nWho's safe you praise praise God she and five other girls all about the age of sixteen sixteen to fourteen Thirteen something like that they were going to end opus days center and opus day is the kind of very popular\nUm lake group lay orderly ministry and the Catholic Church and the meats just really pretty much right across the street from from the synagogue tree of life synagogue\nI drop them off there are many Saturdays usually about one Saturday a month and and and it's ironic Michael the last time that we went by\nWe took a very close look at the synagogue and and I was reading it there's Hebrew written on and I can't read Hebrew but also English and and they said dad so what what does that me and I said well I I don't know real well but I think it's probably a pretty conservative orthodox\nA synagogue right and and I and I remember my thing you know the these folks are friends right we we aligned with ah with these folks so close on so many things\nCulture um you know politically I'm even faith wise even though you know we're Catholics and they're Orthodox Jews and I remember saying these are our friends these are good allies\nThat they are and never and I thought this would have happened\nI should I should make clear on H. I. M. congregation tree of life congregation\nOr if it was a conservative synagogue and conservative Judaism is sort of the middle branch it has more traditional than reform\nBut it is not orthodox and what's fascinating about this is that the evil killer a and we we talked about this before she came in at nine forty five which is right when services we're supposed to start\nAnd run of the characteristics particularly of orthodox and conservative Judaism is no one comes on time\nAs if I had the services are long\nAnd people don't show up on time and they they kind of wander in and then probably had at or their\nOwn speed and catch up it's just the tour reading where you you actually read from the ... is a and an ... a portion of the ... people are reading around the world that's really the center of the service where everybody would hopefully be caught up or come before that starts\nAt and yeah and my daughters they they pulled off about nine fifty five\nAnd ... their thing was going to start at ten and our friend Suzie family friend the mother of one of the girls was driving and they pulled right across from the synagogue right across the street and she was going to drop them off they they were going to walk over to the house\nAnd then soon as he had this kind of got feel that I should just maybe pulled down the street a little bit more and walk them in today\nSo she pulled them or a little bit more an extra minute or two and and at that point cars started flying in police cars they the cars returns sideways they basically barricaded the road police jumped out with heavy artillery they're using their vehicles as barricades shields\nAnd soon as you said to my my my two daughters there and and their friends she said you girls we better not get out you better get down\nSo they they locked the car doors and they they dock below the windows and we about ten sixteen my wife and I just happened to be in Pittsburgh we were driving now liberty avenue and my wife got attacks from my daughter said pray for us\nI Will call you later and my wife said\nRecalling now it is I Want to see ... see yeah so you say you\nYeah what do you see\nYeah so so you ... and and basically you describe in your your piece in American Spectator a report from Pittsburgh it's posted up at our website at Michael midday dot com along with information about Paul's wonderful book a pope and a president\nOr ... you described in there how they waited out they duct in in the van they were writing in and then finally they were able to drive a little bit out of harm's way\nI Do you know what amazes me about this poll is that it's it's very much fits in with a I've gone back and looked at every deadly attack on a Jewish target in the United states\nSince Nineteen Seventy seven or so for the last forty years\nAnd but bless Italy there aren't that many of them and stuff\nBut most of the people who died in those attacks\nWere Christian people who are caught in the crossfire or or ... even in the crossfire because mostly no one was firing back they were Christian people who were in some cases just wrongly targeted there was a a a beautiful guy very devout a Christian and the son of a minister\nWho in April thirteenth two thousand fourteen he was killed by an anti Semite was attacking the Jewish community center he just brought his grandson there\nAnd the grandson was killed two for us singing audition they were doing a program that the Jewish community center\nYeah well that's precisely what were we were worried about was them getting caught in the crossfire also to Michael I immediately thought of it because it at first we didn't know who was doing the shooting right and so I thought okay what's that date\nOctober twenty seven twenty eight in the day before on friday and my Middle East politics classic grow City College we had just finished teaching the Yom Kippur war of Nineteen Seventy three\nWhich it ended I think almost forty five years ago that day on Saturday\nSo I I immediately thought to myself I Wonder if this is a a radical she hottest attack and unfortunately it wasn't that had nothing to do with that but that this was just some loan wacko ... a Nazi apparently a who and I and the worst thing about something like this is\nI don't know what you could even do to stop it other than better surveillance possibly I don't know who would do the survey and like I Would say this people listening\nIf you know somebody on Facebook or on social media who was posting vile hateful things like this was bragging about his weapons collection\nAnd and who's talking about maybe going down to the to the whatever synagogue to to beat up some juice you get on the phone and just call the police\nBoxer his ads say the hell deliver a knockout punch the Washington wanted fast running as a conservative populists ... the Democrat yeah\nSo so yeah that's a race that I Would think they are and see ought to be able to easily win for Mike Kelley Adam ...

those things that what is what is very clear about about Andrew Jackson and many people neglect about him because he um he did enjoy ah drinking ah never drank to access that we know of\nHe um he

the United states eleven people\nMurdered in a synagogue during what we call it ...\nA British which is where in a jail boy circumcised and baby naming ceremony takes place at that point this is a conservative synagogue not politically conservative synagogue a religiously\nConservative synagogue in Judaism in American Judaism anyway there's several branches of Judaism I'm an Orthodox Jew which means deeply observing keeps habit don't drive on Saturday keep kosher there's conservative Judaism which is\nSort of less orthodox people thrive on Saturday sort of a form of habit or they don't keep kosher but they have certain respect for it to our laws in any case\nThis concern in Senegal didn't have much security and an anti Semitic white supremacist\nI keep myself walk into the synagogue armed with an arcane and proceeded to shoot up the Brits me like he was screaming at the time all Jews must die so obviously saw fellow\nSo why does this matter of personal I I think that we need to get something off the table right away when an anti Semitic attack occurs\nYou generally don't need to bother blaming particular politicians anti Semitism is literally as old as the Jewish people literally as old as the Jewish people in other politicians and pass will call for anti Semitism their politicians in the past will actively called for the murder of Jews\nI'm not saying a lot of those on today's American thing there are a lot of politicians on Native American team will hobnobbing with anti Semite who make common cause with anti Semitic we'll get to all of that in just a second but

at you and that's not say that America's violent country for ... it is not America is the safest country in world history purchase\nAmerica's incredible place for June but because the Jewish population is so small and because so many Jews know each other and because the Jews sort of consider themselves and extended family just as Christians consider themselves and extending religious

cook closely bound unit Jewish identity isn't really a choice it's a reality\nMajority has obscured this for a lot of trees but the fact is that all Jews are in the same boat when it comes to anti

more than any of the people like what is so far on the show\nAnd not only that and I'm seeing an argument being made well get to this and the second gun control argument is being made by folks on the left in response to all of this you know my response to solve it says I'm going to start carrying a gun to school\nAnd that's my response to all of that matter sponsors Jews should be arm people in synagogues should be arm and you know why because white nationalist are not going to give up their gun evil people don't give up there done\nThat means I Want more people at my shall I\nWell people don't give up there done that means I Want more people at my actual arm I Walk or security guards at my shall we get to all of that in just a second but first let's talk about life insurance insurance is certainly not the most enjoyable thing to talk about\nMost people don't like to think about what happens after and God Forbid something happens to you but actually having life insurance is a really good feeling it's nice to know that if anything were to happen your family won't have started off on me policy geniuses the easy way to get life insurance on line and just two minutes\nYou can compare quote from the top insurers to find the best policy for you and when you compare quote you save money does indeed that simple policy genius has helped them for a million people shop for insurance place over twenty billion dollars\nIn coverage they don't just do like insurance they also do disability insurance and auto insurance home insurance\nIf you care about it they can cover itself if you've been avoiding getting like insurance because it's difficult for confusing if policy genius of ... just got a policy genius dot com air quotes applying minutes into the whole thing on your phone right now policy geniuses indeed the easy way to compare and by life insurance there is no reason for you to put it off actually responsible for you\nNot to have life insurance policy genius makes everything really easy because again into managing air quotes from the top insurers and find the best policy for you go save money policy genius dot com and easy way to compare and by life insurance\nThat as I say members of the Democratic left and decided that when an anti Semitic shooting takes place in Pittsburgh that has nothing to do with President Trump is obviously President Trump small and they've continued with the narrative Franklin ... who is a columnist over the last sort of full column basically on this idea that members of the Jewish community who support Republicans are responsible\nHe tweeted the organized shutting up Sheldon Adelson jerk question on other Jewish enablers as a matter of protecting the security of the community\nSo we got this right being mean to Jared Kushner is now one prevents shootings and senator mhm Sheldon Adelson one of the great supporters of Israel in the United states and one of the great supporters of Jewish programs like birth right in the United states that is somehow going to make you safer in the United states\nSo if you're ... or ... Keith Ellison or if you like a bunch of Democrats who openly hobnobbing with windows are sewer and that next Tuesday for but if you Shaun the most pro Israel president than American history\nAnd any support that President even walk and that means rhetoric and you are somehow making the Jewish community safer\nAnd then you get ... like Adam Schiff and Democrat from California he says President Trump set the tone of hatred this is an easy argument always again this is just an extension of the argument made last week about the bombing attempt against democratic members\nThat rhetoric is is what causes violence\nI don't remember any of these conversations happening on mainstream television after Bernie Sanders supporters shot up a bunch of Congress people on the congressional baseball field I don't remember these conversations happening for longer than two days it was out of the headlines immediately now we're going to get nothing but this for months because this was always let let's be clear about something this was always going to be the Democratic narrative\nAnd it almost has nothing to President Trump that President Trump plays right into the heart of it because you can't shut his face but\nThis has almost nothing to do with President Trump is this happening under President Bush you get the same crap if this happened under President Romney you get the same crap would not matter people on the left practice adjusted I was responsible for the bombing attempt last week they're both on the left side to suggest that I ... I Believe what happened in Pittsburgh\nAnd you can you can separate out all these issues you can condemn bad rhetoric when you see it on any side without doing this routine is part of an active job\nWhere Adam Schiff that suddenly the great arbiter of decent rhetoric in the middle of a terrible political time\nNo one such the tone more than president United States and the tone that he was one of division often when a patron or sometimes one of incitement to violence against journalists are and there's no escaping or collective responsibility but there's a gaping the tone as he sets for the country\nOkay it's just it again I agree that President from France in a better at home for the country to blame President Trump's telling for everything that happens or to Ford is insane and the tone of the country was already off the rails by twenty twelve it's been years since we've had a decent political conversation in this country is being very very long time\nBut let's not pretend that the world started spinning when president from suddenly entered the political spent ... scene and let's stop pretending that the Democratic party has clean hands when it comes to association with anti Semite\nAnd one of the one of the more scoreless attacks on on Trump and built on the right is ingestion and if you're a critical of George Soros who are somehow anti Semitic\nSo there's been a big narrative put out my thoughts on the left that George Soros who has a lead democratic donor that if you criticize George Soros by suggesting that he gives a lot of money to causes that are in the area and this means that you are somehow anti Semitic\nNow you can attach or source in an anti Semitic way you can suggest that just part of a Jewish ball attempting to run the country but it seems to me that the criticism of George Soros on the right on the mainstream right has been\nNo more market and the criticism Sheldon Adelson unless\nIt seems to me that the criticism of George Soros is very much attention to the criticism of the Koch brothers on the left and yet the idea now is that we're going to spend every critique of drug settled into this is all about George Soros is Jewish heritage which is nonsense and but again in and it's pushing this\nEver going to say you're blaming them are you blaming them and blaming them for putting a guest on the air and not you know correcting him in real time and I so far as I go twelve hours later drink about unemployment honestly at this level after we have soccer cause for the lower end groove and I've known all these people in the past right on TV every night on blaming\nThe management of Fox and the investors inside what he's talking about here or there was a ... in this\nCat who said that the caravan had something to do with the Soros ... runs State Department or something like that\nAnd now that anti Semitic no in any idiotic but it's not anti Semitic and George Soros doesn't run the state department but the idea that going after George Soros as in various force in American politics and somehow inherently aunt medic is ridiculous and the same way as ingesting the going after Sheldon Adelson is inherently anti Semitic when he's a major donor\nTo the Republican Party but I'm a craft are looking for an hour and if they found a convenient narrative again I'm not going to pretend I'm not going to pretend that you left as clean hands when it comes to fighting anti Semitism and they certainly not in the women's march weeded out their sympathy for all of that and it's when it's made some things that we are turning our grief to action with\nWith at Jewish Action than a clear message that the anti Semitic ... attacks can never happen again if you're not in DC tuning around three PM to our Facebook page watching trade last me the women's march includes two had women ... associate openly and defend was Derek on\nI'm not interested in your health ladies\nHave you with your usa denounced the anti Semitism in your own met they not interested solidarity event in New York City Al Sharpton showed up at the solidarity of it\nIs there anything more partisan and ... and that's Marsha Blackburn unity event left this came and they

competition with some major players right Office Depot staples office max I think those those guys we're all here than\nI'm well Office Depot in office max had physical storefronts at that time and within two to three years staples came into town opening up three stories in one shot\nAnd um when suddenly enough all three stories or that since closed up and running still around [laughter]\nOkay so all three staples are gone about Office Depot in office max\nI'm most a lot of their storefront they'd closed down also but yeah they'll say they have like one or two stuff floating around\nYeah there might be a they might have some presence in town but nothing like it was back then so basically\nFive or six of your major big box competitors went out of business in the office supply business in Tucson but Gerry of road runner office supply is still going I Want to know what your secret is Jerry how did you do that you didn't have the depth of pockets you\nWhen you bring in and new employee and I think that you do you do deliveries ride every day you've got deliveries going on is\nSo you've got at first that was you and probably your wife are out there doing every single you know doing everything including the deliveries but now you've got employees to do that when you bring when you bring a new employee in and that that a gallery guys job is going to be alive and you know delivering product to your customers to your local customers\nWhat do you spend time with him personally training them how how does that happen\nOh absolutely um in fact we just hired a new driver a couple of weeks ago and the first week of um his training is actually need doing that deliveries along with him and showing him the process and\nUm main things that I actually try\nAnd ... and ingrained in his head is speed at the deliveries that's not the important part important part is that when you walk in you walk in with a smile and you um\nJust have a good persona about you and you do that delivering the right way not this any way putting it where they want it making sure they're happy and then going you're merry way to the next delivery\nAnd I'm\nJust basically ... that I'm One of my important tended to or it might drivers and do any of my employees\nYeah I think you know it's a funny thing because you get\nIf you're if you're a delivery time person right you you you probably got more stops to making a date and maybe you want to make and so you get in a hurry you get your your vehicle your driving you know you're trying to to be efficient and get it get it done but then when you show up at a customer location you kinda gotta change modes\nAnd all of a sudden it becomes not about you but about that customer\n... exactly\nYeah exactly and you know what driving around town wants to get there and that in a van that's ... that sounds almost like care bears so that's got to put you in a pretty good move by the time you get there and do the owner of the business that's Gerry Gerber road runner office supply spends the first week\nForty hours however many hours that is with this driver making sure that the road runner office supply culture is understood and ingrained in this new employee and a ... you know during that time obviously you guys connect\nA as a as people and and at the beginning of a good\nUh employee employer relationship is formed Jerry road runner office supply dot com brand new ... website I recommend that everybody take a look at it today and I end the call road runner the next time you need some help in that area Jerry thanks for

[noise]\nAll righty we're back we spent ah ten Fifteen riveting minutes with sharing\nA road runner office supply or have a nice visit with Jerry what a nice guy he is and what a great company that must be to work for local office supply company they do deliveries next day on everything no minimum order and if you get a office furniture\nFrom Jerry will come out and assemble it at no charge and this this man is a\nHe is a master at a furniture assembly as he should be after twenty five or Thirty years of doing it so it's it's a work of art a lot of times people like to put on one of Beethoven symphony is Jerry assembles or furniture\nAnd almost make an event out of it there at the office so that's an option for you had a chance to talk with Jerry about something called\nConscious capitalism\nWhich is a an international group founded by John Mackey the founder of whole foods market John founded that company back in Nineteen eighty he and his hippy girlfriend he was a hippie to make no bones about it socially progressive opened up there in Austin or a a\nStore a a an organic you know precursor that was called safer way\nAnd he got involved in the Austin co-op community lots of a\nFood co-op going on around there all of them of course turn a socialist leanings and John being an idealist really thought that this was going to work out great\nAnd then but he became disillusioned because they couldn't make any money they did a lot of bickering between each other and instead of really focusing on how to deliver great products to their customers they they've targeted or other less socially conscious members of the business community and spin\nUh other less socially conscious members of the business community and spend all their energy going after them will after a couple of years the ... the producer a Tom here's wanting to know if it's safe for\nSafer way has something to do is safe way it's hard to get anything passed ... and I think he's probably right safer way anyway they did this for a couple of years got disillusioned with it but they had a lot of believers\nIn what you know what they were trying to do and so they got some investors and they opened the first whole foods market there in Austin in Nineteen eighty\nAnd within a couple of years it had become and mentally popular they were doing a ton of business that community love them the concept was starting to be a starting to get some notoriety beyond just to Austin in Texas and then in Nineteen I Believe was Nineteen eighty\nThree Austin went through the worst flooding in its history and a ruined that whole foods market it flooded the market destroyed all of their product destroyed all of their merchandising\nAnd much of their building they didn't have insurance to cover this they lost everything in that flood\nAnd what happened they were I mean there was bankrupt as you can get and what happened was\nTheir customers showed up as soon as the wander reached seeded with mumps and buckets their bankers showed up with the same thing and their suppliers did the same thing they got the place cleaned up got to put back together the bankers extended them a line of credit and put them back in business\nAnd that was what John Mackey calls his first awakening in business and understanding the importance of\nA stakeholder community and that's when he ... the first time he realized\nThat stakeholders include many more people other than just stock holders their stockholders are certainly important\nAnd he was the stock holder and uh and as a business partner you have at the time\nThey were stockholders but there were many others who were stakeholders and without those stakeholders without the buy in from those stakeholders whole foods market or as we know it would never have come into existence ... would not have been bought out by Amazon if that hadn't happened\nBut uh so anyway I thought that was an amazing story and really demonstrated the importance the significance of a long term perspective on your business and one of the big big problems in corporate America the day especially publicly traded corporate America is that CEOs\nAnd board board members are under so much pressure to deliver\nWhat happens is when you're in the machine all of your blood rushes cheer for and it goes into kind of the fight or flight loads you know and\nI'm as you step back now you know the blood is oxygen aided\nNutrient rich flushing toxins and the brain cells all this awesome name blood where to go which is where you're paying ...\nOkay so you know go in this thing and it's so cold the blood rushes to your core 'cause it's kind of trying to save your life then all these nutrients go with it and and all those activities happening at\nYour inflammation yeah\nOkay so I think we have somebody who's a somebody wants to call him do have dom okay we got a lady named Judith Judith are you there Hi this is Judith Blair I

Kobe Bryant Steph Curry San ...

who's muscles and joins undergo incredible\nDrama on a regular basis and in one of the ways one of the most effective ways they felt you ever found to deal with this used through crime therapy\nOr talk about the inflammation a little bit I Know a lot of people have inflammation in you know in a lot of different ways\nYeah myself I'm myself I'm also a lot of inflammation so um yeah so again it reduces inflammation\nAnd um I mean I just couldn't live without this um you know it keeps me from walking like a Ninety year old you know yeah it's amazing\nYeah that's great well I think that uh

temperature drops in all of a sudden everything kind of all the energy is redirected the core of your body kind of in survival mode um that your metabolism is also elevated at that point to the to the extent that\nYou burn up five to eight hundred calories related to just a short session\nRight that right I I personally have lost thirty pounds already\nIn there and you've done that in in what period of time\nUm I Would say and about three months\nThree months now and you haven't been hitting the gym two times a day he just didn't do\nMy injuries are so bad that I I I I'm In pain if I work

Center for innovation it's another great program which is really like a life cycle I'm you know a incubator right they take from like idea but they'll carry through investment they'll carry through launched through those different types of things um\nBut the thing that doesn't exist in in living that life is\nThat preceded that very early stage that is hyper focused on\nSilicon Valley best practice of hyper growth tech enabled companies right that doesn't exist right now um and you know giving entrepreneurs that range of flavors\nUm I think is one of the best things that we can do for an ecosystem it's not about um you know land grab it it's not about ownership and what we should seize synergy using these I should see lifestyle entrepreneurs launch and go you know what I got an idea that's way bigger than this thing and working on and I would love to see them come to founder Institute and I would love a founder it's to graduate\nTo find some traction and then go engage uneasy CI and go how can I take this further how can I run with this beyond just is fourteen we program I mean if we're building ecosystem right\nAll of these things come together to build what we really want out of Tucson and that is for founder at any level\nOr an entrepreneur somebody that's ready to innovate at any level can enter in and find all the hand off not just the specific programs right one and done aren't going to work for us anymore right we need a specific programs that intertwined and then actually bring you know the success that that they're looking for in an ecosystem looks for\nI Love it I I'm I received that back to the push back a little bit and I completely agree and so you said a couple of things\nA land grab and synergy [laughter] um and we worked on an ecosystem related project called un summit su San in late September and that was to do those very things\nAh with the the the you got to work on it and we weren't coming with an organizational had just a a and the fact that 'cause he's a lot of people who are these guys and guy up so we were wearing the Tucson brand so we weren't coming in for land grab try to say that our organization we're going to put this has been on to support\nOur organization we came as to ... to find\nEcosystem center jeez I'm a to figure out how we could work together to build an environment where these entrepreneurial adventures along all parts of the spectrum you could grow and thrive\nAre so thank you for segue into that [laughter] um ... what are what are some things that you are hearing founders struggling with\nIn Tucson um what are some\nUh if someone is looking to Tucson to start start up yeah what are some things that make us a great place to do that right now and what are some areas where right now we're still weak on\nTo that are holding us back from getting where we want to be\nAbsolutely yeah so let me start with the the positives and there's there's numerous positive that the you know and I'm not just saying it because I'm born and raised here I there are some really great things that occur here I'm but I'm so on the positive side first and foremost culture\nMil this is

into the creativity show where we are having what I'm calling founder day on the creative city show we are talking to founders and about founders about a starting tech companies integrity companies\nIn Tucson I'm joined in the studio or on my right or by Luis ... from in house\nAnd on my left a meal translate from segment\nLike the rain I and a a meal I had a a a brief chance to explain his company well we'll get back to you again you can go more in depth but uh just to keep things fair and equal or we're going to jump or we're going to start this segment with 'em all the weeds first things for\nA coming down to the studio and uh tell me about your company and how you got to I'm starting it and finding it here in white Tucson way back then\nWe'll get a ... um so yeah I'm In a house is a a data in coal marketing platform for mortgage lenders and realtors we technically help or lenders be able to build a pipeline of borrowers through their realtor partners\nUm and we decided to launch in Tucson because this is sort of um where my career in real estate began I I'm through college I did a lot of Web development in ... in um marketing design work for realtors\nFound a niche market there for whatever reason and I learned about what they need 'em and then ended up watching a business with our partner with with my business partners\nAre we actually won free office space I'm with the competition in town and that prompted us to stay here Dr Neko working and we it was six months of free space but we ended up spending you know three years there now so um yeah\nWow six months to three years and years and uh you know or just for the sake of time 'cause this could be a whole interview on its own debt but Luis in a meal actually and I were all talking at an event recently about how um there's a lot of McGuire entrepreneur is that come out of the hill who don't stay\nUm you know once they graduate college and that in terms of telling the stories and storytelling well the successes in Tucson not only did you you know you went through McGuire you came out of it\nYou know your six months and now it's been three years that have been started in Tucson that's a story we're\nFailing and congratulations yeah thanks yeah incredible yeah a lot of people just leave to California or to the next you know next to big city but yeah and I mean there's many good reasons for that and we're not criticizing personal and business decisions but we want to see those entrepreneurs like yourself stay in the city\nYou know even through the first few years of sending a company and gift he's on a shot so that's kind of our theme today so it's cool that you've you've lived that out so yeah yeah super\nA and a meal or or you have um a little bit of a different story um are you are um\nA bit of a different story um are you are a part of the Canadian invasion\nYeah that's very true I've just recently survived my second summer summer am in the desert now so I'm I'm I'm sure glad the or the seasons are changing a little I'm not used to this yet I think it might take you know ten years [laughter] so we heard a little bit\nAbout your company if you had to explain it in one sense or on this side of the break or what would that be and then how did you get to Tucson why are you still hear\nSo I'll say this fake things are bad like fake medicine is bad it hurts a lot of people killed but a million people a year and we can solve that problem\nLike he's done that yeah [laughter] yeah they're basically your technology allows for better verification\nYeah and it's it's really cool you know just with a modern smartphones you just uh you know walk up to Madison bottle that has our technology and uh and just tap it kind of like a path to pay a which your credit card and it'll tell you for sure if it's a genuine uh Madison and if it's ever been tampered with her opened or anything like that so\nI'm not such a big deal right now you know when you go to your local pharmacy here in Tucson that's not a huge concern for you but there's many parts of the world where it's a it's a daily struggle\nRight yeah I mean there's business concerns or social good concerns you you cover\nYou cover the gamut I mean we could even be talking about wind that is sold as a certain age and then it shipped as not at that age and your technology helps to make sure that you're getting what you were yeah I mean there's so many applications we we probably can't go into too many of them but\nWe we shouldn't will will be here for a long time yeah\nYeah yeah we um we're doing our best to have a a rocky an episode here with the ... but each of your companies should have really their own episodes we might have to do that\nOr at some point but um how are the want to make sure we covered this before we had to our second to last break here uh how has that experience been in Tucson and the the experienced the last\nTwo to three years 'cause that like the range we're talking about what's been the highs and lows the challenge is\nNot so much about the entrepreneurial journey as much as the ecosystem so as a founder of a tech company in Tucson or what has gone well and and and what could be could be better and it started with Luis\nOkay yeah I mean so I think the ecosystem here um it's really helpful well I I think two sons or the fact that it's it's a cheap to live here I'm In is not costly to to run a business here I think that helped us out a lot that was really awesome for us\nUm I think there's a lot of resources out there you know with coming from from the ... program that was a great resource to us you were tapped into straight to the investor groups we were you know connected with a network of McGuire graduates across the globe so that was really useful for us or being able to whenever we had a question or\nYou know of an issue to tap into that network that was incredibly useful um [noise] uh you know we also got to participate in pitch competitions there's quite a bit of those um and so given the opportunity to win prizes to to get recognition and the community that was something that Tucson and and the McGuire program did a very well for us\nUm I think uh some of the things that maybe need improvement is the connectivity between 'em all the other programs in Tucson there's quite a bit more than just McGuire program um and we came from the ... program so we had sort of you know we were there um but we wish we could have been connected with\nYour felt more um ah connected with like ... sort of Tucson or or the other programs that were here which are at the time when we launch we felt separate it or not quite meshed um if that makes any sense um\nWow yeah you know what's interesting is um like I said in the beginning of the show a it's almost an accident that the the three of the four of us are airing on the last couple of segments and then you guys\nUm it was almost by accident that we got here on the same day and we didn't compare notes that everything you mentioned Aaron mentioned as well yeah ... which is\nShows the challenge um but from the runway to find the funding you know you can you can live longer on started funding here and then you could maybe and of course Silicon Valley or either side you know either coast and the connectivity um is a is a huge issue um that's super interesting has an improved since you started\nI think so I think yeah definitely I mean being just involved in it takes the entrepreneur to push to you know we can't expect sure someone else to build the ecosystem for us we have to participate in it and so I think the moment that much him and I started doing that um\nWe've noticed maybe what needed to change and we participate in that and I think since our inception two years ago where I guess for years now um I've definitely seen great improvements in that um there's momentum that's growing now we see a lot of new groups coming up and um you know exciting times\nFor sure so awesome yeah yeah I'm a meal or same same question or what's been what's been a great pro and what's been a challenging con\nAs communities and a new look at successful ecosystems there's risk takers that's not just the entrepreneur that's also the private sector and venture capital and and all that so that's what I'm hearing a from you guys thank you for coming down in the studio um and\nSharing your advice for what you mean I Do this community keep on any way that we can report you um we will I think you guys so much they make you Tucson you've been

I remember in the way that there were a lot of damage\nAnd contributed to so many dead are also a heat for repair of tighter security or there may have been security epicenter going or not really sure there is security from synagogues across a Pittsburgh and across the country or what do we need armed guards that are really a place of religious him a\nFaith I I mean ... just a state of war or a constant state of readiness to do a repair or those that would kill the Senate and the rivers are setting but God I mean what are we done here or what I mean what message here you know I mean really serious like if\nYou know ... somebody could have come in there with a with a smaller town or maybe a similar amount of harm but no there there there's really no reason to do to make a forty seven or some all kinds of attack weapons assault weapons\nThat are really weapons of war there is no reason that that individual citizen should actually be owning those I mean we had a ban on them they've already banned for many years for a decade and a one of the public ... took control of both houses of Congress they\nCouldn't wouldn't pass that band and we really need to move in that direction many progressive states have outlawed that Massachusetts Connecticut and California stand out as as an example and also the the you know the huge clips I haven't heard anything about\nKind of clips he was using in this case but\nYou know I'm betting it was something that carry forty rounds of ammunition and so all of that nature and so you know there's no reason to have a clip of that style I mean that these weapons of war ... weapons that soldiers use it's not that not simply ordinary people I'd be walking around with\nIn order to have a situation now to I'm not the president has said that he would not canceled his rally and then proceeded to continue to campaign it would have seemed to be appropriate in light of a terrible death goal or to just cancel any political event that he did not do that\nAnd of course to blame the lack of security on really where the victims ah ... it's just it's just amazing I I don't know where do we go from here and by the way how does this affect the midterms Jeff Rogers\nFor too many charter schools in Arizona accountable\nHe has no merit oversight on charter schools were millions of dollars have been taken out of the classrooms are placed into the salaries of a charter school CEOs\nWorkers to get on the makers will be a painkiller oxycontin\nThat uses advertising so high the life and death risk averse powerful drug\nMore broad adventures of people's lawyer he's running for a second four year term as your lawyer ensure attorney general for your vote now for November ... deals where your trust in your faith in him and your vote I urge you to learn from our world events were attorney general of Arizona there's a message paid for by mark more easy\n... years and I was born in Nogales, Arizona and grew up\nOn the Indian reservations my roots run deep in this district I can no longer turn a blind eye to the fact that the district has some of the worst educational test scores and graduation rates in the country it is a disgrace that district veterans do not receive much needed healthcare or that the border Israel with drugs and human trafficking\nAfter sixteen years ... has no solutions can previous conditions and raise the quality of life of his constituents home and get this money not from the people of Arizona\nFrom special interest groups in Washington and New York city\nWho he works for not you tend not me he does not have the values of our community he had to pay forty eight thousand dollars of are harder and tax dollars to settle harassment lawsuit rumors of drunkenness on the job and these are not the values that we want to represent our district\nMy name is Nick Pearson and I approve this message please vote for me on November six paid for by Pearson for Congress\nFormer Congressman Ron barber during the summertime [laughter] he's got warm by congressman thanks so much\nFor being with us we're really appreciated it was a terribly sad very in America let them dead everybody's trying to guard in Pittsburgh ... president of United States like mom got some good with guns and maybe we should have more security and it just makes me feel sick\nUm I I Believe the rhetoric of the president has laid the foundation for all kinds of terrible things is maybe one of them are what's your thinking their congressmen\nWould I think your comments well taken a you know the president's ah as a family help themselves you know I just watched a clip from his rally and uh\nWhen you thought when he said to his audience is going to tone it down they booed him and so he liked it up again in anything capable of toning it down for about a second\nAnd he has I Believe by his rhetoric a fight is hateful statements as divisive statements\nAnd the things that he senators rally you know punch him in the face I'll pay your bills all I'm Out you know and then the ... the meat demonizing statements he made about people of color and other groups I mean it's just well it'll say he's not the person we want is president the setting a bad over the country\nAnd in that environment people do things or feel encouraged\nAnd in that environment people do things or feel encouraged or permitted or given\nPermission to do things the horrible thing that happened today now the shooter in the Pentagon claims that he didn't like Trump and Trump is certainly telling everybody about that but but the environment we're talking about is one that's created\nFor the first time really by the president United States you know one of the things that I feel is really important for people to think about it is\nWe've always had hate groups we've always had neo Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members all the other people who pedaled that fateful a doctors and they used in the shadows so we've kind of kept them there but this is the first time in my lifetime that I can remember\nThey have a feeling like they were supporting the president of United States the guy down in Florida with all the bombs his vehicle is plastered with\nFolks from a stickers and and and you know targets over the faces of Democrats so you know he has to take the president has to take a lot of his belief\nOr dream or whatever and proper to cancel rally in light of this terrible news is very large number of Jews in one place or\nA ... in in our history or a horrible thing is you know my wife was diversion how'd you benefit from a dog she would have been killed because she was a Jew that's the only reason they die I die because we were Jews think about that just think about that yeah and drive and absolutely\nAnd that's that's just it's just that that's not who we are as Americans you know that's that's something that happens or in another dark place like happened in the in the third Reich when the Jews were terrorized hauled off and killed you know and and these people are Holocaust deniers for the most part\nUh and um we know that that happened and it continues to happen in fact what we've seen over the last three or four years um and it certainly has increased since the president was elected is an increase and hate crimes um be they miner or major like ... today\nAnd I think you know you have to look at the data to see that you've had a spike in this since he became president\nWhen I ask you this will have an effect on them in terms of right around the corner version or congressman or every vote counts you lost more very narrow margin or I've been there myself losing my boss went on a road on\nWho I Am not on I ... or the other one [laughter] and an artist you till you die at that went on it and it never goes away [laughter] true but\nYou know I and I'm enjoying a retirement with my family and my grandkids and also you know it's not all bad\nBut I you know I certainly I Would like to have one but I you know I well here's what I think has to happen\nOn November six we have to have a massive turnout of people who were absolutely disgusted with what's going on because the only way to send a message to people who are supporting the president is old party\nIs to let a whole bunch of them get defeated at the polls I mean I haven't been in Congress than I Am sure you saw it in the state legislature a lot of people just live for one election to the other but they soon as they when they were planning on winning the next time and sometimes this allows people to compromise their values as their\nPrinciples in order to stay in office and that is happening in a huge way in the ... are under this president if you go against him and Europe public and\nYou're going to get treated to death or and or you're going to have someone running a primary against you and\nI get that some people think you know as horrible as he is he's getting get their agenda that but their agenda is not necessarily a very kind and and humanitarian agenda either separating kids of the border acts in a decrease for the rich\nOn and on repealing the health care plan for everybody these are not good policies but these are policies that some in his party one and so I guess they hang in there with him but mostly I think they're afraid\nTo take him on\n... on another front to go some very close races here would approve of recruits in front of our congressmen or congresswoman cinema going against Congress more mature always going to be very close race I think just the mayor percentage point one way or another so McGovern out is going to determine who's going to be the next US Senator for the state of Arizona\nAnd there are some of the question ... going to say anything I and I believe is now a ... to get elected anything I mean it does not make a difference and more I mean it really doesn't do anything for ... or ... minutes you'll say it that I mean it's just she's a classic example\nOf a out of out of a politician who is acts like a wind vein\nWhen the wind blows you east you go east and west you go west I mean it's just the way she works and she has been doing this for the very beginning people say oh she's changed not really\nI ran against for twenty twelve and one I read it gets for twenty fourteen and lost its during that time and I actually back to the primary for the special election in early twenties well her position was pretty far to the right you know when she ran against Jesse Kelly for the nomination\nShe said I'm all I'm a I'm exactly like Jesse Kelly I'm a Tea Party protests that that was what she said in early twenties twelve and his not really different however she has been very artful at avoiding the media\nHad avoiding constituents no town halls no small group meetings only closed door you know media not allow kinds of meetings\nAnd it's going on right now as she avoids the press and or other kind of community uh opportunities [noise] so yeah it's been a long time I mean people are saying oh she's changed her\nShe was a moderate and now she's a Trump or she was never really a moderate she was she has to be very basis and it's like oh she was

think it's important and yes I think everybody should definitely vote because this will help to determine the direction for the country for the next two years but then we have another presidential

series of very very close elections if you look at the the Trump Clinton election state after state after state was incredibly close\nUh most of those states that were incredibly close President Trump won Hillary also won some states that were amazingly close New Hampshire Nevada\nThat she won I'm at the point is we have close elections\nAnd that's exciting and there's a reason everybody should vote but you have full confidence that if you go out and vote your vote is going to be counted and it's going to be counted fairly and it's not going to be basically invalidated by all sorts of phony votes\nWell there's a new book that says you got to be concerned and the book is called fraud\nHow the left plans to steal the next election and you might just sort of throw this on the pile and say well this is nothing but actually it's a book by Eric eggers who is research director for the government accountability Institute\nAnd he's worked with Peter Schweitzer has been a frequent guest on this show on the Clinton Cash or extortion and secret empires which blew the lid off a different kind of corruption right now\nFraud is about vote fraud one of the most ... basic forms of fraud imaginable I Eric thanks very much for joining us and congratulations from the book\nHey thanks so much Michael it's great to be here\nOkay first of all we seen this in the New York times in the Washington Post time and time again there is no evidence that voter fraud has ever ever occurred\nCan you or I help people with a a little bits of evidence about some recent voter fraud that really made a difference\nWell absolutely and I think it's important to point out Michael cause you touched on this earlier about uh the idea of you know people have should that concerned with their vote count\nA real concern is that their vote will be I think invalidated the true weight of it won't count because of illegal votes being hats and what you hear from the left is it voter fraud is just mentioned incredibly rare\nI certainly not have their scale to swing elections but that's because they defined voter fraud in the narrowest possible under inclusive curves are they defy it only as an intentional acts of impersonation\nBuying the legal voter are on behalf of illegal voter right but in fact I think most people would say well anything that makes my vote not should\nThat voter fraud or in the reality is that happens all the time uh and you have to look no further than the tactics being employed to get illegal voters onto the voting will just in Texas this week there was a story\nAbout the Texas Democratic party sending out a voter registration or with the boxes that yes I'm a citizen check\nTo non citizen voters\nOr their blow in voter rolls all over the country there's actually two hundred and forty eight\nCounties in this country that have more registered voters\nThan citizens of illegal voting age ah it's been quite like that that nearly three million people are registered voter in more than one state that gee I where I work as part of the research\nWe did a national study and what we found Twenty one hundred is is a double voting in the state of Florida alone and Michael you remember that nearly four times the margin of victory of a presidential election this century\nSo clearly it's happening and it's happening in the scale of the largest elections you noted a the ... election critics in how close that was\nA there was a very real problem enough one of the ...\nOkay do you um it it can you point to any specific elections where you do feel that evidence exists that the the result was tipped by fraudulent voting for instance I Know a lot of people look at the Al Franken or a Norm Coleman election back in the in two thousand and eight\nThat that's exactly right there were I think that the election it'd be unsettled by around three hundred vote and it wasn't until a couple of years later unfortunately with discovered more than a thousand go by spelling\nAnd people that shouldn't have been voting so that's a that's a very prominent example and by the way\nAl Franken went on to become the the the vote in the Senate so people ask what the true cost of voter fraud I Would say well look you're a writer and insurance premiums because\nOff the voter fraud I Would say well look you're a writer insurance premiums because I'll forget it says it became the vote that lock in Obamacare are in New Hampshire in ... in New Hampshire has a very weird policy about voting have what's called the intent to reside law\nSo and I write about this in the book that Democrats said New Hampshire bill Gardner even admit this is a massive problem he's actually a champion of try to eradicate voter fraud in New Hampshire the senator from New Hampshire Kelly ... she ended up losing by one vote\nIn twenty sixteen well they had six thousand people register to vote on the same day and New Hampshire and they have these buses that come in from Massachusetts a neighboring state six thousand people voted but then didn't actually register a car or take the follow up steps to suggest their actual New Hampshire resident\nSo those are a couple of recent example but um you know but but some of the other thing that happened I think\nThat document example you got the mayor's races you guys share three the sheriff rate in Florida that uh it's basically been proven to that they've had felons that had voted illegally but because the election basically been certified\nOr that the judge the rule that well we have to give these selling due process though that's not enough evidence brought in holiday though it happened\nA nationally\nOkay would would you say there's a certain amount of voter fraud in every state every election\nI I Would um because it really get down to the below in the voter rolls I mean and this is something we experience I live in Florida\nI've been having numerous interactions with the elections officials here and elsewhere because the reality is biased to let people vote right I mean no one wants to suppress illegal voter but\nBecause of that it's created a system of vulnerabilities that I think are actively exploited by bad actors so I mean the the Texas Democrat mailing the the voter registration form is one example but\nYou know you got groups like acorn ... and their whole job is to go out and Raul stop at many voters as possible regardless of the legality of those voters right you've got\nVoted I I Know one ... one of the things you're\nOne of the things that people seem to be a interested in on the left as the idea that if you're a college student you can register both in your college and uh where where you live and then you vote twice now that's illegal but that happens a lot doesn't\nAbsolutely I mean there are nearly three million people registered to vote in more than one state in the country or the Supreme Court sided use that are that the twenty four million voter registration in this country are completely wrong so that's one in a way\nAbsolutely uh some cities are issue in this bill I uh I mean something even lie to vote with a gym membership right or credit card and have your picture I Know you're not like you have to have on the goodness driver's license ...\nAny day it seems to me that if we if we talk to start talking to people about getting IDs\nIt it's such a handicap for somebody not to have an ID because you can't cash a check and you can't I mean all kinds of stuff you can do\nSo if you're actually helping people by giving them IDs at the same time that you're requiring ideas for voting doesn't that help precisely the victims groups that uh we're supposed to be protecting\nIt does except for when it enables I think um they're like he's like Chicago and San Francisco the municipal id up but then the problem is is that I think it creates a little bit of confusion because there you've got a lot of illegal immigrants would go to get his life and\nThen they are actually allowed to vote with those that eating certain local elections\nOh I I say yeah a lot of them are there are there are so many there's so many problems that are raised

there some of them so very hateful it's unlikely at two weeks before a very very tight election that all of a sudden people are going to come together maybe after the election\nParticularly particularly if Republicans can actually hold on and maintain a slender my majority in the house of representatives because of all this is going to lose some seats in the house they're forty Republicans who retired this year and some of those seats are going to be lost\nBut honestly it looks more and more like if you go out and vote\nWherever you happen to live it's so important\nBecause it just a handful of votes can make a difference in each congressional district let's go to your calls in a two Keith in San Francisco case here on the Michael ...\nHey Michael great star to your show I've been struck by people commenting why is Beto O'Rourke willing to move so far left in a state like Texas and drug supposing that fact with his\nPhenomenal fundraising haul of thirty two or thirty six million dollars in small thirty aviation yeah largely\nSo what I think is happening as he watches Cory Booker a fall out of the race rather quickly and and I in my view was Warren\nUm effectively disqualified herself last week probably in terms of the public relations although I think he's going to run for president he's going to lose the race and the Senate and he will be running for president and will probably be a pretty strong a candidate given his I don't agree with you\nBut I think he could be very charismatic and you could extend that magic to the country in the early primaries\nOkay there are two reasons I think you might be wrong I I watched a bay toe performing and ... is a performance is sort of a performance art as they say\nWhen he was doing a town hall in or near El Paso which is where he's from and you know very friendly crowd and very friendly moderator Dana Bash from CNN [noise]\nAnd uh she she asked him very directly about running for president and he said no if he gets elected senator he'll serve all six years of senator now of course he can throw that away but he said it's so definitively\nThat it leads me to believe that\nNo he he didn't rule out running ever but he I think he ruled out\nPretty well running in two thousand and twenty said that if he loses the race is going to want to spend more time with his family of course they all say that um [noise] and some and then it might even be true okay the the other reason that I think he wouldn't be so solid for the race\nWas he was pushed and pushed\nOn the fact that he had said before the race even began that as a member of the house of representatives he thought there was enough evidence of obstruction of justice inclusion that he could vote to impeach Trump now\nAnd he was asked about that as a U.S senator and he didn't back away from it he is for impeachment he he believes even before the Mueller investigation has wrapped up even before it's reported anything\nAnd yes they've indicted some people and they've uncovered some stuff and I I I think the Mueller investigation needs to finish and maybe it'll take some time to finish it needs to fish but doesn't think so he agrees with a lot of people on the far right the ... just forget about the investigation let's impeach him anyway\nAnd I don't think that's a popular position and I don't think it sets them up well for a future presidential run or anything of the time hey I appreciate your call\nUm [noise] I I'm a\nI Will get back to this and to David Leonhardt piece what if the Republicans when everything will

Republicans are good at things\nNow what what's really happening here is that the Democratic math is often Democrats are garbage and everything basically when President Trump is the second thing in the news that has a very good thing for Republicans when he was the first thing in the news it's a problem so when Democrats spend weeks\nDemonstrating they don't care about due process and that they will railroaded by simply for political reasons\nVery good for Republicans when the lead headline is the winning twenty twenty contender for the Democrats setting herself on fire over a DNA sample that's really good for Republicans when the lead headline is Democrats approaching Ted Cruz in a restaurant and screaming at him and his wife very good for Republicans the best friend up Republicans right now\nIs the insanity of the Democrats and you are seeing that full scale in the polls also obviously you're seeing it back to the very good economy on the Republicans the margin by which voters press Republicans over Democrats on the economy has never been larger in the history of the polling results like ARPA Seventeen in this poll which is amazing also\nI don't want to give no credit to President Trump President Trump has done a couple of very good things number one he has taken proper economic measures that have really benefited the average American and number two the presidents of the United states does make it feel like he has a change actor\nAnd usually in midterm elections there is an attempt to vote for change right now what the polls show is that Republicans are actually seen as a party of change well being the party in power it's really unusual usually the party out of power it's you know the party of change because Trump is so out of left field and so outrageous and so chaotic\nThe benefit of that is that he feels like a change agent even though he is the guy who's sitting in the state\nThat has very good for Republicans here is what the latest polls show according to Wall Street journal voter interest in the mid term elections has searched for records within both parties helping to drive up President Trump's approval rating while maintaining the Democrats lead as a party most preferred to leave Congress according to a new Wall Street journal NBC News news poll\nFindings point to an energized widespread\nBuffet by dynamics that brings great uncertainty to the outcome of an election just two weeks away and what the polls kind of show is that everything is narrowing nearly two thirds of registered voters Troy high level of interest in the election that has the highest ever recorded in a midterm election since the journal NBC poll began asking the question in two thousand six\nNow the reason for that is because largely and the Democrats\nThe Democrats were always going to be energized to vote against President Trump but now Republicans are are really mobilized vote against the Democrats I Know that my interest in voting\n[laughter]\n\n\nTrying to save your office and not ... made all these are actual vetoes [laughter]\n\n\nThere you are so I Can't imagine why Republicans are responding the way that they are except for Democrats again the theme of today show Democrats terrible at everything coming up when I say the\nDemocratic Party seems a little bit out of touch and maybe they don't have their feet on

and protect these days are general cause you have Cortez [laughter]\n\nKnow when we talk about at the central threat to the last time we had a really major existential threat to the country was around World War two so she knows nothing about history there was an entire Cold War that existed for several decades after World War two it turns out that until we been here before and we have a blueprint and doing this before right when we bomb the German\nAnd don't don't stop her she's rolling does none of these things are new ideas what we had was next to central Britain the context of a war we had a direct threat to the central part with another nation this time it was not Germany an accident or supposedly made the United states as an enemy as an enemy\nHistory lessons with Alexandra ... some of my favorite history lesson at a direct exit central threat with another nation this time it was not Germany and access\nNot act bodies right okay you mean the axis powers oh that's what you mean\nAnd what we did was we chose to mobilize our entire economy industrialized our entire economy we put hundreds of thousands if not millions of people to work in defending our shores and defending the country we have to do the same thing in order to get us to a hundred percent renewable energy and that's just the ... so we need to draft every male military age have them living berets for four years ship them overseas\n... women in the factories and rationing the butter don't see how that's going to go around why don't we take them seriously I just don't understand speaking of not taking them seriously\nA very serious issue right now is cropping up on America's southern border so\nThat folks know I'm pretty libertarian when it comes to immigration I'm somebody who believes that there should be free movement of labor not citizenship you shouldn't be able to come in the United states and I'm a citizen and vote and shouldn't be able to get taxpayer dollars but if you want to come here at work I really don't have a huge problem with it but\nEven I libertarian on immigration believe that we ought to have actual bores in the United states meeting defensible board if you don't just get the crops are boring because you want to cross our borders a country without boring is not actually a country\nThis caravan issue with a serious issue does according to the Associated Press this morning a going around in a hundred migrants\nShrimp or southern Mexico on Sunday heading towards the United states after making an end run around Mexican agents briefly block them at the watermelon border they're working help at every turn for sympathetic Mexican whopper food water and clothing hundreds of locals driving pickup dancing cargo truck stop them to let them clamber aboard Bessie Shockley Lopez\nOn during the city of San Pedro Sula heritage stuck polar bear in the winter cap that seem to add a place in the tropical heat it's the only way for two daughters four year old Victoria and three year old Elizabeth ... beside her women with sweat\nBut then I have sympathy for folks want to escape crappy places to come for a better life that doesn't mean the United states had an obligation to take an anyone who wants to get in without any sort of vetting procedures or determination is whether this person is going to help the country or not\nOr out of out of some sort of a sympathy for the folks crossing the border you cannot have a country that is the strongest economy on planet earth taking in thousands and thousands of people illegally without betting that without any sort of skill set that does not make for good economy this is one of the reasons why it's so funny both on the way they love Norway they looked at market lost weight and\nImmigration restriction that have been winning in Norway Denmark and in Sweden\nYou cannot actually have it on social estate in terms of redistribution of wealth when you have an underclass that it's coming that does not have a skill set\nAnd one of one of the things about about those ... in the northern country and Scandinavian country is that they basically banned immigration\nWell the United states the left in the United states wants it both ways they want on open immigration at the same time that they want to raise social spending like never before seen in human history that is not a recipe for victory\nAnd that's why President Trump the Republicans are going to win on his even Lindsey Graham was a real dumb on immigration right Lindsey Graham famously\nOf the gang of eight along with John McCain a big fan of immigration form even he said listen this is not something we can do Nancy Pelosi would welcome these tournaments I don't know what happened to Lindsey Graham whether we bumped his head or something but Lindsey Graham you point out the reach that is really good and here's Lindsey Graham senator from South Carolina Nancy Pelosi will welcome these Caribbean\nYou want to be the country of people that run you up and down the hall and spit on you\nOr do you want to be a country of a of of of Republicans who can actually deliver for working families out there that will put good judges on the court that will stand up to the enemies of this country Nancy Pelosi will welcome the caravan fear a Donald Trump and the rest of us will stop\nOkay well that that is exactly right and that's not out of lack of sympathy because a country that has a rule of law must abide by that rule of law Democrat to continue to push the issue are going to lose it's funny because Democrats are so ensconced in their own bubble and what poll shows that Democrats have park you'll Republican friends than Republicans have Democrat print\nBecause Democrats live in areas\nActually she Republicans ... human beings and so they won't even talk to them they actually believe that it's mainstream view that people should be able to flood into the country\nActually believe that it's a mainstream view that gender insects are completely separate\nAnd not only that that if a man calls himself a woman that that man is than a woman the latest evidence of this is I mean there's an amazing story is the way the media are covering\nAn attempt by the department of education to to find what title nine actually set to hear the headline from the New York times today at the transgender could be defined out of existence under a Trump Administration\nNow when you read that headline what does that sound like you it\nSounds like the Trump Administration is saying they're no such thing as transgender people or people who suffer from\nGender just for your gender identity disorder that's what it would sound like from that had one is that what's actually happening no that's not what's actually happening because that that he ought it and nobody is saying there are people who are transgender what the Trump Administration is saying is that under the law laws that have to do with sex\nFrom the ministry ... saying is that under the law laws that have to do with sex discrimination or specifically focused on biological sex they're not focused on you thinking you were a member of a different sex so when the civil rights act was written\nAnd it included language about men and women and sex discrimination it did not mean that it affects discrimination for you to say that a man who shows up in a classroom a fifth grade classroom dressed as a woman and you say that's not cool we're\nNot going to do that that's not the same thing as saying a woman can't work in the classroom that's not sex discrimination and that's that's what the Trump Administration is saying they're saying that behavior by men is not the same as being female\nThat the actual what I'll read the actual article it doesn't it doesn't ban transgender people that's not what they're doing\nThe media is so dishonest with regard to how they cover transgender issues because there used to even acknowledge the fact that there is such thing as biological sex it's only self defeating what the what the ... the gender insects are exactly separate but gender is sex\nAnd so generous act I completely separate you can be a man but your gender is female and\nThat makes you a biological female that makes you an actual woman\nThis is how they want to read the law and make no sense under any circumstances I explain in just one second they think it's a winning issue I mean it's just it's insane it's insane\nBut first let's talk about your online security with all the recent news about online security breaches kinda tough

N. dot com slash then\nSo when President Trump rails at the fake news this is what he's talking about this sort of headline from the New York times transgender could be to find out of existence under a Trump Administration when we're just going to disappear the transgender now\nKnow that is not what they're doing here is what they're doing quote\nThe Trump Administration is considering narrowly defining gender as biological immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth the most drastic move yet in a government wide effort to roll back recognition and protections of transgender people under federal civil rights law\nWell because gender is biological and immutable and it is delivered at birth\nNot what the what is that if they've redefined the term one of the great ... areas of confusion in the ... is what the hell everyone's talking about really I mean that because sometimes when people in general what they mean is expressed feminine or masculine qualities and sometimes what they mean is actual sex\nAnd it is impossible to tell which unless they actually specify and then they shifted definition based on what they want their point to me that the what is really the one making the case it only to dinner they're saying that if you're a feminine and you're actually woman and if you're a masculine woman you're actually in that\nIf you wanted to find gender as ... express characteristics of femininity or masculinity there are seven point three billion genders on planet earth which means it's meaningless toward the means nothing if you want to say that gender has to do with biology\nNow you have to separate it into sex sex is based on y chromosome than X chromosome now they're intersects people and they're very very small percentage of the population that is not the argument being made by transgender advocates they're arguing that you can you bully genetically male and female\nAll of this technological sense it's completely confusing because it makes no sense there was no internal consistency are logic to the transgender civil rights movement they can't even find their terms\nIf they simply want to say people should be treated well I'm with you if they want to say that I have to pretend that a man who says he has a woman who won the Caitlyn Jenner is just as much of a woman if my wife gave me a freaking break and everyone would half a brain on planet earth knows that\nBut here is what the New York times says\nSeries of decisions by the Obama administration losing the legal concepts of gender in federal programs including an education and healthcare recognizing gender largely as an individual's choice and not determined by the sex assigned at birth personal sex assigned at birth the dumbest term in the world it was a gender assigned at birth at least now you're being consistent with the terminology\nBut even that sentence you can see the terminology shifting\nRight there's gender and then their sex assigned at birth\nYou don't assigned a sex at birth babies are born they are what they are when my girl was born she was a girl I did not find her girl\nYou know was signed her girl genetics God that\nWas sort of baked in you know I Know she's a girl my God people and the same thing with my son when he was born you know I knew he was a boy I looked at him\nWow this was difficult and it turns out he is in fact the boy amazing coincidence he comes out and he has all male characteristics and he's also a boy\nUnreal just amazing almost scientific ooh okay so here's what they say the policy prompted fights over bathrooms dormitory single sex programs and other arenas or gender was once seen as a simple concept\nConservatives especially evangelical Christians were incensed I Love the New York times and service especially evangelical Christians weren't sense this is a way of slandering religious people will make it\nIt's not people who actually use their brain and recognize that there are men and women and these are two separate categories\nAnd that maybe they're women's groups that want our main women's groups and not have men who believe that women in those groups and the same thing for men's group\nAnd the same thing for bathroom no it must be that there is those crazy people believe in the Jesus it's those people the people if it weren't for those crazies leaving the Jesus then it would then everything would be fine and we can all acknowledge the men and women are exactly the same except for a little bit of appendage him well\nHere's the New York times has now here's the bad stuff okay what's the bad thing with tremendous ration that\nNow the department of health and Human Services is spearheading an effort to establish a legal definition of sex\nUnder title mine the federal civil rights law that bans gender discrimination and education programs that will receive government financial assistance according to a memo obtained by the New York times\nThe department argues and it's a memo that the government agencies needed to adopt and explicit and uniform definition of gender is determined on a biological basis and it's clear grounded in science objective and administrative all\nThe agencies propose definition would define sex as he's a male or female on changeable and determined by the generals a person is born with according to a draft review by the time any dispute about one sex would have to be clarified using genetic testing\nHow in the world is that not just basic rationality if you clean your woman I should be able to objectively tell whether your woman or not it shouldn't be up and it shouldn't be up to you to decide\nAnd it's amazing to me that the same left that has now come around to Elizabeth Warren is not a Native American because not ... well she's actually isn't that American why isn't she Native Americans you should be why not just more Native American and Caitlin generous woman so what exactly is the problem here",

Seventeen Seventy six our phone number here on the ... that show I mentioned before that I think there is a secret\nReason why despite all the polls showing that Ted Cruz should have this election\nIn the bag in Texas I mean after all types that were heavily Republican state Ted Cruz's word very hard as a U.S senator has for six years and particularly his work with constituents in constituent groups and constituent services have been great\nHe should win this election he should win it big time so why was this debate last night featuring Ted Cruz and his Democratic opponent Beto O'Rourke\nAre considered to be so TV worthy and it's gotten coverage like no other candidates debate much closer races\nWhy because honestly I Do believe that the Democrats are excited about the idea of NATO running for president when he loses\nAnd\nWhy would that be to his advantage look there are reasons that the only times in the um last\nWhat is it last hundred and fifty years that a sitting US Senator has been elected president of the United states has been a rock Obama and John Kennedy\nAnd those were exceptional cases when you're in the Senate it's tough to find time to campaign and\nUh they don't work who's raised all this money I don't think he's going to spend all this money I don't think it's just an old thirty eight million dollars you'll use some of it first presidential campaign\nIs this a ridiculous idea well when you consider who beta would be running against him in Spartacus who lack Pamela Harris who is just low some I don't think crazy Mazie Hirono is planning to run but uh no Christian Jill a brand is\nJoe Biden I don't think Joe's going to run but I is is ... do have a better shot than some of the city sitting US Senators who are talking about running better shopping Michael ... who's running\nUm maybe I because he's pretty good I mean again for a Democrat I think his ideas are ridiculous but um he looks sincere\nAnd er he puts his thoughts well let me give you a sample from this debate now first of all I'm\nOne of the um uh one of the tricks that he performed and this will be cut number five was a President Trump is very popular in Texas and of course Senator Cruz been a big supporter of President Trump\nSo Beto in the debate went right to that issue listen\nCrews and not going to be honest with you have to make up positions and votes but I've never held or ... for the president called them wind and that's why the nickname so because it's for\nOkay so he's picking up lying ... to President Trump and um then a bait so I'm president as Senator Cruz is saying look and it's true if the Democrats win control\nOf the house and Senate ... it's\nMacron's win control of the house in the Senate ... it's going to be a complete just total warfare and investigation and impeachments and this and that all the time here was bad tells response\nNumber four\nReally interesting to hear you talk about a particle circus after six years and in the U.S Senate I'm listening um if you have this special relationship with President Trump um than than where is the result of that um we were all talk\nAnd no action um the tariffs that the president has loving the praying wars that he is entering this country into is hurting no state war than it's hurting Texas are farmers or ranchers are producers are manufacturers and exporters right here in San Antonio at the Toyota plant or a million I bought or tundra and met the folks\nWho made it yes we have problems with other countries around the world China dumping aluminum and steel manipulating their currency I Want to make sure that we stand up to China but whenever we ever gone to war including a trade war without any allies and that's exactly what the president was er cruises help\nWould have us do we've alienated the European Union they only native Canada and Mexico we've alienated all other potential partners and we're going it alone against China and it is not working just listening to the farmers and I know you haven't had the chance to to visit every county but I have and I've listened to them and they are hurting\nAny anxiety and the uncertainty of not knowing when these trade wars will end or the day of knowing that when those trade wars do when\nThose buyers and those other countries will find other people from home for bought from and they will no longer be coming to Texas\nTo buy what we grow what we raise what we export and when we what we manufacture\nOkay it all sounds good except it's a complete lie and we're not telling us alone one of the biggest achievements that President Trump already it pained was he did replace NAFTA he said he would he did we're not going it alone we have a trade deal and it's a better trade deal with Canada with Mexico thank you President Trump\nWe also have the better trade deal with South Korea remember at one point there was talk\nAbout that I'm Ted Cruz a\n... this is actually very sad uh the uh Ted Cruz was actually attacked in the debate because of his response to a good question and I actually was on his response was fine\nBut again the media that are trying to build up to eight or ... not just in the hopes that he might be able to actually become competitive in this election I don't think he will but because they want to promote him as a candidate for two thousand and twenty\nCandidates\nWho are on the on the ballot this time and then in some states they even have third party candidates I'm more than that how do you how do you keep any of that straight\nBecause they're very few places where there aren't multiple congressional races in other words I get a North Dakota are there's only one member of Congress Ken Kramer is the only member of the house\nAnd he's running for Senate but other places it's simply too confusing which is why well political reform is another issue coming up meanwhile I'll tell you one issue coming up is a really factor\nMichael from Connecticut wrote in relief factor helped to almost completely eliminate my elbow pain when I couldn't find any other solution that's a great product and it's helped with a lot of other aches and pains since I started really factor I feel like I've got more energy and I generally feel better common reaction most people find a real difference but they can feel\nWithin five or six days and after three weeks after the quake started just Nineteen Ninety five it's a dollar a day for Twenty one days\nAnd you get a dollar back after that dollar five cents a it's really factor dot com go to relieve factor dot com a

some restrictions apply the storefront detail with good well it's so easy to do good\n\n\nWelcome back as the bench Shapiro show so new battle has broken out not even really between right and left but within both right and left over the future direction of the American economy and it's across the political Baron is really quite interesting\nOn the one hand you have folks who say globalization and redistribution what do we do with the people who are left behind or working jobs that get eliminated\nNow the normal answer in the past was get up get a new skill we do that is why America bands from coast to coast and its relegated to the eastern seaboard\nBecause people legitimately gave up plots of land in New York and decided I'm going to go out to the middle of nowhere and across territory where people want to kill me and we go out in the middle of nowhere to set up a claim and then I'm going to work on that claimed by myself at risk of death\nIn or is that I can make something more myself my dad is the American ideal but that's what I was going by the wayside because we now believe that\nEverybody is entitled to things weren't entitlement culture and so what is broken down is to separate use of where the economy should go from here\nYour number one is globalization and redistribution free markets everywhere and if people are left behind than we have a a basic income universal basic income or we have a social welfare net a safety net and that's how we pick up for the folks get left behind\nAnd those people we just give them money basically the ... races everybody wanting theater and then everybody who is left behind a little bit we give them a little bit of extra money to make them feel better that they can live better that was my number one and\nA lot of folks in sort of the Trump camp said that's not right and the break him say that's not right they say instead we really needed a new model of how to thing and the model of how the thing is about jobs how do we provide jobs for people because jobs provide meaning that if you don't have a job you have less meaning\nSo what are we just restricted the free market itself what if we put barriers on the free market to orange credit orange cat\nHe doesn't really ... ... where we recommend tons of restrictions on the free market you talked about different ways that we can shape public policy in order to make the markets rare actually relieve regulations make it easier to generate jobs but President Trump has suggested restrictions on the free market he's ... he has suggested\nRestrictions on global trade for example and there's a real push by someone from in populist right to restore union power even though it is Americans voluntarily moving out of the union not companies breaking unions that has led to the dark union in the United states\nSo that model number two is you restrict the free market economy in order so that everybody has a job and that again is more of a left leaning version\nSo it's kind of fascinating 'cause you have liberals were for globalization and ... and redistribution of conservative or for globalization and redistribution\nYou have liberals who are poor workers\nAnd not free markets and you have conservatives who are for workers and not free market now the actual answer to this problem is look at what free markets to\nLook at what free markets too and if President Trump were really a free market minded guy that's what he would be saying right now he me ... all he would just pointed at his economy everything you know you're all worried about the logical development you're worried about automated cars and trucks and all the rest of it well guess what\nThere is no question that that capitalism has a process of creative destruction attached to it\nIt goes to show her the famous economist coined the term creative destruction that every time a new industry has created old industries are destroyed the car industry destroyed the horse and buggy industry we'll write when out of business are literally people whose job it was to make when we'll and they went out of business when cars came around\nBut guess what that created new jobs in the car industry and new jobs and making parts for those cards in other words certain jobs get destroyed so we can all live better lifestyle and people have to learn to adapt and ... and that's the history of humanity forget capitalism the history of humankind is adapting and adjusting the environment around you\nThis idea that we can't adapt and adjusted new technology seems to me completely wrong had\nAll the talk about how all the jobs are simply going to disappear thanks to technology and how we have to restore manufacturing jobs by\nRestricting the free market it's a big mistake the reason that we live the most prosperous like any human beings have ever lived in the history of time is because of the free market I think this debate is not only premature I think it's wrongheaded there's under four percent unemployment and you had states right now it's up ... percent unemployment there seven million unfilled jobs\nCan be heard recommending other people present was innocent music while he does members Mr ... body according to the according to the tape shocked me was not interrogated in fact he was beaten up drug and killed by Saturday operated flown in from Riyadh apparently he was dismembered while he was still alive so things are real well\nOver there all of us again is deeply deeply ugly of course that doesn't actually answered the question as to what President Trump should do however\nAnd this is where President Trump best claim is that he has basically just a real is trying to make deals as far as possible and while he appreciate the human rights violations or bad he's not going to stay up nights worrying about the Saudi Government\nCommitting human rights violations that we all know they've been committing for years on it I mean the same Saudi administration\nThat has been quite friendly with radical Muslims for decades on and the vast majority of the of the ... of the nine eleven hijackers were Saudi so if I shouldn't say the Saudi regime is not exactly a wonderful wonderful regime but that doesn't mean the United states doesn't have interests with regard to Saudi Arabia\nAs an example of President Trump saying the sort of thing where he had like he was asked about Helsinki or you remember he had that meaning in Helsinki was Latin reporting where he was very complimentary approved and it was not his mind our first Reagan who has a brand new show on Fox Business which is what we're watching she pressed President Trump on Helsinki here's what Trump had to say\nWith food and they want me to go off and have a boxing match with him on stage it was nice to have I was in a sense\nBut what happened is when I walked off the stage everyone said oh that was great we're on the plane all of a sudden the fake news channel from wasn't tough enough and let me see if I was too tough to say it was tough I could have\nA very good relationship with Russia having a good relationship with Russia would be a good thing not a bad thing\nOkay so there was never that read to him when he says that about Russia he said the same sort of thing that can jump right this is how Trump acts with regard to bad dictator she basically determines whether he needs them or not\nAnd then he tends to treat them nicely if you need them because this is how Trump is personally with all the people he deals with if any do he's very nice you if he doesn't need you and he calls your say\nThat's what President Trump does and some people are confused that President Trump isn't calling mom and been so kind of horse state that's because that's not how President Trump operates that does not mean however and what the left says about from ... relationship with Saudi Arabia is true so Ben Rhodes was just the worst Ben Rhodes the former national security adviser to President Trump\nHe's just awful he's just awful he was the guy who lives in the American people about the Iran deal\nHe was the leader of the Iranian regime outreach effort on the part of the Obama administration the actual outreach opportune evil dictatorship believe sponsor of hair on planet earth attacking President Trump suggesting trumpet somehow responsible for Saudi Arabia ... Saudi Arabia journalist everywhere\nAre less safe and and let's face it we have a president says he says are also the state so for a values like freedom of speech and dissent\nSo for a values like freedom of speech and defense\nSuddenly are very endangered around the world and and that's in front of mine that I think it's getting much worse uh into the vacuum of any advocacy for democratic values I think is putting people at risk and there's nobody else who's going to fill that vacuum if the president United States in the United states of America is not doing that\nOkay this is why Trump supporters are not going to resonate anything we are saying you have the media covered foreign ministry and it did outreach actual terrorists for years upon years upon years when Trump says listen I'm not going to go crazy over the Saudi think most Americans are basically going to say okay well\nAll right now is that the proper action not proper action is probably the sanctions at the very least an insistence on some sort of change in Saudi Arabia we do have leverage over the Saudis to pretend we do is look but\nYou know President Trump is much more of a foreign policy realist than some of his predecessors and as a foreign policy realist I think that it is not fully outside the bounds of propriety for\nHim to suggest that it's it's a little much to abandon the Saudis in the middle of an actual ongoing Middle Eastern crisis between\nSunni and Shia okay in just a second I Want to talk about the great battle of our time which is not Saudi Arabia versus Iran or even Republican versus Democrat it is President Trump versus Stormy Daniels we'll get to that in just one second but first let's talk about your\nOnline security with all the recent news about online security breach is pretty hard not to worry about where my data does\nMaking it online purchase or simply accessing your email could put your private information or risk you're being trapped on line by social media sites marketing companies are mobile Internet provider\nNot only can they recorded browsing history and sell it to other corporations who wants to profit from your information which is why I decided to take that my privacy using express VPN expressed VPN as easy to use apps that runs seamlessly in the background of my computer\nPhones and tablets turning on expressed became protection it only takes one quick expressed BP and secures and anonymous your Internet browsing encrypting data hiding republic IP address\nProtecting yourself with expressed began costs less than seven bucks a month for what are you waiting for its way to the number one VPN service high tech radar it comes to the three day money back guarantee there's no risk involved protect your online activity today find out how you can get three months for free expression VPN dot com slash men at the X.

says Michael it was reported today that the budget deficit exploded Seventeen percent year over year do mostly to the Trump tax cuts the Jews often preys on your show\nPerhaps you could comment on that instead of this ridiculous Elizabeth Warren side show very glad to comment on that uh let me just tell you that those people\nWho are saying that the reason for the budget increase the budget deficit increase is the tax cuts are partisan hacks it's not true how do I know it's not true\nBecause revenues year over year at the same time that the budget deficit went up revenues went up they didn't go down the increase in free slightly but ah my source for this is a not only government figures but the New York times and the Treasury Department the New York times\nThey um they report that as a matter of fact the treasury reported that federal revenues rose by is zero point four percent from the two thousand and Seventeen fiscal year to the two thousand Eighteen fiscal year\nAnd uh they view that a treasuries assigned the tax cuts are paying for themselves and the New York times takes issue with that because\nThey say well the growth in revenues would have been even greater without the tax cuts okay they might be right that the growth in revenue would have been greater but the growth in revenue is still growth in revenue we're taking in more money\nThe problem we have is we're spending too much and I actually think President Trump did a good thing and advising the cabinet that he expects every federal department to cut at least five percent and the knowledge that we should do more let's go\nTo on disagreeing today Christine in Seattle you're on the Michael method show\nFrom Michael I'm I Am calling today because I just like with your guest marijuana\nI Am a survivor a\nYear on year domestic violence and um I because of that developed ... and\nI go to therapy I've been in therapy for about three years and they recommended me to be on you know like pharmaceutical drug\nWas scared to do that and I didn't want to\nBecome reliance on it so with a combination of therapy and smoking marijuana I Am\nRecovering I'm I'm very happy for you and I'm Glad to hear it and marijuana is legal medical marijuana has been legal for a long time um but you said and you're right you didn't want to become dependent on some of the pharmaceutical drugs shouldn't you also be concerned about becoming dependent on marijuana\nYes I actually am a gun that is a concern of mine um however I\nProven to myself I'm a numerous times that like I'll go I'd gone through fans in the past ... years of no you and then I you occasional and then I can like turn it down\nApparently when I use I use it right before a therapy session\nApparently when I use I use it right before a therapy session I agree\nAnd and again and you're you're getting medical and psychological attention and and that's good and I hope everything should continue to be better for you and then the the basic position that I Would have on marijuana is simply that being dependent on anything\nIs not great uh I think people get very dependent on alcohol I was reading a they have a thing in the New York times they have a advice column called sugars and somebody was writing in and asking for advice\nAnd I was saying what should we do our children are are talking to my wife and myself children are nine and seven and I say hey mommy and daddy you drink too much\nAnd he said one of our kids said at the the other day when my wife was having a second bloody Marriott month at lunch\nOkay and of course in the answer to them they never said you know maybe you do drink too much I mean it's and it turns out that they have a family history of alcoholism they got to be careful but the ideas looked life life has all kinds of challenges\nAnd sometimes it does make sense whether it's with marijuana or with booze certainly was opioids or any other kind of prescription drugs anything\nDon't make things more difficult for yourself then is absolutely necessary let's go\nTo a Lauren in Houston you're on the Michael ... that shows disagreement day\nHi Michael I'm\nMy hearing today that we all think are the

all of a sudden announced okay okay uh we're canceling this arms deal with Saudi Arabia where they're buying a hundred billion dollars worth of our arms that we make here what what would happen do you think they would get their arms from somewhere else\nOr you're\nAbsolutely they would they would first probably get them from China or Russia\nAnd a ... again what have we accomplished ... I Do I Believe that Saudi Arabia's a problematic country I think it's a corrupt and brutal autocracy it's a very problematic country\nBut do I believe that it would help the United states to

hate each other and how to heal and it's already a best seller and it should be because of very important book but one of the points that you make again and again and again is politics didn't get us

mislead an have your audience and thing but it doesn't it truly does but what we're going through right now ... even in the chaos in our politics really didn't originate in our politics I think we need to know kind of where we are an economic and cultural history\nAnd we're going through a digital revolution which is awesome and lots of ways\nWe're going to produce more total goods and services than the world has ever known and all of human history a partly because of this isn't a revolution but one of the things that it does is it enables humans to think that we can be ruthless\nAt exactly the same time that we have lots of social science literature now confirming what people have\nKnown for millennia a through philosophy and theology which has been rooted makes you happy do you have a family or do you have a few deep friendships do you have meaningful work do you have shared vocation do you have some projects with co workers and your community the local were spent community if you have those things you tend to be happy that's about rooted in it\nAnd get our technology of letting us be ruthless and we haven't figured out the habits for this digital age this this ruthless age and so traditional tribes good tribes family friends workplace et cetera there and alarms and so we're trying to find meaning grand good and evil meaning in politics and it's not going to work\nSunday

topic\nAnd that's a Senator Ben Sasse senator from Nebraska his new book a them why we hate each other and how he'll\nLet let's talk for just a moment about the aftermath of the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation fight and thank goodness you were a very key part of winning that fight for a justice Kavanaugh and I'm sure he's going to be a big credit to the Supreme Court and do a terrific job\nBut what about this idea I Know your colleagues Senator Graham and some others have talked about not letting it go going after the leakers and the people who set up the ugliness that America saw going after Dianne Feinstein for instance I'd do you think that's productive\nUh I I don't know the right\nPath from here in the Judiciary Committee that it is broken as the committee on which when the and I said that they're loving loving Republicans and Democrats edited a terribly broke and circus right now\nUm it didn't serve anybody our kids or the cabinet family or the Ford family or a search for facts and truth it didn't serve anybody well because the Senate and the Judiciary Committee in particular decided they wanted to be swallowed by cable news television instant instant certain the on everything\nWe did a really really bad job of the United States Senate\nBut senator Feinstein's team did some really horrible despicable fangs\nAs I Do think we need to sort out how did we get to a place where these allegations were always treated in a circus like atmosphere as the first bite at the apple when I sat on the Judiciary Committee now for two years\nWe get lots of allegations all over the map about stuff that ends up being real solve it ends up being great from it ends up being clearly made up political yet\nAnd there's a way to deal with this with the FBI and in the Senate confidential process\nThat doesn't start with everything as cable reality t._v. screaming and there were people in our Judiciary Committee who decided that's what I wanted to start at the time that back to the theme of our half an hour I gather here I really do think there is a desperation for\nSome of our political addicts and Washington to try to act like blood sport politics\nOr forever more if what they want what\nThey don't really love their neighbor they don't really care about your listeners kids and grandkids because they're not trying to solve a long term problem they're trying to make politics and our other gladiatorial fight and that's not going to work in a republic\nYeah I mean somehow World Wrestling entertainment is not what you want for uplift of of your kids or for the American future a speaking speaking of which is one of the things that last night I I I gave a talk or to a neighborhood group we had a couple of hundred people there was great\nBut there's this general sense that our politics is broken and I found myself realizing as many as ... to you today talking a little bit of a would I be wrong to say that the Nebraska Legislature which is non partisan and you and a camera on there is only one house in the legislature\nThat things work a little bit better in your state than they do and many others\nThey do a ... there's less sense of preventing constantly for the camera and even though my state is you know one of the four or five most conservative states in the union and that's one of the reasons I as one of the most conservative or rather than the United states elected from here\nEven though we're a very conservative place probably two to one Republican and the legislature people do not officially caucus there aren't really parties and argue that camera all our one one house a state legislature\nAnd so what people are mostly doing is wrestling with long term pragmatic question how do you get a good infrastructure and highway and bridges bell that's cost effective\nUh there's less certainty that you're going to find the line between good and evil or for people who might have lightly different priorities of which ... which highway to find it so much healthier thing to the bridges and roads by politics\nInstead of trying to do a good and evil heaven and hell by project if if federal politics do what they should be an American constitutional system which can maintain a framework for ordered liberty affirming the idea that people are created with dignity the image of God and they have rights by nature and government is our shared project to secure those rights\nGovernment is the author sorts of right then government could do a small number of big things\nOr we need to build the fiber of strategy for the digital age et cetera but then most of what meaningful can happen back and communities where people actually live next door to their neighbors\nI we need governments that are sympathetic to the United states\nA general I'll see see is vastly preferable to the Muslim Brotherhood a government that that actually fell and made a mess of Egypt\nI I don't think that somehow there is a a danger here worse than Obama who dealt with other evil regimes like Iran or we will be right back on that Medvedev show a quick word from relief factor which is a natural way of dealing with the aches and pains of life\nIf you want to take care of yourself and you want to reduce the ... or some of the eggs and the arms legs feet neck back\nReally factor can help most people feel a real difference after taking it just a three little packages a day for the first five or six days and then after that if you go to the whole three weeks three weeks costs just Nineteen Ninety five less than a dollar a day if you

eliminates pain though to relieve factor dot com that is released factor die um we'll be right back on the issue of getting used to reality\nAnd reality in this case means President Trump will be

tax plan it's mostly just taking money from some people and giving money to other people and the people who are getting the money don't really pay much tax in the first place so\nTo continue with with terrorist attacks when she's offering as much as three thousand dollars a year for a single person or six thousand dollars a year for a married couple on top of the existing tax and transfer program dispersed either as a lump sum tax refund or as a monthly payment\nAs many as eighty million Americans would benefit so who is going to pay for all of this the answer is that they don't care\nThat really is the answer they tend to disappointing jobs the economy because if you give a bunch of money to people at the bottom end of the economic spectrum this is what creates economic growth that is not really never been true what jobs economic growth the creation of new products and services that create new jobs and it also allow people to buy cooler stop\nSocialism is about freezing the economy in place and redistributing all the pilots in the room\n... capitalism is that expanding the size of the pot now doesn't mean that everybody is going to get an equal distribution of the pie but it does mean that you're going to be able to generate new and better types of pie bigger pie everything that makes ... awesome\n... otherwise you can just read it and distribute it until there is no ... that's basically the socialist model so where are they going to pay for all of us I Love how the Atlantic describes ... proposal\nOf course the federal proposals were commenting never getting caught in some cases on the scale of the Trump tax cuts or the Affordable CARE Act\nThose are not the same thing from tax cuts are not things that costs money their meat paying less money into the federal government that is not a federal cost a federal costs you spending my money not and you're telling me I get to keep my own money\nAnd it's not a cost let someone keep their own money\nThe way that this measure didn't say suggested me a portable CARE Act which is a government expenditure based on tax receipts it's the same thing as cutting tax receipts by saying that people can keep throwing money is a slight of hand a festival sleight of hand\nThe brown legislation with costs one point four trillion dollars over a decade Harris legislation would come in at something like two hundred billion dollars per year which means to ... dollars over the course of a decade\nHarris has proposed repealing that Trump tax cuts paper mill that is not even come close to covering the kind of cautious talking about and they're talking about universal health care and they're talking about free child welfare and they are talking about ... or ... for childcare and they're talking about free college tuition none of this stuff is going to get paid for\nSo why why it has is they're all of us who just for this sort of stuff in a time when we have as an yesterday seven million unfilled jobs in the United states a four percent unemployment rate and historically booming economy why are we talking about undermining the pillars of capitalism because we have shifted our mindset in the United states\nAnd this is really what I Want to talk about today it shifted our mindset when it comes to\nWhat our wide should be like we believe we are guaranteed things here in the United states we believe that we are guaranteed a solid level of living because we live here you hear this from Bernie Sanders all the time in the richest country in the world but we really have people who do not have enough money to buy all the things that they could possibly all\nYou hear that from Bernie Sanders all the time the assumption there being you were born here you deserve stuff you were born here therefore America's rich therefore you get stuck in a baseline assumption you're entitled to things here is what you are entitled to in a free country you are entitled to adventure\nThat's what you're entitled to your born entitled to exercise your rights in pursuit of adventure you get to make up your own story here that the American dream American Dream is people who are coming from across the the place they did not know to an environment that we're not used to\nAnd building lives for their family and creating prosperity from the ground up\nAmerican stories people crossing the Appalachian into wilderness they did not know places that had not been that going to areas where they had no allies setting down roots and trying to build towns in civilization\nWell that's not that's not correct and again this is not coming out of a place of a lack of sympathy this is coming from a place where I sympathize with people's plight and the question is what can you make your life better\nDemocrats don't tell them what they want to talk about what can we do to make your life better\nAnd the answer is very little the real question is what can you do to make your life better because every successful ... person on planet earth is the person who at some point said to themselves what can I Do to help myself America is a country of people saying to themselves what can I Do to help my lot in life\nWhat can I Do to be more ambitious what can I Do to stretch my wings and fly\nAnd then we say okay well what can we do to provide that when what can we do to get all the obstacles out of your way what can we do to remove the barriers\nThat's the American way and it's not the American way if it wasn't you know ... comfortable to stretch a wing it may be difficult to leave home it may be hard to do that\nBut it so so we're just going to make sure you know you never happen\nWe're going to cuddle you we're going to make sure that your swab in the warm blanket of government benefits\nWe're going to ensure that you never have to get out there and fly again this is not coming from place to no sympathy this is coming from a place of you can't innovate your children you can't innovate your communities and you can't intervene your country on the basis of empathy alone\nAnd that is the best case interpretation of what exactly Democrats are doing here the worst case interpretation and something much more cynical purpose for innovation I'm an entire sector of the population specifically to gain votes and thereby political power\nAnd after you look at tells like Detroit it's hard to imagine that's not what's been going on there for decades because the failure of this sort\nOf of thinking is evident in major cities and\nCounties across the United states if you actually want to reinvigorate the American spirit we're going to have to teach people the same lesson the gods hot Abraham at the very beginning of the Bible I get up leave the home that you were born in and go to a place you do not know that's how we become bigger that's\nHow we become better that's how wives become better to have a world becomes better trade becomes better it's like you have cool stuff is white cultured become better because they experienced bounce off of other cultures\nThat this notion that we can hunker down now because we've reached paradise and all we have to do is hunker down and live and and redistribute what's in our backpacks\nThose back after going to run out ... there's not wait any of this war okay so in just a second I Want to talk about this fascinating article in the New York times about why scientists are are now attempting to avoid actual research out of Europe you All right\nBut first let's talk about how you go out at night you come home from work you need to get ready to go to a party you need to get ready to go out to dinner how are you getting ready a shower and wash the workday off the style in your hair brushing your teeth I'm asking

butter and razor any one of those got five bucks the best way to try out they're amazing product after your stars that\nProduct ship a regular price get yours today a dollar shave club dot com slash Ben that dollar shave club dot coms watchman\nBecause there's a fascinating article in the New York times I Want to talk about\nBecause it speaks to the lack of objectivity when it comes to the intersection with politics\nThe article from New York Times is titled why white supremacist are chugging milk and white geneticists are alarmed and here's what they say from any harm and\nNo one on the agenda of the annual meeting of the American society of human genetics being held in San Diego this week and the topic plaguing many of its members the recording appropriation of the field research in the name of white supremacy\nSticking your neck out on political issues is difficult to Jennifer Wagner a bioethicist and president of the group's social issues committee who sought to convene a panel on the racist misuse of genetic confound little fracking\nBut the specter of the fields ... past which include support for the American eugenics movement looms large for many geneticist in light of today's white identity politics\nThey also worry about how new tools that are allowing them to hone in on the genetic basis of hot button traced like intelligence will be misconstrued that racist ideology is an argument that I have on a pretty frequent basis with a friend of mine Jane costs and over a box\nOr Jane is black and and I think rightly has great sensitivity and everybody should have great sensitivity but I think they would suggest that her background contributes to the sense to me I'm with regard to the races past of the United states and the and the racist association\nBetween politics and bad science\nAnd so this has led to some serious conversations between the two of us about political correctness about whether in fact there's an appropriate time to talk about\nIQ for example or standardized testing for example or about the natural differences between men and women\nLike one can't talk about biology without being condemned sexist or racist he's a real issues that we have to discuss and take on head on unfortunately the scientific community has decided to quash a lot of actual science because they're afraid that people who are racist or going to take that science out of context and then use that to call them into submission minority group and that's basically what this New York times articles about\nHas in recent months some scientists have spotted distortions of their own academic papers and far right Internet forums others have fielded confused where he's about claims of white superiority wrapped in the jargon of human genetics misconceptions about how genes factor into America stock racial disparities has surfaced and the nation's increasingly heated arguments over school achievement gaps\nImmigration and policing instead of long discounted proxies like ... or ... friends and family pedigrees according to experts you track the far right\nToday's proponents and racial hierarchy are making their case by misinterpreting research on the human genome itself\nAnd debate that have been largely limited ivory tower forums scientist whose job is to mine human the humanities genetic variation or the collective good are grappling with how to respond if there's a real way to respond all of this\nPut out the science and then defend the science that's the way to respond all of us instead scientists afraid that there are scientists are going to be misappropriated misinterpreted or used for bad reasons\nThey've decided that they are going to simply squash\nAll of this discussion internally John of Emory University of Chicago evolutionary biologists studying human genetic diversity is easier in a society where diversity is clearly valued and celebrated right\nNow that it's very much on my mind once my doctor November his folded into his recent talks to pitch a group of white nationalist chugging milk at a two thousand Seventeen gathering to draw attention to a genetic trait known to be more common and white people than others the ability to digest lactose as adults\nAnd also showed that social media posts from an account and she called enter the milk zone with a map lifted from a scientific journal article on the traits evolutionary history\nIn most of the world the article explains the gene that allows for the digestion of lack of switches off after childhood with the arrival of the first cattle herders in Europe some five thousand years ago a chance mutation that left that turned on provided enough of nutritional lived up to nearly all of those who survived eventually carried it\nAnd then the post shows a snippet of hate speech urging individuals that African ancestry to leave America saying if you can't drink milk you have to go back well\nI mean so what they're idiots in one of the great ironies of of white supremacist instead of the stupidest people on the planet\nThey're constantly talking about white people are superior and they're just dumb houses it's one of the things that's so funny it's like if you're going to proclaim white superiority and you really shouldn't send your best is I'm In a commentary that accompany the paper in the journal genetics documentary warned that research is wrapped in numerous habits that are likely get lost in translation because\nPeople are flaunting DNA ancestry test indicating exclusively European heritage but the problem here is that we actually have to look at what science does have to say because it is they confounding factor when you look at it from eating racism to America so take for example racial disparities in education\nSo there's a lot of talk these days about affirmative action and whether people are performing at certain levels I was going to get them into college\nAnd the suggestion is that it is historic American racism that has led to that has led to the education gap in America's higher education system\nIn alternative would be that the test scores do not wind up equally among various ethnic groups\nAnd that is true not just with regard to black and white it's not very productive white and Asian white people score lower on the SATs and Asian people do as a general matter in the United states how much of that is genetic how much of that happens to be environmental we don't actually know the answer to that that's a hotly fraud question in science\nBut suggesting that racism is to blame for everything without looking at other confounding factors like for example test scores is a mistake and leads us to the wrong outcome and we just to the wrong measures to to deal with those outcomes\nGenetics is not the answer to all of these disparities but neither is racism\nNow these are questions you have to be very careful that because obviously don't want to give material to people who are suggesting that people some people are near inherently\nAre inherently worse or more evil or more violence or stupid or because of the color of their skin genetics doesn't line up that way but\nYou also have to look at questions of science because you've already scientist\nSo it is and it's fascinating to watch this debate play out in real time\nSo there there are doctors who have of organized meetings and social scientists and it's a social implication of the field newest tools David Nelson a Baylor College of medicine geneticist who's president of the human genetic society has it will not say completely quite on the issue is that there is no genetic evidence to support any racist ideology which", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show",
